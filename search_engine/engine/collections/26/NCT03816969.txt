      intubating laryngeal airway (Air-Q ILA blocker) in 2011. It has all the previously mentioned
      advantages, and in addition, a new, built-in, soft guide channel that accepts regular Nasal
      Gastric (NG) tubes to suction or optional Blocker Tubes for accessing the posterior pharynx
      and managing the esophagus. investigators can suction the pharynx or suction, vent and block
      the upper esophagus. Ever since the idea of SAD has launched and applying an optimum
      intra-cuff pressure that maintains enough sealing and at the same time not injurious to the
      oropharyngeal mucosa concerns anesthesiologists A good seal will provide good ventilation,
      will guarantee the desired depth of anesthesia at lower gas flows and with lesser leaks to
      the esophagus, it will not cause rise in intragastric pressure thus preventing regurgitation
      However When the cuff pressure is more than the mucosal perfusion pressure, it is likely to
      either cause postoperative pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, dysphonia) or
      cause local mucosal trauma and nerve injuries Therefore, in 2013 another improvised design of
      the Air-Q family has evolved, a Self-pressurized Air Q (air-Q SP) with blocker) . It has a
      drain tube through which a suction tube is passed like the Air-QILA blocker , And Instead of
      the pilot balloon and inflating cuff, the air-Q SP with blocker incorporates a
      self-regulating periglottic cuff at the end of this tube, a communication orifice at the
      junction of the peri-glottic cuff and the airway tube. This communication between two spaces
      enables the cuff to dynamically regulate intra-cuff pressure depending on airway pressure.
      This distinguishing feature of the air-Q SP may result in reduced risk for airway morbidities
      related to cuff hyperinflation. In this study investigators shall compare between the two
      types of air-Q 's; the Air-Q ILA blocker and the Air-Q SP with blocker , regarding good
      sealing and oropharyngeal leak pressure
