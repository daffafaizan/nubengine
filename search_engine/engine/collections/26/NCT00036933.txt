        -  Determine the safety of glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant
           QS21 in patients with prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the antibody response in patients treated with this vaccination therapy.

        -  Assess post-immunization changes in PSA levels and other objective parameters of disease
           (radionuclide bone scan) in patients treated with this vaccination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant QS21
      subcutaneously once weekly on weeks 0-2, 6, 14, and 26 in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients whose antibody titers against Globo-H or MUC-2 antigens fall below 1/40
      and who have no disease progression may receive a seventh vaccination after week 50.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until biochemical relapse or radiographic
      disease progression.
