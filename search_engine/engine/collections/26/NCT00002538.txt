      incompletely staged ovarian, primary fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. II.
      Assess the adverse effects associated with this technique.

      OUTLINE: Surgery. Laparoscopy with cytologic examination and lymph node sampling followed, if
      feasible, by surgical resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 50 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years. If more than
      4 evaluable patients cannot complete surgery, the study will be closed.
