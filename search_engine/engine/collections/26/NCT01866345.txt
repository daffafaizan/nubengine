      of orthodontic movement among patients requiring proclination or alignment of their
      mandibular anterior teeth with SFO (TEST group) as compared to conventional orthodontic
      treatment (CONTROL group). A null-hypothesis is that there will be no difference between both
      treatment groups in the occurrence of dental (root shortening) or periodontal (mucogingival
      defects, alveolar bone resorption) complications associated with orthodontic treatment.
