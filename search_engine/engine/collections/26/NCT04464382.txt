    
      Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen and one of the most
      frequent diagnoses that require urgent surgery worldwide.

      Many laparoscopic procedures are currently performed on an outpatient basis.Laparoscopic
      appendectomy, however, continues to require postoperative hospitalization averaging between 1
      and 2 days, at most institutions.

      At present ambulatory laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) are gained popularity due to the
      improved understanding of patient selection criteria, the application of enhanced recovery
      pathways, and the potential for improving healthcare resource utilization.

      There are few studies about to compare the morbidity and readmission rates between ambulatory
      and conventional LA.

      There is a lack of high-quality comparative studies making conclusive recommendations not
      possible at this time. Based on current data, ambulatory LA may be safe and feasible as
      compared with conventional LA.
