      course, and lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. It is often clinically silent with
      symptoms developing only in advanced disease. Surgical resection is the recommended curative
      intervention with only a minority of patients (10-20%) having potentially resectable tumors
      at time of diagnosis.

      Endoscopic palliative therapy in CCA entails the relief of obstructive jaundice through
      transpapillary or percutaneous insertion of plastic or metal biliary stents. Although biliary
      decompression provides relief of cholangitis and improvement in quality of life, it does not
      improve survival.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) in conjunction with biliary stenting may improve bile duct patency
      by local obliteration of malignant tissue through the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen
      species. Several studies suggest PDT plus biliary stent placement may prolong survival (range
      of 360-630 days), reduce cholangitis, and improve the quality of life of patients with
      advanced disease. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of PDT
      with biliary stenting compared to biliary stenting alone in the palliative treatment of
      unresectable CCA in China.
