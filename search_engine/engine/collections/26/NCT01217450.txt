      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose of AZD6244 in
      combination with cetuximab in advanced, refractory solid tumors.

      II. To assess for evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination, per tumor
      measurements using RECIST criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 and cetuximab when administered concomitantly.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of AZD6244 and cetuximab in
      patients with K-RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      secondary to treatment with AZD6244.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab and the
      relation to treatment side effects.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MEK inhibitor AZD6244.

      Patients receive oral MEK inhibitor AZD6244 once or twice daily on days 1-28 and cetuximab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and
      biomarker analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month or every 3 months
      for 1 year.
