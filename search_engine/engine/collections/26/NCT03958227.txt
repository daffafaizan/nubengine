      groups during 15 sessions. Manual therapy techniques will apply to the manual therapy group
      in addition to exercise practices. Patients will evaluate in terms of functional status,
      pain, range of motion, muscle strength and health-related quality before and after 5 weeks of
      treatment. Also, patient's satisfaction from treatment will evaluate at the 5th week of the
      treatment. DASH and ASES forms for functional status, VAS for pain, digital goniometer for
      range of motion, manual muscle test for muscle strength, SF-12 for health-related quality of
      life, and Global Rating of Change (GRC) Scale for patient satisfaction will be used as
      evaluation criteria.
