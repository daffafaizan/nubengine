    
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm pilot study designed to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab in
      patients with treatment-na√Øve resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining
      this intervention of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab, bevacizumab,
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma but they
      have been approved for other uses. Surgery is an accepted and standard treatment option for
      resectable hepatocellular carcinoma

      The study interventions (atezolizumab bevacizumab, and SBRT) are thought to increase the
      immune system's (the system in the body that fights against disease) response to cancer
      cells. These interventions may increase the immune system's response by helping the T cells
      (an immune cell that identifies and attacks infected cells) recognize and find cancer cells
      in the body. By increasing the system's response, it is believed the chances of recurrence of
      resectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be less than when only standard of care surgery is
      used.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they
      are benefitting from the study interventions and will be followed for 5 years or until
      participants withdraw their consent to be contacted.

      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study
