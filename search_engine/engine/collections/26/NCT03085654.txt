      sub-trait inventory of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). According to subjects' trait
      anxiety scores, they will be divided into high or low anxiety experimental groups.

      Next, experiments will investigate the acute effect (single dose) and chronic effect (3 doses
      or 5 doses) of oxytocin on brain functional connectivity during resting-state and brain
      activation in response to watching emotional stimuli using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Also the brain structure data (T1 and diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) of
      subjects will be collected. After finishing the scanning tasks, subjects will be required to
      rate the emotional valence, intensity and arousal of the pictures shown in the scanner.

      During the course of the study subjects will complete a number of questionnaires: Empathy
      Quotient (EQ), Cheek and Buss Shyness scale (CBSS),Interpersonal Reactivity Index
      (IRI),Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),Beck depression inventory (BDI), State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
      (LSAS),Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS),d2 attention test, and the Visual
      Analogue Scale for anxiety.
