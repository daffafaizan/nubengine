      Primary

        -  To assess tumor response to lenalidomide, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone
           in patients with symptomatic previously untreated low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the adverse event profile of this regimen.

        -  To evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and time
           to treatment failure associated with this regimen.

        -  To estimate tumor response to lenalidomide, rituximab, cyclophosphamide and
           dexamethasone in the subgroup of patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom's
           macroglobulinemia).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21, rituximab IV on day 1, oral
      cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1, 8, and 15, and oral dexamethasone once daily on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.
