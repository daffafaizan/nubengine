      cases per year. Rectal carcinoma represents 40% of colorectal cancers.

      Locally advanced rectal carcinoma raises the issue of both the oncological control, local and
      general, and the therapeutic morbidity. Currently, pre-operative radiochemotherapy associated
      with radical proctectomy (TME) is the standard treatment. Radiochemotherapy improves the
      local control but with enhanced postoperative morbidity and poor functional results.

      Moreover, some patients have no downstaging (around 1/3) and the metastatic risk remains
      about 30%.

      Then, compliance to adjuvant chemotherapy is generally poor after radical proctectomy.

      Tumor response to preoperative treatment is the major prognostic factor which reveals tumor
      aggressiveness. Nevertheless, at present, there are no predictive markers of tumor response.

      Progresses in rectal cancer management are related to sharing biological and clinical
      resources with scientific community.

      A clinical and biological collection will allow to :

        -  develop research programs on predictive markers to pre-operative radiochemotherapy or
           prognostics factors to disease recurrence

        -  optimize diagnostic and follow-up tests

        -  develop new biomarkers to improve patient's therapeutic management

      In this context, the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM) decided to initiate a biological
      collection biomedical research dedicated to the tissular and blood samples of patients with
      colorectal cancer.
