    
      The DISCO-RLS Trial is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether or not a fixed,
      low-dose therapy with ropinirole and/or gabapentin is safe and effective compared to either
      alone or placebo for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome in patients with End Stage Renal
      Disease receiving hemodialysis. DISCO-RLS will randomize a total of 80 participants.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 8 treatment sequences. Each sequence is composed of 4
      periods and in each period participants will receive 1 of 4 possible combinations of study
      medications (gabapentin+ropinirole, gabapentin+placebo ropinirole, ropinirole+placebo
      gabapentin, placebo gabapentin+placebo ropinirole). Eligible participants will complete a
      1-week Run-In period followed by 4 periods of 4 weeks each for a total of 16-week follow-up
      after randomization. A final study visit will be completed at the end of the 16 week
      follow-up.
