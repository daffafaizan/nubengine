      tests are at identifying swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      (ALS).

      As a participant one evaluation will be performed at the University of Florida Swallowing
      Systems Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville will take place. This will
      take approximately two-hours. During this evaluation an videofluoroscopy (X-ray of
      swallowing), cough tests, tongue function test and questionnaires will be completed.
