      pathways. VOCs can be transported to the alveoli through the blood circulation and expelled
      by exhalation. Changes in VOCs production, clearance, and alterations in lung air-blood
      exchange functions can lead to aberrant VOCs profiles in the exhaled breath. Testing exhaled
      breath has the advantages of being completely non-invasive and easy to collect, and has been
      considered as a perfect approach for disease diagnoses and therapeutic monitoring. Many
      clinical studies have found that VOCs in exhaled breath are closely related to disease
      status. Specific VOCs alterations have been identified in many tumors, especially lung
      cancer.

      In this study, we use a highly sensitive mass spectrometry to detect exhaled VOCs of lung
      cancer patients and healthy people. A lung cancer diagnosis model based on mass spectrometry
      data and support vector machine will be initially established and validated.
