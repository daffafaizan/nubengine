    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) supplementation starting in the second trimester (12-27 weeks gestation)
      and continuing until 12 months postpartum among HIV-infected Tanzanian pregnant women who are
      receiving HAART. Eligible individuals are randomized to receive a) a vitamin D3 regimen
      consisting 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 taken orally once daily starting in the second trimester
      and continuing until 12 months postpartum or b) a placebo regimen taken orally once daily
      starting in the second trimester and continuing until 12 months postpartum. Mothers will be
      followed at study visits during pregnancy and mother/infant pairs will attend study visits
      from birth until trial discharge at 12 months postpartum.
