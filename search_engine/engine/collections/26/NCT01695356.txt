      by symmetrical, irregular macules occurring in photo-exposed areas such as face. Treatment
      with sunscreens and depigmenting compounds such as hydroquinone, are still the gold standard
      in this condition.

      Visible light has pigmenting properties that could be interfering with the treatment in
      melasma patients. So, the primary objective of this study is to compare the depigmenting
      adjuvant effect of using a UV-visible blocking sunscreen against a UV sunscreen.

      Patients who are included in the study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      sunscreen type, which should use for 12 weeks. The sun blocking agents should be applied in
      the affected regions every 3 hours from 8AM to 5PM. The evaluation of clinical improvement
      will be done in a blinded modality by means of the MASI score, the Global Physician
      Assessment, as well as colorimetry and histological melanin content. Evaluations will be held
      on visits at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Skin biopsy will be taken at onset and at 12 weeks.

      At the end of the study, data will be compared concerning the former parameters. All side
      effects will be recorded and analysed.
