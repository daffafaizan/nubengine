      study lens, and to report the stability of ELP post-operatively. Additionally, correlations
      of ELP to predicted postoperative lens position, capsular bag metrics, preoperative biometry
      and age will be statistically analyzed for determination of ELP prediction via one, or a
      combination of preoperative variables.
