      surface area and treatment durations will be dictated by the Realief Therapy protocol
      according to their proprietary algorithm, which includes assessment of geographic areas
      involved and the degree of neuropathy experienced. For the trial, each patient will be given
      18 treatments of 30-minute duration, scheduled every three times weekly. The treatments will
      include laser exposure of any or all of 27 differentiated areas of the legs, feet, cervical
      spine region and lumbar spine region, for durations of 3 to 30 minutes, based on the symptom
      presentation at the time. Power densities will vary from 5 to 12 watts, based on the symptom
      presentations through the course of therapy.
