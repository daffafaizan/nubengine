    
      Induction Phase:

      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with active disease, will be treated with Dd-R as
      outlined below:

      All patients will also receive Levaquin 500 mg by mouth (PO) every day (QD) [or if allergic
      receive amoxicillin 250 mg PO twice a day (BID)], acyclovir 400 mg PO BID or Valacyclovir 500
      mg BID and aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily while receiving Dd-R. Aspirin will continue through
      maintenance. For patients who cannot tolerate aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or
      therapeutic doses of coumadin may be used in place of aspirin.

        -  Doxil速 30 mg/m^2 on day # 1 to be repeated every 28 days

        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days (days 1-4) every 28 days

        -  Revlimid速 25 mg PO daily on days 1-21, followed by 7 days of no therapy, repeated every
           28 days

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Patients who complete the induction regimen or those who complete at least 2 cycles of the
      induction regimen and not showing evidence of progressive disease but cannot tolerate any
      further chemotherapy could be started on maintenance therapy as follows:

        -  Revlimid速 15 mg or 25 mg* PO daily on days 1-21, followed by 7 days of no therapy,
           repeated every 28 days

      Patients will start maintenance therapy at the dexamethasone dose that was tolerated at the
      completion of the induction phase. *The starting Revlimid速 dose for maintenance will be
      either 15 mg or 25 mg, which will be determined based on whether specific criteria are met on
      scheduled Day 1.

        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days (days 1-4) every 28 days

      All participants will also receive aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily while receiving maintenance. For
      patients who cannot tolerate aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or therapeutic doses of
      coumadin may be used in place of aspirin.
