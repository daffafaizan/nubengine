      incidence rate differs greatly across geographic areas, we propose to examine the prevalence
      and level of viral and host immune response markers as well as the protein expression pattern
      of 57 subjects who subsequently developed ATL and 171 matched control subjects who
      participated in various prospective studies of carriers of human T-lymphotropic virus type I
      (HTLV-I). Informative markers to be studied include provirus load, HTLV-I antibody titer,
      anti-Tax protein, clonality of HTLV-I infected lymphocytes (viral markers), total
      immunoglobulin E (IgE), C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, soluble CD30, soluble
      interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2-R), EBV antibody profile (host immune markers), and proteomics.
      These markers were selected based on the measurability on the majority of specimens,
      availability of validated assays, relevance to the biology of T-cell malignancies, and has
      been used in a cross-sectional comparison of HTLV-I carriers and non-carriers from Japan and
      the Caribbean. We will utilize central laboratory and validated, standard assays for all
      specimens. The results, unlinked to personal identifiers, will be analyzed using generalized
      estimating equation. The findings will further our understanding of the etiology of ATL, and
      of differences in natural history of HTLV-I infection across geographic areas.

      While pursuing the same theme of trying to identify host and viral markers associated with
      ATL, the unique aspect of this proposal is to pool ATL cases, an extremely rare malignancy,
      from multiple epidemiologic studies through international collaboration, in order to achieve
      adequate statistical power and to perform valid comparison of tumor characteristics across
      geographic areas.
