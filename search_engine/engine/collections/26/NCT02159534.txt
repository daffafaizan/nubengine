      including cerebral palsy, sensory impairment and intellectual disability. Several early
      intervention approaches have been designed in the hope of optimising neurological development
      in this context. These programmes show high variety in the type of intervention, frequency of
      sessions and total duration of the intervention, as well as the duration of follow-up.
      Depending on studies, there is an inconstant benefit on cognitive and behavioural development
      in the first 2 years and preschool age. According to the most recent studies, it seems
      important that the intervention takes into account parental mental health, focuses on
      parent-child interactions and lasts sufficiently long.

      This prospective randomized-controlled clinical study has been designed to evaluate the
      effects of an additional parent-administed programme to the usual care in this developmental
      risk population,.

      The intervention is carried out at home by parents coached by physiotherapist from term-age
      to 6 months of corrected age. The monitoring and evaluation period for all infants
      participating in the study ends at 24 months of corrected age and includes clinical,
      neurodevelopmental, parental stress and neurophysiological assessments using high density
      electroencephalography and recording of event-related potentials at term age, 3, 6, 12 ,18
      and 24 months of corrected age (ActiveTwo, BioSemi).
