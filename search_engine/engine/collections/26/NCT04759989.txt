      to clearly improve outcomes in patients with septic shock. Although Surviving Sepsis Campaign
      guidelines recommend a weight-based approach to initial fluid resuscitation (i.e. 30ml/kg),1
      at present, there are no robust data to support whether dosing based on actual body weight or
      an alternative correction formula (ideal body weight, adjusted body weight) is superior.

      FRISSBE is a prospective, randomized, three-arm parallel-group pilot trial of alternative
      resuscitation strategies for obese patients with septic shock, looking at feasibility and
      safety of different weight-based approaches. Subject treatment assignment will not be
      blinded. Data will be collected and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. The study will
      enroll 126 subjects, with 42 subjects per treatment arm. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive one of three weight-based initial fluid resuscitation strategies - 30cc/kg ideal body
      weight (IBW), 30cc/kg adjusted body weight (AdjBW), or 30cc/kg actual body weight (ABW).
