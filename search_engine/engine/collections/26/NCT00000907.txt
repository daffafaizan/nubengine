      decrease where potent antiretroviral therapies are used. HAART (highly active antiretroviral
      therapy) seems to significantly reduce the incidence of MAC. This study tests the validity of
      those observations.

      Peripheral blood cultures and bone marrow (aspirate) samples from 50 eligible patients
      previously diagnosed with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (DMAC) are assessed for
      microbiologic sterilization of MAC at the time of study entry. If either bone marrow or blood
      cultures test positive for MAC, patients are discontinued from study. If cultures prove
      sterile, patients receive 6 weeks of treatment and then discontinue MAC therapy at Week 6
      (entry into Step 2 of study). They are then monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of MAC
      recurrence and for the presence of mycobacteria in blood cultures. In cases of increased
      viral load during study, modification of antiretroviral therapy is allowed at the discretion
      of the patient's provider.
