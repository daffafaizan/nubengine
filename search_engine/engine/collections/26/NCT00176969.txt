      these nerves to the topical medication capsaicin. Under normal circumstances topical
      capsaicin is known to target nerves in the peripheral nervous system causing short-term
      release of the neuropeptide Substance P (SP) as well as long-term transient depletion of SP.
      We expect the AA patients will respond abnormally to topical capsaicin treatment.
