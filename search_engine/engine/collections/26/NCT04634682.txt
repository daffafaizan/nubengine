      Myotonic Dystrophy type I (DM1) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy,
      affecting 1 in 8000 individuals. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with multisystemic
      involvement of multiple organs and tissues, mainly brain, heart, endocrine system, eyes and
      both smooth and skeletal muscles.

      Hypersomnolence is one of the most frequently reported symptoms in patients with DM1 and
      often lead to handicap such as cessation of employment and withdrawal from social activities.
      The present project is a 6 month randomized study to assess the effect of MYODM on fatigue,
      hypersomnia and quality of life in DM1 patients.The patients will be randomized to one of the
      two study arms. The active arm will receive the MYODM treatment and the control arm will not
      but both will follow the same evaluation program.

      Patients will come to the center every 3 months for evaluations.
