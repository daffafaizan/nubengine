      procedures will be screened for inclusion in the study.

      Within an 18-day screening period, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study and
      undergo percutaneous chest aspiration or percutaneous biopsy utilizing the ActiSightâ„¢ Needle
      Guidance system using CT to guide the needle. Subjects will be followed-up for at least one
      hour at the clinic for safety and preliminary accuracy evaluations. An erect chest radiograph
      will be performed within 90 minutes of observation after the chest aspiration to detect the
      majority of post procedure pneumothoraces. A follow-up visit will be conducted within 7-10
      days after the procedure day for safety evaluations.
