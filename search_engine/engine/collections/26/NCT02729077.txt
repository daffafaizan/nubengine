    
      324 subjects will be enrolled into one of two groups: increased or not increased risk for
      OSA, n=162 patients per group. Preoperative assessments of OSA status, Mallampati score (an
      assessment for mouth and throat morphology), STOP-BANG test (assessment for risk of OSA), and
      medical history will be used to determine patient group assignment. All subjects will receive
      standard general anesthesia and monitoring as a part of standard of care whether or not
      she/he will participate in the study, including ECG, arterial pressure, SpO2, BIS, Blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR), all of which will be continuously
      recorded and data will be saved for every three minutes during induction using standard
      monitors. Standard monitoring assessments in PACU will be used, and patients with increased
      perioperative risk for OSA will be closely monitored for hypoxemia and other complications.
      The Nellcor Pulse Oximetry Sensor will be applied in PACU and continuously monitor the
      patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory rate for the first 48 hours postoperatively. At
      the end of the 48 hours, the device will be removed, and the de-identified data will be
      transferred to a computer with analysis software and examined for patterns in respiratory
      distress in both patient groups. Data collected from the Nellcor Bedside Respiratory Patient
      Monitoring System on pulse and oxygen saturation, as well as data on clinically significant
      events, such as PRCs, acute respiratory failure, tracheal reintubation, hypoxemia, CHF, MI,
      A-fib, and delirium will be analyzed to understand the effects of OSA on postoperative
      recovery
