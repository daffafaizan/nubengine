      improve treatment for patients with spine metastases, more research is needed to determine if
      it is better than CRT. The first part of the randomized trial (phase II) looked at whether it
      was possible (feasible) to provide these treatments in cancer centres across Canada, by
      aiming to recruit 54 participants within 18 months. This part of the study was successfully
      completed in early 2017. The second component of this study, called a randomized phase III
      trial, is now underway. It involves recruiting another 124 participants to receive either CRT
      or SBRT, using the same study procedure as in the feasibility study. We will continue to
      obtain information about whether SBRT is better than CRT at controlling pain.
