      therapy for facial rejuvenation at the hospital of Xuzhou medical university. The therapy
      involves injection of patient's own adipose-derived stem cells, which are separated from
      vacuumed fat obtained through liposuction of abdomen, hip, thigh and so on. It was confirmed
      the adipose-derived stem cells can be induced differentiation into fat cells, osteoblasts,
      chondrocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells and so on under the corresponding condition in
      the current literature. The therapy has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial
      rejuvenation compared to more traditional techniquesï¼Œsuch as fat cells injection, sodium
      hyaluronate injection. Through the use of pre and post treatment photos, three-dimensional
      skin CT, in addition to the therapeutic evaluation, patient satisfaction questionnaire and a
      clinician assessment, it is our hope that the investigators will confirm the rejuvenating
      capabilities of adipose-derived stem cells therapy.
