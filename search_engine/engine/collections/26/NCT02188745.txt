      become resistant to all available anti-estrogens. Response rates to estrogens are similar to
      those of anti-estrogens in the metastatic setting. Given that ER+ breast cancers are often
      responsive to anti-estrogens and estrogens, alternating anti-estrogen/estrogen therapies may
      be more effective than continuous treatment with either type of agent. Anecdotal evidence
      indicates that such a strategy of alternating therapies is effective in some patients.
      Preclinical evidence suggests that anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancers are sensitized
      to the anti-tumor effects of estrogens. Such cells harbor subpopulations that can ultimately
      regain the ability to grow in the presence of estrogens, and revert to their
      anti-estrogen-sensitive state. The investigators will formally test whether alternating
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies is effective for the management of
      anti-estrogen-resistant metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, and to identify molecular
      biomarkers that predict tumor response to 1) 17B-estradiol and 2) alternating
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies. If successful, this study would present a novel
      strategy to manage metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer by pre-emptively switching therapies
      prior to disease progression.
