      cardiometabolic disease. However, compliance of the European population to general
      recommendations of exercise and weight loss is unsatisfactory. There have been no studies
      that have attempted to convert the exciting new experimental data on the circadian clock,
      lifestyle, and cardiometabolic risk into diagnostic tools or novel therapeutic approaches via
      structured multidisciplinary efforts. One of the aims of the EuRhytDia study is to study
      novel applications of established lifestyle interventions by co-ordinating the timing of
      interventions with circadian rhythmicity.
