      contraction on patellar lateral displacement and tilt in patients with patellofemoral pain
      syndrome. This discrepancy may be caused by lack of information regarding to classifications
      of patellofemoral alignment under quadriceps relaxed. We hypothesized quadriceps contraction
      has different effects on each type of patellofemoral malalignment.

      We expect to recruit 150 subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome to participate in this
      study. All patients underwent computed tomography imaging of symptomatic knees, with and
      without quadriceps muscle contraction in 0°, 15° and 30° of knee flexion. Patellar lateral
      condyle index and patellar tilt angles of Sasaki and modified Fulkerson were measured to
      investigate the effect of quadriceps contraction on patellar repositioning.
