      self-expanding covered metal stents. The long-term outcomes of patients treated with this new
      type of stent are as yet unknown. The differences between these stents is also unknown, as
      well as the ease of removal, efficacy, and/or placement. The intent of this study is not to
      determine which stent is better, but to merely evaluate the use of both. With this in mind,
      there will be no randomization of stent use, nor will there be restrictions on which stent
      may be used in which setting. This will be left to the judgment of the clinical placing the
      stent.
