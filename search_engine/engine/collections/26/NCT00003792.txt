      in patients with metastatic melanoma. II. Perform serial analysis of T cell and B cell
      function in these patients after this treatment. III. Determine objective response and
      response duration in these patients after this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1-6, then undergo
      leukapheresis for 2-3 days, beginning on day 6. Mononuclear cells are selected for CD34+
      cells in the laboratory, made into dendritic cells, and then pulsed with MART-1, gp100,
      tyrosinase, MAGE-3 peptides and flu matrix. These antigen pulsed dendritic cells (ApDCs) are
      used for vaccinations. Prior to vaccination, ApDCs are mixed with MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase,
      MAGE-3, and flu matrix. Patients receive this dendritic cell vaccine mixture SQ every 2 weeks
      for 4 priming doses. Patients receive 4 boost vaccinations SQ at 2 months, 5 months, 9
      months, and 15 months following the last priming vaccination. Patients are followed monthly
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
