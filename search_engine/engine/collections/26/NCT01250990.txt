      ability of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to transport cholesterol to the liver to be
      eliminated. This process is called Reverse Cholesterol transport and is one of the main
      mechanisms by which HDL protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The
      availability of a method to assess RCT is important for the development of new drugs which
      affect RCT and may result in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.

      This study will evaluate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol administered
      intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse cholesterol transport
      (RCT) in humans before and after treatment by niacin by analyzing changes in the tracer
      activity in total plasma and lipoproteins. The study population is healthy volunteers.
