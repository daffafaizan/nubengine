      low back. The pain prolonged and varies from mild to severe, and the effect of the clinical
      treatment is poor which has become a serious social problem. Recent studies have put forward
      a new point of "bone Immunology", which suggests that immune system, especially CD4+ T cell
      system, are involved in the regulation of bone formation, bone resorption and bone
      remodeling. So, in this study, the investigators will observe the therapeutic effect of
      thymosin alpha 1 on osteoporotic pain in elderly by observing the improvement of VAS score
      before and after the treatment, as well as the changes of proportion of peripheral blood CD4+
      T lymphocyte subsets, bone mineral density, serum bone biochemical index, neuropeptides,
      RANKL and other cytokines levels will be evaluated. The clinical safety of thymosin alpha 1
      in elderly patients with osteoporotic pain will also be observed.
