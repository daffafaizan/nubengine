      inheritance, characterized by systemic damage to the exocrine glands, mainly the
      bronchopulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. CF is usually characterized by a severe course
      and poor prognosis. The severity of the disease and the life expectancy of the patient with
      CF is determined primarily by the state of the bronchopulmonary system; more than 90% of
      patients die from lung diseases.

      CF Pulmonary damage develops as a result of a gene mutation - cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      regulator of ion conductivity Na and Cl (CFTR-cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator). The
      main function of CFTR is to regulate the transport of sodium and chlorine across the cell
      membrane and is part of the cAMP-dependent chlorine channel. CFTR-protein dysfunction in the
      bronchial tree epithelial cells leads to a blockage of the chlorine ions transport and an
      increase in the sodium ions absorption, and impaired fluid secretion through the epithelial
      cells apical membrane.

      Dornase alpha, a human recombinant deoxyribonuclease 1 (rhDNase, rhDNase) hydrolyzes
      extracellular DNA (viscous polyanion) that enters the sputum from destroyed neutrophils,
      thereby reducing the adhesion and viscosity of sputum. In CF patients dornase alpha is used
      as symptomatic therapy in combination with standard therapy in patients with a forced vital
      capacity (FVC) index of at least 40% of the proper value.
