      study procedure: ovaries were stimulated with standard protocol (long GnRH Agonist) or
      gonadotrophic releasing hormone (GnRH Antagonist, when at least 3 follicles achieved 18 mm
      diameter, Human chorionic gonadotrophic (hCG) (10000 IU) was administered for ovulation
      triggering, transvaginal oocyte retrieval was performed at 36-38 hours after injection of hCG
      . the oocytes were fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) method. the
      thickness of endometrium was evaluated on the day of oocyte retrieval and syringe which
      containing (300 mcg/1 ml) GCSF (neupogen) was infused slowly in the uterine cavity and after
      5 days (before embryo transfer) endometrial thickness was evaluated again. all patients
