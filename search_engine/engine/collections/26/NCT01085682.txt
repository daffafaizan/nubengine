      physical inactivity in Korea. Many studies reported that lifestyle modification related in
      the primary prevention of diabetes in multiethnic populations. The aim of this study is to
      determine whether internet-based interventions in those at high risk may delay the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thereby reduce the incidence of cardiovascular
      diseases and strokes in Korean populations. In January 2008, participant recruitment began in
      Chung-ju city, a rural area in Korea. The subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or
      elevated fasting plasma glucose concentrations were selected from initial screening and then
      randomized to either a control or intensive lifestyle group to carry out intervention over 4
      years. The primary outcome of this study is the development of diabetes by ADA criteria. To
      confirm the onset of diabetes, all subjects have an OGTT at the interim 6-month and each
      annual visit. Also, systematic evaluation examination will be done at the same time. The
      proportion of subjects developing diabetes in each group and the factors relating the
      progression will be estimated using statistical analysis.
