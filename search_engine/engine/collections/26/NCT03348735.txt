    
      A multicentre, randomized, open-label comparative trial evaluating topical treatment options
      versus oral systemic treatment in adult patients suffering from localized neuropathic pain
      (LNP) syndromes. A wide variety of peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes will be included
      such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), post-surgical NP/post-traumatic NP/scar pain,
      post-amputation NP, post-radiation therapy NP, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1.
      In contrast to most (or even all) commercial clinical studies we will not limit the inclusion
      to one or two distinct neuropathic pain syndromes such as post-herpetic neuralgia (inclusion
      based on etiology of the neuropathic syndrome). In this pragmatic trial we will however
      include all patients suffering from a clinical neuropathic syndrome with distinct clinical
      features such as hyperalgesia/allodynia, presence of spontaneous positive sensory phenomena
      and lasting for more than 3 months without making any exclusion based on etiology. Initial
      pain intensity indicates the presence of either moderate or severe pain in these adult
      patients (NRS 4/10).
