    
      Experimental procedure:

      Serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT1), glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase
      (GPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and serum glutamate, aspartate and lactate
      levels of a total of 100 patients will be collected and divided in three different groups:

        -  A: BM group (n=50), patients affected by BM from lung, breast and melanoma, candidates
           to SRS

        -  B: Control group 1 (n=25), patients with the same primary controlled tumors without nor
           brain nor extracranial metastases

        -  C: Control group 2 (n=25), patients with benign intracranial lesions candidates to SRS
           treatment.

      In A) and C) serum GOT1, GPT and LDH levels and serum glutamate, aspartate, lactate levels
      will be evaluated before and after SRS treatment (at 3, 6 and 9 months follow-up).

      In B) serum biomarkers levels will be only collected at baseline.

      â€¢ Oncological and imaging data will be collected during follow-up in patients enrolled in the
      present studies. MRI imaging will be performed at definite timepoints (baseline and 3, 6 and
      9 months follow-up).

      Serum levels of markers will be analyzed in each group and results will be compared between
      them. Moreover, MRI changes and oncological relevant outcomes will be investigated.
