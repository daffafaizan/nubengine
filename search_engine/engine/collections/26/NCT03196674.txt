    
      In this intervention, comparative study, 30 individuals with stiff shoulder following
      fracture to the proximal humerus (4 weeks to 6 months following the injury) will be treated
      at the Gait and Motion Laboratory at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Each subject
      will undergo a 12-session treatment (2-3 times a week, 30 minutes per session). In each
      session, reflective markers will be placed on the upper or lower body of the patient. Ten
      fast infra-red cameras will detect the movement of the patient and provide real-time feedback
      when obtaining a correct movement pattern, as instructed by the therapist, pretrial. The
      motion capture system will provide visual and auditory feedback of success, via a large
      screen, located on the wall. This could be manipulated so that the feedback is provided for a
      slightly higher range than instructed by the therapist.

      The subjects will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive the
      non-manipulated feedback treatment for 6 sessions and then the manipulated feedback treatment
      for the remaining 6 sessions and vice versa for the second group. The shoulder passive and
      active range of motions, pain and activity levels will be tested 3 times: at baseline,
      following 6 and 12 sessions. A satisfactory questionnaire will be filled out by each patient
      twice, following 6 and 12 sessions.

      The study will test for no differences in the overall progress of the patients during the
      12-session rehabilitation period. The study will further test for differences in all outcome
      measures between the manipulated and non-manipulated treatment sessions.
