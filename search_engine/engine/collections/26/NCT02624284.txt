      randomized to one of three tDCS dosage groups (1mA, 2mA or sham) and will receive three 20
      minute sessions of the same dosage over the course of 1 week before completing a 7 day quit
      attempt. Eligible participants will complete an Intake Visit (week -1) for final eligibility
      determination, and complete baseline measures (if eligible). Participants will then be
      randomly assigned to one of the three dosage groups (1mA, 2mA or sham) and will attend three
      identical tDCS resist-smoking sessions (study days 1, 3, & 5) during which they will receive
      20 minutes of their assigned tDCS dosage and complete cognitive tasks and a resist smoking
      paradigm. During the resist smoking sessions, participants will receive a session of their
      assigned dosage of tDCS for 20 minutes while being exposed to in vivo smoking cues (their
      cigarette pack, cigarettes, an ashtray). Participants will not be informed of their dosage
      condition. During and after the tDCS session, participants will have the opportunity to smoke
      in the approved smoking lab. The investigators will measure time to first cigarette and
      subsequent ad libitum smoking during the resist smoking paradigm. Following Session 3
      participants will receive a 20 minute coaching session from a trained smoking cessation
      counselor to help them prepare for a 7-day quit attempt. During the 7-day quit attempt
      participants will be asked to attend 4 monitoring visits (study days 6, 8, 10 & 12) to
      confirm smoking status.
