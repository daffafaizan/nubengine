    
      Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer achieving CR or PR after chemotherapy
      and thoracic radiation therapy were randomly divided into observation group and prophylactic
      cranial irradiation (PCI) group to evaluate the effect of PCI on survival after radiation
      therapy for thoracic lesions. To preliminarily analyze the clinical characteristics of
      patients who would benefit from thoracic radiation therapy plus PCI. To explore the optimal
      treatment modality after chemotherapy + thoracic radiation therapy in patients with
      extensive-stage SCLC.
