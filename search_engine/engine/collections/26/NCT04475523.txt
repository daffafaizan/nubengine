    
      The plan is to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor
      malignancy (non-lymphoma) that is considered relapsed and/or refractory to prior therapy into
      specific dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of full doses of CI-8993,
      based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 28 days from the first full dose.
      Administration is every 2 weeks. To assure patient safety, each patient will receive an
      initial low dose of CI-8993 (step-dose) one week prior to their first full dose.

      A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all safety data and make cohort
      escalation/de-escalation decisions.
