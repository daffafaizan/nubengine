    
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study in subjects
      with GA secondary to dry AMD to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD),
      and immunogenicity of IVT injections of GEM103 to a single eye.

      The study is designed to identify the MTD for IVT administration of GEM103. Safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of GEM103 will be assessed based on the occurrence of DLTs.
      Three escalating dose cohorts are planned.

      Subjects will undergo clinical and ophthalmic assessments for inclusion eligibility into the
      study. Enrolled subjects will receive GEM103 and be followed for safety, PK, clinical, and
      biomarker evaluations.
