    
      Information from laboratory studies and retrospective studies of patients with this disease
      has shown that the addition of metformin (a commonly used medicine for treating diabetes) to
      chemotherapy and radiation can improve the rate at which the cancer responds to treatment.
      Metformin is used frequently in the treatment of patients with diabetes and other illness,
      but has not yet been used to treat patients with this type of cancer. In this research study,
      we want to see if using metformin during treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will
      increase the chance that the cancer will respond to treatment and not return.
