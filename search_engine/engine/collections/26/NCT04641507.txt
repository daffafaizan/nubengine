      world. Genetics and/or life style accelerate the kidney stone formation (Urolithiasis).
      Sometimes, it is stuck up in ureter especially distal ureter; hence called as lower ureteral
      stone (LUS) and causes intense flank pain beside urinary obstruction.

      The ureter contains α adrenergic receptors along its entire length with the highest
      concentration in the distal ureter.

      There has been a steep rise in minimally invasive procedures but medical expulsive therapy
      (MET) is still regarded as an established treatment option for the management of distal
      ureteric stones.

      Stone location, size, number, ureteric spasm, mucosal oedema or inflammation, and ureteric
      anatomy are the factors affecting passage of ureteric stones.

      Drugs that expel stones might act by relaxing ureteral smooth muscle through inhibition of
      calcium channel pumps or α-1 receptor blockade. Tamsulosin is one of the most commonly used
      α-blockers.

      Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEi) are a class of drugs that inhibit the breakdown of cAMP
      and cGMP, enhancing smooth muscle relaxation. Therefore, PDEi may be able to decrease
      ureteral spasm and facilitate stone passage. Tadalafil is a selective PDE5i and because of
      its smooth muscle relaxation property, tadalafil received the US Food and Drug Administration
      approval for lower urinary tract symptoms with benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile
      dysfunction.

      Monotherapy with tadalafil or tamsulosin similarly improved lower urinary tract symptoms had
      already been demonstrated .

      With demonstration of in vitro effects of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) as tadalafil
      on isolated human ureteral smooth muscle, interest in use of PDE5i as MET has increased.
