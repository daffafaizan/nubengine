      hemorrhage. This improvement, if present, may be due to improved basal CBF, improved
      autoregulatory function, or a mitigation of large arterial narrowing. The information gain
      from this study will help us to better understand the mechanism of action of statins. This
      knowledge may be useful in the design of future studies with statins and in the development
      of other therapies aimed at similar mechanisms.
