      and tracking system for use of reduced PTV margins during intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT), which will allow treatment of smaller volumes of normal tissue during
      radiation therapy. Such a reduction in the PTV margins and the exposure of healthy tissue
      during treatment may allow for several future improvements in prostate radiotherapy
      including:

        -  decreased acute and chronic adverse effects with similar local tumor control

        -  dose escalation to achieve higher cure rates with similar adverse effects to standard
           dose treatment

        -  hypofractionation to shorten the time of, and lower the expense of, treatment without
           increased adverse effects.
