      (Accu-Chek Guide) and attach a blinded flash glucose sensor (Libre Freestyle) to the back of
      the arm. Subjects will complete any applicable baseline Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
      questionnaires and be sent home with no changes to their current therapy. While at home
      Subjects will be asked to test blood glucoses using the provided BGM and continue their usual
      insulin dosing before returning to clinic for Visit 2. Visit 2 will consist of randomization
      (Interventional Group or Control Group). The control group will be continued on their current
      pen needle and receive standard visit education as needed. The intervention group will be
      trained on the use of the DC App and be switched to BD Nano 2nd Gen pen needle. During weeks
      3 through 8, subjects in both groups will continue their usual insulin routine, with the
      control group adhering to their usual practice of managing their diabetes and the
      intervention group utilizing the DC app for relevant educational content and tips plus using
      the BD Nano 2nd Gen for all insulin injections. During Visit 3 subjects will get a 2nd fGM
      sensor placed and be instructed to continue their insulin routine for the final 2 weeks.
      Visit 4 is the last visit where subjects will have their fGM removed, return the BGM,
      complete applicable PRO surveys, an injection technique questionnaire and be discharged.
