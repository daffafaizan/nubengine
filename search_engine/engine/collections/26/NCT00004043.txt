      adenocarcinoma of the prostate with rising PSA levels. II. Assess the impact of this regimen
      on the slope of the PSA rise in these patients. III. Determine the qualitative and
      quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the impact of this
      regimen on the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients remain on a reduced calcium diet for the duration of the study. Twelve
      hours prior to treatment, patients begin drinking 4-6 glasses of extra fluid for 3 days.
      Patients receive oral calcitriol over 4 hours weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every
      4 weeks during treatment, and at the end of the study. Patients are followed for at least 1
      month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
