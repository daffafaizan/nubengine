    
      Paclitaxel is an active antitumor agent that has demonstrated a broad range of activity in
      preclinical and clinical studies. The optimal dose and schedule has not yet been determined
      in either adults or children. The objective of this trial is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and the toxicities of paclitaxel given as a short hour infusion in children
      with refractory malignancy. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel given in this way
      will be studied and both model-dependent and model-independent parameters will be determined.
