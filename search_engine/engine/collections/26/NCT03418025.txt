      I. Determine the feasibility and acceptability of offering the Exercising Together program to
      couples during the time when men are undergoing an 8 week radiation treatment regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the efficacy of partnered strength training on objective physical function,
      self-report function, symptoms and intimacy in both the patient and his spouse.

      OUTLINE:

      All participants complete questionnaires about their health status, physical activity habits
      and relationship with their spouse/partner and undergo four physical tests at baseline and at
      the end of the 5-8 week radiation treatment. The questionnaires are then completed one final
      time 8 weeks following the completion of radiation treatment.

      EXERCISING TOGETHER PROGRAM: Participants complete three exercise sessions (approximately 1
      hour per session) per week over 5-8 weeks during radiation treatment. Participants also
      receive a digital video disc (DVD) of a partnered strength training exercise program to
      continue on their own after radiation is completed.

      After completion of the supervised exercise program, participants are followed up at 8 weeks.
