      consent form. During the screening visit, pre-study parameters will be measured in order to
      assess the subjects' eligibility to participate.

      These include:

        1. Medical History

        2. Vital signs, Height and weight and BMI calculation

        3. Visual Parameters

        4. Blood draw for clinical chemistry and hematological safety

      Intervention Period:

      At baseline visual parameters and a serum sample for analysis of inflammatory markers will be
      taken. Supplements will be dispensed. Study visits will then be conducted every 3 months. At
      these visits, subjects will have visual parameters, adverse events, study diary, vitals, a
      questionnaire evaluating health/diet/exercise/alcohol, product distribution and compliance
      checked. A final serum/plasma sample will be taken at the final visit for re-assessment of
      safety parameters and inflammatory markers.

      Compliance check:

      The number of tablets dispensed at baseline and returned, as well as all intake information
      from a subject diary. Per protocol population is defined apriori as >80%.
