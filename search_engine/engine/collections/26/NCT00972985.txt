      (100 mg, p.o.), methylphenidate (20 mg, p.o.), and lorazepam (1 mg, p.o.) in 15 healthy male
      volunteers. The acute effect of the medications will be measured by MEG, EEG and simple
      cognition testing. Study procedures will be performed over 5 separate days. During an initial
      screening visit, Study Day 1, subjects will consent to enroll and undergo clinical evaluation
      sufficient to determine they are eligible to participate in the study. Upon qualification and
      enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or one of the active
      medications on Study Days 2 - 5. Medications or placebo will be administered orally. Subjects
      will arrive at the MEG center in the morning on Study Day 2 and baseline MEG and EEG scans
      will be performed along with baseline cognition testing. The medication or placebo will be
      administered immediately following the baseline scans and cognition testing. Additional MEG
      and EEG scans will be conducted 2, 4, and 6 hours after medication or placebo administration.
      On Study Days 3 - 5, subjects will undergo identical procedures but will be crossed over to
      receive the alternate medication or placebo.
