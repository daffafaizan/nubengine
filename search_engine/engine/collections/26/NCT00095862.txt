        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of vaccine therapy comprising an
           allogeneic (non-self) tumor cell line transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene
           combined with low-dose interferon alfa and low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with
           stage IV breast cancer or other solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate clinical response with immunological response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV once 2-3 days before each tumor
      vaccine. Patients then receive tumor vaccine comprising HER2/neu-positive allogeneic
      (non-self) breast cancer cells transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene intradermally
      (ID) on day 1. Patients also receive low-dose interferon alfa ID approximately 48 and 96
      hours after each tumor vaccine. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 vaccinations and then
      monthly for 3 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
