      Anxiety Coach smartphone app as an addition to traditional therapy for the treatment of
      anxiety disorders in youth, particularly those youth who may have limited access to mental
      health treatment in the traditional clinical setting. Therapist will provide CBT to patients
      with infrequent face-to-face contact and then will examine the acceptability, ease of use and
      need for contact.
