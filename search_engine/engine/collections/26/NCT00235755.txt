    
      This Phase 3 study is being conducted in Europe, Israel, Australia, and South Africa to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of retigabine dosed at 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day, in three
      equally divided doses, compared with placebo in patients with epilepsy who are receiving up
      to three established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The primary objective is to demonstrate a
      superior change in total partial seizure frequency for four weeks from baseline to the
      double-blind period. The proportion of responders (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in
      seizure frequency for four weeks from baseline to the double-blind period) will also be
      evaluated.
