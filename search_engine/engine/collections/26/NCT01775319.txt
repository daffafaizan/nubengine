      Zn absorption from biofortified wheat cultivar (60 ppm Zn) to regular wheat (28 ppm Zn) and
      to post harvest fortified wheat (60 ppm Zn) for a total of 3 test meals per study. The
      studies will be conducted with products based on wheat with high extraction rate (study part
      1) and medium extraction rate (study part 2) in two separate groups of women of childbearing
      age.

      The goal of study part 3 is to investigate the difference of absorption measurements between
      intrinsically and extrinsically labeled biofortified wheat. The label of the test meals will
      have the same nature as the fortificant itself (extrinsic vs intrinsic), for a total of 3
      test meals.
