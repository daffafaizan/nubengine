    
      Influence of the following procedures will be examined:

        -  Application of Atropin

        -  Application of Fentanyl

        -  Application of Mivacurium

        -  possible desaturation and / or bradycardia during intubation attempts

        -  restoration of arterial oxygen saturation and / or heart rate after succesful intubation

      We aim to examine the change of the following parameters by the use of electrical
      cardiometry:

        -  stroke volume

        -  cardiac output

      We compare two different premedication protocols and we evaluate the impact of these protocol
      on the time needed for intubation and on intubation difficulties .
