      I. To evaluate the tumor-specific mutation(s) detected using the CancerCode™ mutation panel
      as a predictor of pathologic response to chemoradiation for patients with rectal
      adenocarcinoma undergoing chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of utilizing biopsy specimens from locally advanced rectal
      adenocarcinoma to perform CancerCode™ mutation panel genetic testing.

      II. To assess disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated on
      study.

      III. To collect pilot data regarding the clonal heterogeneity of rectal adenocarcinoma, and
      the relationship of this heterogeneity with treatment response.

      IV. To evaluate the treatment response utilizing multiple fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) parameters including heterogeneity and textural features as an
      exploratory study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for analysis via sequencing.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
