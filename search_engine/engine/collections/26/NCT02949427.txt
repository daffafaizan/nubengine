      Research Hospital (SJCRH). Participants will be enrolled in the study according to their
      underlying primary diagnosis: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in patients undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      Patients will be asked to provide an oral wash and nasal swab sample at three time points
      during the course of their treatment at SJCRH. These samples will be used to characterize
      comprehensively the oronasal microbiota.

        -  Group 1 will include 30 patients with newly diagnosed AML. Within 72 hours of the start
           of chemotherapy, patients will provide an oral rinse and nasal swab sample. Participants
           will provide two subsequent oral rinse and nasal swab samples. The first (second total
           oral rinse and nasal swab sample) will be provided within 7 days of completion of
           "induction II" of therapy. The second (third total oral rinse and nasal swab sample)
           will be collected within 7 days of completion of therapy.

        -  Group 2 will include 30 allogeneic HSCT recipients. Prior to beginning their
           conditioning regimen, patients will provide an oral rinse and nasal swab sample.
           Participants will provide two subsequent oral rinse and nasal swab samples. The first
           (second total oral rinse and nasal swab sample) will be collected after completing their
           conditioning regimen on day +10 (plus or minus 7 days). The second (third total oral
           rinse and nasal swab sample) will be collected on day +30 (plus or minus 7 days).
