      transfer. The learning curves for the mastoidectomy procedure have not been intensively
      studied. The only study conducted on learning curves in mastoidectomy to date found a plateau
      in performance for 4 medical students after about 4 mastoidectomy procedures on separate
      occasions. The participants were however assessed using an unvalidated, unestablished
      simulator integrated overall performance score. There is therefore a need for establishing
      learning curves and plateau using established objective assessment scales, which could have
      implications for future studies and on a larger scale for the future organization of temporal
      bone dissection courses.

      The long-term effect on learning of deliberate repeat simulator training of the mastoidectomy
      procedure has not previously been studied. The role of cognitive load in learning complex
      surgical technical skills in simulation has not been studied in great detail. The
      relationship between time and progress/performance assessment using Final Product Analysis
      (FPA) has not been studied.

      We have previously suggested that a tutor-function with volumetric approach with green
      lighting of the procedural steps could have an effect on performance. The effect of the tutor
      function could however not be isolated.
