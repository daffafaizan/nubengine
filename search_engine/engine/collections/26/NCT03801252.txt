      Medical Center who meet enrollment criteria. Flyers will be distributed to providers to give
      to women who may be eligible for the study at prenatal visits, so that they may review the
      information prior to presenting for their induction of labor. Labor induction may be a
      scheduled procedure. However, many inductions occur in an unscheduled fashion due to medical
      or obstetric indications. Therefore, it is difficult to predict which women will ultimately
      require labor induction and at what gestational age they will require it, so it is not
      feasible to approach and consent all women during a clinic visit prior to labor induction.
      Distribution of flyers will allow patients to have information about the study prior to
      presenting for labor induction. Furthermore, unlike women in spontaneous labor, women being
      consented just prior to a labor induction are not vulnerable in the same way as one might
      consider a patient in labor, since they will not have the distraction and discomfort of
      uterine contractions that are presenting in laboring patients.
