      pulmonary nodules in children to obtain preliminary data for sample size determination for a
      larger multi-institutional trial. The primary objective of the multi-institutional trial will
      be to compare the accuracy of diagnostic CT alone to PET-CT in distinguishing benign from
      malignant nodules in children with solid malignancies. We are hopeful that PET-CT will allow
      us to better direct the clinical management of these patients and to reduce the number of
      invasive procedures performed to confirm the presence of benign disease.
