    
      Patients diagnosed with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer indicated by
      their treating physicians for first line endocrine-based palbociclib combination therapy and
      who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in this study. The key
      objectives of this study are to describe clinical, scientific and patient reported outcomes
      for patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer initiating treatment
      with first line endocrine-based palbociclib combination therapy in the real-world setting in
      Germany and Austria. Patient characteristics, real-world treatment patterns, treatment
      sequences and reasons for the physician's treatment decisions will be collected. Additional
      real-world research questions are to explore patient-focused parameters such as longitudinal
      follow-up data on patient-reported outcomes beyond disease progression and by treatment
      sequence or to analyze the time from the start of first line treatment to the first
      administered palliative chemotherapy. Clinical outcome by treatment sequences will be
      described. Routinely assessed biomarkers and diagnostic procedures applied for treatment
      sequence decisions will be collected.
