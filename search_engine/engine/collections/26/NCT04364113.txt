      determination of eligibility and a 3-month baseline period. The baseline period is used to
      instruct patients about study procedures; to assess GFR and dietary protein intake; and to
      control blood pressure according to standard medical practice. GFR, dietary protein, and
      urinary protein must meet the eligibility criteria at the end of the baseline period before
      an individual can be randomized.

      Two different strata or studies are used depending on the level of an individual's GFR at the
      end of the baseline period. Study A is for individuals with a GFR from 25 to 55 ml/min/1.73
      m^2 and a usual dietary protein intake of at least 0.90 g/kg/day, where kg are standard body
      weight. Study B is for persons with a baseline GFR from 13 to 24 ml/min/1.73 m^2 and no
      specification of protein intake.

      Individuals who are randomized in the trial are prescribed one of three diets and one of two
      target mean arterial blood pressure goals (MAP). MAP is a weighted average of the diastolic
      and systolic blood pressures (two-thirds diastolic plus one-third systolic). The goals depend
      on the person's age. The moderate goal of 107 mm Hg is equivalent to a blood pressure of
      140/90 mm Hg, the usual limits of normal blood pressure. The low-MAP goal of 92 mm Hg is a
      more strict level of control than usually achieved, equivalent to, for example, 125/75 mm Hg.
