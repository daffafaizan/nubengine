    
      ASLAN003-003 is a multi-center, Phase IIA study to determine the optimum dose of ASLAN003
      based on the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of varying doses of ASLAN003 (100 mg QD, 200
      mg QD, 100 mg BID, and possibly 200 mg BID) administered to AML subjects daily for a
      continuous 28-day treatment cycle until disease relapse, disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

      The study has 2 parts and plans to enroll a total of 44 to 56 patients with 18 to 24 patients
      in Part 1 and 26 to 32 patients in Part 2 (comprising Parts 2A and 2B). The Overall Complete
      Remission Rate will be evaluated in AML patients not eligible for standard treatment (Part 1)
      and in relapsed and refractory AML patients (Part 2A) using the optimum dose of ASLAN003
      established in Part 1 of the study. In Part 2B of the study, the appropriate dose of ASLAN003
      in combination with azacitidine in older (more than or equal to 60 years) AML patients who
      have exhausted any approved and available treatment options will be determined.
