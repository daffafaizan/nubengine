      to evaluate the effect of 12 months of treatment with dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD or
      dexlansoprazole 60 mg BID on the recurrence of IM in participants who have achieved complete
      eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM) and dysplasia (CED) with RFA. The study will
      enroll approximately 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg once a day and placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the
           study drug but has no active ingredient) once a day

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg twice a day.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice a day at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group trial will be conducted in North
      America. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 13 months. Participants will
      make 5 visits to the clinic, and will undergo a safety follow-up assessment 30 days after the
      last dose of study drug.
