      blood of persons living permanently above the altitude of 2,500m. The symptoms of this very
      incapacitating disease are : headaches, chronic asthenia, digestive troubles, sleep
      disturbances. The hemoglobin concentration is higher than 21 g/dl of blood. In addition,
      patients show a pulmonary hypertension of variable degree, as well as a systemic
      hypertension.

      This disease affects essentially males, but women are also concerned after menopause. The
      evolution of the disease is always very dramatic, towards a cardiac failure and cerebral
      vascular stroke. The prevalence is between 8% and 15% on the Andean Altiplano . No
      pharmacological treatment is available.

      A preliminary study was performed (Richalet et al. AJRCCM, 2005) that demonstrated the
      efficiency of acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) in reducing the hematocrit and
      the erythropoetin concentration,and increasing nocturnal oxygen saturation in patients
      suffering from CMS, after 3 weeks of treatment.

      We plan to perform a double-blinded placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficiency of a
      3-month treatment with daily 250 mg acetazolamide to reduce the hematocrit and hemoglobin
      concentrations and ameliorate the clinical symptoms of 55 patients suffering from CMS and
      living at high altitude (Cerro de Pasco, Peru).
