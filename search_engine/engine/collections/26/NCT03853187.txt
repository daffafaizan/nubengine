    
      This is an interventional study in 20 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer who
      will receive 2 courses of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in the neo-adjuvant setting, followed by
      surgery with curative intent.

      Experimental imaging procedures include 1) Zr-89-labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736) scan prior to
      neo-adjuvant treatment to determine accessibility and intra-tumoral distribution of
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 2) injection of ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled autologous CD8+
      T-cells 48 hours prior to surgery. The scan is scheduled on the day of surgery and after
      surgery, the resected tumor specimen with In-111-oxine labelled CD8+ T-cells in situ, is
      fixated for high-resolution ex vivo imaging on a preclinical U-SPECT scanner and quantitative
      histopathological analysis, next to standard histopathological evaluation.

      Total duration of the study is maximum 42 days (from injection therapeutic dose durvalumab
      (MEDI4736) to surgery).
