    
      Study-specific interventions will be the monitoring of intrapleural pressure using an
      electronic pleural manometer (Mirador Biomedical CompassTM Thoracentesis Assist Device) and
      thoracic ultrasonography. Both of these are considered non-invasive and low-risk to the study
      participants.

      As part of their standard usual clinical care, participants will undergo a diagnostic and/or
      therapeutic pleural intervention in the form of thoracocentesis or pleural aspiration;
      intercostal chest drain insertion; and/or talc pleurodesis. All of these procedures are
      invasive and associated with potential complications that participants will be informed about
      as part of standard informed consent procedures. These interventions will however be
      clinically indicated and carried out whether or not an individual chooses to participate in
      this study. For those individuals who do participate in the study, any complications of these
      standard clinical care procedures will be recorded as part of the data collection process for
      the study.
