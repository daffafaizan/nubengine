    
      Single center, prospective, randomized, intention-to-treat clinical trial. The study has been
      performed within a two tier EMS system of a major city. Prehospital emergency physicians are
      on scene in every patient enrolled to the study.

      Patients with acute respiratory failure (SaO2 < 90%, respiratory rate > 20/min) were enrolled
      to the study using envelopes for randomisation for either "conventional" (O2 + medication) or
      "NIV." Vital signs have been documented as well as venous blood gases have been taken every
      10 minutes after treatment has been started.

      Primary endpoints are 28-day mortality, hospital-, ICU- and respirator-days, SAPS, SOFA II
      and complications. Secondary endpoints are out-of-hospital incidence of invasive ventilation,
      effect on SpO2, CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure.
