    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover, multicenter
      trial in participants with CF and EPI. The study consists of a screening period (1 to 14
      days), a washout period (2 days), a dose titration/stabilization period (6 to 9 days), a
      blinded randomized treatment period (6 to 7 days), an open-label normalization period 1 (5 to
      14 days), a blinded crossover treatment period (6 to 7 days), followed by an open-label
      normalization period 2 (7 days). The order of treatments (placebo followed by EUR-1008
      [APT-1008] or EUR-1008 [APT-1008] followed by placebo) will be determined by randomization at
      the beginning of randomization treatment period only and will be carried through the
      crossover treatment period. The starting dose will be 1,000 lipase units per kilogram per
      meal (lipase units/kg/meal), which will be titrated to control symptoms of EPI, with the
      total dose not exceeding 10,000 lipase units/kg/day.
