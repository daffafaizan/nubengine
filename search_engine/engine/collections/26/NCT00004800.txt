    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 vaccines and a placebo vaccine in a
      3:3:3:1 ratio.

      One group receives diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT) vaccine containing filamentous
      hemagglutinin (FHA), Pt-9K/129G, and 69 kDA outer membrane protein (OMP).

      A second group receives DPT containing FHA and OMP. The third group receives DPT containing
      whole-cell pertussis. The control group receives diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccine. All
      vaccines are administered as an intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection at 6-12, 13-20,
      and 21-28 weeks of age. The first vaccine is given at week 12 if hepatitis B or other immune
      globulin was given at birth.

      All patients receive a DT booster at 11 months, and are followed every 4 weeks for
      approximately 20 months.
