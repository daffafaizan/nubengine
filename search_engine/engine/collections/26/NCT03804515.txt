    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose study of 14C-labeled poziotinib to determine
      routes of excretion and single-dose PK parameters for poziotinib in patients with solid
      tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutations or EGFR/HER2 overexpression/amplification.

      On Day 1, enrolled patients will be admitted to the inpatient unit and all predose
      assessments will be completed. Patients will be admitted to the inpatient unit for 9 days. On
      Day 2, a single capsule containing 12 mg of 14C-labeled poziotinib (approximately 90 to 110
      Î¼Ci) will be administered orally in the morning right after breakfast with at least 200 mL of
      water.

      Over the following 168 hours, urine and feces will be collected and pooled at specified
      intervals for measurement of total radioactivity recovered and subsequent determination of
      the routes of elimination of poziotinib and its metabolites. Blood samples will be taken at
      specified time points for 168 hours after dosing for estimation of single-dose poziotinib PK
      parameters.
