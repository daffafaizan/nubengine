    
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to
      assess the biological activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of PU-AD compared to placebo in
      ALS. It will be conducted in approximately 20 sites in the US. Approximately 30 subjects will
      be enrolled in this study; subjects will be randomized 3:2 to receive either PU-AD 30 mg or
      matching placebo qd, added onto any current stable background treatment. Subjects who meet
      all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in
      this study.

      The study consists of a Screening Period (including background treatment stabilization, if
      required) (4 weeks), Treatment Period (24 weeks) and a safety Follow up Visit (4 weeks [Â±1
      week] after the last dose of investigational medicinal product [IMP]). The expected study
      duration is up to 32 weeks.

      The Screening visit will take place within 4 weeks prior to dosing, to assess eligibility of
      subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomized and then return to the site for baseline
      assessments at Week 1. During the 24 week Treatment Period, subjects will be administered 30
      mg PU AD or matching placebo qd, orally, on an empty stomach (1 hour prior to food or 2 hours
      after), at about the same time each day.
