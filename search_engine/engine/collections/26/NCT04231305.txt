      medication peri-operatively for cutaneous surgery lacks evidence-based consensus. Therefore,
      patients who were referred to cutaneous surgery and needed full thickness or split skin
      grafting and using antitrombotic or non-antitrombotic therapies were observed. Data on
      patient characteristics, diagnosis, location of surgery and surgery performed, antithrombotic
      medication and complications in skin grafts were collected. Skin grafts were traced on a
      transparent film and areas of unhealed skin graft were marked
