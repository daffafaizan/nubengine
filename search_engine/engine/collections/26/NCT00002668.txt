        -  Evaluate the feasibility of implementing an outpatient education and behavioral skills
           training program for pain control in a multi-institution setting.

        -  Evaluate whether patient education and behavioral skills training improve cancer pain
           control in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast or prostate cancer.

        -  Amend the protocol, with the approval of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control,
           to a groupwide 3-arm study if analysis demonstrates feasibility and potential efficacy
           of the patient education and behavioral skills training program.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (breast
      vs prostate cancer), initial "pain worst" score (4-6 vs 7 or higher), and participating
      institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard pain management.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive educational intervention (booklets, audiotapes, and videotapes)
           and behavioral skills training (including a schedule of practice relaxation sessions) in
           addition to standard pain management. Patients receive a follow-up phone call within
           48-72 hours of intervention to review pain status.

      Patients on both arms undergo pain and psychological assessments on days 1 and 15.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
