      amino acid requirements. Over the years, we have changed our method to make our studies on
      amino acid requirements safer to use in specific vulnerable populations like babies or older
      adults. For example, we have shown that we only need to collect breath and urine samples
      instead of collecting blood.

      Another feature of our method is that we require subjects to consume personalized diets for 3
      days at a time, repeated for up to 7 times. These personalized diets are important as they
      allow us to study the amount of amino acids needed by the body. The body's metabolism changes
      with different intakes of amino acids. We measure this change in metabolism by collecting
      breath and urine samples on the 3rd day of each diet period. However, we do not know if this
      specific length of time for the personalized diets (i.e. 3 days) is sufficient or whether
      more time is needed for the body to adjust to the amount of amino acids provided. There is a
      possibility that 3 days is not enough time and our results (i.e. our estimates of amino acid
      needs) may be different if we allow more time.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the threonine requirement determined using IAAO
      in adult men changes if the length of time on the personalized diets increases from 3 days to
      5 and 9 days.
