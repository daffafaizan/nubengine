      patients with solid malignant tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of fenretinide and
      its metabolites. III. Determine the preliminary antitumor activity of fenretinide in this
      patient population. IV. Determine the recommended phase II starting dose of fenretinide. V.
      Determine whether fenretinide induces apoptosis in clinical specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral fenretinide once daily on
      days 1, 8 and 9 and three times a day on days 2-7. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment continues for up to 6
      months following complete remission. Accessible tumors are biopsied on day 8. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
