      I. Assess the activity of bevacizumab, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival rate and
      objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of bevacizumab in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of these
      patients.

      II. Determine the effects of prognostic factors, including performance status and
      histological grade.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
