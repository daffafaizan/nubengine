      oropharynx by potential respiratory pathogens in mechanically-ventilated (MV), intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients. Thus, improvements in oral hygiene in MV-ICU patients may prevent
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The Specific Aims of this investigation are: 1) to
      organize the necessary infrastructure to develop and perform a pilot clinical trial to
      evaluate alternative oral hygiene procedures to prevent VAP; 2) to use this organization to
      perform a pilot clinical trial to determine if the use of oral topical chlorhexidine
      gluconate (CHX) will prevent dental plaque, oropharyngeal colonization by respiratory
      pathogens, and VAP in MV-ICU patients. This pilot longitudinal, double blind intervention
      study will consider the appropriate frequency of delivery of CHX to improve oral hygiene in
      MV-ICU patients. Preliminary data from these pilot studies will also allow accurate sample
      size calculations to be made for a large-scale multi-center clinical trial; and 3) to perform
      molecular epidemiological studies to identify and genetically type bacteria cultured from
      lower airway secretions of MV-ICU patients with or without VAP and compare them to isolates
      of the same species from their dental plaque.

      This pilot study will enable this multidisciplinary team of investigators to organize the
      infrastructure, patient recruitment and methodologic protocols, and data management and
      analysis procedures necessary to perform a multi-center, controlled clinical trial to assess
      the efficacy and generalizability of this intervention to improve oral hygiene in MV-ICU and
      prevent VAP.
