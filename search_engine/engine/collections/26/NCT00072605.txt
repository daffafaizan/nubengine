    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of an Ebola DNA
      plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that the vaccine will be safe for human administration and
      elicit immune responses to Ebola. Primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the investigational vaccine and the secondary objective is to evaluate immune
      responses. Randomization assignment will be blinded to subjects, clinical investigators and
      laboratory investigators.
