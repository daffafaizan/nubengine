      sensation. Healthy male and female adults (ages 18-45) will be enrolled. We will use low
      frequency repetitive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to temporarily reduce
      activation in parts of the sensory cortex and will examine the effect of this procedure on
      perception of touch stimuli. After screening, participants will undergo three testing
      sessions. Session 1 will involve questionnaires and anatomical and functional MRI scans
      (non-invasive brain imaging) that will be used for localizing the correct regions to
      stimulate with the rTMS. Sessions 2 and 3 will involve active and control rTMS and testing of
      gentle (non-painful) touch sensation.
