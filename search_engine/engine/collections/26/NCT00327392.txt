      following pretreatment with an analgesic, fentanyl, in patients who are undergoing minor
      surgical procedures that require minimal-to-moderate sedation. All patients will be placed on
      supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and an electrocardiogram monitor, pulse oximeter, and
      blood pressure monitor will be attached prior to administration of fentanyl. Assessments will
      be made to evaluate the safety of AQUAVAN in patients undergoing minor surgical procedures.
