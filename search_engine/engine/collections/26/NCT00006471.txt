        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, median survival, and percent of 1-year
           survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
           and neck treated with fenretinide.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide every 12 hours on days 1-7. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response continue treatment for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
