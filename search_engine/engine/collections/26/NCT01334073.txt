    
      Phase I study of the combination of axitinib (AX) plus everolimus (EV) in patients with
      malignant advanced solid tumors.

        -  To determine the recommended dose for phase II study of the combination of AX + EV

        -  To determine the safety profile and predictive factors for toxicity, pharmacokinetics
           (PK), and efficacy in adult solid tumors.

        -  To assess functional vascular imaging (FVI) as surrogate marker of activity, biomarkers
           predictive of activity and preliminary efficacy data in metastatic RCC, untreated with
           antiangiogenics.

      Phase I, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized, sequential algorithm based dose-finding
      (3+3), clinical study in successive cohorts of patients.

      Patients will take both drugs orally, every day, without planned rest period (AX bid and EV
      once a day). By convention one cycle is 28 days. At the first cycle patients will take one
      week of AX single agent before starting EV. Patients will be treated at increasing dose
      levels (DLs) in successive cohorts of 3-6 patients according to the number of patients with
      dose limiting toxicities (DLT) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; i.e. the DL at which <=
      1/6 patient experiences a DLT during the first cycle). All decision concerning qualification
      for DLT, dose escalation, study termination, inclusion of additional patients, will be taken
      by a Trial Monitoring Committee..

      The MTD will not be higher than the recommended dose of each single agent. Six additional
      patients will be entered at the MTD to confirm the feasibility of the dose and preliminarily
      assess the efficacy of the combination in patients with RCC untreated with antiangiogenics.

      Three levels of dose will be explored.
