      to assess the effect of once daily bexagliflozin tablets on HbA1c in either treatment-naïve
      T2DM subjects or in subjects who were treated with one oral anti-diabetic agent. Treatment
      naïve subjects were eligible if their HbA1c values were between 7% and 8.5% at the screening
      visit while subjects who were treated with one oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) were eligible if
      their HbA1c value was between 6.5% and 8.5% at screening and underwent a 6 or 10 week washout
      period. In addition, all eligible subjects underwent a two week placebo run-in period and
      those who showed good compliance in taking study medication (i.e., missed no more than one
      dose during the run-in period) during this period and whose HbA1c values were between 7 and
      8.5% at the end of the run-in period were eligible for randomization.
