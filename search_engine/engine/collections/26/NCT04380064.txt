      Subjects undergoing ILM peeling during vitrectomy will have lower central macular thickness
      on OCT and lower rates of DME, fewer postoperative epiretinal membranes, and thereby better
      final visual acuity to control subjects Randomization: Subjects will be randomized according
      to a coin toss during PPV, once Grade 2 or Grade 3 vitreoretinal adhesion has been
      determined: heads undergo ILM peeling, while tails do not.

      Number of Subjects: With study power of 80%, a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of
      60 patients for each group was calculated.
