    
      The goal of this AD Pilot is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, phase IIa
      exploratory safety, feasibility and proof-of-concept trial in mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease patients with the orally bioavailable p75 neurotrophin receptor ligand LM11A-31-BHS
      dosed twice daily for 26 weeks. Successful completion of this trial will provide the safety,
      endpoint and statistical basis for the design and execution of a phase 2b/3 efficacy trial.
      It will also bring to the AD field a much-needed new set of target mechanisms and will help
      pioneer the strategy of the concomitant targeting of multiple fundamental AD-related
      pathological processes.

      During the 26 weeks study period the eligible patients will be invited to 5 visits.

      Safety monitoring will include the full extent of phase 2 clinical, electrophysiological and
      laboratory testing.
