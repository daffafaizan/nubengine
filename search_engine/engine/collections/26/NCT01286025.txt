      work in groups under the supervision of a tutor who guides their exploration of the material.
      As students progress through the curriculum there is an opportunity to advance the complexity
      of the material they are presented with. Video-based patient case studies have been shown to
      improve critical thinking ratios in paediatric medical student problem-based learning
      exercises, and time spent on data exploration, theory building and theory evaluation in
      postgraduate residency programs. We hypothesize that video provides a stimulus that improves
      cognitive processing and critical thinking among medical students, as compared to working
      from the text-based transcript of the same case.
