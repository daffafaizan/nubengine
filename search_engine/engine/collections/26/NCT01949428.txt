      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated with
      poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well as
      chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that HDMA
      leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in
      HDM-sensitised patients.

      The proposed observational study is designed to gather information on subjects with
      HDM-related rhinoconjunctivitis.
