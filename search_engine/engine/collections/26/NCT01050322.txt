      received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or metastatic setting . However, in countries where
      trastuzumab is not approved or is not available to patients due to reimbursement or other
      considerations, trastuzumab na√Øve patients are allowed considering the efficacy data of
      Lapatinib in this subset of patients.

      This trial uses a design to ensure a selection of one or more of the better treatment
      combination for additional clinical Approximately (165), who meet the criteria for efficacy
      analysis as defined, will be enrolled in the study in a single stage process. The sample size
      will be accrued in 16 months, with further follow-up for a 24 months study period from
      randomization or until progression.

      The study includes a Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment
      Follow-Up Period. Patients will continue to receive investigational products until disease
      progression or early discontinuation from investigational product for other reasons. Patients
      who discontinue investigational product(s) without disease progression will continue to be
      evaluated for efficacy until progression or until receiving the first subsequent anti-cancer
      therapy. Once progression is documented, all patients will be followed for survival at
      approximately 3-month intervals until death.
