      with HIV infection or at high risk for acquisition of HIV, and the number of cases in
      children is expected to increase over the next several years. AZT therapy may be effective in
      altering the course of the disease and decreasing the high mortality in these children. It is
      also possible that early intervention with AZT may prevent the establishment of HIV
      contracted before, during, or just after birth.

      The children entered in this study receive oral and IV AZT. The first 6 children receive 2 IV
      doses and 2 oral doses over a 2-week period, then 4 weeks of continuous oral dosing (4 doses
      per day). The remaining 12 children receive

      1 IV dose and 1 oral dose followed by 6 weeks of oral AZT (4 doses per day) and a second IV
      dose at the end of the study. Each child is under the care of a specialist in pediatrics and
      has a physical examination and laboratory tests before starting AZT and 6 times while taking
      AZT to make sure the drug is not having a toxic effect on the child. A single cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) sample is taken from the last 12 children entering the study, so that the level
      of the AZT reaching the brain can be measured. The child returns to the hospital or clinic 4
      weeks after the end of therapy to make sure that there are no delayed toxic effects.
