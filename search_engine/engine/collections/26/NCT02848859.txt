      coronary heart disease. Another 30 patients will be recruited from another institution.
      Patients will be screened with a modified version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a
      brief self-report instrument validated for identifying insomnia. The investigators will
      modify the ISI to include exclusionary criteria. The investigators will randomize
      participants to 6 weeks of access to web based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
      (wCBT-I) using an internet based CBT-I program plus education provided through access to the
      Harvard Sleep Education web site (which provides general sleep education information only)
      compared to 6 weeks of access to the Harvard Sleep Education web site, followed by access to
      the web-CBT program (a wait list control group). The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that use of wCBT-I improves sleep quality and sleep duration as measured by sleep diaries and
      the ISI. A secondary goal of the study is to assess the recruitment yields, retention and
      adherence rates.
