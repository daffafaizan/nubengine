      the maintenance of vitamin D levels achieved during the summer in Finland. The investigators
      randomized 37 subjects into groups of 17 and 18 subjects. The other group received 2 standard
      erythema doses (SED) nbUVB exposure every other week until week 24, and serum 25(OH)D levels
      were measured at the onset and at weeks 6, 14, 20, 26 and 30. The control group was not
      illuminated and serum samples were analyzed correspondingly. 6mm punch biopsies were taken at
      the onset and at week 14 for CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 enzyme expression level analyses.
