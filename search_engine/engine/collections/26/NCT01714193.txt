    
      This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same
      medication on the same days), to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie,
      how the body affects the drug) of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and
      levonorgestrel. The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label
      treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in
      the study for approximately 33 days.
