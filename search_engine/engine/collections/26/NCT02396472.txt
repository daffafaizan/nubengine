      information, emotional support and other resources. They are an important resource for
      patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Although participation in health-related
      ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression,
      anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress, many ISG members leave too soon to
      benefit. In a parallel study, we are using state-of-the art machine learning and automated
      language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions that keep people
      participating in these groups and that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health
      quality of life and how these interactions develop. The clinical trial described here uses
      these technologies and insights from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate
      interventions that improve the interactions in Internet health support groups.

      We will develop and pilot-test interventions to encourage effective communication processes
      identified in our empirical research. Participants from the American Cancer Society's Cancer
      Support Network will access this support group using either the default interface that orders
      content by disease diagnosis and date or with a new interface that sometimes highlights
      communication content and people who match their interests and needs. We will test whether
      mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following
      interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others;
      (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate
      participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with
      compatible peers. In a series of small, randomized experiments, we will examine how these
      interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement
      and satisfaction with their online interactions.
