      survivorship care plan improves satisfaction, knowledge and health-related quality of life
      compared to standard survivorship care plans among older adults who have completed curative
      chemotherapy for cancer. The investigator's hypothesis is that older adults who receive a
      geriatric assessment-enhanced survivorship care plan will report improved satisfaction with
      care, health-related quality of life, and knowledge and preparedness for survivorship care
      needs.
