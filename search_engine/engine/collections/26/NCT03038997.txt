      chemotherapy. Cells in the cardiovascular system have limited regenerative capability, making
      them susceptible to long term adverse effects from these chemotherapeutic agents. The ability
      to detect subclinical changes in cardiac function will allow clinicians to use proven
      treatments to prevent further progression in this vulnerable population. The current standard
      testing uses echocardiography, which is not as sensitive as cardiac MRI or serum biomarkers.
