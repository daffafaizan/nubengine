      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating
      effects.

      Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, a healthy diet rich in
      unsaturated fatty acids and low in calories should improve cognitive functions such as
      learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain functions
      in healthy elderly subjects (50-80 years old) during a short term diet.
