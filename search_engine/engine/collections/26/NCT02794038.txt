      Cellular Device in the hands of the intended (lay) users - untrained study participants who
      have consumed alcohol and use the Soberlink Cellular Device to measure their blood alcohol
      content (BAC) in comparison to a predicate device.

      The purpose of this document is to define how the human factors environment impacts the
      actual user interface design as well as how usability engineering evaluates user interface
      via usability objectives and usability tests. This accuracy and usability study will be
      performed on Soberlink Cellular Device in order to comply with FDA's Draft Guidance for
      Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, titled: Applying Human Factors and Usability
      Engineering to Optimize Medical Device Design, IEC 60601-1-6 (collateral standard for
      usability engineering of medical electrical equipment), and IEC 62366 (application of
      usability engineering to medical devices).
