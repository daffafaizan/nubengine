    
      This research study involves three aims (Aims 1, 2, and 3).

        -  Aim 1, Part 1, which focuses on finding the best format for the study intervention
           (called AYA-RISE); whether AYA-RISE is easy to use; and whether patients, family
           caregivers, and providers find AYA-RISE acceptable.The research study procedures
           include:

             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE,

             -  Participating in audio-recorded, 30-minute interviews

        -  Aim 1, Part 2, which is a pilot study of the study intervention (called AYA-RISE). In
           this pilot study, the investigators are looking at whether AYA-RISE is easy to use and
           what participants think of it.

           -- The activities involved in this part of the study are:

             -  Baseline Questionnaire

             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE

             -  Follow-up Questionnaire

             -  Brief feedback interviews on AYA-RISE

        -  In Aim 2, participants will be randomized trial into one of two groups;

             -  Group 1: Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit or

             -  Group 2 : Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit and Access to AYA-Rise

        -  Aim 3: Semi-Structured Interviews:

             -  Evaluate implementation outcomes using 28 semi-structured interviews with patients,
                family members, providers, and site principal investigators
