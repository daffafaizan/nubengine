      patterns (arcing, semicirculer, single loop, and double loop). Participants will use their
      own wheelchairs with their preferred stroke pattern for 20 minutes at a speed of 1 m / s on a
      motorized treadmill for a wheelchair propelling test. Wheelchair propelling videos will be
      recorded during the test. Shoulder kinematics will be analyzed using Kinovea motion analysis
      software and stoke pattern will be confirmed. Ultrasonographic assesment of participants'
      nondominant shoulder will be performed before and after testing procedure.
