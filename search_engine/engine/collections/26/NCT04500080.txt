      a structured, multicomponent, supervised and unsupervised exercise program.

      Secondary outcome will be evaluate the change in the health condition, in particular muscle
      strength, cognitive function, fatigue, balance, anxiety and depression level, and quality of
      life.

      The PE program will be conducted at the "Virgilio Camparada" Municipal Athletic Track in the
      city of Reggio Emilia (IT). Patients will be participate in a supervised exercise program
      with three sessions per week, for eight weeks. Subsequently, the intervention will continue
      further for four weeks maintaining one supervised session and two unsupervised sessions a
      week. Finally, sessions will be performed without supervision for further eight weeks. The
      overall duration of the intervention will be twenty weeks. In addition, an evaluation will be
      performed at one year from baseline to monitor long-term fall and fracture events.

      At baseline will be the following assessment:

      - clinical and anthropometric data and the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT) to determine the
      intensity of aerobic exercise.
