      the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Their legally
      responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to use it
      on the patients at the hospital. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied 3 times a
      week for 12 weeks. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at Week 12.
