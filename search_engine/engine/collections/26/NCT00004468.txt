    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a part placebo-controlled (arm I) study. Patients either apply
      topical petrolatum (Vaseline) with calcitriol (vitamin D3) on a psoriatic lesion daily and
      petrolatum only on an other similar lesion daily to serve as a control (arm I) or receive
      oral calcitriol nightly (arm II).

      Arm I patients continue treatment for at least 2 months. At the end of 2 months of topical
      treatment, one biopsy is taken of the lesion treated with calcitriol, one biopsy of the
      lesion treated with petrolatum alone, and one biopsy of skin unaffected by psoriasis. Lesions
      are also photographed prior to therapy, 2-4 weeks during therapy for the first two months,
      then once every 1-3 months, and then once at end of treatment.

      Arm II patients increase dosage of oral calcitriol every 2 weeks up to a maximum dosage daily
      in the absence of adverse effects (high urinary calcium or serum calcium levels). Patients
      continue treatment for at least 1 month. Lesions are photographed prior to therapy, 2-4 weeks
      during therapy, and then once at end of treatment.
