      day and maintaining cognitive and psychomotor performance.

      As such, it is recommended for long-haul drivers driving their vehicle. However, these
      drivers have no alternative but to sleep in their seats. These conditions are not optimal for
      producing quality sleep. The motorcyclist, for his part, has no chance of sleeping without
      finding a place to feel safe to give himself up to sleep. On these bases, SOMBOX has
      developed a mini-hotel allowing drivers to find an optimized place to take a nap.

      Investigators propose an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness, on simulator
      driving performance and on the results obtained during cognitive and motor testing, of a nap
      taken under three different conditions. The effect of the nap will be assessed by comparison
      to a rest awake.

      This study should include healthy volunteer participants.
