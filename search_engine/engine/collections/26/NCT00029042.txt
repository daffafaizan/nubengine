      been licensed for the treatment of adult patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      A double blind placebo controlled trial in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
      using a single dose fixed infusion regimen is currently ongoing. This dose finding study is
      designed to determine whether a clinically guided intravenous (iv) infusion regimen allowing
      for intra-patient dose escalation is superior in achieving a 70% clinical response to fixed
      dose administration of infliximab in children with a polyarticular course of JRA. We will
      model the pharmacokinetic profile in both phases of the study. We plan to enroll a maximum of
      48 patients to allow for 36 patients to be randomized into the two treatment arms. In the
      first phase of the study all patients will receive a fixed dose of 5mg/kg/dose for a total of
      3 infusions over 6 weeks (weeks 0, 2, 6). In the second phase at week 14, patients who have
      not achieved a 70% improvement will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either receive
      intra-patient dose escalation capped at 15mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks or continue to receive
      5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks in a blinded fashion. After 6 additional IV doses, patients will
      again be evaluated clinically, radiographically and serologically for clinical response.
      Patients who achieved a 70% response by week 14 will be kept on 5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks for
      the trial duration of 62 weeks, but will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. We
      also plan to evaluate patients endocrinologically and metabolically to determine the effect
      of TNF blockade on these systems.
