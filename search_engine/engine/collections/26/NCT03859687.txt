      PCV and hepatitis A vaccination. Those randomized to the treatment arm will receive 10,000 IU
      orally at the time of vaccination, while those randomized to the control arm will only
      receive vaccines. Vitamin levels and antibody responses towards the vaccines will be measured
      at screening, Day 0 (vaccination day) and Day +21. Children will be randomized using a
      stratified permuted block method.
