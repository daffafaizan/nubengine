    
      To measure the test performance characteristics of the CardioFluxTM Magnetocardiograph in the
      assessment of various patients' potential cardiac illnesses for refined diagnostic
      information versus screening for risk factors, as well as patients requiring monitoring of
      pre-existing cardiac illnesses to record in a patient registry maintained by Genetesis.

      All patients presenting to the Genetesis facility (5950 Mason Montgomery Rd, Suite 1400,
      Mason, OH 45040) meeting the inclusion criteria for performance of a magnetocardiograph scan
      for diagnosis, risk assessment, or treatment monitoring due to cardiac illness (as determined
      by the Investigators) may participate.

      The outcome measures will be NPV, PPV, sensitivity, specificity for CardioFlux
      magnetocardiograph against the patient's standard of care test results based on the
      indication for the scan (diagnosis, screening, or surveillance). Patients will be contacted
      at intervals over a 1 year period for follow up data for the patient registry, based on
      consideration of a patient's clinical disposition. The patient may choose whether or not to
      provide follow up data or to participate in another scan.
