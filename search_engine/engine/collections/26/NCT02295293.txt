    
      Rhus (Somagh) is found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, often growing in areas of
      marginal agricultural capacity. Rhus is used as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine
      because of its assumed analgesic, antidiarrhetic, antiseptic, anorexic and antihypergylcemic
      properties. The fruits of Rhus contain flavonols, phenolic acids, hydrolysable tannins,
      anthocyans and organic acids such as malice, citric and tartaric acids. Some studies have
      shown that polyphenols could have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer and
      could be regarded as bioactive compounds with a high potential health-promoting capacity.
      Phenolic compounds inhibit lipid peroxidation, scavenge the superoxide anion and hydroxyl
      radical, and enhance the activities of detoxifying enzymes.Moreover, the hypocholesterolemic
      action of dietary polyphenols has been reported. The hypocholesterolemic effect of Rhus fruit
      powder and its components have been reported previously in rabbits and mice.
