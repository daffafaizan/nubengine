      Approximately 85% of persons with MS report walking as a major limitation, whereas 65%
      experience cognitive dysfunction. Traditionally, walking and cognition have been viewed as
      unrelated, but there is evidence of cognitive-motor interference (CMI). CMI is believed to
      stem from damage to common neural tracts. Recent evidence supports cognitive-motor
      interference in persons with MS. For example, there is evidence that walking performance
      declines when performed in conjunction with a simultaneous cognitive task (i.e., dual task
      cost [DTC] of walking) and this decline in walking performance is greater in persons with MS
      compared to healthy controls. This elevated cognitive-motor interference during walking is
      mainly associated with walking performance in persons with MS although cognitive function
      does play a role. Cognitive-motor interference during mobility tasks is of practical and
      clinical importance because it has been linked to decreased community mobility and a greater
      risk of falls in other clinical populations. Despite the adverse consequences of elevated CMI
      there is ambiguity concerning prevention and rehabilitation strategies for cognitive-motor
      interference in individuals with MS.

      This study seeks to examine whether single and/or targeted dual task rehabilitation has a
      beneficial effect on CMI in individuals with MS. The results of this investigation will
      provide the foundation for future rehabilitation-based randomized control trials seeking to
      improve walking and cognitive function in persons with MS.
