      i) feasibility, ii) validity, and iii) preliminary efficacy of the three treatment components
      that will be further investigated in a subsequent larger trial. The present pilot study will
      employ the same design as will be used in the subsequent larger trial, namely the Multiphase
      Optimization Strategy (MOST). Specifically, in the subsequent larger trial, MOST will be used
      to evaluate the efficacy and change processes of three psychological treatment components
      selected from so-called "third wave" cognitive therapies (CTs), which have been shown to be
      efficacious in the treatment of pain after breast cancer.

      The overall hypothesis is that the selected third wave CT components will target key
      maintaining psychological factors in pain, thus leading to reductions in the primary outcomes
      of pain intensity and -interference. Specifically, we hypothesize that:

        1. Mindful attention practices will increase attentional control (i.e., the ability to
           intentionally focus and intentionally shift one's attention), thereby reducing pain
           hypervigilance, leading to reductions in pain intensity and -interference.

        2. Decentering practices will reduce fusion with thoughts (i.e., getting caught up in one's
           thoughts and acting automatically in response to thoughts), thereby reducing pain
           catastrophizing, leading to reductions in pain intensity and -interference.

        3. Values and committed action (i.e., behavior linked to values and goals) will increase
           acceptance of discomfort and reduce avoidant behavior, leading to reductions in pain
           intensity and -interference.
