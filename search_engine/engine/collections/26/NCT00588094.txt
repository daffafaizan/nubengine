    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if dose escalation of the rituximab-ICE (RICEesc)
      program can improve the overall response rate of patients with primary refractory or poor
      risk relapsed aggressive B cell lymphoma. R-ICEesc will be administered for 2 cycles with
      peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) collected after cycle 2.

      A two-stage design will be employed, such that the study will be terminated if in the first
      cohort of patients it appears that the overall response rate is <50% or if >25% patients fail
      to mobilize at least 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
