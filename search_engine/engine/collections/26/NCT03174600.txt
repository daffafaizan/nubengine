      urgency, urinary incontinence, and frequency of voiding, defined by the International
      Continence Society. Several disorders and conditions affecting the nervous system that
      controls the lower urinary system can result in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction
      (LUTD). Stroke is one of these conditions. The literature review reveals that there is
      insufficient data regarding the course of LUTD symptoms other than urinary incontinence in
      stroke patients, and their relation with functional and mental status. The aim of this
      prospective, multi-center study was to determine the frequency and course of post-stroke LUTD
      from early term up to a period of six months, and to investigate the relation of LUTD with
      functional and mental status and quality of life in stroke patients.

      This study was designed as a prospective study and included 70 stroke patients enrolled by
      the Neurogenic Bladder Study Group from five different centers across Turkey.

      The demographic (age, sex, education, marital status and occupation) and clinical
      characteristics (side of the stroke, cause of the stroke, stroke localization and
      anticholinergic medication use) of the patients were obtained from the patient files and
      through face-to-face interviews. In addition, patients were questioned on the post-stroke
      1st, 3rd, and 6th months in terms of bladder drainage methods (normal spontaneous urination,
      use of adjunct maneuvers such as crede, valsalva and tapping, presence of overflow, clean
      intermittent catheterization use, permanent catheter use) after stroke.

      The patients were questioned using the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS), and
      evaluated using the Brunnstrom motor staging (hand, upper and lower extremities), modified
      Barthel index, incontinence quality of life questionnaire (I-QOL), and the Mini-Mental Test
      (MMT) on the 1st, 3rd and 6th months.
