      including related and unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high risk AML
      patients and related allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation for standard risk
      AML patients in a multi-center setting. Furthermore it randomizes patients between
      intermediate-dose Cytarabine vs high-dose Cytarabine within the first postremission-course.
