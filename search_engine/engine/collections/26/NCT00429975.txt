      suggest that some antimicrobials may induce a differential release of cytokines, with the
      potential of either accelerating or down regulating cytokine production.

      The aim of our study was to compare the effects of ceftriaxone compared with levofloxacin on
      cytokine systemic concentrations in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.
