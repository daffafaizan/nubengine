      moderate to severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Baseline confirmation of study eligibility will be completed the day before or day of study
      drug administration.

      Study drug will be administered by intra-articular (IA) injection into the joint space of the
      knee.

      Up to 270 participants will be randomly enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups (90
      participants/ group). Treatment Groups:

        2. Low dose XT-150 (1 mL)

        3. High dose XT-150 (1 mL)

      The study will be conducted in 2 stages, A and B:

      A. Placebo-controlled for 6 months

      B. Continued follow up for 6 months with the option of receiving one of two doses of XT-150
      injection to the index knee.

      Final assessments will be 12 months after the first IA dose.
