      in maximum dimension no longer responding to conventional chemotherapy but able to tolerate
      further chemotherapy will be enrolled. The primary endpoint of this study will be the
      proportion of patients who experience CNS toxicity, with secondary endpoints progression-free
      survival, overall survival, steroid dosage, development of radionecrosis, quality of life,
      objective radiographic response and performance status.
