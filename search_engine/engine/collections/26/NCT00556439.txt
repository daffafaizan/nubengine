      the body's ability to carry oxygen to areas that need it. Symptoms of GCA include headaches,
      jaw pain, and blurred or double vision. Serious symptoms that occur less commonly are
      blindness and stroke. TAK symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, and
      non-specific aches and pains. There may also be tenderness near affected arteries.
      Researchers believe that GCA and TAK are diseases that are controlled by the body's immune
      system. Activated T-cells, specifically, are critical to the origin and development of these
      diseases. Abatacept is a medication that modulates the signal required for T-cell activation.
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK
      and preventing disease relapse.

      Participation in this study may last up to 4 years. Participants will receive abatacept
      intravenously on specified days during Months 1, 2, and 3. They will also receive daily
      prednisone, which will be started at a dose of 40 to 60mg, then tapered to 20mg by Month 3,
      and finally further tapered until discontinuation is reached. At Month 3, participants who
      have achieved remission will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to either
      continue abatacept or be switched to placebo infusions. Both treatments will be given once a
      month at study visits. Blood samples will also be collected at the monthly study visits to
      conduct laboratory-based studies. Participants who remain in remission will continue to
      receive abatacept or placebo monthly until the common closing date, defined as 12 months
      after enrollment of the 33rd participant for each disease.
