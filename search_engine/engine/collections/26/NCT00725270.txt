      mifepristone (RU 486) in rapidly reducing the symptoms associated with schizoaffective
      disorder. Our group believes that the cognitive deficits (a decline in the ability to think
      clearly) and psychosis (hallucinations or delusions) exhibited in some affective disorders
      are driven by an excess of stress hormone effects (hypercortisolemia). Often the origin of
      this hormonal imbalance is unknown. Current treatment for schizoaffective disorder
      (characterized by mood swings and hallucinations and/or delusions) involves using a
      combination of antidepressant medication (for mood elevation), mood stabilizing medications
      (to prevent extreme high and low moods) and antipsychotic medication (for the correction of
      altered thinking). While these therapies are often effective, they can take several weeks or
      longer to work. We hope to uncover a quick, effective, safe therapy for the treatment of
      individuals with your condition.
