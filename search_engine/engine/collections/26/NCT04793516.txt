      stroke, and the severity of such. Spatial neglect is a disorder that may occur after a stroke
      that leads to a person paying more attention to one side of their body over the other. Each
      testing session, they will perform paper and pencil neglect tests before and after playing a
      VR video game that is being designed as a potential future treatment. They will also give
      feedback on the game after the session is over. People who have spatial neglect after stroke
      are encouraged to apply.
