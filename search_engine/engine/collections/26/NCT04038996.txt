      (miR-146a) reduces miR-146a expression. Previous studies of the investigators demonstrated
      that this SNP was associated with increased acute GvHD severity in patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this prospective, observational study
      the investigators aim to analyze, whether SNP rs2910164 is associated with severity of
      immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Moreover, association
      of rs2910164 with outcome parameters will be studied.
