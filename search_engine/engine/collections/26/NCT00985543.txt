      efficacy to the standard dose of 400/100mg twice daily. Lower drug doses are also associated
      with limited toxicity and cost.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of plasma lopinavir/ritonavir
      following administration to male and female HIV-negative volunteers of 400/100mg, 200/150mg
      and 200/50mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily. Each dosing phase will last for 7 days and each
      phase will be separated by a 7-day wash-out period. Pharmacokinetic evaluations will be made
      over a 12-hour interval at the end of each dosing phase.

      Healthy subjects as determined by their medical history and physical examinations will be
      eligible to participate in the study. HIV-positive subjects will not be recruited as there is
      a risk that HIV-resistant mutations will be selected by an experimentally reduced dose of
      lopinavir/ritonavir. There is no reason to presume that there is any meaningful difference in
      the metabolic processing of lopinavir/ritonavir between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
      people.
