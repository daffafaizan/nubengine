      outcomes, including increased mortality and morbidity, longer length of ICU stays, prolonged
      mechanical ventilation, and costlier hospitalizations. Previous studies showed that, the
      incidence of delirium for seniors patients admitted to ICU can reach up to 58%-75.6%
      depending on the patient population and screening instrument. The current protocols for
      perioperative opioid use and postoperative pain management may influence the occurrence of
      delirium. We hypothesize that the use of oral acetaminophen (OVA) may lead to reduced opioid
      consumption and decreased incidence of postoperative delirium.

      Objectives: To investigate the impact of acetaminophen analgesia on the frequency of
      postoperative delirium and 28 days mortality in elderly patients after noncardiac surgery.

      Study design: A randomized and controlled trial. Setting: Departments of critical care
      medicine of tertiary hospital (Xiangya) in China.

      Patients: 164 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) who are scheduled to admitted to ICU after major
      surgery (predicted duration ≥ 2 hours) Intervention: For patients in the acetaminophen group,
      oral acetaminophen supplemented dexmedetomidine sedation will be provided after surgery. For
      patients in the control group, sufentanil supplemented dexmedetomidine sedation will be
      provided after surgery. the other analgesia drugs will be provided as back up in study group.

      Primary outcome: Early primary endpoint is the frequency of delirium in the first 5-days
      post-surgery. Secondary endpoints include biomark and NeuroMonitoring of delirium, 28days and
      in-hospital mortality, length of stay days in ICU and hospital, complication in hospital.

      Predicted duration of the study: 2 years.
