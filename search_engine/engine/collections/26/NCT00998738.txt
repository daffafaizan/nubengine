    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare ixabepilone-induced peripheral neuropathy (sensory) as measured by European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life Questionnaire
      (QLQ)-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)20 sensory subscale between calcium
      (Ca) Magnesium (Mg) and placebo arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the incidence of CTCAE measured grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral neuropathy
      between CaMg and placebo arms.

      II. To compare the times to onset of CTCAE measured grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral
      neuropathy between CaMg and placebo arms.

      III. To compare the proportion of patients requiring ixabepilone dose reductions and/or
      stopping ixabepilone secondary to peripheral neuropathy (sensory) between CaMg and placebo
      arms.

      IV. To assess the toxicity of CaMg in this situation. V. To document the incidence and
      severity of the acute pain syndrome (APS, commonly known as arthralgias/myalgias) induced by
      ixabepilone.

      VI. To evaluate whether CaMg will decrease the acute pain syndrome (APS). VII. To evaluate
      the incidence and characteristics of, and change in, ixabepilone-APS over several cycles.

      VIII. To evaluate the association between the ixabepilone-APS and eventual
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate IV over 30 minutes
      immediately before and after each ixabepilone administration.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 30 minutes immediately before and after each
      ixabepilone administration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 12 months.
