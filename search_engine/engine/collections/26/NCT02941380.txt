      coronary artery bypass grafting. Severity ranges from postoperative delirium to stroke, but
      the majority of patients with postoperative cognitive decline following coronary artery
      bypass grafting have decline in recent and remote memory in particular.

      The reason for the cognitive decline is still not fully understood though many reasons have
      been proposed.

      Inflammation and oxidative stress may contribute to the postoperative cognitive dysfunction
      which may also be in combination with a reduced cerebral autoregulation.
