      volunteers for approximately 12 weeks and stable isotopes will be measured in blood and hair.
      Participants will be randomized to one of three diets: a weight-maintaining diet without
      soda, a weight maintaining diet with 20% of carbohydrates provided as soda, and a weight
      maintaining diet with 40% of carbohydrates provided as soda. Ultimately, the goal is to
      develop biomarkers to be used to validate food intake patterns in outpatient clinical and
      epidemiological studies. The primary objective of this study is to validate the use of stable
      isotope biomarkers as representatives of specific dietary intake patterns; changes in the
      blood and hair carbon stable isotope ratio (13C/12C) will be measured from baseline to 12
      weeks. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of the amount of soda on urinary
      sucrose and fructose excretion, extracellular vesicles levels and content, and gut
      microbiota, measured from baseline to 12 weeks. Study volunteers will be adult non-diabetic
      men and women who are in good health.
