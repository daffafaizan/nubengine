      (treating physician, diagnosing physician or primary care physician) and if eligible will be
      invited to enroll in the registry. The Registry Coordinating Center will be responsible for
      obtaining consent from adult patients and caregivers of minor patients (as well as assent
      from minors when appropriate), screening patients and enrolling them in the registry.

      The registry will capture data entered by the patient, the patient's healthcare provider, and
      the patient's caregiver using online (electronic) survey tools administered at baseline, and
      annually thereafter. The patient's healthcare provider will complete the baseline Healthcare
      Provider survey tool, reporting the patient's baseline demographics, medical history,
      clinical information, and disease characteristics. The patient and caregiver will complete
      their dedicated baseline survey tools answering questions on the impact of disease on their
      everyday life. Survey tools include questions on patient and caregiver demographics, patient
      physical activity, patient food and hunger episodes, patient quality of life, and caregiver's
      perspective of disease burden on the family. Registry patients, caregivers, and healthcare
      providers will be contacted annually (approximately every 12 months) by the Registry
      Coordinating Center to complete an online follow-up survey tool including a smaller subset of
      questions from the baseline survey tools.
