    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo a glucose tolerance test over 3 hours and a potassium body
      scan on day 1. Patients undergo an indirect calorimetry over 20 minutes on day 2. Patients
      receive stable-labeled leucine and stable-labeled glucose IV over 3 hours followed by insulin
      and glucose IV over 4-4.5 hours on day 2 using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
      technique.

      Blood and breath samples are collected to measure glucose tolerance, peripheral insulin
      sensitivity, and whole body protein turnover. Hepatic glucose production is measured by mass
      spectrophotometry.

      Patients maintain a 3-day food journal before pregnancy, during each trimester, and after
      pregnancy.

      Patients undergo each study during the final 2 weeks of each trimester of pregnancy and then
      at 6 months post-partum.
