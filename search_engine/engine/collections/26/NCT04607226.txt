      stimulation (tVNS) at different stimulation frequencies and sham stimulation during five
      sessions within a 2 week period. Heart rate variability (HRV) point process adaptive
      filtering estimation algorithms will be used to evaluate changes in cardiac autonomic
      physiology in subjects with major depression in response to tVNS. The effects of tVNS on
      cardiovagal regulation will be evaluated at rest and in response to an emotion reactivity
      task. Depression rating scales (Beck's Depression Inventory) will be used to evaluate short
      term effects of tVNS on depressive symptoms in these subjects. In addition, the study will
      evaluate the acute effects of the stimulation on serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
      The stimulation frequency that produces the greatest regulatory effects on depressive
      symptoms and physiological variables in this population will be used in a second longitudinal
      phase of the study.
