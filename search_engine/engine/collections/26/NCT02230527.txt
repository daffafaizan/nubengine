      Stage IV) or CLI with concomitant vascular insufficiency wounds (Rutherford Stage V-VI PAD).

      Potential participants will be identified and screened prior to discharge or at the time of
      the first out-patient visit (within 2 weeks after discharge) after a percutaneous lower
      extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention (stent or balloon angioplasty) for
      the presence of lower extremity vascular insufficiency. Participants will be classified as
      Rutherford Class IV - VI (with or without ulcerations). A total of 60 patients will be
      randomized into 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (ticagrelor to clopidogrel). Patients are
      placed on clopidogrel after their arterial intervention per standard of care. They will
      remain on clopidogrel up to the time that randomization occurs. For patients that are
      randomized to ticagrelor, the clopidogrel will be stopped.

      Patients will be randomized to either ticagrelor 90mg by mouth twice daily or clopidogrel
      75mg by mouth daily.
