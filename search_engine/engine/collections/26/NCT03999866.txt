      thyromental distance or evaluating the mallampati score, mandible protrusion or body mass
      index still not 100% specifically say anything. all patients were pre oxygenated with 100%
      oxygen with nasal canulla during the whole procedure. We administered 0.07 mgr/kg
      remifentanil for minimum 3 minutes and continue this infusion during the procedure. The
      patients airway topicalized by 10% lidocaine spray. We enroll 20 patients undergoing elective
      surgery.

      We compare 4 different video laryngoscopes for preoperative assessment of difficult
      laryngoscopy in the same patient. We evaluate the patient and the instructors satisfaction
      with the visual analogy scale and the visualization time. Demographic vary,ables and the
      airway characteristics of patients. We assess the cormack lehane view of these
      videolaryngoscopes with or without cricoid pressure. and the occurrence of gag reflex as
      well.
