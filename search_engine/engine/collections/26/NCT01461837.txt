      by familial haploidentical T cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients
      with high risk Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). It is hypothesized that it will be safe and well
      tolerated, and result in sustained donor chimerism, acceptable engraftment and immune
      reconstitution. Also, that it will limit SCD related organ damage resulting in improved
      and/or stable neurological, neurocognitive, pulmonary and pulmonary vascular function and
      health related quality of life (QOL).

      Patients 2-20.99 years of age with a diagnosis of high-risk SCD and with an unaffected HLA
      partially matched family donor and meeting eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion
      criteria) are eligible.
