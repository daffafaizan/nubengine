    
      The purpose of this database analysis is to assess the impact that this operational change
      has had in the short, medium and long term on key clinical and laboratory parameters in the
      patients, including blood pressure, body weight, interdialytic weight gain, serum
      electrolytes, intradialytic saline administration, missed treatments, hospitalizations,
      medication, inflammatory markers, etc. All subjects included in the final dataset will be
      matched with dialysis patients receiving treatment in other dialysis clinics of the Renal
      Research Institute who were not subject to the operational change. This will lead to the
      development of a matched cohort of equal size unexposed to dialysate to serum sodium
      alignment.

      The analysis is planned to investigate treatment effects, and test the effects of dialysate
      to serum sodium alignment for interactions and associations between those laboratory and
      clinical parameters. The extent and magnitude of sodium alignment (the operational change)
      will also be assessed.
