      a North American control diet that they will consume for five weeks under isocaloric,
      weight-maintaining conditions. Participants will then consume the MedDiet for 5 weeks, again
      under isocaloric, weight-maintaining conditions. All foods will be provided to participants
      during these consecutive 5-week diets. Participants subsequently will then undergo a 20-week
      weight loss period in free-living conditions during which they will be given advice on how to
      create a 500 kcal deficit in their daily energy intake. The last phase of the study consists
      of a second 5-week MedDiet consumed under feeding, weight stabilizing conditions. Metabolic
      studies and CHD risk factor assessment will be performed at the end of each experimental
      diets. Metabolic studies include the measurement of in vivo kinetics of apolipoprotein
      (apo)B-containing lipoproteins including small dense LDL, apoCIII, HDL (apoAI) and C-reactive
      protein (CRP) as well as indirect measures of cholesterol absorption and synthesis.
