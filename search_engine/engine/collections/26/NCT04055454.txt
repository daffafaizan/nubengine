      different dose levels of MV-LASV. As safety precaution, the study will begin with enrollment
      of two successive unblinded dose groups of sentinel participants randomized into groups of
      four in an open-label fashion (group A and B).

      Thereafter, 52 participants will be enrolled in an observer-blinded, randomized manner into
      one of the three treatment groups (A, B or C). Placebo will be applied to blind the different
      Treatment schedules.

      After the screening visit, participants will bei enrolled to one of three Treatment groups.
      Visits for immunogenicity sample collection and safety assessments will be performed for 56
      days, and additionally subjects will for long-term follow-up up to 365 days.

      The investigator and site personnel assessing Adverse Events (AEs), all participants, as well

      Medicinal Product (IMP) will be unblinded within the randomized observer-blinded treatment
      phase.
