      peripheral vascular disease. Folate is a type of B vitamin that occurs naturally in food. In
      nutritional supplements, folate is known as folic acid, and it has been shown to lower the
      concentration of homocysteine in blood. Folic acid supplements are a simple way for people to
      increase their folate intake, lower their homocysteine levels, and reduce their risk of
      developing heart disease. However, more research is required to determine the most effective
      dose of folic acid needed to lower homocysteine levels. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the effect that varying doses of folic acid have on folate levels and homocysteine
      concentration levels in older adults.

      This 6-week study will enroll healthy adults over the age of 60 who do not currently take
      multivitamins or B-vitamins. At a screening visit, participants will complete questionnaires
      on medical history, demographics, and diet. Also, height and weight will be measured, and a
      blood collection will occur. At a baseline study visit, participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either placebo or one of four doses of folic acid-100 mcg, 400 mcg, 1000
      mcg, or 2000 mcg-to be taken once a day for 6 weeks. Participants will attend a final study
      visit at Week 6, at which time another blood collection will occur.
