      guidance by ultrasonography three times with 4-week interval. Initial dose of allergen was
      1,000-fold diluted solution from maximal concentration of allergen extract for subcutaneous
      immunotherapy (30 AU/ml for Df or Dp, 10 AU/ml for Cat hair, and 1:1/10 weight/volume for dog
      hair/dander, HollisterStier, New Orleans, USA) in volume of 0.1ml. After the first dose,
      allergen concentration was escalated 3-fold at second dose, and 10-fold at third dose if
      there was no or mild local or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The allergen concentration
      did not change at second or third dose if there was moderate local or systemic reaction. The
      allergen concentration was decreased by 10 or 100-fold from previous concentration if there
      was severe local or systemic reaction.

      The investigators evaluated parameters regarding allergic rhinitis within a week before the
      first injection and 4 months after the first injection. These parameters included
      Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test
      (SNOT-20), and Visual analogue scale (VAS) of symptoms including rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal
      obstruction, postnasal drip, eye/nose/ear/palate itching, dyspnea, wheezing, chest discomfort
      as well as urticaria, angioedema, and itching on exposed skin during exposure to causal
      allergen in daily life. Skin prick test, intradermal test, blood sampling for serum
      allergen-specific IgE, exhaled nitric oxide, and nasal lavage for Th1, Th2, and Treg
      cytokines were also included. Adverse events were recorded and graded according to Muller's
      classification and Ring and Messmer's classification.
