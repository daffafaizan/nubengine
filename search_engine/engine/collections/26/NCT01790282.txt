      Two recent met analyses (Gelbaya et al 2008) &(Jee et al 2010)( ) has shown that the addition
      of E2 to P4 for luteal phase support in IVF/ICSI cycles has no beneficial effect on pregnancy
      rates. However they commented that the data in the literature are, limited and heterogeneous,
      precluding the extraction of clear and definite conclusions. Previous met analysis ( Pritts
      and Atwood 2002 ) and an update (Fatemi et al 2007 ) and subsequent randomized trials (
      Ghanem et al 2009 , Var et al 2011 ) reported beneficial effects of adding E2 to luteal P4
      support. Recent retrospective studies have shown that high response in terms of excess egg
      production ( >15 . ) and or high E2 (Chen et al 2007,Kyrou et al 2009, Sunkara 2011 ) are
      detrimental to cycle outcome. This prospective randomized trial aims to study whether adding
      E2 to P4 luteal support in high ovarian responders is detrimental to cycle outcome or not
