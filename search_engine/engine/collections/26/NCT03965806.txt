    
      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the current knowledge regarding field of
      anesthesiology and role of anesthesiologist in general population of Ireland.

      Operational definitions:

      Knowledge:

      Knowledge of patients will be defined as the percentage of patients giving correct answers to
      a questionnaire consisting of questions modified from previous studies and other added
      questions (2-8). Patients giving 66% (8 out of 12) correct answers to the questionnaire will
      be considered to have knowledge of anesthesiology and anesthesiologist.

      Methodology:

      Study settings:

      Study will be conducted among general population visiting or working in our lady of Lourdes
      Hospital.

      Duration of study:

      Study will be conducted over a period of two to three months after the approval of study.

      Study design:

      Cross-sectional study.

      Sample size:

      Sample size is calculated using WHO Sample Size Calculator. In a previously study(6) ,
      knowledge regarding anesthesiologist and anesthesiology was about 51.52% therefore 384
      patients will be include in this study to estimate knowledge within 5 percent point (margin
      of error) of the true value (51.52%) with 95% confidence interval.

      Sampling technique:

      Non-probability purposive sampling.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. People visiting or working in our lady of Lourdes hospital.

        2. Age 18 and above.

        3. Both male and female

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. People refusing to give consent.

        2. Pediatric patients (patients up to age of 16years).

        3. Language barrier.

        4. Patient unable to understand the questions due to disability.

        5. Patients who are doctors.

      Data collection:

      After getting approval from the hospital .All subjects fulfilling the criteria will be
      enrolled in the study after taking informed consent. Patients will be interviewed by the
      preoperative SHO/Registrar or principal investigator in hospital. Each interview will last
      for 10-20min and will be based on attached questionnaire.

      Questionnaire:

      Questionnaire consist of questions modified from previous studies and added questions (2-9).
      It has two parts; demographics i.e. age, gender, educational level, occupation, previous
      anaesthesia experience and type of surgery, second part will consist of 12 questions about
      anesthesiology and anesthesiologist. Patients giving correct response to 8 out of 12
      questions will be considered to have knowledge.

      Data analysis:

      All statistical analysis will be performed using statistical packages for social science
      version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Frequency and percentage will be computed for gender,
      type of surgery, education level, previous surgery, Patient's knowledge about anesthesiology
      and anesthesiologist. Mean and standard deviation will estimated for age. Stratification will
      be done to control effect modifiers like gender, age, education level, previous surgery to
      observed Patient's knowledge about anesthesiology and anesthesiologist through chi-square
      test. p≤0.05 will be considered as significant.
