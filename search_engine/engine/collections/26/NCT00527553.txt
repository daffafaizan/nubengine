      which 3 months are actual trial and follow-up time. Every individual will have 3 measuring
      points at set intervals. At every measuring point (days 1, 45 and 90), these subjects will
      undergo 6 different non-invasive measuring techniques. These are the mean visual acuity test
      using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, contrast sensitivity
      using the Pelli-Robson chart, Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO), Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) and Heterochromatic Flicker Photometry (HFP) and the Reflectometer. A
      questionnaire will be taken at the beginning of the trail. The invasive part of the study
      involves blood sampling at all three times, measuring the serum concentration of lutein,
      zeaxanthin, omega-3 and lipoprotein using the HPLC analysis.
