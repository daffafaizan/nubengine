      psychologic distress for patients.Recombinant Human TNF Receptor-Ig Fusion Protein for
      Injection (Qiangke®) can block the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.

      TNF-α plays a major role in the pathophysiology of both Psoriasis（PsO）and Psoriatic Arthritis
      (PsA). TNF-α levels are elevated in psoriatic skin lesions, serum samples, and synovial
      fluid. Anti-TNF-α therapy has shown efficacy in treating psoriatic skin lesions, joint pain
      and swelling, enthesitis, and dactylitis plus the ability to improve mobility, reduce
      radiographic progression of disease, and influence quality of life parameters.

      Qiangke® is a dimeric, soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding
      portion of the TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human Immunoglobulin gamma-1（IgG1）.
      It is capable of binding and neutralizing soluble TNF and transmembrane TNF. It alters
      neutrophil migration and dendritic cell and T-cell maturation and migration, thus decreasing
      the local and systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their subsequent effects.
