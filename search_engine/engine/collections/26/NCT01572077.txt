      are substantial differences among patients in their tendency to develop right heart failure.
      This study proposes to determine if right ventricular (RV) changes can predict the
      development of right heart failure in patients with PAH.

      In addition, the study aims to evaluate the relationship of right ventricular metabolism to
      other physiologic responses in PAH,including:pulmonary vascular resistance, serum BNP and
      changes in cardiac hypertrophy and function. In conjunction with hemodynamic measurements,
      biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); RV metabolism will be evaluated with
      (18F) FTHA and (18F)FDG cardiac PET imaging.

      A cohort of 20 age sex matched individuals will serve as normal controls. These subjects will
      have no known cardiac or pulmonary disease with normal ventricular function and estimates
      pulmonary pressures on echocardiogram.
