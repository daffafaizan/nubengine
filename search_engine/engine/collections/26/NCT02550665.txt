      showed poor response in lower dose, however the side effect profiles according to dose
      titration method were not clarified yet. This study aims to confirm which titration method
      would show better safeties and tolerabilities in the high dose donepezil treatment.
      Investigators include patients with moderate to severe dementia who were diagnosed as
      probable Alzheimer's disease and treated with donepezil 10mg at least 3 months before the
      study. The study duration is for 12 weeks and the titration duration is the first 4 weeks of
      the study. Investigators evaluate the side effects profiles and vital signs at every 4 weeks
      and measure blood laboratory tests at screening and the last visit.
