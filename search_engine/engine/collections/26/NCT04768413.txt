      care model is justified in a population highly vulnerable to COVID 19, with Rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in a health emergency situation and in turn seeking to promote its well-being,
      taking into account the importance of interdisciplinary follow-up to strengthen self-care,
      avoid deterioration, hospital admissions and improve therapeutic adherence. This research
      work proposes the evaluation of the implementation of a tele-orientation program and
      tele-consultation to the adult population with RA attended at a specialized rheumatology
      center in Bogota, Colombia, over a period of three months, by means of a observational,
      analytical, cohort, prospective study that will include mixed methods for collecting
      information (quantitative and qualitative). The qualitative methods will include interviews
      with a subgroup of patients attending by the two models and with the professionals who care
      for them, with the aim of knowing the experiences and perceptions of both the patients and
      the professionals.

      The impact that the project seeks is focused on evaluating the program's contribution to the
      control of RA symptoms and inflammation, avoiding progressive structural damage.

      On the other hand, elements will be provided to advance towards telehealth educational
      interventions and their effect in improving the therapeutic adherence of patients with RA, as
      well as avoiding their displacement, maintaining quarantine measures and stimulating
      necessary self-care measures in search of mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and counteract the
      spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly in this
      susceptible risk group.

      Finally, this study will provide information on the characteristics of RA patients who choose
      telemedicine compared to face-to-face care when both are offered as usual care options during
      an unprecedented situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, the possibility of
      replication at the national level from the planning of telemedicine programs in rheumatology
      will be essential for contributing to the reduction of epidemiological indicators against
      contagion by coronavirus and the use of hospital service
