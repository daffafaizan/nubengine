      infusion and PSC 833 in patients over age 56 with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. II.
      Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Determine the frequency and prognosis of functional and phenotypic P-glycoprotein expression,
      cytogenetics, and pharmacokinetics in this population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of
      PSC 833 IV over 2 hours on day 1, then continuously for 96 hours; daunorubicin IV
      continuously on days 1-3; and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7. Filgrastim (G-CSF) or
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SQ) or IV beginning on day 15 and
      continuing until blood counts recover or day 21. If patients do not achieve complete
      remission after one course, a second course is administered. Patients who achieve A1 bone
      marrow, B1 peripheral blood, and C1 extramedullary disease status after 1 or 2 courses of
      induction chemotherapy proceed to consolidation therapy, which begins upon recovery from
      induction therapy. Consolidation therapy consists of PSC 833 over 2 hours on day 1,
      daunorubicin IV over 1-5 minutes on days 1 and 2, and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats for a total of 2 courses. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years
      and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-9
      months.
