      I. To develop a novel, multi-dimensional index of physiologic reserve and resilience specific
      to surgical cancer patients.

      II. To implement and assess a novel comprehensive multidimensional prehabilitation program on
      frail cancer surgery patients.

      OUTLINE: Non-frail patients are assigned to Arm 1. Frail patients are randomized to Arms 2 or
      3.

      ARM I: Non-frail patients receive standard of care.

      ARM II: Frail patients receive standard of care.

      ARM III: Frail patients undergo a physical therapy consultation and complete home exercises 3
      days per week.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks after surgery and
      then every 3 months.
