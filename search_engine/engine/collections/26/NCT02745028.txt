      duodenum level that results in stimulation of contractility resulting on increase rate of
      gastric emptying. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the administration of a
      single dose of monosodium glutamate can shorten the gastric emptying time.

      Patients with a prior study indicating a delay of gastric empting time, will undergo a second
      test with the addition of a weight adjusted dose of monosodium glutamate. Each patient will
      serve as her/his own control. Results will be analysed by pair-T test.
