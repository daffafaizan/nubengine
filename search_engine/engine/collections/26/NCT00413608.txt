      receptor will receive during one week a daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel. Depending on
      their pharmacodynamic response to this dose of clopidogrel, subjects will be affiliated to
      two groups, "good responders" and "bad responders". After a wash-out period, "bad responders"
      will receive a double dose of clopidogrel, while the "good responders" will receive 75 mg of
      clopidogrel, associated with a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Such study will allow to evaluate both the
      impact of raising daily dose of clopidogrel in patients with defected variants of 2C19 and
      potential interactions of clopidogrel with other drugs.
