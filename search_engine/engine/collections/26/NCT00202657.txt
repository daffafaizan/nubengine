      disease. Last year, two studies showed that pergolide can induce unexpected heart valve
      disease potentially severe and frequent. The late discovery of this unknown side effect had
      dramatic consequences in Parkinson's disease management and the French drug agency (AFFSAPS)
      has recently published guidelines for its prescription. Little is known about the prevalence
      and the molecular mechanisms leading to this adverse event. To determine the prevalence,
      evolution, and potential risk factors of pergolide-induced heart valve disease, we propose an
      echocardiographic observational study in parkinsonian patients taking pergolide compared to
      matched controls. This clinical study will be performed in the Clinical Investigation Centre
      in collaboration with the Institute of Cardiology of the Salpétrière Hospital
