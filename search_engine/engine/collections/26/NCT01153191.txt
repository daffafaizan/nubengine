      elective transabdominal colorectal surgery. This population was chosen due to its inherently
      high rate of superficial-incisional infection.Colorectal procedures stand out as a
      particularly highrisk surgery with respect to SSI. Several studies have reported rates of
      infection of 25% or more making colorectal surgeries an excellent opportunity for testing new
      strategies to reduce SSI.

      This pilot project seeks to preliminarily evaluate two new strategies that are inexpensive
      and could be readily incorporated into current practice. The strategies are pressurized
      irrigation of the superficial surgical wound (above the fascia) and subcutaneous injection of
      gentamicin into the surgical wound prior to initial skin incision. Comparison will be made
      between prospectively enrolled patients and historic controls.The hypothesis to be tested is
      that these interventions will significantly reduce superficial incisional infection rates
      compared with historic control.
