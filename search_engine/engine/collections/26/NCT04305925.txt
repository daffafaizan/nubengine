      fusion-guided transrectal-based focal laser ablation (FLA) of prostate cancer using the Orion
      System, an investigational laser-based interstitial irradiation/thermal soft-tissue ablation
      system. Safety and feasibility will be determined by analyzing the number, type, and severity
      of adverse events. In addition, changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be
      evaluated using Expanded Prostate Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP), Memorial
      Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), and Decision Regret Scale.

      This is an open-label early feasibility/pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      the Orion System. In this study, the investigators intend to use the investigational Orion
      system to deploy and monitor thermal energy in cancerous regions of the prostate, identified
      by MRI and confirmed by targeted biopsy. MRI guidance will be achieved by MRI/ultrasound
      fusion, overlaying stored MRI images upon real-time ultrasound images. Interstitial laser
      treatments would be achieved by inserting the fiber into the cancerous regions guided by the
      Artemis image-fusion device. Applications of laser energy up to 15 watts of power will be
      used to treat the target region. Subjects will return to clinic 1 week, 1 month, and every 3
      months until one year post-FLA to be monitored for adverse events and complete Health Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) questionnaires. Biomarker (PSA) kinetics will also be monitored.
