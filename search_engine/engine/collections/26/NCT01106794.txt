      pediatric brainstem tumors and 10% of pediatric brain tumors, and is the most lethal form of
      brainstem gliomas in children. There is currently no effective therapy to treat these tumors.
      We hypothesize that this tumor exhibits unique molecular abnormalities leading to altered RNA
      and protein expression. The aim of this trial is to collect specimens from pediatric patients
      with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, brain
      tumor and other constitutional tissue, during therapy and/or at autopsy. Our goal is to study
      this tissue to characterize the genetic abnormalities that lead to tumor formation in order
      to identify key molecules as biomarkers which we can target to design and test new and more
      effective treatments.
