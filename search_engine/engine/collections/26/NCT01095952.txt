      and safety of a new algorithm aimed at controlling VR during rapidly conducted AF by
      delivering AVNS from the atrial lead placed at a septal position, and designed with the
      purpose of reducing inappropriate shocks. Additional purposes include the assessment of a
      possible application of AVNS aimed at allowing prolonged control of VR during AF and reducing
      AF symptoms, and evaluation of implantation data on selective placement of the atrial lead in
      postero-septal right atrium. About 37 patients will be followed for half a year.
