      mellitus in the World [3]. Visceral (abdominal) obesity is particularly common and more
      closely related to morbidity in the UAE. The investigators propose to undertake a controlled
      dietary intervention study in UAE subjects with visceral obesity, the aims of which are: (i)
      To examine the feasibility of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and/or whole-grain fiber in
      the UAE population (ii) To examine the effects of increased fruits, vegetables and/or
      whole-grain fiber consumption on cardio metabolic risk factors (iii) To investigate the
      longer-term influence of increased fruits, vegetables and fiber consumption on health and its
      capacity to sustain lifestyle change. The proposed study will provide the scientific
      rationale and the methodology for improving the diet and promote healthy eating in the UAE
      population.
