    
      This study is being conducted to determine whether administration of a single IV dose of
      palifermin 3 days before initiation of chemotherapy and 3 days before each subsequent
      treatment cycle would reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and to evaluate the safety
      profile in the subject population. This study will evaluate the efficacy of palifermin in
      reducing the incidence of grade ≥ 2 OM in subjects with stage 2B or stage 3 locally advanced,
      colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and leucovorin in cycle 1. This study
      will also assess the safety and tolerability of palifermin administered as a single IV dose
      before each cycle of 5-FU and leucovorin, evaluate the effect of palifermin on
      patient-reported mouth and throat soreness, the incidence of grade ≥ 2 oral mucositis in
      cycle 2, the duration of grade ≥ 2 oral mucositis, 5-FU dose reductions/delays and the
      long-term effects of palifermin on disease outcome and survival.
