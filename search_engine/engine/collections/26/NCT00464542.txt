      high frequency of asymptomatic shedding in the genital tract, as transmission usually occurs
      during these periods of subclinical reactivation of the virus. Therefore, an improved
      understanding of the risk factors associated with HSV-2 shedding is needed.

      Preliminary data suggests that bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be associated with increased
      genital tract shedding of HSV-2. As BV is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in
      reproductive age women, even modest associations with genital tract shedding of HSV-2 would
      result in substantial attributable risks for transmission of the virus.

      This study assessed the effects of asymptomatic BV on daily genital tract shedding of HSV-2
      by determining shedding frequency before and after treatment of asymptomatic BV. Twelve HSV-2
      seropositive women with asymptomatic BV were enrolled. These women were instructed to
      self-collect daily swab specimens for HSV-2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) analysis from the lower genital tract for one month. At the end of the one
      month follow-up visit, each participant completed a one week course of oral metronidazole for
      treatment of BV. This was followed by daily home collection of genital tract swab specimens
      for an additional one month.
