    
      Exclusion criteria were the following:

        -  lower third molar buds;

        -  lack of contiguous second molar;

        -  wide cyst-like areas or severe osteo-metabolic/tumor pathologies associated with the
           lower third molar;

        -  pre-operative neurosensory deficit related to IAN on the side where surgery was to be
           performed.

      Clinical and radiographic data were noted on a special chart, developed in four areas
      concerning the patient's personal data, pre-operative case evaluation, surgical technique,
      and post-operative course.

      Assessment of surgical difficulty was reached using a modified Pederson's scale by assigning
      a 1 to 3 score to each of the following variables: tooth inclination (mesioangular/vertical =
      1; horizontal = 2; distoangular = 3), depth of impaction (modified Winter classification: A/B
      = 1; C1 = 2; C 2= 3), Pell & Gregory class (I = 1; II = 2; III = 3), root morphology (fused
      or slightly divergent = 1; strongly divergent = 2; presence of apical anomalies = 3),
      proximity to the IAN (none = 1; contiguity = 2; embrication = 3) and maximum mouth opening (>
      4 cm = 1; 3-4 cm = 2; < 3 cm = 3). For each extracted third molar, a total score between 6
      and 18 was therefore obtained.

      All surgeries were performed by the same expert surgeon (RP), with the buccal approach using
      local anesthesia, and included the following maneuvers:

        -  luxation of the coronal portion of the tooth/root in an ipsilateral or parallel
           direction with respect to the IAN position and running, in order to minimize nerve
           compression;

        -  post-extraction residual bone cavity inspection using a Zeiss 4x300 magnification
           optical system to better identify intra-operative nerve exposure.

      No material was inserted into the residual cavity, neither by regeneration nor by
      haemostasis.

      After one week, sensitivity was tested on both sides with the tactile test using a 27-gauge
      needle tip and, if a difference was found, the patient was followed up once a week for the
      first month and every two weeks thereafter, until he/she reported to perceive the pin-prick
      test in the affected side the same way as the healthy side.
