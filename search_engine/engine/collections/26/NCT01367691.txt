      Different LV-RV delays will be programmed during CMR and LV function and different
      dyssynchrony parameters will be assessed. Results will be used to determine the optimal LV-RV
      delay, and CRT-devices will be reprogrammed accordingly. Improvement in NYHA-class/conversion
      to therapy responder will be determined clinically after 3 months.
