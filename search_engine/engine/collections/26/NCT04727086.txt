      safety and tolerability in phase I clinical trials. When administered to mice, BP1.3656 was
      associated with increased metabolism of histamine and elevated brain dopamine and
      acetylcholine, suggestive of utility in psychiatric disorders including Alcohol Use Disorder
      (AUD).

      This study is a Phase II laboratory-based trial of BP1 .3656 for AUD. 40 non-treatment
      seeking participants with AUD will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      intervention with BP1 .3656 or placebo in a within-subject, crossover design. During each
      intervention period, outcome measures relating to alcohol motivation and self-administration
      will be assessed in the laboratory. It is hypothesized that relative to placebo, alcohol
      self-administration will be decreased by BP1 .3656.
