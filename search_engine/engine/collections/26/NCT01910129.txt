      for the reduction in frequency of seizure associated with epilepsy in subjects 18 or older.
      Subjects will record 4 weeks of baseline seizure activity before being randomized for a
      period of 8 weeks to receive and active treatment to an active-sham treatment. All subjects
      will then receive another 8 weeks of active treatment.
