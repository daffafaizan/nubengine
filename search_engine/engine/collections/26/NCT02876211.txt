      complications in patients with chronic kidney disease. Eryptosis (accelerated red blood cell
      death) is a novel mechanism associated with renal anemia and several factors such us iron,
      erythropoietin and klotho (anti-aging hormone) deficiency have been associated with this
      process.

      The use of the paricalcitol may inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, especially
      interleukine-6, which is one of the most important cytokine associated with the pathogenesis
      of the AI. If the use of the paricalcitol for the SHPT control may exert direct influence on
      the erythropoiesis process is not known.
