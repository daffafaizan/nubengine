      treatment answering for the inclusion criteria and having given informed consent to the
      inclusion in the study.

      Criteria for choosing the size of the stent according to the IVUS:

        -  Support on the healthy parts of the vessel.

        -  The diameter of the stent should match the diameter of "media-media" in the distal
           reference segment or be the average between the diameter of the lumen of the proximal
           and distal reference segments.

        -  Postdilatation is sure to be in the stent: in the affected area by a large balloon over
           the initial diameter of the "media-media", at the entrance of the stent - over the
           initial of the reference diameter of the lumen.

      After postdilatation a control is being performed with "Virtual Histology" (VH) IVUS and
      i-MAP, an optimal stent implantation is estimated.

      Criteria for optimal implantation:

        -  Complete apposition around the entire circumference.

        -  Symmetry index is more than 0.75.

        -  Stent diameter is not less than 80% of nominal.

        -  Lack of initial dissection at the edges of the stent.

        -  Lack of prolapsed tissue.

      A comparison of all the data is carried out by groups with and without using of IVUS and by
      types of the stents, as well as by groups according to intraoperative results: (a) the
      optimal result by IVUS and OCT, (b) optimal result by IVUS; suboptimal - by OCT, (c)
      suboptimal results with IVUS and OCT, as well as in subgroups of optimal (d) and suboptimal
      (e) results by OCT in patients without IVUS.
