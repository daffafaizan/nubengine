      is the degree of inflammatory response. SP16 is a synthetic anti-inflammatory peptide
      developed to reproduce the anti-inflammatory activities of naturally occurring Serpins and
      has been tested as a treatment for AMI in mice. This Phase I trial will be the first to test
      the hypothesis that a single subcutaneous administration of SP16 is safe and well tolerated
      in healthy individuals, while also assessing the pharmacokinetic parameters of three
      different dosages. Participants will undergo direct clinical monitoring for up to 12 hours
      after drug administration. Additionally, participants will follow up with the same
      assessments at 24 hours, 48-72 hours and 7 days post drug administration.
