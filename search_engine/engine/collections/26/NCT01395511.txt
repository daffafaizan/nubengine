      Kyung-hee Medical Centre during December 8, 2009 to October 14, 2010.

      Patients who met eligibility criteria were randomly allocated into either acupuncture
      treatment group or waiting-list group. Random sequences were generated by computerized number
      table. Allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. According to priority, sealed
      envelope was matched when the patients had given informed consent.

      The method of acupuncture: participants were given acupuncture treatment three times a week
      during 2 weeks, for 15 minutes (Needle retention time) at each session. (Total 6 times)
