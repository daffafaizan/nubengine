    
      The plasma samples from 15 individuals with schizophrenia (with a diagnosis of ICD-10) and
      the equivalent healthy controls will be conducted with the quantification analysis of the
      microRNA-30e via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR).

      The 15 patients enrolled should be the first-episode and have not been treated, or were drug
      free 3 months recently at least.

      This research measures the expression level of microRNA-30e in schizophrenia respectively
      before the beginning treatment with atypical psychotics or combined with MECT, after the
      4-week treated , the 8-week treated compared with 15 healthy controls.
