      bladder, major abdominal vessels, and an anterior abdominal wall vessel) have been
      introduced.

      These methods include the standard technique of insufflation after insertion of the Veress
      needle, the open (Hasson technique), the direct trocar insertion and optical trocar
      insertion. Furthermore, it is more difficult to perform in the obese patient, especially if
      the first trocar is not umbilical, like obesity surgery. This is because obese patients have
      a very thick abdominal wall (particularly in women) as well as a thick peritoneum.

      Very different complications, some even potentially fatal, i.e., injury to viscera or to
      major intra-abdominal and abdominal wall vessels, have been reported in surgical literature.
      Complications of first entry develop in up to 1-2% of patients and more than half of all are
      fatal complications. Major vascular and abdominal organ injury rates of 0.03-0.1% and
      0.08-0.14%, respectively, have been reported. Surprisingly, there has been little change in
      entry techniques since the dawn of laparoscopic surgery. Some risk factors are defined for
      prediction of complications, such as obesity. Laparoscopic obesity surgery has become very
      attractive and gaining popularity, recently, and however it possess many complications and
      challenges such as (it starts with) entry to the abdomen.
