      treating depression in MCI and mild AD patients over 60 years of age who have not tolerated
      or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. 28 patients will be assigned to receive 4
      consecutive weeks of daily active dTMS treatment. The long-term effects of treatment on
      emotional cognitive measures will be assessed at a 4-week follow-up visit (8 weeks from
      baseline). Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the Montogmery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognition will be assessed using a validated
      neuropsychological battery.

      We will also offer patients to receive 4 weeks of treatment using theta-burst TMS, which is a
      milder version of TMS.
