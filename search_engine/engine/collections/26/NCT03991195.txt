      and probiotic supplementation may positively affect cognitive function for patients with AD.
      However, there are few existing studies involving the role of gut microbiota in possible
      intervention for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).

      In this project, taking the method of random, double blindness and control, the probiotic
      supplemented group with aMCI will take Bifidobacterium for three months. The control group
      with aMCI will take placebo. After that, the investigators aim to investigate the differences
      of cognitive function between these two groups and changes of intestinal microbial flora
      diversity via combining neuropsychological tests and 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing
      technique. Furthermore, based on the multi-modal neuroimaging techniques, including
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI）, functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)，
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the regulatory mechanism of intestinal
      microorganism in intervening aMCI will be revealed from the perspective of brain networks.

      In conclusion, these results are beneficial for understanding the therapeutic effect of gut
      microbiome as a non-drug treatment for early AD and further elucidating the potential brain
      mechanism, which are of great values in solving scientific and clinical practice issues.
