        -  Examine the mutational status of the EGFR pathway in tumor and blood samples from
           patients with lung cancer.

        -  Correlate the EGFR pathway mutations in these samples with clinical outcomes of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed via PCR to detect EGFR pathway
      mutations in DNA.
