      impairs quality-of-life for a considerable number of individuals each year.1-3 In the United
      States, 600,000 groin hernia repairs (GHR) are performed annually, and a conservative
      estimate is that 2%, corresponding to 12,000 individuals, each year will develop this
      debilitating pain condition.4 The management of SPG remains a daunting challenge to the
      medical profession 5, often requiring multidisciplinary efforts.1,6 Several surgical
      procedures have indicated substantial pain-relieving effects in SPG1,7 however few
      well-powered, controlled studies have been presented.8,9 In pharmacological and
      neuromodulation procedures, most studies are still case-based or uncontrolled.

      In 2010, the authors established a dedicated tertiary center for SPG-patients open for
      referral on a nationwide basis. The objectives were, first, to analyze the pathophysiological
      mechanism behind the pain, second, to implement optimal medical and surgical pain management
      and third, to perform clinical SPG-research projects. Standardized clinical and
      neurophysiological tests guided the management paradigm for each patient. Treatment outcomes
      were evaluated prospectively using baseline questionnaires (Q0) and a 5-year questionnaire
      (Q5Y) mailed at the end of 2014 to all patients referred to the center.

      The focus of the present study is first, to present clinical, neurophysiological and
      psychometric data on SPG-patients at referral, and second, to evaluate and compare efficacies
      of exploratory surgical and non-surgical treatment, based on a consecutive follow-up cohort
      of 222 patients.
