      received single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle.
      The treatment phase began on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Study visits were scheduled to occur every 28
      days to coincide with the beginning of a new cycle. The start date of a new cycle was delayed
      if adverse events (AEs) occurred, in which case the visit date for the start of the following
      cycle was scheduled 28 days after the actual start date of the delayed cycle. Efficacy and
      safety assessments, including complete blood counts (CBCs) were performed at least every 2
      weeks during Cycles 1 to 4 of the treatment phase. Participants continued in the treatment
      phase of the study for up to 52 weeks or until disease progression developed, lenalidomide
      treatment was discontinued for any reason, or the study was terminated.
