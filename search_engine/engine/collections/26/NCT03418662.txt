      surveillance colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled. This study aims to compare the
      adenoma detection rates between EndoRings colonoscopy (EC) and Standard colonoscopy (SC). It
      is assumed that the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma would be 25% with SC and
      35% with EC.
