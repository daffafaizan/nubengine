      suppressing plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels. However, approximately 10% of patients who
      achieve undetectable viral loads will experience a detectable rise in HIV RNA each year. When
      HIV replication has been suppressed to very low levels, it may be possible to consolidate
      antiretroviral therapy into a simpler and potentially less toxic "maintenance" regimen
      without a PI. Such a regimen would ideally be potent enough to continue to maintain viral
      suppression but use agents that are better tolerated, more easily salvaged, less expensive,
      and/or more convenient than PI-containing regimens. Subsequent rises in HIV viremia with
      non-PI maintenance regimens may respond to resumption of the pre-maintenance PI-containing
      regimen, extending the use of the potent PI class.

      Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with ddI/d4T/HU (Arm A) versus ddI/d4T/EFV (Arm B)
      versus continuation of the pre-entry PI-containing regimen (Arm C). Viral load is measured at
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years. Upon virologic
      failure (plasma HIV RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml), or drug intolerance,
      patients on the maintenance regimens (Arms A and B) restart their pre-entry PI-containing
      regimen. Patients on Arm C are managed according to best medical judgment of their primary
      care provider in the event of virologic failure.
