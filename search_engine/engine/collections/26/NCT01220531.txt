      successful treatment, children remain immunodeficient and usually die by age 2 years. In
      complete DiGeorge subjects, thymus transplantation with and without immunosuppression has
      resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function. The purpose of this expanded
      access study is to continue thymus transplantation safety and efficacy research for the
      treatment of complete DiGeorge anomaly. Until thymus transplantation is FDA approved as
      standard care for complete DiGeorge anomaly, research study participation is the only means
      by which a patient may have access to this potentially life-saving procedure.

      This protocol includes 4 groups: one for subjects who do not require immunosuppression; and 3
      immunosuppression groups for subjects with different T cell function levels to be suppressed
      adequately.

      Eligible subjects undergo thymus transplantation and may undergo an allograft biopsy.
      Protocol specified studies continue until approximately one year post-transplantation.

      Study participation lasts two years or until thymus recipients may be asked to participate in
      a long-term follow-up study.
