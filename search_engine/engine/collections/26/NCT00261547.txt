      Recent studies from our group and others have shown that these antibodies are probably
      responsible for chronic rejection by attacking the vascular endothelium and fixing complement
      (detected as C4d in renal biopsies). Studies in humans and monkeys have shown that
      circulating antibody and complement deposition precede the development of chronic graft
      injury. Interruption of antibody production is a potential beneficial strategy to prevent
      late graft loss from this mechanism.

      Therapeutic regimens that have been used in an attempt to deplete HLA or ABO antibodies
      include plasmapheresis, IVIg, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and anti-CD20
      (rituximab). Of these regimens, the most specific is anti-CD20, rituximab (rituxan), a
      therapy now FDA approved for B cell proliferative diseases. Although initially introduced for
      the treatment of neoplasm, the humoral immunosuppressant effects of rituximab have been shown
      to have clinical significance. Rituximab interferes with both primary and secondary humoral
      responses by eliminating B-cells prior to antigen exposure, thus interfering with
      differentiation into antibody secreting cells and specific antibody production.
