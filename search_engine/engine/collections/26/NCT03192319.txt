      transplantation, CIBMTR(Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research)
      guidelines recommend varicella vaccination only in patients who is at least two years after
      transplantation and without graft versus host disease and no immunosuppressive drug.

      However, recent studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of shingles vaccination in
      patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      But, there is no basis for timing of live vaccine administration after HSCT.

      The investigators plan to make scientific recommendation for optimal timing of zoster vaccine
      after HSCT by comparing immune response between two groups(vaccination at 2 to 5years after
      HSCT vs. 5 to 10years after HSCT). Primary outcome is interferon gamma releasing ELISPOT
      response at week 6 after vaccination. Secondary outcome is ELISA titer for zoster-specific
      IgG at week 6 after vaccination.

      All the patients will be asked if they have any contraindication for zoster vaccine by a
      physician before vaccination. And they will be monitored for any adverse reaction of the
      vaccination after 6 weeks(visiting the hospital).

      In order to confirm the efficacy of the experiment, 30 healthy controls and 30 patients who
      were treated with chemotherapy alone for leukemia were selected. The control group will also
      apply the same protocol as above.
