      constitutes a standard therapy. However, because of the risk of neurocognitive side effects
      as well as reduced local tumor control, employment of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is
      becoming more common. The disadvantage of SRS alone may be poor intracranial tumor control
      because of frequent appearance of new distant brain metastases after therapy. In recent years
      hippocampal avoidance whole brain therapy has been shown to minimize treatment related side
      effects while reducing the rate of distant intracranial failure.

      In this study patients will be randomized to receive either hippocampal avoidance whole brain
      radiation therapy with integrated tumor boost (HA-WBRT+SIB) or stereotactic radiosurgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that HA-WBRT+SIB can improve intracranial tumor control compared to
      stereotactic radiosurgery, while avoiding additional neurocognitive side effects.
