      CRC and approximately 3% of all CRC. LS significantly increases the risk for an individual to
      develop CRC during their lifetime. Individuals with LS also have an increased risk to develop
      extracolonic cancers, including endometrial, gastric, ovarian, upper urinary tract, small
      bowel, biliary tract, CNS, and certain types of skin cancer. Given the hereditary nature of
      this syndrome, preventing second primary tumors in patients with Lynch Syndrome after surgery
      to the primary site is very important.

      The purpose of this study is to prevent adenomatous polyps and second primary tumors using
      PD-1 antibody (Tripleitriumab) in patients with Lynch Syndrome.

      The primary outcome of this study is the incidence of intestinal adenomatous polyps and
      secondary primary tumors. The secondary outcomes are the incidence of colorectal adenomatous
      polyps greater than 1cm, incidence of high-grade colorectal polyps, treatment-related adverse
      events, disease-free Survival and overall Survival.

      There are two groups: the PD-1 antibody prevention group and the routine follow-up group. For
      the PD-1 antibody prevention group, participants will receive Toripalimab 240mg IV every 3
      months for a year. For the routine follow-up group, there is no drug intervention.

      This whole study will take 5 years: the first year for recruiting and the latter four years
      for follow-up.
