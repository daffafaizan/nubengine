      example obesity has been implicated in the development or progression of low back pain and
      knee osteoarthritis. The mechanism by which obesity causes lumbar back pain is poorly
      understood, but the contribution of both mechanical and system factors is likely. Direct
      mechanical stress on the intervertebral discs and adjacent structures are suspected to be
      mechanisms through which obesity affects the spine, leading to subsequent low back pain. The
      link between obesity and knee osteoarthritis has also been demonstrated, but potential
      factors underlying the association of obesity with knee osteoarthritis has not entirely been
      elucidated.

      It is a well-known fact that obesity leads to an excess load on the joint, increased
      cartilage turnover, increased collagen type 2 degradation products and increased risk of
      degenerative meniscal lesions. Although all of these factors have been proposed to lead to
      knee osteoarthritis, no causal relationship has been demonstrated.
