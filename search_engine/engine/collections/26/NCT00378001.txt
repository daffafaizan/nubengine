    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, investigator blinded, randomized, concurrent control,
      phase III clinical trial. Patients meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be
      randomly assigned to receive either the test drug (Fostimon®, IBSA) or the reference drug
      (Gonal-F®, Serono Inc.). Investigators will be blinded by not allowing them to have any
      contact with the study medications (supplied in boxes labeled in a manner that does not
      reveal the content of the boxes), and requesting that patients do not make any statements to
      the investigator that might indicate the treatment to which they were assigned. Equivalence
      testing with regard to the primary outcome variable will establish whether the two treatments
      are indeed similarly effective.
