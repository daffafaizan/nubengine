      stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights
      infections in the human body, and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the
      immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that
      clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients, but there is no reliable information
      on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients.

      All patients take INPX capsules 4 times a day and RBV capsules 2 or 3 times a day. The first
      group of patients take the dose of RBV shown to be effective in an earlier trial and
      subsequent groups take higher doses until toxic effects occur. The planned treatment period
      is 3 months, but further treatment may be allowed for patients showing improvement. Blood
      samples are taken from an arm vein and used to evaluate possible changes in the patient's
      immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the blood and possible changes in
      the presence of HIV in the blood.
