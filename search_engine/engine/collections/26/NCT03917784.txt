      mainly food and exercise plans. It has been advice, in specific circumstances, to grant a
      pharmacological regimen.

      Curcumin or Curcuma Longa ((1E,6E)21,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-
      heptadiene-3,5-dione), is the main ingredient of the Hindu condiment, Turmeric, which is
      obtained from the Rhizome plant. In new studies, it has been documented that the oral
      consumption of curcumin (Curcuma longa) in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients has a positive
      effect as an antidiabetic agent thanks to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic,
      cardio and neuroprotective effects. In animal models, it has been shown that oral curcumin
      consumption is capable of increasing insulin sensitivity in liver, muscle and adipose tissue,
      increases glucose uptake in muscle and insulin secretion, which is reflected in the reduction
      of hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, decrease of the homeostatic model assessment of
      insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and decrease of serum lipids.

      Curcumin has been included in the oriental diet since ancient times and is used in
      traditional medicine, which is why it is considered safe, since its consumption is approved
      by the FDA (Federal Drugs Administration). A 12g per day dose has shown no side effects in
      humans. Therefore, it is proposed that the consumption of curcumin in pre-diabetic patients
      can improve glucose tolerance and decrease insulin resistance parameters.
