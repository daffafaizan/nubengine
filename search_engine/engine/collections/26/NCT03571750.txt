      preventative intervention in a number of types of psychopathology including suicidality. In
      the case of Perceived Burdensomeness (PB) and Thwarted Belongingness (TB), theory suggests
      that they may be malleable, though this has received little empirical attention. Taken
      together, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and related empirical literature suggest that
      targeting PB/TB should offer a novel and important avenue to reduce suicidality. This
      inspired the investigators' efforts to create and evaluate an intervention - called Building
      Stronger Allies (BSA) - designed to reduce these factors.
