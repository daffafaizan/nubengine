      patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with oxaliplatin. II. Determine the
      toxicity, including objective measurement of neurotoxicity, of oxaliplatin in these patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by platinum therapy status
      (platinum sensitive vs platinum resistant). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression, other illness that
      would preclude administration of study drug, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      for a minimum of 2 years or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
