    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of two rapid-acting insulin Lispro
      formulations: Humalog® and Listro™ in healthy subjects, based on the pharmacokinetic
      parameter (PK) AUC (INS-LIS 0-8h) and the pharmacodynamic parameter (PD) AUC (GIR 0-8h) and
      also assess the safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations.
