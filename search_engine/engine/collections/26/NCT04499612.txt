    
      250 patients of similar age, gender, and ethnicity will be divided into five groups: Group
      A1-3: 150 patients with indications for cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)
      implantation; Group B: 50 patients with an CIED implanted 8-10 years ago; Group C: 50
      patients with diseases similar to group A, but without indications for CIED implantation;
      Patients will be followed up for 2 years. Patients of group A1-3 will be taken peripheral
      venous blood to assess the studied parameters of hemostasis (platelet count, plateletcrit,
      mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, von Willebrand factor, P-selectin,
      coagulation factor I (FI), coagulation factor II (FII), coagulation factor V (FV),
      coagulation factor VII (FVII), coagulation factor X (FX), coagulation factor VIII (FVIII),
      coagulation factor IX (FIX), coagulation factor XI (FXI), coagulation factor XII (FXII),
      plasminogen, soluble fibrin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), D-dimer, antithrombin
      III, protein C) and duplex ultrasound of the vessels of the upper and lower extremities
      before the operation, after 7 days, 1 and 12 months after the operation. Similar procedures
      will be performed for patients of groups B and C only when included in the study.
      Echocardiography will be performed on all patients at enrollment, after 12 and 24 months of
      follow-up.
