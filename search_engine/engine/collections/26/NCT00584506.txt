      deformities is well established. It is known that successful orbital reconstruction hinges
      upon restoration of native orbital volume in order to establish pre-morbid function and avoid
      long-term complications. To date, a facile, reliable, and reproducible method to measure
      orbital volume has not been rendered, despite numerous approaches. The objective of this
      study is to assess the performance and clinical predictive value of a novel software program
      designed to perform complex volumetric analysis with application in the field of orbital
      trauma.
