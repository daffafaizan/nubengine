      intensive care (ICU). Unfortunately, one of the complications of its positioning is
      catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) and its consequences. Despite the widespread use of CVC and
      the extensive literature describing its complications, areas of uncertainty regarding the
      onset, treatment and prevention of CRT persist, especially with regard to asymptomatic
      thrombosis.

      This study aims to describe the incidence of catheter-related and non-catheter-related
      thrombosis in a population of adults in ICU and to assess its correlation with alteration of
      coagulation parameters.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the proportion of patients developing CRT
      (proportion) and the incidence of CRT (rate expressed in catheter events/days) in patients in
      ICU.
