        -  To determine the incidence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow and
           circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of women with cervical cancer at diagnosis
           and 3 to 9 months after chemotherapy and pelvic radiation with and without Zometa.

        -  To determine the change in biochemical markers of bone turnover from diagnosis to 9
           months after radiation in women receiving chemoradiation for cervical cancer with and
           without Zometa.

        -  To determine change in bone mineral density from diagnosis to 9 month after
           chemoradiation with and without Zometa.

        -  To determine if depressed and anxious mood are associated with greater impairment of
           adaptive immunity (ratio of Th1/Th2) and higher levels of angiogenesis (VEGF) in
           peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients.

        -  To examine the relationship of standardized uptake values (SUV)Max and metabolic
           heterogeneity in the primary tumor and evidence of persistent/recurrent disease on the 3
           and 9 month Fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans with DTCs and
           CTCs.
