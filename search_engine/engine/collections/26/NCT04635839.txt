      antepartum hospitalizations place pregnant patients at an even higher risk of developing
      thromboembolism. As a result, there is an increased emphasis on administering pharmacologic
      thromboprophylaxis for antepartum patients with prolonged hospitalizations. Previously,
      standard dosing of unfractionated heparin was widely adopted for thromboprophylaxis in the
      pregnant population. However, due to a suspected altered metabolism of unfractionated heparin
      in pregnancy resulting in a decrease response, the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (ACOG) currently recommends considering gestational age-based dosing for
      unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy with standard dosing as an
      alternative option. The data supporting altered dosing is very limited. In addition,
      increased dosing of heparin may result in challenges in anesthetic management, potentially
      limiting the receipt of neuraxial anesthesia resulting in increased need for general
      anesthesia associated with both increased maternal and fetal risks. The potential effects of
      higher prophylactic unfractionated heparin dosing in pregnant patients need to be further
      explored before being widely adopted for inpatient antepartum thromboprophylaxis. The
      investigators propose this study to provide a direct comparison of gestational age-based
      unfractionated heparin dosing to standard dosing of unfractionated heparin for pharmacologic
      thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized antepartum patients.
