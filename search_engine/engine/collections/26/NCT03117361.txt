    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single arm, non-comparative phase II trial, designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of plitidepsin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in
      patients with MM double refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide.The primary endpoint will
      be overall response rate (ORR), including stringent complete response (sCR), complete
      response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and partial response (PR).

      Approximately 64 evaluable patients will be needed for the evaluation of the primary
      endpoint, ORR.

      An early futility analysis will be performed with the efficacy data collected from the first
      20 evaluable patients. The futility analysis will commence once patient number 20 has
      completed two full treatment cycles. Patient recruitment will not be halted during the
      conduct of this futility analysis.
