      proteins and markers of apoptosis in muscle tissue and muscle extracellular fluid will be
      determined in both legs and in parallel the functional consequences of immobilization will be
      assessed. Vascular function and vascular proteins will also be determined. In order to
      understand how the oxidative capacity of the muscle is altered in parallel with changes in
      capillarization, markers of mitochondria will be measured .Half of the subjects will be
      randomized to single-leg training during the immobilization period to assess whether
      simultaneous training reduces the loss of capillaries, muscle function and vascular function
      in the immobilized leg. After the immobilization period the study participants will train the
      immobilized leg and the control leg for four weeks by moderate to intense interval cycle
      training and the same parameteres as during immobilization will be assessed in both legs. The
      study will also include measurements of circulating compounds and platelets in blood.
