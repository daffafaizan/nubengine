      dermatitis will provide increased efficacy outcomes in subjects who are currently using the
      FDA approved therapy of dupilumab but have responded only partially or inadequately to this
      therapy. Our hypothesis is that adding apremilast will allow patients to go from an
      inadequate response to dupilumab to an adequate response defined as an Investigator Global
      Assessment (IGA) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).
