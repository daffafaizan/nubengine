      I. To assess the safety profile of romidepsin given before and after ifosfamide, carboplatin,
      etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma (PTCL).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if reached, of romidepsin administered in
      combination with ICE chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate in patients
      with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of romidepsin.

      Participants receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 4, ifosfamide
      IV over 24 hours on day 1, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and etoposide IV over 2 hours
      on day 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 2-4 weeks.
