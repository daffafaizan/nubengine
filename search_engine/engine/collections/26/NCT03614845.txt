    
      Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery will be randomly assigned either volume controlled
      ventilation group or pressure controlled volume guaranteed ventilation group. All patients
      will be performed lung ultrasonography pre and postoperatively to evaluate the development of
      lung atelectasis and effect of different ventilation modalities on the development of
      atelectasis.
