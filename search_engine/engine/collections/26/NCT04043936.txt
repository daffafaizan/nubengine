      intervention designed to target stigma-related cognitions among service members at elevated
      suicide risk not currently engaged in behavioral health treatment. Interventions that
      leverage CBM principles involve the completion of brief, web-based tasks in which
      participants are presented with a series of stimuli (e.g., words, sentences) and trained to
      respond to those stimuli in a manner that is positive or neutral, rather than negative and
      unhelpful. Consistent with the theoretical rationale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBM
      interventions function by reshaping negative cognitions. Repeated reinforcement of adaptive
      cognitions enhances functioning and reduces distress. CBM interventions have efficacy in
      reducing maladaptive cognitions across a range of psychiatric symptoms. However, limited data
      exist regarding the use of CBM to target help-seeking stigma cognitions.
