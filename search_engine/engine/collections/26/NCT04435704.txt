    
      This is an unblinded Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study in which oxytocin is
      infused in increasing steps to different levels up and down in a set manner and the PD effect
      of pain relief from each level of oxytocin determined. All study participants will receive
      the same treatment and will not be blinded to the experimental plan, although particpants
      will not be informed when oxytocin levels are changing.

      In this study healthy people or those with knee arthritis so severe that they may need joint
      replacement are recruited for a one day study. Participants will come to the Clinical
      Research Unit (CRU) and one intravenous catheter (IV) will be inserted in the forearm for
      oxytocin infusion. In this study, the oxytocin rate will be changed every 15 minutes for 7
      times. Oxytocin will be infused by IV route and 5-min heat pain tests obtained, but instead
      of giving oxytocin at a constant rate, the rate will be adjusted every 15 minutes to aim to
      get the right amount at the effect site to reduce pain by 10% of the maximum, then 30%, then
      70%, then 90%, then back down to 70%, 30%, and 10%. At the end of each of these 7 15-min
      infusions participants will be tested for pain with heat and the study team will compare how
      effective the calculations for the effect site are to control the amount of pain relief
      obtained at each level.

      This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the PK/PD Core
      part of this application. Mathematics will be used to calculate how quickly oxytocin moves
      from the blood to where it reduces pain (Part 1) and to test the accuracy of these
      calculations (Part 2).
