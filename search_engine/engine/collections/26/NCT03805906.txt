      suffering from chronic low back pain. Because physical examination and medical imaging have
      limited value in determining the source of pain, diagnostic blocks play an important role in
      the management of this common condition. Blocks of the L5 dorsal ramus (DR) are used to
      diagnosed pain originating from the L5-S1 facet joint, which is one of the most commonly
      implicated levels in patients with low back pain. Fluoroscopic guidance, which uses x-rays,
      is currently the standard imaging modality used to perform this block. Recently, ultrasound
      guidance has seen increasing use because of its greater accessibility and lack of ionizing
      radiation. Although USG has been shown to provide a high level of accuracy at other levels,
      the greater anatomical complexity found at the L5-S1 has hindered the development of a
      satisfactory L5 DR block technique. In this study the investigators will use fluoroscopic
      control to examine the accuracy of a novel ultrasound-guided approach to this block.
