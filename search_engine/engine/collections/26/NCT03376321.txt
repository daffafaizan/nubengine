      receiving) study will evaluate efficacy/safety of pimodivir in combination with SOC treatment
      versus placebo in combination with SOC treatment in adolescent, adult, and elderly
      hospitalized participants with influenza A infection. The study will be conducted in 3
      phases: screening phase, double-blind treatment period of 5 days (with the possibility to
      extend treatment period by 5 days for participants who will enter an optional double-blind
      extension treatment arm), and post treatment follow-up period of 23 days. Study evaluations
      will include efficacy, pharmacokinetic, biomarkers, safety and tolerability. The duration of
      participation in study for each participant is 28 days, except for participants receiving
      extended treatment, for whom study duration will be up to 33 days.
