      electrical leads were implanted in the subcutaneous space transverse to the occipital nerve,
      in the back of the head, under x-ray guidance. The leads were tunneled under the skin to an
      implantable pulse generator (IPG) implanted in the chest wall or abdomen. The OPTIMISE Trial
      is designed to be a pivotal study of the Boston Scientific PRECISION neurostimulation system,
      when the system is used for ONS. The PRECISION System has been previously been approved for
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS).
