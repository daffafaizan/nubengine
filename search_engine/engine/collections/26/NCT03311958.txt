    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine if nivolumab administration, as a maintenance strategy in DLBCL patients with
      high risk of relapse, can convert positive ctDNA to negative ctDNA and/or result in relapse
      free survival (RFS-ctDNA) of 9 months or longer after positive ctDNA was documented.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate safety of nivolumab as maintenance drug in post-induction, post-salvage and
           post-autologous transplant setting

        2. Relapse free survival (RFS-ctDNA) for nivolumab treated patients

        3. Proportion of patients who are able to convert from ctDNA positive to ctDNA negative
           after nivolumab treatment

        4. To validate NeoLabs assay platform by comparing the results to Clonoseq platform.
