      cyclophosphamide as part of first induction chemotherapy followed by alternating chemotherapy
      and chest irradiation in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution.
      All patients receive 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with doxorubicin, etoposide,
      cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide. For the first course, one group of patients receives a lower
      dose of cyclophosphamide than the other group. Both groups receive the same, and still lower,
      dose of cyclophosphamide during the second course. Beginning 1 week after the completion of
      induction therapy, patients receive 3 alternating courses each of radiotherapy to the
      mediastinal and supraclavicular areas delivered over 10-12 days and chemotherapy as in the
      second course of induction. Each course is initiated after a 1-week rest. Patients receive a
      final chemotherapy course beginning 4 weeks after the previous chemotherapy course. Patients
      are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be entered.
