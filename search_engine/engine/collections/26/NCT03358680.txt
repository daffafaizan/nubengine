        1. Investigator will apply IOC2 to reflect the depth of analgesic during hypothermia in CPB
           period.

        2. Furthermore, investigator evaluated the effectiveness of IOC2 monitoring for anesthetic
           depth versus commonly used vital sign monitoring based on factors such as blood pressure
           and heart rate.

        3. Evaluate the other sedation co-relation measurement, include BIS , IOC2 to reflected the
           consciousness during the operation.

        4. Evaluate the other hemodynamic index, include CO, SVV, CVP, PPV to reflect the
           circulation function , and the effect to the IOC2 and IOC1.

        5. Describe the trend of all the measurement. detect the variation of the index during the
           temperature change during the CPB.
