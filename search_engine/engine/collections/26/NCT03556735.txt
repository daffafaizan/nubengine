      especially the Src family. The Src family upregulate NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate) subtype of
      glutamate receptor thereby gating the production of NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation
      that are vital for processes that underlie physiological and pathological plasticity in the
      brain. Dysregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors in frontal cortical regions of the
      brain seem to be associated with depression. The fibroblast growth factors are highly
      dependent on the activity of the Src family.

      For treatment of depression the PEMF equipment, which are provided by the company Re5 A/S,
      consists of a 220 V impulse generator that creates electrical impulses and an applicator
      which consists of an electrical cable connected to a helmet on which there are 7 electrical
      coils on the inside. In comparison with the rTMS equipment, which uses stimuli approaching
      neuronal firing level, the PEMF fields in human are very much lower.

      PEMF treatment involves placing the treatment helmet on the head and connecting it to a power
      source (220 V), which leads to induction of a pulsating magnetic field. The treatment was
      given for 30 min once or twice daily for 8 weeks. Participants are awake during these
      treatments and sit in a chair where they can read or eat. Pilot data demonstrates that the
      treatment can give mild transient nausea. No other side effects have been observed.
