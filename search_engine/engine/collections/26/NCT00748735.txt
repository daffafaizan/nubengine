      latest peak systolic circumferential strain prior to CRT, considered as the optimal LV lead
      target. LV lead will be defined by (1) fluoroscopy, (2) the maximal temporal difference of
      peak circumferential strain before-to-on CRT and (3) the earliest peak systolic
      circumferential strain during LV pacing. For all 3 modalities optimal LV lead position is
      defined as concordance or immediate neighbouring of the segment with defined LV lead position
      to the determined optimal target segment. At follow-up echocardiography will be performed to
      determine improvement in LV function and remodeling.
