    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether VRx-3996 in combination with valganciclovir
      is safe, determine the side effect profile, and to determine whether this therapy may help
      patients with EBV-related lymphomas. The study has two phases. Goals of the first phase
      include determining a safe and tolerable dose that can be administered in phase 2. Goals of
      the second phase include further evaluating the safety and tolerability of VRx-3996 in
      combination with valganciclovir, evaluating how the drugs are metabolized in the body,
      evaluating response rates and other exploratory objectives that will help the researchers
      evaluate how these drugs work in the body. Participants will receive daily oral doses of the
      two study drugs and will have multiple study visits where they will have blood collected,
      physical examinations, and other medical monitoring.
