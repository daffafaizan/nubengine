    
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, 2-period, single-dose study assessing the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered via
      dialysate and IV to pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD).

      Total participation in the study is approximately three weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, two dosing (PK) visits, and a follow-up visit.

      Each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered IV into the venous blood
      return line over the duration of the dialysis. At the next scheduled dialysis session each
      patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered via dialysate during a single
      hemodialysis session.

      Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for
      safety.
