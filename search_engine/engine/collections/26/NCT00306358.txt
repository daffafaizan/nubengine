      optimised. We investigate which test - measurement of holotranscobalamin or cobalamins -
      could be used for reflection of vitamin B12 absorption. Furthermore, we prolong the duration
      of vitamin B12 administration in order to determine the final duration of the vitamin B12
      absorption test CobaSorb.

      Seventy-eight healthy individuals (age 21-81 years) are treated with three oral doses of 9
      microgram cyanocobalamin per day for five successive days. Non-fasting blood samples are
      collected on day 1-5 before administration of the first dose of vitamin B12 and on day 8.
      Cobalamins and holotranscobalamin are measured on day 1-5 and 8. The performance of the
      vitamin B12 absorption test will be evaluated in individuals with borderline or low levels of
      holotranscobalamin or cobalamins (below the 75% percentiles) using a change larger than
      2CV(day to day) of holotranscobalamin (22%) and cobalamins (12%) to indicate a change caused
      by absorption of the administered vitamin B12.
