    
      The measurements of liver stiffness made by the AixplorerÂ® will be compared to (where
      available) :

        -  blood markers

        -  biopsy results

        -  other stiffness measurement exams (FibroScan, ARFI, ElastPQ...)

      The influence of other (confounding) factors on the reliability of SWE measurements will be
      analyzed.
