      adults and this is likely to be important in frail older adults both in long term care and in
      the community. The reversibility of drug-induced mobility impairment is unclear therefore the
      investigators plan to investigate signals of any impact of reducing polypharmacy on mobility.
      The investigators chose the long-term care setting given the presence of complete medication
      administration records and this patient population's high prevalence of polypharmacy and risk
      of adverse drug events. TaperMD is an electronic tool for systematic medication reduction
      that incorporates patient priorities, electronic screening for potentially harmful
      medicines,supporting evidence tools and a monitoring pathway to support medication reduction.
      This study will examine the feasibility of this tool in a long-term care setting as well as
      examine. Participants in two long-term care facilities will participate in this study.
      Measures will include feasibility outcomes regarding the logistics of the intervention as
      well as patients outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, and medications) collected before and
      after implementation. The study will be an adaptive trial design with two phases. Phase 1
      will be an internal pilot. This will allow the investigators to re-evaluate and modify
      outcome measures and processes as necessary. Phase 2 of this trial will allow for
      continuation after adjustments to the process or design has been made in a larger randomized
      controlled trial.
