      prevalence rate ,high recurrence rate, could increase patients' disability and burden of
      disease. But the pathological mechanism is so far unknown. Until recently, more attention are
      focused on gene dysregulation hypothesis. The preliminary works of our laboratory prompted
      that microRNA-30e gene polymorphism and expression abnormal may be related to schizophrenia.
      Combined with previous studies showed that miRNA disorder involved in neurodevelopmental
      obstacle and neuropsychiatric disease, the investigators surmised: miR-30e dysregulation can
      impact the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. This study will carry on the
      multidimensional research by using the technology of neurobiology, molecular
      genetics,neuroimaging and so on, and integrate methods of molecular, cell, animal and human
      body tracking, so as to:(1) Explaining the transcription and regulation mechanisms of target
      genes of miR-30e,and building the gene regulatory network of schizophrenia as the core of
      miR-30e.(2)To investigate the pathogenesis of miR-30e participate in schizophrenia, and to
      evaluate the clinical value of miR-30e in peripheral blood on the disease diagnose,
      genotyping, predicting efficacy and ending. The object of this study is to provide new
      scientific data and research ideas for further exploring the neurobiological basis of
      schizophrenia, and recognize pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia, ultimately to
      improve and strengthen the new situation in schizophrenia prevention.
