      sizes are generally small. One BMI trial indicated that behavioral economic variables such as
      low levels of proportionate substance-free reinforcement and inelastic demand for alcohol
      predicted poor intervention response, and that participants who successfully reduced their
      drinking increased their participation in academic and other substance-free activities. A
      subsequent NIAAA R21 developed a substance-free activity session (SFAS) supplement to
      traditional alcohol BMIs that attempted to increase engagement in constructive alternatives
      to drinking by enhancing the salience of delayed rewards (academic and career success) and
      the patterns of behavior (academic engagement) leading to these outcomes. This study
      indicated that a two session (alcohol BMI + SFAS) preventive intervention resulted in
      significantly greater reductions in alcohol problems relative to a two session (alcohol BMI +
      Relaxation) active control condition. The BMI+ SFAS was also associated with significantly
      greater reductions in heavy drinking for participants with lower levels of substance-free
      reinforcement at baseline. This was the first controlled study to demonstrate that a
      supplement to traditional BMIs can improve outcomes. The current study will extend these
      promising pilot results by (a) increasing the efficacy of the behavioral economic SFAS by
      including booster contact, (b) increasing power and generalizability by recruiting 425
      students from two universities and including a no-treatment control group, (c) measuring
      drinking, as well as behavioral economic mechanisms as mediators and moderators of
      intervention outcomes (delay discounting, alcohol reinforcing efficacy, substance-free
      reinforcement) at 5 time points over a sixteen month period, and (d) evaluating the economic
      costs and benefits associated with the SFAS. The goals of the SFAS - increasing student
      engagement in academic, campus, and career-related activities- are consistent with the
      priorities of most colleges.
