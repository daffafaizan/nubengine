    
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by lack of
      expression of paternally derived imprinted material on chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS is
      characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, repetitive/compulsive behaviors
      and rigidity, social cognition deficits and severe hypotonia at birth, followed by the onset
      of hyperphagia later in life. Obesity is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and
      mortality associated with PWS, and compulsive eating behaviors are most responsible for
      diminishing the quality of life for caregivers and family members. Oxytocin has been
      implicated in the pathophysiology of PWS and there have been small studies of intranasal
      oxytocin (IN-OXT) in this population. To date, however, studies have not been adequately
      powered to detect significance in target symptoms of hyperphagia and associated symptoms of
      individuals with PWS. The primary goal of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of
      IN-OXT on hyperphagia, as measured by the Hyperphagia Questionnaire-Clinical Trails, from
      baseline to week 8. Currently, there are no effective treatments available to manage
      hyperphagia in patients with PWS.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is an 8-week double-blind, randomized study in 50 children with PWS aged
      5-17. Participation involves 2 in-person visits to our program and 5 remote visits. Travel
      expenses will be reimbursed to participating families.
