      Overall survival-12 months

      Overall survival-24 months

      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Matched Related patients-up to 4 months post transplant

      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Unrelated and Mismatched related patients- up to 4 months
      post transplant

      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease Matched Related patients- up to 2 years post transplant

      Chronic Graft-versus-host disease Unrelated and Mismatched related patients- up to 2 years
      post transplant

        -  OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to donor type (HLA-matched related vs
           HLA-matched unrelated, single HLA-allele disparate related, or unmatched)
           (HLA-mismatched related or matched unrelated donor stratum closed to accrual as of
           1/11/06).

      Patients receive a nonmyeloablative regimen comprising alemtuzumab IV over 8 hours on days -8
      to -5, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4, and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on
      days -3 and -2. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow is infused on day 0.

      Patients receive graft-versus host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV every 12
      hours beginning on day -1 and continuing orally as tolerated until day 100.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 3-6
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter or as clinically indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 HLA-matched related and 25 HLA-mismatched
      related or matched unrelated) will be accrued for this study within 2 years (HLA-mismatched
      related or matched unrelated donor stratum closed to accrual as of 1/11/06).
