    
      Goals of the pilot study:

        -  Compare CFU counts on antimicrobial vs standard scrubs in a clinical setting

        -  Assess CFU counts on the hands of HCWs wearing antimicrobial vs non-antimicrobial scrubs

        -  Assess HCW hand hygiene compliance during the study protocol

        -  Correlate device associated infection rates during protocol to historical controls

        -  Assess feasibility of applying protocol to a longer,12-24 month, prospective
           crossover-trial to definitively study and assess the impact of antimicrobial scrubs on
           HCW apparel and hand colonization, control of multi-drug resistance organisms, hand
           hygiene compliance, and device associated hospital acquired infection rates.
