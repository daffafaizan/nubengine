      hundred four patient starting PD will be randomized into two training groups. Patients in the
      conventional training group (CG) will be given non-standardized in-center conventional
      training programs plus two sessions of training by home visit, while those in intensive
      training group (IG) given in-center conventional training programs plus repeated home visits
      regularly over 24-month period (total thirteen visits). The primary end point of the study is
      exit site infection (ESI). Secondary endpoints are peritonitis and all-cause infection.
      Generalized Estimating Equations will be used to assess the adjusted effect of training level
      on the ESI and Cox regression model employed to evaluate the effect on the peritonitis and
      other secondary outcomes.
