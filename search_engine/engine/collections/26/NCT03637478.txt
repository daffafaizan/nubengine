      the intervention within the four study site clinic locations. Comparison group families will
      receive usual care. Each primary care study site will have designated Family Support
      Specialist, Clinical Care Manager and Child Psychiatry resources. The intervention includes
      an integrated care consultation which combines diagnostic evaluation, family assessment, and
      multi-disciplinary, team-based treatment recommendations, with follow-up community linkages
      and support, as indicated.
