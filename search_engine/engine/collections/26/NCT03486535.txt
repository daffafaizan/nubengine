      nerve blocks need to be investigated on human models, besides animal researches. The
      investigators have been performing this study to explore whether the presence of DM will
      affect the outcomes of infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks (ICBs) in patients undergoing
      elbow, forearm, and hand surgery. The primary hypothesis is that the sensory block duration
      will be delaying in diabetic patients.

      Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 60 patients
      with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-IV and aged between 40 and
      80 years are enrolled to the study. Diabetic patients will be included in Group DM and
      non-diabetics will be included in Group NODM. All patients will receive ultrasound-guided
      ICBs with the mixture of 15 mL lidocaine 2% and 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5%. Postoperatively,
      patients will be administered diclomec SR 75 mg IM first and if still needed tramadol 100 mg
      IV as rescue analgesics (numeric rating scale (NRS) is ≥4). Our primary outcome is sensory
      block duration, and secondary outcomes are sensory and motor block onset times, motor block
      duration, time-to-first-pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) ≥4), postoperative NRS scores, and
      rescue analgesic consumption through the postoperative first 2 days. All outcomes will be
      assessed by blind investigators.
