    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase III clinical trial to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib in combination with Rituximab, high-dose Ara-C
      and dexamethasone (R-HAD) to R-HAD alone in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL after or
      not eligible for myeloablative treatment. The primary endpoint is time to treatment failure
      (TTF). Secondary endpoints are the complete response (CR) rate, the overall response (CR,PR)
      rate, the progression-free survival (PFS), the progression free survival of responders, the
      time to next lymphoma treatment, overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability of Rituximab,
      high-dose Ara-C and dexamethasone alone or in combination with Bortezomib. Study arms will be
      compared to each other to evaluate the impact of additional Bortezomib. Study arms will also
      be compared to historical controls.
