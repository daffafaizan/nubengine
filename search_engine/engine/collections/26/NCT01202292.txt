      study showed that obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor independent of other risks such as
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking. Moreover, the main problem in the
      management of weight-loss is its maintenance, if it is achieved. We have designed a study in
      two geographically separated groups, one of which would receive the group motivational
      intervention, and the other one would receive the usual follow up.
