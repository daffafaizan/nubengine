      transplant patients who will be randomized to weekly alendronate, annual zoledronic acid
      infusions or placebo (calcium with Vitamin D). These patients will be followed for two years
      with annual bone density testing as well as biochemical markers. A secondary aim is to
      evaluate the compliance.
