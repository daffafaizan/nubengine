      patients with stable coronary heart disease. The secondary aims include: 1. To evaluate the
      awareness of CKD in patients with stable coronary heart disease. 2. To find out risk factors
      that is associated with CKD in these patients. 3. To evaluate the association between CKD and
      cardiovascular events during one-year's follow-up. Based on sample size estimation, the plan
      is to recruit 10000 patients from 100 centers. Patients who participate the study will finish
      one-year's follow up (0 day, 6 months and 12 months after recruitment). During the baseline
      visit, patients' demographic characters will be collected, and laboratory tests will be
      performed for urinalysis, renal function, hepatic function, etc. During the 6 months' follow
      up, MACE(Major adverse cardiovascular events) will be recorded through phone or face to face
      interview between investigators and patients. MACE include all-cause mortality,
      cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, documented re-hospitalization for
      unstable angina pectoris, and coronary revascularization (including percutaneous coronary
      intervention and CABG). During the 12 month's follow up, MACE will be recorded, and
      laboratory tests will be performed again.
