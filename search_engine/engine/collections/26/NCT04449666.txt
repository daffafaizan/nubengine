      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages (aSAH). Among the most common impairments after aSAH are
      memory deficits. Volumetric MRI studies suggest an association of memory dysfunctions with
      temporal atrophy, especially of the hippocampus. In a previous study, 77 patients with good
      or moderate clinical outcome after aSAH were examined one year after discharge (Bendel et
      al., 2006). Temporomesial atrophy was detected without direct brain damage, e.g. by secondary
      ischemia. Due to the effects of complex cognitive impairments on the quality of life and
      participation in social and professional life, this relationship will be examined in more
      detail in the planned study. Specifically, we will investigate to what extent the frequently
      observed discrepancy between severe memory impairment and normal structural imaging results
      (no focal lesions in temporomesial areas) is due to hippocampal atrophy. In contrast to
      Bender and colleagues, this question will be investigated in the acute phase of the disease,
      immediately after admission to inpatient neurological rehabilitation.

      Over a period of 24 months, 29 neurological rehabilitation patients with aSAH (Hunt & Hess
      grade I and II) are going to be included. Within the first week (day 1 to 7) after study
      enrollment, a native MRI examination (without contrast agent) is performed, in which a
      high-resolution 3D-MPRAGE sequence (T1 weighting) is measured in the sagittal plane. After
      checking the data quality of the 3D-MPRAGE sequence, especially with regard to its
      suitability for hippocampal volume determination, a comprehensive neuropsychological
      examination is performed, in which specific memory and attentional functions are tested.
