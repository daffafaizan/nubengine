      including PrEP, and thereby potentially avert some of the 50,000 annual incident HIV
      infections in the U.S. Few studies to date have capitalized on risk networks as a way to
      identify and engage high-risk individuals, like CJ-involved women, who could markedly benefit
      from PrEP. This study advances the field by: 1) Using an innovative network-based framework
      (a non-traditional model of care delivery) to engage a high risk population in PrEP
      dissemination as HIV prevention; 2) Incorporating a syndemic approach to PrEP that addresses
      HIV prevention in the context of substance use, psychiatric comorbidities, IPV, and stigma;
      and 3) Recruiting, enrolling, and retaining high risk networks of CJ-involved women who are
      difficult to reach by other means. In doing so, this proposal addresses key funding
      priorities of the Gilead Investigator Sponsored Research program, which includes research on
      PrEP implementation targeted to high risk populations and delivered in non-traditional
      clinical settings.
