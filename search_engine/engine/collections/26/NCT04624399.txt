    
      Screening (up to 28 days before day 1 of treatment):

      Written informed consent will be obtained before potential participants undergo any study
      specific procedures. Each potential participant will undergo screening during the 28 days
      prior to recruitment in the study to confirm eligibility. Clinical data obtained as part of
      their standard care prior to consent may be used to confirm eligibility if they fall within
      the protocol specified timelines. Screening will involve standard of care and study specific
      assessments.

      Standard care assessments:

        -  Medical history

           performance score)

        -  An assessment of the patient's fitness for surgery

        -  Questions about what medicines including over the counter and herbal medicines the
           potential participant is taking

      Study specific assessments to be carried out once the potential participant has consented to
      the study:

        -  Blood samples will be taken for routine biochemistry, haematology, coagulation tests,
           thyroid function testing, and hepatitis/HIV serology testing

        -  Urine sample for routine urinalysis testing

        -  Women of childbearing potential will be asked to take a pregnancy test

        -  An ECG to confirm cardiac function

        -  A CT scan or MRI of the disease area

        -  Blood sample (approximately 20ml/4 teaspoons) and urine sample (approximately 50ml) for
           research purposes

        -  An archival FFPE tumour sample will also be collected as part of patient's normal
           clinical care

      Treatment period:

      Eligible participants will undergo two cycle of atezolizumab treatment (1200 mg administered

      undergo the following assessments:

        -  Physical Examination

        -  Weight

        -  Vital signs

        -  ECOG performance score

        -  Blood samples will be taken for biochemistry and haematology blood tests

        -  Urine sample for routine urinalysis testing

        -  Signs and symptoms (side effects) or other adverse events they may be experiencing and
           any medications being taken

        -  Blood sample (approximately 20ml/4 teaspoons) and urine sample (approximately 50ml) for
           research purposes

      Surgery:

      There must be a minimum of 5 days between the last atezolizumab infusion and surgery.
      Patients will undergo a pre-surgery visit, at which they will undergo the following
      assessments:

        -  Physical Examination

        -  Weight

        -  Vital signs

        -  ECOG performance score

        -  An assessment of the patient's fitness for surgery

        -  A CT scan or MRI of the disease area

        -  Signs and symptoms (side effects) or other adverse events they may be experiencing and
           any medications being taken

        -  Blood sample (approximately 20ml/4 teaspoons) and urine sample (approximately 50ml) for
           research purposes

      An FFPE excision sample will be collected after the tumour has been surgically excised and
      pathologically examined.

      Post-surgery visits:

      Patients will undergo follow-up visits at 4 weeks,12 weeks, and 24 weeks after surgery.
      Patients who do not undergo radical surgery will attend safety follow up visits from the date
      the decision was made to cancel surgery. At these visits, they will undergo the following
      assessments:

        -  Physical Examination (4 week visit only)

        -  Weight (4 week visit only)

        -  Vital signs (4 week visit only)

        -  ECOG performance score (4 week visit only)

        -  Blood samples will be taken for routine biochemistry, haematology, coagulation tests (4
           week visit only),and thyroid function testing (12 & 24 week visits only)

        -  Signs and symptoms (side effects) or other adverse events they may be experiencing and
           any medications being taken

        -  Clavien-Dindo assessment of any surgical complications will be carried out as per normal

      Patients will be followed up at 1 year and 2 years after surgery for details on survival,
      disease status and new anti-cancer treatment information. This will be conducted via
      telephone or review of patient medical notes on site.
