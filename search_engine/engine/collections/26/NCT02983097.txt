    
      This is a phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide added to a
      standard chemotherapy regime of R-DHAP (Rituximab, Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine,
      Cis/Carboplatinum) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory high-grade B-cell
      non-hodgkin-lymphoma (NHL).

      The study hypothesis is that the combination of lenalidomide with standard immunochemotherapy
      will lead to an overall response rate of at least 60%. In this study, 3 rounds of
      immunochemotherapy in combination with lenalidomide will be administered. After the first or
      second round of therapy, peripheral hematopoetic stem cells will be harvested. Consolidation
      treatment with autologous or allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is
      recommended in all patients suitable, but is not part of the study.

      In phase 1, up to six cohorts of at least 6 patients each will be treated with the study
      therapy, with lenalidomide in increasing dosages, to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD).

      In phase 2, 50 patients will be treated with the MTD. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated.
