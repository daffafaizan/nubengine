      obese individuals and 24 individually matched healthy control subjects and determine NET
      expression in vivo using (S,S)-[11C]MRB and PET. This will provide novel insight into
      alterations in pre- and post-synaptic homeostasis in alcoholism and obese people with the
      goal to explain regulatory processes and their alterations in these disorders. A better
      understanding of brain mechanisms and contributory stress would have an enormous impact on
      the public's understanding of the vulnerabilities for these disorders, influence medical and
      legal response to these problems, could lead to a new understanding of these phenomena, and
      stimulate a better means of prevention and treatment.
