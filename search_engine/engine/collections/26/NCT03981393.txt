      protective ventilation strategies, patients who have severe respiratory failure often develop
      complications from mechanical ventilation, including volutrauma and barotrauma. ECMO allows
      gas exchange to occur extracorporeally and may reduce the potential burden of iatrogenic lung
      injury by allowing a reduction of volume and pressure support - a 'lung rest' strategy. It is
      theorised that earlier intitiation of ECMO may allow for better outcomes, as there will have
      been less time for iatrogenic lung injury to occur.

      The UK ECMO registry has been collected of patients treated under the NHS England
      commissioned respiratory ECMO service since 2011. This study has been previously registered
      and publication is intended shortly.

      Patients will be extracted from this registry if they received VV ECMO. Propensity matching
      scores will be created and patients will be stratified into groups of 'early' vs 'delayed'
      ECMO, based on their probability of being in either group.

      Patients will be divided into cohorts based on the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio at decision to
      cannulate ('less severe hypoxaemia') and ('very severe hypoxaemia'). Matched cohorts will be
      created correcting for key confounding factors (age, primary diagnosis, duration of pre-ECMO
      ventilation and PaCO2), using cardinality matching (a novel technique described by
      Zubizaretta et al. in 2014) and traditional propensity-score-based methods.

      The technique with greater balance and statistical power (as defined by sample size) will be
      selected for the primary analysis.

      Further analyses will assess the relationship between hypoxaemia at decision-to-cannulate and
      confounding factors as above.
