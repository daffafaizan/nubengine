      sound. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of tinnitus is so difficult.

      So, Investigators measure auditory ERP through autonomously developed system to make a
      objective diagnosis tinnitus. Moreover, patients undergo continuous resting EEG measurement.

      In this study investigators examined the efficacy of rTMS treatment for tinnitus and check
      into changes in brain connectivity or auditory task with ERP, continuous resting EEG before
      and after rTMS. And develop a new test that can detect tinnitus objectively in humans, using
      the prepulse gap paradigm
