      junction tumors. There is a need for individualized radiotherapy delivery to the upper
      abdomen, because of mobility. Likewise, controlling gastric filling by instructing patients
      about fluid and food intake before treatment, may contribute to positional reproducibility.
      There is evidence that missing microscopic disease in treating the clinical target volume
      (CTV) results in a worse prognostic outcome. The investigators want to evaluate wether
      positional difference of stomach, with and without fasting prescription, has an impact of the
      delivered dose. They will focus on the part of the CTV extending in the stomach. The
      investigators hypothesize that measurement of the dose using verification kilovoltage cone
      beam CTs will provide information on potential cold/hot spots of dose delivery and monitor
      potential geometric differences during treatment. This may result in a suboptimal treatment
      and a reconsideration of matching target volume on soft tissue instead of bony landmarks. The
      investigators will evaluate the first clinical results with DGRT in patients with esophageal
      cancer.
