      and is called the true diverticulum. Perforation is observed less frequently due to its full
      thickness. Conservative treatment can be applied unless complications such as abscess
      formation and free perforation occur. Here, we aimed to discuss the results of conservative
      and surgical treatment for right colon diverticulitis in the light of the literature. 150
      patients treated for colon diverticulitis between 2015-2020 were retrospectively screened.
      Right colon diverticulitis detected incidentally, missing data, and left colon diverticulitis
      were excluded from the study. Data of a total of 26 patients were accessed. Unlike the left,
      right colon diverticulitis has low complications and can be treated conservatively. The
      differential diagnosis of right colon diverticulitis should be kept in mind in order to
      prevent unnecessary surgeries. Surgical treatment is inevitable in cases such as recurrent
      diverticulitis, generalized peritonitis, and suspected malignancy
