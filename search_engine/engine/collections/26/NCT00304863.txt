      therapy, has become increasingly common and important in American hospitals, causing
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for this
      condition. We have recently reported (Clin Infect Dis, June 2005) that treatment with
      metronidazole is associated with a 22% rate of failure and 28% rate of relapse. No other
      medication has been shown to be more effective. There is a substantial theory and some
      limited data to suggest that dietary supplementation with non-pathogenic normal bowel
      bacteria will benefit these patients. Lactobacillus GG is the best-standardized and the most
      extensively studied of these agents.
