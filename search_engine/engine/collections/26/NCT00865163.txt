      the background of full anticoagulation is approached by the investigators. On the collected
      data the LASER registry will

        -  document the frequently used treatment modalities how patients requiring stents on the
           background of full anticoagulation with Vitamin K Antagonists are currently managed

        -  will document the associated cardiac event rates with each currently used treatment
           strategy

        -  will document the associated bleeding rates with each currently used treatment strategy

      With these data available, the LASER Registry will allow

        -  to define an optimised treatment regimen for the treatment of patients on full
           anticoagulation with Vitamin K Antagonists receiving one or more coronary stents

        -  to allow the appropriate sample size calculation for the design of a subsequent
           randomised comparison of continuous triple anticoagulation versus this optimised
           treatment regimen in such patients.
