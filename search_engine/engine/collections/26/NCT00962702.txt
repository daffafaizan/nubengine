      assessed peri-operatively, and at 30 and 90 days post procedure. The primary effectiveness
      outcome is the percentage of patients with complete exclusion of the left atrial appendage
      assessed peri-operatively (visually), and at 90 days post procedure via transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE).

      Transesophageal echocardiography will be performed intra-operatively and again at 90 days
      post procedure. Intra-operative and follow-up TEE examinations will be read centrally at a
      core laboratory. Any Doppler flow across the Fastener into the excluded portion of the
      appendage will also be considered a failure of exclusion. The presence or absence of LAA
      and/or LA thrombus will be evaluated. Patients will also be evaluated for other potential
      sources of embolism, including aortic atheroma, patent foramen ovale, or other intracardiac
      shunts.

      Data collection will be completed at baseline, at the time of open cardiac surgery procedure
      and throughout the perioperative hospitalization. Patients will be evaluated at 30 days post
      surgery and at 90 days post surgery.
