      torcular puncture and median prosencephalic vein embolization. Detachable platinum coils
      (Target XL and XXL Detachable Coil, Stryker Neurovascular) will be used to pack the
      prosencephalic varix. This procedure will take place in an obstetric OR at Brigham and
      Women's Hospital. Data will be collected every 4 weeks post-procedure until delivery, as per
      standard of care. Data regarding delivery and post-delivery status will also be collected
      until the subject is discharged from the hospital. After delivery, neurological assessments
      will be performed every 6 months for 2 years (adjusted for gestational age). Data will be
      compared to historical cohorts.
