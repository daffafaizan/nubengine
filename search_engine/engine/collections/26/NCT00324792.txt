      demonstrated that the urinary LTE4 excretion is increased in patients with type 1 diabetes.
      With regard to recent human genetic studies showing that polymorphisms in the 5-lipoxygenase
      (5-LO) promoter and FLAP haplotypes is linked to cardiovascular disease susceptibility our
      data suggested the potential interest of LTE4 as a non-invasive biomarker of cardiovascular
      risk. In diabetes mellitus, further studies are required to evaluate the 5-LO pathway after
      improvement of glucose control and concomitantly with established inflammatory cardiovascular
      biomarkers.

      The secondary objectives are:

      Before and after 3-month intensive insulin therapy- Relationship between a marker of platelet
      activation (urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxan B2 :11-dehydroTXB2) and urinary LTE4- Relationship
      between inflammatory plasma markers of cardiovascular risk (hs-CRP and fibrinogen) and
      urinary LTE4- Relationship between a plasma marker of endothelial dysfunction (sICAM-1) and
      urinary LTE4- Changes in LTE4 according to patient subgroups (patients with type 1 and type 2
      diabetes mellitus)
