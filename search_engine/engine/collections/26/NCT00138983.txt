      therapy, causing increased (vertebral) fracture risk. Bone loss is caused by inhibition of
      bone formation by GCs. Active vitamin D analogues like alfacalcidol directly stimulate
      osteoblasts leading to an increase in bone formation. Bisphosphonates like alendronate induce
      apoptosis of osteoclasts leading to inhibition of bone resorption.

      We performed a randomized, double-placebo, double-blind clinical trial of 18 months duration
      in patients with a rheumatic disease, starting GCs in a dosage of 7.5 mg prednisone
      equivalent daily or higher. Two hundred one patients were allocated to receive either
      alendronate 10 mg and alfacalcidol-placebo daily or alfacalcidol 1 microgram and
      alendronate-placebo daily. Primary outcome was change in bone mineral density of the lumbar
      spine in 18 months, secondary outcome incidence of (symptomatic) morphometric vertebral
      deformities.
