      weeks, and a 24-week post-treatment period. The duration of treatment was determined by
      product labeling. Participants received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) 300 mg/120 mg once
      daily. Participants who completed or prematurely discontinued the treatment period were
      followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study drug to monitor safety, hepatitis C
      virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA), and the emergence and persistence of viral substitutions.
