      on the development of metabolic illnesses is an objective of numerous clinical studies.
      However, the effect of an isocaloric diet on metabolism is less investigated and not well
      understood. This study aims to reveal genetic determinated metabolic responses to an
      isocaloric high carbohydrate, low fat diet versus an isocaloric low carbohydrate, high fat
      diet in healthy twins. This study generates information for further detailed nutrigenomic
      analysis. Twins receive an isocaloric diet rich in carbohydrates (55% carbohydrates, 15%
      protein, 30% fat) with dietary counselling for 5 weeks and afterwards with nutrients supplied
      for 6 days, followed by an isocaloric diet rich in saturated fat (40% carbohydrates, 15%
      protein, 45% fat) for 6 days with nutrients supplied and for 4 weeks with dietary counselling
      and again followed by another 6 days when nutrients were supplied. Anthropometry, blood tests
      and energy expenditure are performed after the period of diet rich in carbohydrates (Carb),
      after the first 6 days (HFshort) and at the end of the period of diet rich in fat (HFlong).
