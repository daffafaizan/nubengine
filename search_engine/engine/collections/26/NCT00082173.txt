      to 8 million new cases of active TB occur each year. TB is the second most common infectious
      cause of death worldwide. Appropriate treatment of persons with active TB is very important
      in limiting the transmission of M. tuberculosis and preventing TB-related mortality. Current
      therapy requires 6 months of a four-drug regimen of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF),
      pyrazinamide (PZA), and EMB.

      The development of alternative regimens is a priority, and new classes of antituberculosis
      agents are needed to provide treatment options for patients with drug-resistant disease. This
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of replacing EMB with MOX in a multi-drug regimen in
      the initial phase of treatment of smear-positive pulmonary TB in patients with and without
      HIV infection.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either a MOX-containing drug
      regimen or the standard EMB-containing drug regimen for 8 weeks. Participants will have study
      visits weekly during these 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, participants will discontinue MOX, EMB,
      and PZA and will continue taking INH and RFP for 4 months. Participants will have study
      visits at Months 4, 6, 12, and 18. Study visits will include a medical interview, physical
      exam, blood and urine tests, and sputum tests for TB.
