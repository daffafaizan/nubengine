    
      The clinical investigation is designed as a prospective repeated measures longitudinal study
      with intra-subject controls, using a selection of subjective evaluation tools to assess
      patient related benefits from hearing implant treatment of permanent hearing loss.

      Clinically standard self-assessment scales, threshold measures and a general hearing history
      profile questionnaires for the clinician and implant recipient are made available for
      selection through an interface to a central electronic platform.

      The registry is aimed at collection of data for patients who have already made the decision
      together with their implant centre clinician for an implant device from the company Cochlear.

      Patients are approached for registry participation following implant by the caring clinician
      on a consecutive and voluntary basis and on condition of signing the patient informed
      consent.

      Monitoring of data entry is included through automated reminders via e-platform and through
      inherent audit trail.
