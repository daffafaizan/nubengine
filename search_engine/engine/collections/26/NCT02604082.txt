      with mechanical ventilation (G2) vibrocompression + hyperinflation with mechanical
      ventilation (G3) in the amount of aspirated secretions, mechanical ventilator time, incidence
      of ventilator-associated pneumonia , reintubation tracheal and mortality in mechanical
      ventilator. Primary outcome: weight in grams of the aspirated secretions. Secondary outcome:
      hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure,
      peripheral arterial oxygen saturation; peak inspiratory pressure, tidal volume; dynamic
      compliance ; mechanical ventilator time; reintubation tracheal; Incidence of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality in mechanical ventilator.
