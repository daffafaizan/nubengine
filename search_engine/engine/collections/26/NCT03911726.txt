      antipsychotic agents, representing nowadays gold standard for patients with schizophrenia,
      may lead to an up regulation of dopamine D2-like receptors and associated, a supersensitivity
      of these receptors. The detection of such changes and the study of influencing factors (in
      particular smoking and type of medication) are most important for the understanding of
      relapse risks, development of treatment resistance and the risks for motor complications of
      antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. This monocentric, controlled study will include 140
      participants over a time period of three years. 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode,
      drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will
      undergo a single PET/MR measurement.
