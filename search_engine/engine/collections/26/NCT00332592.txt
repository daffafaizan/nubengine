      microdialysis during the observation period. The catheter is placed in the stomach via the
      naso-oesophageal route. If surgery is necessary a microdialysis catheter is placed in the
      peritoneal cavity prior to wound closure. Samples are collected every 4-hour. Samples will be
      analyzed continuously but the results will not be included in the clinical evaluation of the
      patient.

      A total of 20 patients will be included in this pilot study. The results of the intragastric
      and peritoneal microdialysis will be compared with the clinical course, s-lactate,
      radiological and pathological findings in each patient.
