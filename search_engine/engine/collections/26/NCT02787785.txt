      defibrillator or Conventional Medical Therapy (CMT). Randomization will be stratified by
      enrolling site, in a 2:1 (S-ICD:CMT) scheme. Length of follow-up for each subject will be
      dependent on the date of entry into the study, since all subjects will be followed to a
      common study termination date.
