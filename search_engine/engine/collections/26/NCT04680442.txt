    
      SCHOLAR-2 is a Phase II open-label randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome event
      ascertainment with a target sample size of 130.

      Control Group Recommendations for continuing or holding trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or
      trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) for the control group are guided by an adaptation of the 2008
      Canadian recommendations.

      Intervention Group The intervention group will continue to receive trastuzumab, pertuzumab,
      or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in the setting of asymptomatic decline in LVEF up to an LVEF
      of 40% as outlined in the criteria listed in Table 3. For reasons of practicality, in the
      intervention group, the first dose of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab-emtansine
      (T-DM1) after randomization can be administered up to 3 weeks late. This will allow time for
      the participant to be reviewed by a cardiologist and to receive ACE-I/angiotensin receptor
      blocker and/or beta-blocker, and for dose titration.

      Study assessments will occur:

        1. 3 weeks after randomization

        2. 6 weeks after randomization

        3. Follow-up at every 3 months thereafter until 12 months after the last dose of
           trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1)
