      fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS). AFIS consists of amikacin solution (AMS) and fosfomycin
      solution (FFS), delivered by aerosol to the lungs via the Investigational eFlow AFIS Inline
      System (AFIS Inline System) with tamper evident reservoir. Patients will be randomized to
      receive 5 days of treatment with either AFIS or placebo, followed by all patients receiving
      open label AFIS for five days. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in
      tracheal aspirate Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacterial density at the end of the
      5-day randomized course of study drug.
