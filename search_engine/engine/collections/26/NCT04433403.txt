      study. Clinical treatment does not involve , so it meets the ethical requirements. The
      clinical data, laboratory test results and imaging data of adult severe pneumonia patients in
      different hospitals in different cities are recorded. The pathogenic microorganism is
      detected by second-generation sequencing of lower respiratory tract sputum or alveolar lavage
      fluid samples, and the data were sorted out to draw the pathogenic microorganism spectrum of
      adult severe pneumonia in Liaoning area. It will be used to guide clinical empirical
      treatment.
