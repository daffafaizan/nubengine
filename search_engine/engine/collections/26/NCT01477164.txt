      Lifestyle interventions that can help maintain muscle mass and function can be beneficial to
      improve health and decrease the costs associated with loss of independence in the elderly.
      Muscle proteins accumulate damage during aging, which is suggested to lead to loss of
      function. The biological processes that remove damaged proteins and synthesis new proteins
      appear to be decreased with aging. Exercise is known to increase the processes that remove
      older and synthesis newer muscle proteins and may be an effect lifestyle intervention to
      improve muscle quality and function. Additionally, specific types of proteins appear to decay
      with age including contractile and mitochondrial proteins. Different types of exercise
      training can increase the making of specific proteins. The investigators will examine the
      ability for aerobic and resistance training to increase the quality of mitochondrial and
      contractile proteins between younger and older people.
