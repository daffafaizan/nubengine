      KLT-R test asses the concentration level of a person. Subjects will do this test at different
      simulated altitude level in the hypobaric chamber at the FAI in DÃ¼bendorf. Investigators'
      first hypothesis is that concentration level will be altered by hypoxia. The higher altitude
      the subjects are, the more the concentration would be altered. KLT-R performance would be
      impaired by hypoxia compare to sea level performance.

      The primary endpoint of this project is to investigate how KLT-R performance is affected by
      the different hypoxic conditions. KLT-R test will be passed nine times in total during the
      test visit. There will be a pre-test; a test at each of the conditions (3000m HH, 5500m HH,
      5500m NH and 5500m HN); between each condition at sea level (to have a new baseline before
      each condition) and a post-test at the end of the protocol. To avoid influence of fatigue,
      all conditions will be randomized.

      The second endpoint of this study is how the brain electrical activity is modulated by
      hypoxia. Micro-states also will be measure during hypobaric hypoxia conditions (3000m HH and
      5500m HH).
