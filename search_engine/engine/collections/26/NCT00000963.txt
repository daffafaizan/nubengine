      benefits of AZT in adults with AIDS and severe AIDS-related complex (ARC) appear to last for
      approximately 12 to 18 months, at which time most patients have progressive deterioration.
      Recently published literature has described a reduced sensitivity of HIV isolated from
      patients after prolonged AZT treatment. Although the clinical significance of this is
      unclear, it makes the development of new antiretroviral drugs important.

      Children who show AZT intolerance and/or progressive disease after 6 months of AZT therapy
      receive oral ddI at 1 of 2 doses for a minimum of 48 weeks, with a 48-week extension.
      Patients are seen for clinical and laboratory evaluations at scheduled times during the
      study. (Per 5/12/92 amendment, new patients will not be enrolled in the pharmacokinetics
      studies.) Per 10/31/94 amendment: Patients are eligible to receive blinded study drug for an
      additional 8-16 weeks after the final on-study visit, but no later than 2/15/95.
