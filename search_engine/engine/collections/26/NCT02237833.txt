      and drugs for circulatory support, especially the vasopressor norepinephrine. Fluids and
      drugs for circulatory support are to restore adequate organ perfusion. Inadequate oxygenation
      of the brain can give neurologic damage. Traditionally treatment is guided by surrogate
      markers like arterial and central venous pressure. Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method
      which measures cerebral saturation of oxygen, SCO2, and thereby expresses regional cerebral
      perfusion. By registering cerebral oxymetry on patients treated with vasopressors for septic
      shock we want to reveal if higher doses of vasopressor correlates with cerebral
      vasoconstriction and lower cerebral oximetry.
