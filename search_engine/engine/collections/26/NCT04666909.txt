      demonstrated efficacy in achieving lower blood pressure and improved hypertension control
      rates among Black men with high blood pressure. This program will reach 10-12 barbershops per
      year, working with 2-3 barbershops each quarter. Briefly, a trained barbershop navigator will
      work with each barbershop t o measure blood pressure on each adult customer who agrees, and
      to provide culturally-targeted education about high blood pressure and its consequences, and
      motivational interviewing-informed counseling about therapeutic lifestyle changes. For
      customers found to have high blood pressure, the navigator will also provide referral and
      navigation to a medical provider and, as appropriate, a local pharmacy. At all recruitment
      events, all study team members and potential participants must wear masks and practice social
      distancing when appropriate. Participants who do not have face masks should be offered masks
      for continued outreach participation. Study team members will also wear gloves and have hand
      sanitizer visible. When available, staff should wash hands frequently with soap and water. If
      this option is not available, staff should frequently use hand sanitizer.
