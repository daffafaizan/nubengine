      open surgical or endovascular repair.

      In 1983 the Elephant Trunk technique was introduced and has greatly facilitated the
      management of patients with extensive thoracic aortic disease.

      In recent years, this traditional open surgery has been combined with thoracic endovascular
      repair (TEVAR) and this is known as the 'hybrid' approach. Hybrid repairs, consisting of an
      open surgical repair combined with endovascular techniques.

      Further advancement in the types of prosthesis available has resulted in the evolution of the
      conventional ET technique into the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique. This utilises
      devices that incorporate both a traditional dacron graft (for open surgical treatment of the
      aortic arch) and a stented graft portion (for treatment of the descending thoracic aorta).
      The stented portion of the graft is introduced via an antegrade approach through the
      transected arch. The FET technique is now commonly used to treat patients with extensive
      thoracic or thoraco-abdominal aortic disease.

      Vascutek Ltd has developed the Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device (Plexus™ 4 and Ante-Flo™) for the
      repair or replacement of damaged or diseased vessels of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and
      descending thoracic aorta in cases of aneurysm and/or dissection. The Thoraflex™ Hybrid
      Device is one of the commercially available frozen elephant trunk prosthesis.

      Over 3000 Thoraflex™ Hybrid Devices have been sold and the current study seeks to provide
      further evidence of the continuing safety and effectiveness of the device.
