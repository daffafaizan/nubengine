      patients, which subsequently debilitates patient's quality of life. Although reducing pain is
      crucial to successful patient care in hemodialysis population, symptoms are often
      undertreated.Conventional pharmacological approaches are limited in dialysis population ,
      given their altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles and increased potential for
      adverse reactions. Acupuncture has been known to be beneficial in various chronic pain
      condition. As a non-pharmacologic intervention, it might be valuable for pain management in
      hemodialysis patients whose analgesic use are limited due to altered pharmacokinetics.
      However, little is known for the benefits of acupuncture for pain management in dialysis
      population. This study aims to determine whether acupuncture is a feasible, effective and
      safe therapeutic intervention for pain management in hemodialysis patients.
