      bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Group B undergo double bundle ACL
      reconstruction. At 3-6 weeks post operation, all the patients undergo 3-D MRI examination of
      both knees. The investigators reconstruct 3-D models of reconstructed ACL and native ACL, and
      compare the difference between single and double bundle graft.
