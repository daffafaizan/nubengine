      in PreSchool (MIPS) study. The MIPS study was initiated in 2016 and included preschool
      children (3-6 years of age) attending public preschools in the Municipality of Svendborg, in
      Denmark. A subset of the preschools included an intervention component, whose aim was
      optimization of motor skills. In this study, the children's screen media use was assessed via
      questionnaire and physical activity was assessed using two Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd.,
      Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) triaxial accelerometers - one placed at the hip and one
      at the lower back - at both baseline and at 18-month follow-up. Time spent in distinct
      activity types (sitting, moving, standing, biking, running, walking, and lying down) are
      determined from the acceleration measured with the thigh worn device. In addition, data on
      relevant covariates was also collected. Having data on both exposure and outcome at baseline
      and follow-up renders detailed longitudinal assessments possible. Furthermore, daily schedule
      (proxy based on reporting by parents and pedagogical personnel) information on the children
      introduces the possibility of domain-specific analyses of physical activity, as we can time
      annotate the data into different sections of the children's daily routine.
