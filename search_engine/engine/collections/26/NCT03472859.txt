      control group. It enables a comparison between two lasers; namely the KTP laser and the
      investigational PHOTOLASE laser. The split-face design eliminates the individual biases and
      the randomization eliminates the possible small variations in the symmetry of the
      telangiectasias on the face. The double-blinded assessment eliminates the physicians' and the
      subjects' subjective and objective bias.

      Methods: The subjects will be treated with a 532-nm green KTP laser and a 585-nm yellow
      PHOTOLASE laser; different laser on each side of a face. A total of one or two treatments
      will be given based on the response of the first treatment. The improvement of subjects'
      telangiectasia will be graded after the final treatment according to a 7-point Telangiectasia
      Grading Scale (TGS) by a blinded physician using images taken with Visia imaging system. The
      usability, reliability and treatment characteristics of PHOTOLASE laser will be qualitatively
      assessed by the treating physicians (not blinded).

      Objectives: The primary objective is to assess how the PHOTOLASE laser compares to the KTP
      laser in the treatment of facial telangiectasia in terms of the treatment outcomes. The
      secondary objective is to assess the usability, reliability and treatment characteristics of
      the PHOTOLASE laser from the perspective of the user.
