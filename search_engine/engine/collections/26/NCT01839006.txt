    
      To assess the clinical significance of supranormal differential renal function (DRF) in the
      recovery of unilateral hydronephrosis (HN) after surgery, pediatric patients who underwent
      pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) who showed supranormal DRF (> 55%)
      in the DTPA renography will be analyzed. Clinical parameters including age at the first
      visit, age at operation, gender, laterality, and follow-up period will be evaluated. To
      evaluate predictors of recovery from supranormal renal function according to the level of
      DRF, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses will be performed. Patients
      would be subcategorized into two groups; group A (DRF â‰¤60%) and group B (DRF >60%) in
      consideration of the mean value of preoperative DRF and each parameter of group A was
      compared to that of group B using independent sample's t test and chi square test.
      Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test will be used to determine the difference of recovery
      time of obstructed hydronephrosis in each parameter.
