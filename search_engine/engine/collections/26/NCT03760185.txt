      dilation size is important for operative eye procedures. Decreased pupil size is related to
      increased complication risks in eye surgery. By exploring novel pupil dilation techniques,
      there is a potential to counteract the effects of poor pupil dilation that is caused by
      medications such as alpha-blockers. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a syndrome
      characterized by a floppy iris (IFIS) and poor pupil dilation during surgery that is caused
      by BPH medications. This study evaluates treatment methods targeting IFIS.
