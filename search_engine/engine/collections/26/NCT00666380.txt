      enrolled to receive an investigational malaria vaccine. The vaccine is made of a malaria
      protein FMP010 mixed in the adjuvant AS01B. Since this vaccine has not yet been in humans,
      first, 5 volunteers will get a small (10 µg) dose of FMP010 in AS01B. If it is safe, then 20
      volunteers will get 50 µg FMP010 in AS01B. Vaccinations are given IM in the deltoid of the
      non-dominant arm, every month for 3 months. After each vaccination, the subjects will follow
      up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events. There will be blood draws to
      assess safety of the vaccine as well as the level of immune response generated to the
      vaccine.

      Upon receipt of preliminary safety results, the Kenya phase begins in which 30 volunteers who
      are randomized to receive either 50 µg FMP010 in AS01B (20) or the rabies vaccine (10).
      Vaccination and is on the same schedule as in the US phase and follow-up is for 112 days.
