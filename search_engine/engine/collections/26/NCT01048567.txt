    
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common adverse drug reaction, occurring in 5-35% of
      patients, and is of significant consequence to hospitalized patients. Patients who develop
      AAD are more likely to experience a longer hospital stay, incur higher medical costs, and
      develop other co-morbidities. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) accounts for
      approximately 15-25% of AAD cases and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in
      hospitalized geriatric patients.

      A preventative measure that has been suggested for AAD and CDI is the use of probiotics.
      Although probiotics have been used for a wide range of indications, including the prevention
      and treatment of AAD and CDI, there is lack of data regarding efficacy of these products.

      Hospitalized elderly patients are at significant risk of developing AAD and CDI and
      prevention of AAD and CDI in this population may contribute to a reduction in morbidity,
      length of hospital stay, medical costs, and potentially mortality.
