      direct with direct acting anti-HCV agents (DAAs), a fixed-dose combination of
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks with or without weight-based ribavirin. Before
      and after completion of the treatment course viral load assessments will be undertaken using
      low-cost laboratory monitoring for comparison to standard HCV viral load measurement. Up 800
      patients enrolled on treatment will be followed up at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks when Sustained
      Viral Response (SVR) will be determined. Safety monitoring will be undertaken at applicable
      visits for those on Ribavirin and all adverse events will be reported based on Good Clinical
      Practice (GCP). In addition to assessing cost outcomes, the project will assess HCV treatment
      efficacy in terms of SVR at 12 weeks after end of treatment ( defined as undetected HCV RNA
      or less than lower limit of detection), compare the cost of low cost viral assay platforms to
      standard of care, assess rates of ART initiation and virologic suppression of HIV-infected
      persons within the simplified HCV treatment model and impact of HIV co-infection in
      participants on the HCV treatment outcome of SVR12. The project will be conducted at 2
      treatment sites in Kiev.
