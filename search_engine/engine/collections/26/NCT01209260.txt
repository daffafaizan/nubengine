      catheter ablation. Historically, a conventional Brockenbrough needle has been used for this
      procedure to mechanically puncture the fossa ovalis, which has been well described in the
      literature.1, 2 Although generally safe, serious complications such as perforation of the
      atrial wall or aorta can occur.3, 4

      Previous studies have evaluated the feasibility and safety of radiofrequency (RF) energy
      applied to a conventional needle as a technique to access the left atrium, particularly in
      patients with a repeat procedure, fibrotic septum or aneurysmal septum.5, 6 As a result of
      this earlier work, a special proprietary device has been designed. The NRG RF needle (Baylis
      Medical Inc., Montreal, Canada), uses radiofrequency energy emitted from the needle tip to
      aid in transseptal access. Despite limited literature to support its superiority and
      safety7-9compared to the conventional approach, the new device has become adopted in some
      electrophysiology procedures involving a transseptal puncture.
