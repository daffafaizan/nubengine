      protects against severe malaria in the Dogon ethnic group of Mali, West Africa. We believe
      that abnormal display of major parasite virulence antigens (PfEMP-1) on the surface of HbC
      erythrocytes accounts for this protection. Whether this mechanism mediates protection by
      other mutant erythrocytes remains to be investigated. The principal objective of the current
      protocol has been to investigate whether HbC also protects against severe malaria in the
      Malinke of Kela, which historically gave rise to the Dogon. Our preliminary data from
      protocol #02-I-N285 suggest that HbC but not HbS (sickle trait) protects the young Malinke
      children of Kela, with the opposite being true for the Malinke children of Kangaba, a nearby
      village. To confirm these novel preliminary findings and to investigate candidate mechanisms
      of protection, our ongoing case-control study requires an additional 150 severe malaria
      patients who are less than 5 years old, of Malinke ethnicity, reside in either Kangaba or
      Kela villages, and have normal G6PD activity. Children less than 11 years old and diagnosed
      with either severe (case) or uncomplicated (control) malaria will be tested for
      hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency. Severe and uncomplicated malaria patients will be
      treated with parenteral quinine or oral artemisinin combination therapies, respectively,
      which are standard of care in Mali. Principal outcome measures will include a comparison of
      the frequency of HbC, HbS, and G6PD deficiency between cases and controls; with odds ratios
      and 95% confidence intervals determining the degree and statistical significance of severe
      malaria protection.
