      degeneration of the polymers during passage through the narrow valve leading to turbulences.
      After written consent and an extended anamnesis of existing coagulopathy, we take three blood
      samples in these patients: before surgery, on the day after surgery and 4 weeks after
      surgery. We determine von Willebrand factor in lab and by a point-of-care platelet function
      analyzer (Multiplate TM). We measure amount of mediastinal drainage after 24 hours and blood
      product consumption in these patients.
