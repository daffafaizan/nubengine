      known to be multifactorial and affected by a combination of environmental, teratogenic, and
      genetic causes. Furthermore, both genetic and environmental factors have been proposed to act
      as disease modifiers, accounting for a wide variation in phenotypic expression and clinical
      outcomes of these disorders. To date however, few specific genetic or environmental causative
      factors have been identified, nor is it even known what proportion of cases involve genetic
      factors.
