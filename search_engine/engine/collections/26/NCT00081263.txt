    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of celecoxib to induce complete remission (or partial regression
      to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1) of CIN 2/3 or CIN 3 as evaluated in the
      post-treatment excisional biopsy.

      II. To determine the toxicity of celecoxib (400 mg once daily) as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events in this patient population of women with CIN 2/3 or
      CIN 3.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether treatment with celecoxib changes the number of quadrants containing
      acetowhite lesions as determined through colposcopic examination.

      II. To determine the efficacy of celecoxib treatment in changing human papillomavirus (HPV)
      viral load in cervical cells.

      III. To examine the association of histologic response; HPV viral load; lesion size;
      proliferation index (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [Ki67]), apoptosis index (terminal
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labelin [TUNEL] assay),
      angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in
      tissue; the amount of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in serum before and
      after treatment; and the amount of celecoxib present in serum during treatment. Cervical
      cytology karyometry will be assessed as a potential marker for regression IV. To determine
      the feasibility of digital imaging, web-based review of histopathology in a Gynecologic
      Oncology Group (GOG) study.

      V. To compare the diagnoses of the web-based review of histopathology with the diagnoses of
      GOG's standard procedure.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral celecoxib once daily for 14-18 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 14-18 weeks.
