      in Australia. Lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) is a painful musculoskeletal condition
      that is often treated in primary care. Seven out of every 1000 patients seeing their general
      medical practitioner do so for this condition, though most are not tennis related. On average
      10-30% of sufferers take 12 weeks of absenteeism from work and the condition may last 6-48
      months.

      Two popular treatment options that are commonly prescribed for the management of lateral
      epicondylalgia are manual therapy/therapeutic exercise and corticosteroid injections. To date
      there is little evidence that supports manual therapy/therapeutic exercise. This lack of
      evidence is largely due to the small number of studies of physiotherapy treatments, most of
      which are of poor quality. The small number of studies of manual therapy contrasts with the
      larger number of studies of corticosteroid injections, which show that corticosteroid
      injections are beneficial in the short term (3-6 weeks), but they are associated with
      significantly greater recurrence rates and offer no advantage in the long term (12 months).
      The efficacy of a manual therapy and therapeutic exercise programme compared to that of
      corticosteroid injections is unknown at this stage.

      This randomised controlled trial will evaluate the role of manual therapy and therapeutic
      exercise in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. The factors associated with success or
      failure of these common treatment options for lateral epicondylalgia will also be examined. A
      tangible outcome of this project will be the development of clinical guidelines for the most
      effective method of treating lateral epicondylalgia.
