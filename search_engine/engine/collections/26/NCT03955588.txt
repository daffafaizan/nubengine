      diagnosis. It allows a microscopic examination for any structural abnormalities of chromosome
      with a turn-around time of 2 to 3 weeks and it is also labour intensive. Array comparative
      genome hybridisation (aCGH) provides a platform for a higher resolution analysis of
      chromosomal aberrations in a shorter period of time. The effectiveness of its application in
      prenatal diagnosis has been examined (Callaway, Shaffer, Chitty, Rosenfeld, & Crolla, 2013).
      The main clinical limitation lies on the difficult interpretation of certain copy number
      variants (CNV). Our previous study has demonstrated an increase diagnostic yield of 3.2%
      using aCGH over conventional cytogenetics in the first-tier test study and by 6% as a further
      test in a cohort of fetuses with ultrasound abnormality and normal karyotype findings (Kan et
      al., 2014). This finding were consistent with the overall reported of 5.2% to 10% increased
      detection rate by other studies (de Wit et al., 2014; Hillman et al., 2013; Hillman et al.,
      2011). Various authorities have also approved the use of aCGH as an adjunct diagnostic tool
      in prenatal cases with fetal ultrasound abnormalities (American College of Obstetricians &
      Gynecologists, 2013; Novelli et al., 2012).
