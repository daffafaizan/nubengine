      1000 people in Finland suffer from SAH, their average age being under 50 years. SAH has a
      mortality rate of 12 % acutely and 40 % of patients die within a month from admission to
      hospital. In addition, 30 % of the surviving patients remain with neurological deficits. Most
      survivors of the primary insult suffer from secondary injury during the first 2-3 weeks from
      the insult.

      Despite the advances in neurosurgical and -radiological techniques and intensive care, the
      mortality and morbidity rates in SAH have not changed in recent years. There is still only
      limited understanding of the mechanisms of secondary insults causing brain injury after SAH.

      In this study the investigators are aiming to clarify the timescale and mechanisms
      contributing to the secondary insults. The investigators also explore usability of novel
      biomarkers to guide treatment of the patients suffering from SAH.
