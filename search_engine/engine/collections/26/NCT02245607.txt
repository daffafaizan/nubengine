    
      This is a 12 week randomized study to compare Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) versus
      Recreational Therapy (RT) in Latino clinical high risk individuals in the US and Mexico.

      Study participants will be measured 3 times, at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks on all outcome
      measures. Study hypothesis: Study participants receiving CCT will show significant
      improvement at 12 and 24 weeks compared to baseline in 1) Neurocognition using the Global
      Cognitive Index z score derived from the MATRICS neurocognitive domain scores, 2) Functional
      Capacity as assessed by the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA/UPSA-Adolescent),
      3) Self-Rated Functioning as measured by the Specific Level of Functioning Scale (SLoF) and
      4) Clinical symptom ratings as measured by the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) total score
      when compared to subjects receiving RT training across study time.
