    
      Sixty naive patients with HIV and confirmed hepatitis C who are co-enrolled in another AACTG
      antiretroviral study that involves the testing of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral
      Therapy) are entered on this prospective study. Patients who are defined as naive have never
      received specific, active antiretroviral agents that sustain viral suppression below the
      limit of detection (500 copies/ml) or have received those agents for only a very limited
      time. HAART is defined as therapy which is likely to result in HIV-1 RNA plasma levels less
      than 500 copies/ml for at least 16 weeks. Plasma is collected and evaluated during the study
      for additional quantitative measurements: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) by HCV RNA PCR and HIV-1
      RNA levels. All evaluations for HIV-1 RNA are obtained from the co-enrolled study at the
      following time points: Pre-entry, entry, at least 2 measurements before Week 16, Week 16, and
      at least 1 measurement after Week 16.
