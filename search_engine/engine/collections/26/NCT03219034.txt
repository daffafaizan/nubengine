      designs, mid-line traction versus bilateral thrust. From a clinical perspective, it is
      important to know which design is superior and should be the 'treatment of choice' for
      improving airway function and sleep quality. These two designs differ in their protrusive
      mechanisms that are categorized in general under four main types: bilateral compression,
      bilateral thrust, midline compression and mid-line traction. Although the two designs
      considered in this proposal have undergone the most rigorous testing individually, well
      controlled 'head-to-head' trials as proposed here have not been conducted to determine their
      efficacy within a single test population.
