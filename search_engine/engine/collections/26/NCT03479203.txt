      aerosol on vascular function in healthy, non-smokers and 2) to examine and compare vascular
      function in healthy smokers chronically exposed, at baseline and after 12 months, to
      nicotinized e-cigarette aerosol versus conventional cigarettes as compared to age, gender and
      body mass index-matched nonsmokers. Vascular function (microvascular reactivity via dynamic
      femoral oximetry, arterial hyperemia, femoral artery flow-mediated dilation, central
      pulse-wave velocity, neurovascular reactivity) will be assessed as part of a single
      integrated MRI protocol. The outcome of the project will provide new insight into the acute
      and chronic effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in terms of surrogate markers of
      endothelial dysfunction (EDF), the prime promoter of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
      and aid toward establishment of future public health advisories.
