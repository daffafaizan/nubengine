    
      Multicentric (15 centres), prospective, randomised, single-blinded phase III pivotal study in
      patients undergoing a colonoscopy. Gut cleansing will be performed using 2 litres of NRL994
      gut lavage solution with 1 litre (or more) of extra clear liquids or 2 x 45 ml of a sodium
      phosphate solution plus 2 litres (or more) of extra clear liquids the day before colonoscopy.
      Patients requiring a morning colonoscopy who fulfil the inclusion criteria, will be
      randomised. One of the two tested products will be delivered by a pharmacist, blindly from
      the gastroenterologist. The assigned product will be taken the day before the coloscopy
      according to the information leaflet. Efficacy of the two tested preparations will be
      measured on video-tape record of each colonoscopy by a final grading i.e. "the overall
      quality of colonoscopy prep" by an gastroenterologist expert. A standardised patient
      questionnaire administered by a nurse on the morning before colonoscopy will assess clinical
      tolerance and acceptability (satisfaction) of the prep. A baseline blood sampling will be
      withdrew before intake of the preparation and one more blood sample will be performed after
      the intake on the morning, before the coloscopy.

      After the coloscopy, as the gastroenterologist gives the result of the coloscopy , a last
      visit is performed.
