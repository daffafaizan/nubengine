      of thirst mechanisms or ﬂuid loss from the intestinal and respiratory tracts. The use of
      diuretics can lead to dehydration too. The risk of dehydration induced by acute or chronical
      diseases is increased in older people because of the reduced capacity to maintain a proper
      fluid balance. Lower muscle mass, reduced kidney function, physical and cognitive
      disabilities, blunted thirst, and polytherapy are recognized as main factors for dehydration
      risk in older people.For these reasons, coordinated efforts are necessary to develop
      comprehensive assessment tool to monitor hydration in hospitalised older adults. We need to
      develop a pathway of screening to detect early stage dehydration in older patients in order
      to correct it precociously. Presently, no standardized clinical dehydration assessment method
      exists and there are relatively few papers investigating hydration status. A new tool was
      created: the Geriatric Dehydration Screening Tool - Modified doesn't require laboratory
      parameters, and thus its use is feasible outside hospital settings. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Geriatric Dehydration Screening Tool - Modified in
      the assessment of the hydration status of hospitalized older population.
