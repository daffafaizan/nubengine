      school-age children with HLHS. The general approach of the proposed research is confirmatory
      study/hypothesis testing. The hypothesis (neurodevelopmental outcome of children with HLHS is
      inversely correlated with cerebral oximetry values as measured by NIRS in the 48 hours
      following the Norwood operation) was formulated based on a meticulous review of the
      literature, which clearly demonstrates a substantial prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      deficits in children with HLHS who have undergone surgical palliation. The methodologies for
      measuring developmental outcome are highly reproducible and have been validated in this
      population.
