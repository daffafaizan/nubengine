      Wii Fit balance platform for a period of twenty minutes or greater per day (at the discretion
      of the specialist physiotherapist) during their standard rehabilitation program. These
      balance training exercises will be in addition to those already used in the standard
      rehabilitation program, but will not add to the total therapy session time. Activities on the
      device will be chosen by the therapist based on the subjects' current abilities and their
      phase of training. More complicated tasks will be given as the subject progresses. The
      therapist will intervene and provide instruction / correction if the subject is using unsafe
      technique or poor technique (postures, positioning strategies that would not be condoned in
      the regular training program).

      The device is a stable, level platform 5.5 cm from the floor. Subjects stand on the device
      and may use gait aids if indicated.

      Standard practice involves intensive training of the subject by the same specialist
      physiotherapist but without the use of the Wii Fit platform.
