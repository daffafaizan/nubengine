        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and duration of prolonged topotecan as maintenance
           in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
           cancer with complete clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral topotecan twice daily for 21 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients who tolerate course 1 may receive an escalated dose of topotecan for subsequent
      courses. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose tolerated by the majority of the
      patients.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
