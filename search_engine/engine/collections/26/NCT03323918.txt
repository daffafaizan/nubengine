      the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of the present
      project is to investigate the brain activity changes that are at the basis of the changes
      observed in the children's behaviour. More specifically, the investigators will assess the
      effect of Project ImPACT, a parent-implemented intervention, which teaches parents techniques
      to stimulate the social-communicative abilities of their children.

      The intervention is suitable for preschoolers with a diagnosis of ASD and consists of 18
      sessions of maximum 2 hours each, one session per week, delivered by trained therapists of
      the home guidance services in Flanders. Children with a diagnosis of ASD (or children who are
      suspected of ASD) between 1,5 and 4 years old and their parents will participate in the
      study. They will be randomly assigned to the ImPACT intervention or treatment as usual. The
      investigators will assess the effect of the intervention on the children's
      social-communicative abilities, and on the neural and biological correlates of these
      abilities.

      The families will be invited to come to the Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogical Sciences at
      three time points: before the start of the intervention, immediately after the end of the
      intervention (which is expected to last 18 weeks) and 12 weeks after the end of the
      intervention.
