      mindfulness meditation and yoga, has advanced in domains both clinical and basic, motivated
      by burgeoning evidence of their efficacy for remediating psychopathology and augmenting
      well-being and resilience. However, much of this research has examined the effects of
      scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the course of several
      weeks. Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most common and arguably
      most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered Contemplative Applications
      (apps) for Well-being (CWAs). The proposed study will examine the use and impact of an app
      delivered to populations facing extreme time demands.
