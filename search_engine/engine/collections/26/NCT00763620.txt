      cultures for patient with mild serious infectious pneumonia admitted in intensive care unit
      and non intubated. Invasive procedure may worsen respiratory distress and non invasive
      procedure such expectorated sputum culture is not enough effective. The purpose of the study
      is to assess the microbiological diagnosis capacity of a new technique for taking samples
      from the lower respiratory tract: mini bronchoalveolar lavage performed by naso tracheal way
      through a suction catheter.Each consecutive patient admitted in intensive care unit for a
      community acquired or nosocomial pneumonia and not requiring intubation and mechanical
      ventilation will be included. Written informed consent by patient himself will be required.
      For each patient, after the introduction of a suction catheter, an endotracheal aspiration
      will be performed. Then, the mini bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed through the
      suction catheter with a specific catheter.The whole time of the procedure is about ten
      minutes.Expectorated sputum will also be ordered for each patient.This study is a pilot and
      prospective study.
