      Participants will all undergo pre-biopsy mp-MRI and mp-USS of the prostate. Only men with
      positive scans will undergo prostate biopsy. The order in which lesions discovered on mp-MRI
      or on mp-USS are sampled will be randomised. All biopsies will be taken via the transperineal
      route in a single procedure. Comparison will be drawn between biopsy results of lesions
      detected by mp-USS with those lesions detected by mp-MRI. Consideration will be given as to
      whether a lesion detected by one imaging modality is the same abnormality as one detected by
      the other imaging modality, in the same patient. Analysis will be carried out at both the
      level of the lesion and the whole prostate. Men without suspicious lesions on either imaging
      modality will not proceed to biopsy.
