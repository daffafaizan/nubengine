    
      This is an OL proof of concept study of adjunctive GNX treatment in patients with a confirmed
      clinical diagnosis of TSC and/or a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. The trial
      consists of two parts: Part A consists of a 4-week baseline period followed by a 12-week
      treatment period (4-week titration and 8-week maintenance). For patients not continuing in
      the 24-week OLE period (Part B), a 2-week taper period followed by a 2-week safety period
      would follow. The main difference between Part A and Part B is the length of treatment, less
      frequent assessments, and the ability to alter drug doses (both GNX and other antiepileptic
      drug [AED] treatments which includes initiating and stopping other medications) based on
      investigator evaluation of the patient's clinical course during Part B. Patients with a
      seizure frequency reduction during the 12-week treatment period in Part A compared to
      baseline may continue into Part B ("OLE eligible"), to assess long-term safety, efficacy and
      tolerability in patients with TSC-related Epilepsy.
