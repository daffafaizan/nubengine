      cancer in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In HIV-infected patients with KS in developed
      settings, the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated
      with regression of the tumor, in many but not all cases, even in the absence of conventional
      chemotherapy. However, it is not known which specific antiretroviral drugs or regimens are
      critical to convey HAART's anti-KS effect. In particular, it is not known whether the anti-KS
      effects of protease inhibitors (PI) in vitro and in animal models translate into improved
      clinical outcomes as compared to non-PI-based HAART regimens. To address this, we will
      determine whether a PI-based HAART regimen (lopinavir/ritonavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir)
      is superior to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based HAART regimen
      (efavirenz plus emtricitabine/tenofovir) in promoting the regression of KS tumor burden in
      persons with AIDS-related KS in sub-Saharan Africa. We will enroll 224 patients with
      AIDS-related KS in Kampala, Uganda, randomly assign them to either a PI-based HAART or an
      NNRTI-based HAART regimen, and observe them for one year to determine the response in their
      KS to therapy.
