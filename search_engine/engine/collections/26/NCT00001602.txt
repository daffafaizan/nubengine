      determining pathophysiological basis of this disorder. This study will combine two approaches
      to examine genetic aspects of stuttering, linkage in families, and candidate gene analysis.
      Linkage studies will be completed using adult individuals who are diagnosed as persons who
      stutter and those who can be judged as never having stuttered from one or more families with
      large numbers of affected individuals within several generations. Candidate gene analyses
      will also be carried out in adults who stutter to determine if the frequency of polymorphisms
      for certain neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes differ from control populations. In
      addition, given the heterogeneity of the population of adults who stutter, other phenotypic
      probes such as motor skills, language skills, neuropsychological abilities and psychological
      responses to stuttering will also be assessed in order to identify subgroups in which the
      phenotype expression of the gene may differ.
