      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of laser light therapy using a fixed dose of
           HPPH in patients with dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, or T1 squamous cell
           carcinoma of the larynx.

      Secondary

        -  To determine response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of laser light therapy.

      Patients undergo photodynamic therapy comprising HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1 and laser light
      therapy to the tumor on day 2. Approximately 8 weeks later, patients with a partial response,
      no response, or a geographical miss may receive a second course of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and
      then periodically thereafter.
