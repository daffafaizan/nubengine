      catheter ablation, however contiguous and transmural lesions are not always guaranteed.

      Even though, catheter ablation is now being offered for symptomatic persistent AF, recurrence
      after the index procedure in such a persistent AF substrate is not unusual. Redo-catheter
      ablation is routinely offered for such patients; however long term success still remains low.
      Non-pulmonary vein triggers are often targeted in such redo-catheter ablation procedures;
      though this approach remains controversial. More recently, the Wolf Mini-Maze procedure has
      been utilized with promising results.

      This study proposes to randomize a group of persistent AF patients to undergo either catheter
      ablation or the surgical mini-maze procedure with left atrial appendage (LAA) ligation
