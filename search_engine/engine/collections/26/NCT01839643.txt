    
      Each volunteer will participate for 3 menstrual cycles, beginning with one menstrual control
      cycle without treatment, following by one menstrual cycle with meloxicam ring administration,
      and finishing with another control menstrual cycle.

      Meloxicam will be administered in the second menstrual cycle via a vaginal ring in two doses
      of 2.4 g or 3.0 g/ring. The safety of the vaginal ring and the absorption of meloxicam will
      be assessed. Also the effect on follicular development and if it maintains ovarian cyclicity,
      as shown in a recent study with oral administration, will be assessed.
