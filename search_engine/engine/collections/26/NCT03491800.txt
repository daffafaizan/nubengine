      member who accompanies the patient into the examination room at a visit). While our study
      primarily will target HF dyads, if the investigators encounter recruitment difficulties,
      unaccompanied HF patients (i.e., HF patients who do not have a family member who can
      participate in the study with them) will also be enrolled.

      Procedures (methods): Single group pre-post study design.

      After providing informed consent, HF patients or dyads will receive the prompt list while in
      the waiting room prior to their visit. Completing the prompt list involves two steps. In step
      1, participants will independently select from a predetermined list of questions (within
      topic areas) that they would like to ask their health care provider. The questions/topics
      were developed by other HF patients and family members in another phase of the study. Also,
      patients will be asked to choose behaviors they would like their family member to engage in
      during the visit (e.g., write down the provider's instructions, ask questions), from a
      structured list developed based on prior research. Family members will identify which
      behaviors they are willing to perform. In step 2, patients or dyads will collectively
      prioritize which questions/topics to discuss during the visit. Each dyad member will receive
      a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before their appointment.

      All visits will be audio-taped to assess effects of the intervention on communication
      behaviors during the visit. All participants will complete a questionnaire at baseline, 2
      days after the audio-taped clinic visit, and at 3 months.
