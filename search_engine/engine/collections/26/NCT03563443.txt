      prior to morphological changes in cells and tissues, therefore molecular biological test is
      more sensitive to detect cancer at early stage. Genomic imprinting is one kind of epigenetic
      regulation that controls gene expression. In detail, a copy of gene on the certain maternal
      or paternal allele is silenced through methylation, while the other acts normally. This kind
      of genes are named imprinting genes. Loss of imprinting and Copy number variation (LOI & CNV)
      is epigenetic change that the silenced copy of an imprinting gene is activated through
      demethylation. Numerous studies indicate that LOI exists ubiquitously in cancers and precede
      morphological changes. In contrast, LOI rarely happens in normal somatic cells. Therefore,
      the methylation status of imprinting genes can act as a biomarker to detect and analyze the
      abnormal cells.

      The investigators will develop a couple of common LOI to establish a predictive diagnostic
      LOI panel in urine with optimal and robust efficacy in diagnosis of bladder cancer by
      analyzing LOI in urine from bladder cancer patients and control group that without any tumor
      in urinary system or other organs. Moreover, the changes of LOI in urine collected before and
      1 year after transurethral resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NIMBC) will also
      be monitored. External consistency validation will be performed on subsequent urine from
      patients and control participants collection.
