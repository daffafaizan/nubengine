      become an important focus of the NCI's 2015 goal of eliminating suffering and death due to
      cancer, although very little is known about the factors that influence development of frank
      malignancy in those with high risk benign/precursor conditions. The Radiation Epidemiology
      and Biostatistics Branches of the NCI propose to evaluate the contribution of inherited
      genetic variation to benign pre-malignant breast conditions, and to subsequent breast cancer
      risk in women diagnosed with such conditions, in the Breast Cancer Serum Bank, a unique
      biospecimen resource housed at NCI since 1995. Premenopausal participants (N=2632) biopsied
      at an average age of 27 in 1977-1987, (many diagnosed with high risk benign breast conditions
      (moderate/florid breast hyperplasia and atypia)) were interviewed and provided a blood
      sample. Participant biopsy reports will be obtained for review and recoding, and participants
      will be traced for vital status and breast cancer development (expected n = 240 cases).
      Variants in genes related to hormone metabolism and cell signaling, processes implicated in
      the development of premalignant breast conditions, and in genes associated with cell cycle
      control and apoptosis, and thus possibly related to progression to breast cancer among women
      with premalignant breast conditions will be assessed at the NCI Central Genotyping Facility.
      We have a remarkable opportunity in this study to address scientific questions regarding
      breast carcinogenesis mechanisms at relatively little cost. Greater comprehension of the
      influence of inherited factors on distinct steps in the biological pathway, first from normal
      tissue to benign high risk breast tumors, and then hence the breast cancer, should contribute
      to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that shape breast cancer development, and
      holds promise for the discovery and delivery of sound risk-adapted interventions for women
      with high risk premalignant conditions.
