      referred early to specialized palliative care teams, they had improved QOL, symptom control,
      and greater satisfaction with their cancer care. Such routine specialized palliative care
      intervention, while effective, may be challenging to enact broadly with widespread shortages
      of palliative care physicians. STEP systematically identifies patients with the greatest
      need, using symptom screening at every outpatient visit, with triage and targeted referral to
      palliative care. This could reduce resource use while directing care to the most vulnerable.

      Patients will be recruited from Breast, Lung, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, and Gynecology
      medical oncology clinics. Consenting participants will complete questionnaires measuring
      outcomes of QOL, symptom control, depression, and satisfaction with care at recruitment, 2, 4
      and 6 months. The objectives of the study are to assess the feasibility of conducting a
      larger phase III trial and to collect information to assist in trial planning and sample size
      calculation for such a trial. Feasibility criteria are: i) ≥100 patients accrued in 12
      months; ii) ≥70% complete screening for ≥70% of visits; iii) ≥60% of those for whom a call is
      triggered meet at least once with the EPC team; iv) ≥60% complete measures at each endpoint.
