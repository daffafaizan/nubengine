      nocturnal oxygen therapy and adaptive servo ventilation(ASV) are recognized as effective
      modalities. However,in fact, majority of CHF patients are complicated not only with CSA but
      with obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Recently, Philips developed Bipap® auto SV Advanced for
      such patients. It has auto-CPAP function as the modality of OSAS, in addition to ASV
      function. The present study is prospective randomised study to compare the effects of
      nocturnal oxygen therapy and Bipap® auto SV Advanced.
