      Insomnia (CBT-I) for improving sleep and related functional outcomes in Veterans with
      psychosis and insomnia.

      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I for reducing insomnia severity in Veterans with
      psychosis and insomnia.

      Hypothesis 1: CBT-I participants, as compared to those in an active control condition, will
      show significantly greater reductions on the Insomnia Severity Index at post-treatment and at
      a 6-month follow-up.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I for improving the functioning of Veterans with
      psychosis and insomnia. Hypothesis 2: CBT-I participants, as compared to those in an active
      control condition, will show significantly greater increases in mental and physical health
      functioning on the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey at post-treatment and at a 6-month
      follow-up.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the process that underlies the relationship between insomnia severity and
      functioning in Veterans with psychosis and insomnia.

      Hypothesis 3: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at post-treatment
      will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at week 5 of treatment.

      Hypothesis 4: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at the 6-month
      follow-up will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at immediate post-treatment.

      Exploratory Aim: Explore whether psychiatric symptoms 1) moderate the impact of CBT-I on
      insomnia and functioning and/or 2) change as a result of participation in CBT-I.
