    
      In this prospective clinical trial, patients who present to the breast cancer clinic at one
      of the primary sites with suspected breast cancer requiring MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosis
      or staging will be screened consecutively. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be
      approached for consent to participate in the study. Upon consent, each participant will
      undergo a teleoperative breast biopsy at their local site using the IGAR-Breast system, while
      the radiologist operates the system from a remote site. All consenting participants will be
      followed up for the assessment of the secondary outcome measure.

      A total of 5-10 participants will be consented for the pilot investigation.

      Each individual subject's participation is estimated to last approximately one week post
      procedure, with the trial itself expected to be completed within one year of its start date.
