      volunteers in whom air hunger is induced experimentally in the lab. However, how much
      reduction varies among individuals. It is not known if the way the mist is breathed
      (slow/deep or fast/shallow) or the size of the droplets in the mist (large or small) can
      explain the variation in relief. Both of these factors can influence the site of deposition
      of the aerosol in the lungs

      In this study the relief of air hunger (induced by hypercapnia and constrained ventilation)
      will be compared when furosemide is inhaled quickly or slowly, and when the mist has large or
      small droplets. 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited. After a practice session, the 'air
      hunger' test will be performed before and after 4ml of a 10mg/ml solution of furosemide
      (40mg). This will be repeated on 4 separate test days using a different method of inhaling
      the furosemide on each day.
