      increase in the incidence of Intravascular disseminated coagulopathy. The development of
      coagulopathy in the context of tumor resection is associated with poor results. Transfusion
      decision during the course of neurosurgical surgery offers benefits such as increased oxygen
      carrying capacity but may increase the risk associated with transfusions such as blood
      infections, hemolysis, lung injury and immunosuppression. The information available on
      tranexamic acid used in neurosurgery is little, therefore this opens up new alternatives in
      the techniques of reducing intraoperative bleeding.

      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that blocks the binding of plasminogen to the
      fibrin surface. It has been used to reduce blood loss during coronary revascularization,
      liver resection, obstetrics and orthopedic procedures. Tranexamic acid intraoperatively has
      been shown to reduce blood loss up to 45%. The primary concern when administering an
      antifibrinolytic drug is the potential increased incidence of thromboembolic events. There is
      no actual data on the utility of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss in brain tumors
      resection surgery.

      We want to compare Tranexamic Acid to Saline solution(Placebo) to see whether Tranexamic ACid
      Administration will reduce blood loss during brain tumor resection. Reduction in transfusion
      requirements will lead to reduced costs and possible reduction in complications of blood
      transfusion and perioperative incidents.
