      women give birth by Cesarean Section according to the 2014 Demographic and Health survey.
      Despite the rising incidence of Cesarean section, controversy about the optimal surgical
      method of Cesarean section still remains. Obstetricians use a variety of surgical techniques
      to reduce post-operative adhesions after Cesarean section, such as parietal peritoneal
      closure and rectal muscle approximation. They believe that adhesions may result from exposure
      of an opened intraperitoneal cavity to the subfascial space which can be prevented by
      approximating the rectus muscle or closing the parietal peritoneum. In addition, rectus
      muscle approximation may be considered to reduce the risk of persistent rectus muscle
      diastasis. However, different studies showed a controversy and inconsistency in the practice
      of rectus muscle re-approximation among surgeons. Some obstetricians agree that the rectus
      muscles can regain their right anatomic position by themselves and that suturing them
      together does not add any benefit. Even though, one of their main concern against rectus
      muscle approximation is its potential association with increased post operative pain, hence
      the importance of this prospective randomized controlled study. The aim of the investigator's
      study is to assess the effect of rectus muscle re-approximation by 3 interrupted simple
      sutures versus tighting it by 3 vertical mattress sutures during cesarean delivery on
      postoperative pain.
