    
      5-Azacitidine(5-AZA) is the most promising drug for treatment MDSs. When administered at a
      dose of 75mg/m2/day subcutaneously for 7 days, every 28 days (every month), 5-Aza produces
      high rates of trilineage responses, reduces the risk of progression to AML in high-risk MDS
      and improves the QoL. The use of 5-Aza in the earlier phases of MDS could reduce the
      proliferative advantage of MDS clone and favour the regrowth of normal hematopoiesis. Other
      doses or schedules could improve its efficacy. Gene expression profile studies in MDS
      patients who are sensitive or resistant to 5-AZA are lacking and data coming from these
      studies could be useful to clarify the mechanisms of 5-azacitidine and optimize the therapy.

      Objectives of the study

      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy (hematologic response) and toxicity of 5-Aza five days monthly
           treatment schedule in patients with low-risk MDS (IPSS 0-INT1)

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate QoL by the FACT-An questionnaire

        -  To evaluate time to progression of MDS;

        -  To evaluate the gene expression profile of MDS patients sensitive or resistant to 5-AZA;

        -  To evaluate oncostatin M, interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 levels in the responders and
           non responders.

      Azacitidine will be given at a dose of 75mg/sqm subcutaneous daily for 5 consecutive days
      every 28 days (every month) for a total of 8 courses. 5-Aza dosages will be adjusted as
      follows:

      Patients' care and other medications

        -  RBC are transfused to maintain a Hb level > 90 g/L, or whenever indicated.

        -  Platelets are transfused if platelet count is < 20 x 109/L, or whenever indicated.

        -  EPO is not allowed during the trial time (8 months= 8 courses of 5-AZA therapy)

        -  Granulocyte or granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF or GM-CSF) are
           allowed in case of severe neutropenia and/or systemic infection.

        -  Antibiotics and antifungals per os are given in prophylaxis if neutrophils <0.5 x 109
           /L.

        -  Antibiotics are given i.v. in case of fever (> 38°C for > 24 h) or whenever indicated.

        -  Antifungals are given i.v. in case of fever persisting for more than 5 days of
           antibiotics i.v. or whenever indicated.

        -  Other experimental drugs or agents are not allowed.

        -  If another experimental drug or agent will be administered, the patient must discontinue
           the treatment with 5-AZA, and goes off-study.
