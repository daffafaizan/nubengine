      to take a fall final exam will receive a daily probiotic combination, individual probiotic,
      or placebo for 6 weeks. Questionnaires will assess gastrointestinal symptoms, immune health,
      stress and stress management, quality of life, diet, adverse events, and compliance. In a
      subset of subjects, stool samples will be collected at baseline and at week 5 of the
      intervention (the week before final exams) to characterize microbial communities.
