      will be period 1, when base line fasting blood samples will be collected on day 1 and 8. For
      the next 28 days (period 2 or intervention period) subjects will supplement their diets with
      280 g/d of pitted Bing cherries by replacing an equivalent amount of carbohydrate calories.
      We will prefer that the subjects split the cherries into three equal portions and consume one
      with each meal; however, this will not be mandatory. Subjects will be asked to record all
      foods and drinks consumed for three 24-hr periods during the study. Fasting blood samples
      will be drawn on study days 22 and 36 (14 and 28 day after the start of cherry consumption).
      The third period of 28 days will be post-intervention, when the subjects will return to their
      normal diets without cherries. Post-intervention blood samples will be drawn on study day 64.
      All blood draws will follow a 12-hour fast. Blood samples will be processed within one hour
      of draw and the plasma stored frozen in different aliquots, until analysis.
