      than 65 years of age. Drug therapy for atrial fibrillation is not effective or not tolerated
      in many elderly patients, for both rate or rhythm strategies. Preliminary data from AVN
      ablation and pacemaker therapy demonstrated this strategy is highly effective in controlling
      symptoms among patients who have failed numerous drug therapy. Quality of life is improved
      while hospital admission and office visits are reduced.

      Pilot Study Design

        -  All patients will be 1:1 randomized to standard-care drug therapy (American College of
           Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline, 2006) or AV node ablation and pacemaker
           therapy

        -  For patients randomized to AVN ablation, there will be a 1:1 sub-randomization to
           conventional right ventricular apex pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy
           (biventricular pacing)

        -  All patients will be followed at 2 and 6 months from the time of randomization in the
           pilot study.

        -  A total of 60 patients from 5-15 clinical sites will be enrolled during an active
           recruiting period of 12 months for the pilot study.
