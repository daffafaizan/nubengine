      Pelvic floor disorders lead to handicap and medical care consumption. Pregnancy and delivery
      are the main etiologies. Pelvic floor exercises are proposed for prevention and may reduce
      immediate postpartum incontinence but we do not know if this preventive effect persists at 1
      year.

      Principal criteria:

        -  Urinary incontinence score at 12 months post-partum (ICIQ-SF)

      Secondary criteria:

        -  Urinary incontinence prevalence at pregnancy end, 2 and 12 months post-partum

        -  Other pelvic floor disorders at pregnancy end, 2 and 12 months post-partum: symptoms
           questionnaires, QOL questionnaire, Pad-test, POP-Q.

        -  Mode of delivery, length of active second phase, perineal tears, Apgar score.

        -  Number of postpartum pelvic floor session, number of medical consultations, Kegel
           exercises.

      Progress:

        -  Inclusion between 20 and 28 weeks, initial assessment, randomization.

        -  8 sessions of pelvic floor exercises with a physiotherapist between 24 and 36 weeks
           versus written information only.

        -  Assessment at pregnancy end, 2 and 12 (+/-1) month post-partum

      Study length:

        -  For each women 18 months.

        -  For each center 30 months.

      Number of subjects:

        -  To show a 1 point difference on ICIQ-SF score, we need 182 subjects (sd=2,4, a=0,05,
           Î²=0,20 bilateral test).

        -  Taking in account lost of follow-up (estimated 1/3) we are going to include 280 women.
