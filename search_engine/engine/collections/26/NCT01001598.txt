      initially receive danazol at a dose of 5 mg/kg/d orally, rounded to the nearest 100 mg. For
      the first 8 weeks, the patient will be evaluated at weeks 2, 5, and 8 for hematologic
      response (HR). If the patient shows a hematological response (either a hemoglobin or platelet
      value no longer meeting blood cell count criteria for protocol inclusion in the absence of
      recent transfusions)within the first 12 weeks on the initial dose, the study drug will be
      continued at this dose for the next 6 weeks. If the patient fails to show any hematologic
      response within the first 12 weeks, the dose will be escalated to 10 mg/kg/day for the next 6
      weeks, and an additional monitoring visit will be required at week 14. If at week 18, the
      patient fails to show any hematological response on the increased dose, the dose will be
      increased to 15 mg/kg/day for another 6 weeks (not to exceed 800 mg/day), and an additional
      monitoring visit will be required at week 20. At 24 weeks, if there is no response to this
      dose the patient will be taken off study drug and classified as a treatment failure, and will
      be monitored at weeks 38 and week 52). After week 24, if the patient continues to show a
      response, however, the study drug may be continued at the discretion of their primary care
      physician, with monitoring at weeks 38 and 52.

      Should the patient lose the hematologic response on 5 or 10 mg/kg/day dosing at any point
      within the first 18 weeks of treatment, the dose will be escalated to 10 or 15 mg/kg/day (not
      to exceed 800 mg/day), respectively. The patient will continue to be evaluated at the next
      visit. If after week 24 no hematologic improvement is seen, the patient is then taken off
      study drug and monitored at weeks 38 and 52.
