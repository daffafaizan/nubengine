      It can provide greater overall comfort with lower pain scores and greater tolerance of
      physical activity during the initial postoperative period.

      Ultrasound imaging has revolutionized the practice of regional anesthesia in that the
      operator can visualize and identify the paravertebral space, needle during its passage
      through the tissues, as well as deposition and spread of local anesthetic into the desired
      spaces. The usage of ultrasound may facilitate more rapid block onset and prolong duration
      with the added advantage of decrease in drug dosage, reduction in incidence of local
      anesthetic toxicity, increase success rate, reduction in procedure pain and better patient
      satisfaction.

      To the best of researchers' knowledge, evaluation of unilateral ultrasound guided
      paravertebral block as perioperative analgesia for lower limb-sparing surgery in adult cancer
      patients was not investigated before.
