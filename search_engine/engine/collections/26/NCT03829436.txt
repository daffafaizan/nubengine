    
      This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity
      of TPST-1120, a small molecule selective antagonist of PPARÎ± (peroxisome proliferator
      activated receptor alpha) in adult subjects with selected advanced solid tumors. TPST-1120
      will be administered as monotherapy and in combination with a systemic anticancer agent,
      nivolumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This trial is
      composed of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.
