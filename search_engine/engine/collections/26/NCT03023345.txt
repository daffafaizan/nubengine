      active surveillance or whole-gland treatments, with significant induced morbidity and burden
      on quality of life. Focal treatments of the index tumor are currently under investigation to
      decrease morbidity while proposing active treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, precision and safety of a novel
      ablation treatment using microwaves, delivered transrectally under real-time guidance with
      MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration. The index tumor will be detected with prostate
      MRI and characterized with targeted biopsies using MRI-transrectal ultrasound image
      registration. It will then be ablated with microwaves using the same transrectal approach and
      guidance system (KOELIS).
