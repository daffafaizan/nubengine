      placebo administered sublingually once a day. Treatment will start at least 16 weeks prior to
      the anticipated start of the pollen season 2009 and will last until the end of the pollen
      season 2011. Study medication will be titrated during the first period of treatment until
      maintenance dose has been reached.
