      I. To assess the PSA response in prostate cancer patients with only biochemical recurrence
      after local curative therapy who are then treated with perifosine.

      II. To assess the secondary endpoints of a) six-month increase in PSA levels compared to
      baseline, b) PSA doubling time and c) time to PSA progression in prostate cancer patients
      receiving perifosine.

      III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this agent in this patient
      population.

      IV. To investigate potential molecular markers predictive of decreased PSADT and possibly PSA
      response in prostate cancer patients receiving perifosine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior therapy
      (surgery vs radiotherapy with or without brachytherapy vs surgery and radiotherapy) and
      original combined Gleason score (7 or less vs 8-10).

      Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28. On day 1 of course 1 only, patients
      receive 2 doses of oral perifosine. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease by PSA alone may
      receive up to 3 additional courses of therapy after documentation of progression.
