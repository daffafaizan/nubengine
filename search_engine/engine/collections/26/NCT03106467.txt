      population since it was first reported in 1998 by Esposito et al. Nonetheless, the practical
      advantages of SLA over conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) have yet to be
      established well in pediatric population due to lacking and inconsistent high-level evidences
      from randomized trials and meta-analysis.

      Thus far, in addition to overall postoperative hospital stay, complications such as wound
      abscess and seroma, intra-abdominal abscess and ileus were reported not to be significantly
      different between SLA and CLA, while SLA might have taken longer operation time in children
      and adult. Currently, the advertised benefits on postoperative pain and cosmetic results of
      SLA incurred suspicion because of heterogeneous data inconsistently supporting SLA from a few
      RCTs especially in pediatric population. Consequently, a consensus regarding the practical
      superiority of SLA to CLA has still not been reached particularly in children.

      To address this issue, the investigators designed the randomized trial to clarify practical
      benefits of SLA over CLA in pediatric population. For this, the investigators compared
      conversion rate, intra-operative adverse events, operating time, wound complications,
      intra-abdominal complications, and postoperative hospital stay, changes in postoperative pain
      severity, and cosmetic outcomes during follow up period between SLA and CLA groups. Primary
      end points were postoperative pain severity and cosmetic satisfaction. Secondary endpoints
      were intra- and post-operative complication rates, operation time, and postoperative hospital
      stay.
