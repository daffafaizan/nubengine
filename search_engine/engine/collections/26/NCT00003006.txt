        -  Determine whether the presence of occult micrometastases (OM) detected by
           immunohistochemistry or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in
           histologically negative lymph nodes or bone marrow is associated with poorer survival
           among patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the incidence of OM in histologically negative lymph nodes and bone marrow by
           immunohistochemistry (staining for cytokeratins and the CEA glycoprotein) or RT-PCR (to
           detect CEA mRNA) in these patients.

        -  Assess the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry relative to RT-PCR for detecting OM in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between tumor size (or T-stage) and the presence of OM
           detected by immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between the presence of OM and disease-free survival in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between the site of OM and incidence of recurrence, site of
           recurrence, and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: At the time of thoracotomy and pulmonary resection, patients have samples of bone
      marrow, primary tumor, and intrathoracic lymph nodes harvested. The presence of occult
      metastases in bone marrow and lymph nodes is assessed using immunohistochemistry or reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.
