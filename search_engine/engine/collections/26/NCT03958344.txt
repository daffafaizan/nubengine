      study. Inclusion criteria consist of clinical and/or imaging evidence of dacryoadenitis with
      or without adjacent rectus muscles (superior and inferior recti) myositis. Patients meeting
      following conditions will be excluded:

        1. Age < 15 years

        2. Diabetes mellitus

        3. Collagen Vascular Diseases

        4. Vasculitides

        5. Biopsy of lacrimal gland denoting a specific diagnosis (i.e. the term "idiopathic" does
           not apply)

        6. Glaucoma

        7. Patients who have lost one eye

        8. Bilateral disease

        9. Abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone

      Outcome measures include number of recurrences, duration of remission, and side effects.

      Patient allocation will be based on blocks of 4. Each patient will undergo lacrimal gland
      biopsy and subsequently will be allocated to one arm of the study according to a
      predetermined randomization sequence (balanced block of four). Outcome measures will be
      recorded in 0, 3 and 6 months after patient enrollment.

      Patients in oral steroid group will receive 1 mg/kg/day of Prednisolone, tapered in 3 months
      (based on a detailed table).

      Patients in injection group will receive 1 shot of 1 mL (20 mg Triamcinolone + 3 mg
      Betamethason) into the lacrimal gland.
