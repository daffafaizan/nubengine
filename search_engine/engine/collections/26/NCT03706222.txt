      Patients treated with grazoprevir/elbasvir during August 2017 to July 2018 are candidates of
      study subjects. All the required study information will be recorded with detailed chart
      review.

      DDI will be evaluated by HEP Drug Interactions (www.hep-druginteractions.org) assessment of
      comidications: Category 0: Classification not possible due to lack of information; Category

      The assessment of DDI will be evaluated and recorded according to the suggested categories,
      the number of patients at risk for a clinically relevant DDI, and the ratio of patients with
      at least one predicted DDI between medication of grazoprevir/elbasvir will be calculated.
