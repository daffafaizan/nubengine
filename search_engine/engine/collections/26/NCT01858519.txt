    
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional point-prevalence study conducted in the US to
      determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to selected porcine viruses in pancreatic enzyme
      replacement therapy-exposed CF patients and in an unexposed control group with chronic
      medical conditions matched for age and geographic region of residence. Data collection
      includes demographic and medical history, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, transfusion
      history, and history of potential exposure to pig viruses. If a patient meets all the
      requirements of the study and provides a study specific informed consent/assent, a single
      blood sample is obtained as part of a planned standard-of-care blood collection.
