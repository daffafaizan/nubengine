    
      This study involves the use of a newly designed shoe insole device (also referred to as a
      foot insole device) similar to various shoe insoles or inserts you can buy at a store or
      pharmacy. Healthy participants will wear this insole device in their own athletic/tennis
      shoes over the course of one week. There are two key purposes of this study: 1. To determine
      how using this insole device for 1 week may effect a healthy individual's balance and
      postural sway while standing; and 2. To determine how using this insole device for 1 week may
      effect how an individual walks (gait), how hard they hit the ground as they walk, and foot
      pressure patterns with each step. Each individual's balance, postural sway, and walking gait
      (how you walk) will be analyzed before and after wearing the shoe insole device for the
      one-week time period.
