        -  All 75 volunteers who had never had rabies immunization would be enrolled and designated
           into 3 groups.

      group 1 : 25 Healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 yr who were attacked by mammals, possible exposed
      to rabies and had WHO category III exposure, all receive standard post - exposure rabies
      treatment with 5-dose intramuscular rabies vaccine on day 0,3,7,14,28 and 40 IU/kg of equine
      rabies immune globulin (ERIG).

      group 2 : 25 Healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 yr receive 4-dose intramuscular rabies vaccine on
      day 0,3,7,14 and 40 IU/kg of equine rabies immune globulin (ERIG).

      group 3 : 25 Healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 yr receive 4-dose intramuscular rabies vaccine on
      day 0,3,7,28 and 40 IU/kg of equine rabies immune globulin (ERIG).

      5 cc - Blood would be drawn from all volunteers before vaccination and on day 14, 28, 90 and
      360 for rabies neutralizing antibody titers (RNab).

      The GMTs of RNab among both groups would be analyzed and compared.
