      considered a big obstacle for interventional cardiologists. Very long coronary lesions are
      usually found, and implantation of a single stent was a great problem forcing the operator to
      do overlapping of several stents.

      Recently, new stent designs with increasing length are developed and emerging as a great tool
      for the percutaneous treatment of long lesions. Nowadays, stents up to 60 mm are available to
      be used in these cases reducing stent overlap.

      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention has been shown in
      clinical trials, registries, and meta-analyses to be associated with a reduction in clinical
      events after percutaneous coronary intervention; however, IVUS utilization during
      percutaneous coronary intervention remains low in the United States and worldwide. The impact
      of IVUS in these complex lesions may be associated with a lower rate of clinical adverse
      events in comparison with angiography alone.

      The study will be conducted on forty patients with chronic stable angina on maximal medical
      treatment who are going to have elective coronary angiography and elective PCI and having one
      long coronary lesion that is more than 40 mm in length, they will be randomized into either
      treatment of the lesion with a single very long stent (more than 40 mm in length) or with
      more than one overlapping stents in 1:1 randomization. Control angiography and IVUS will be
      done to the 2 groups after 6 months and the major cardiovascular outcomes will be addressed
      at 1,3 and 6 months follow-up periods.
