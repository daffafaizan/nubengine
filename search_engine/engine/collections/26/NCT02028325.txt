      the Yellow 560 microscope to aid in treatment of intracranial tumors and vascular lesions.
      The objectives of this study aim to investigate the use of Fluorescein in assisting with
      evaluating complete tumor removal and thorough treatment of intracranial vascular lesions as
      well as tumor biopsy procedures. The hypothesis is that Fluorescein Sodium will help surgeons
      better identify residual tumor and vascular lesions and its use will allow surgeons to obtain
      better surgical results and prognostic outcomes.
