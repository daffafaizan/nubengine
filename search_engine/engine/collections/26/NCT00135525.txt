      will be single-blinded), group comparison study.

      Paroxetine 20mg/day (achieved via the starting dose of 10 mg/day for the first week) once
      daily, or placebo was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks (fixed dose was adopted in
      the Treatment phase) in patients with GAD.

      For subjects who were classed as non-responders at Week 8, paroxetine at 30 to 40mg/day (once
      daily) or placebo (once daily) was orally administered with flexible titration regimen for 4
      weeks (fixed dose was adopted in the Treatment phase). The subjects underwent a taper phase
      in case they received Paroxetine 40mg/day, paroxetine 30mg/day or placebo at treatment
      completion or study withdrawal. A follow-up examination was conducted after 1 to 5 weeks from
      the last dose of the investigational product.

      The overall study duration requiring subject participation was 10 to 20 weeks.
