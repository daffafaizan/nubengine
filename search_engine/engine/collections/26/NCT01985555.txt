    
      The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy
      following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504. The safety and tolerability
      variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital
      signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including
      serum chemistry, hematology (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment
      analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms
      (ECGs) in triplicate, Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), to determine the
      MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).
