      prospectively collected.Screening for MDR bacteria (using nasal swabs, tracheal aspirates
      from intubated patients and specimens from the infection location) was performed at ICU
      admission and discharge. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDR bacteria were
      recorded, and the accuracy of the ATS criteria in predicting infection or colonization with
      these bacteria at ICU admission was documented. All of the infected patients were treated by
      the attending physician, and the choice and adjustment of antibiotic were in accordance with
      the recommendations of the ATS guidelines.
