      in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV or simian/human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV plasma
      viremia. The aims of this protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics profile of 10-1074 in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and
      its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected individuals.
