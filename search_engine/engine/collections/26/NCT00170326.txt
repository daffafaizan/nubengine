      there is no synchrony -as in left bundle block (LBBB)- the clinic consequences should have
      little importance in patients with a healthy heart or a great importance in patients
      suffering heart failure (HF), specially in those with severe grade of HF, the benefit of
      cardiac resynchronization by pacing both ventricles or left ventricle (LV)should means
      healthy improvement in patients. All previous studies done in HF, are in patients with
      symptomatic HF. The importance of stop progression of latent HF in patients with asymptomatic
      ventricular dysfunction (VD)in permanent pacing indication patients. Pacing may accelerate HF
      progression by dissincronyzing ventricles. ACE inhibitors studies in asymptomatic VD gave
      positive results.

      The PreVent-HF is an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded
      pilot trial specifically designed to evaluate as main objective the progression of VD in
      permanent pacing population.
