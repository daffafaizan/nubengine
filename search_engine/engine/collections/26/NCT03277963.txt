    
      In this controlled study, patients of both sexes over 18 years of age who are obese with a
      body mass index (BMI) of 30 will be included. They will benefit from a polygraphy to confirm
      or invalidate the presence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (defined by an
      apnea-hypopnea index to 10). Patients will be tested for mechanical and electrical pain
      within one week of diagnosis. Among these patients, those with severe SAOS (IAH 30) warrant
      treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (usual procedure). They will be
      hospitalized for the implementation of this treatment (usual procedure) and subjected to
      mechanical and electrical pain tests on the second day after the treatment is put in place.

      One month after the start of treatment, they will benefit from an ambulatory polygraph test
      (usual procedure) as well as mechanical and electrical pain tests.
