      characteristics suggestive of minimal risk for leakage from the pancreaticojejunostomy will
      be included in the study. At the time of reconstruction the patient will be randomized to
      either conventional size of the stomach or to a subtotal gastrectomy containing a small upper
      gastric pouch only.
