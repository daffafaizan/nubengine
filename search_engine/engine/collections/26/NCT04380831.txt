      I. To assess the feasibility of using IMRT to deliver total body irradiation (TBI) to 800 cGy
      while keeping mean lung and kidney doses to 200 cGy.

      II. To assess the safety/feasibility of total body irradiation using IMRT (IMRT TBI) in
      systemic sclerosis patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate dose homogeneity and dose sparing to lung and kidneys. II. To evaluate
      transplant-related mortality at 30 days and 100 days post IMRT TBI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo TBI using IMRT twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -4 in the absence of disease
      progression or disease progression. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2
      and undergo HSCT on day 0 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 30 and 100.
