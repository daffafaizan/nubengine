        -  To install the breast Positron Emission Mammography system and to test and ensure its
           compliance with all regulatory agencies including the American College of Radiology and
           the Food and Drug Administration.

        -  To measure and compare the number of call-backs for positron emission mammography (PEM)
           imaging and conventional mammography.

        -  To measure and compare patient satisfaction for both conventional mammography and
           positron emission mammography in terms of comfort and pain.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a conventional two-view mammogram and positron emission mammography
      (PEM). Immediately following treatment, patients complete a questionnaire on their
      satisfaction with the standard mammogram and the positron emission mammography.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually.
