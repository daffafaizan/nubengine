    
      Randomized, stratified, two arm study:

        -  Litx™ and chemotherapy arm (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI)

        -  Chemotherapy only arm (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI)

      For patients who have progressed on FOLFIRI, they will be treated with Litx™ plus FOLFOX4
      versus FOLFOX4 alone; and for patients who have progressed on FOLFOX, they will be treated
      with Litx™ plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone.

      Stratification upon enrollment by chemotherapy and tumor sum of the longest diameter (SLD)
      (SLD < 4 cm or SLD ≥4 cm but ≤7.5 cm).
