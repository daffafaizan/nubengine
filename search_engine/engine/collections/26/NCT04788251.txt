      On Programme, SOP) have been shown to be effective to prevent and reduce falls in primarily
      non-Asian settings. The Otago Exercise Programme is a single component intervention that has
      been shown to reduce fall rate among older adults by 35%. The OEP is a group-based exercise
      programme based on strength and balance components. The Stepping-On Programme is a
      multi-component intervention that has been shown to reduce fall rate by 30%. The SOP consists
      of group-based series of weekly sessions to teach fall prevention strategies to
      community-dwelling older adults. Sessions comprise of strength-balance exercises and classes
      based on adult learning principles.

      However, there is little evidence of the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of
      locally-adapted community fall prevention interventions. Furthermore, studies on the
      effectiveness of fall prevention interventions among Asian populations are less robust due to
      the lack of well-designed studies with adequately powered sample sizes.

      In this study, exercise-based fall prevention programmes will be implemented based on
      geographic region where participants living in the North region will receive the modified SOP
      and participants in the Central region will receive the modified OEP.
