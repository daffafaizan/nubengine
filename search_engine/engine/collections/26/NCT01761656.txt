      intervention (PCI), increasing attention has been paid to postoperative myocardial injury
      (MI) after PCI. NAPLES II1 and ARMYDA2Studies have shown that loading dose statin therapy
      before PCI for ACS patients can reduce perioperative myocardial infarction and major adverse
      cardiac events (MACE) and mortality 1 year after PCI. The core mechanism about the effects of
      statins on the clinical outcomes above-mentioned, which can not been completely explained by
      the lipid-lowering effect, so far have not been discovered in previous studies. Thus the
      interest of some researchers turned to the other point of view, such as coronary
      microcirculation. MI after PCI is a kind of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (NSTEMI) related to coronary microcirculation, which can not been detected by coronary
      angiography, but can be detected by index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) examination.

      In this study, we will recruit stable angina, unstable angina and acute non-ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction patients who have been confirmed by coronary angiography. At
      the time of enrollment, patients will be randomly assigned to loading dose group
      (atorvastatin 80 mg 12 hours before PCI and 40 mg 2 hours before PCI and then 20mg/d after
      PCI) or control group (atorvastatin 20 mg 12 hours before PCI and then 20mg/d after PCI).
      When PCI is performed, index of microvascular resistance (IMR) will be measured before and
      after the procedure. Periprocedural myocardial infarction will be defined by post-PCI cardiac
      biomarker. All patients will be followed for adverse cardiac events for 1 month.
