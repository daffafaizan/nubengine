      I. To determine if F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET can differentiate between benign
      treatment-related changes and recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1.

      II. To determine if FET PET can accurately differentiate between low-grade and high-grade
      glial neoplasms in population 2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and
      recurrence in comparison to pathology or imaging follow-up in population 1.

      II. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and
      recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1 patients with recurrent low-grade
      gliomas (grades 1 and 2).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 minute
      and undergo PET over 40 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.
