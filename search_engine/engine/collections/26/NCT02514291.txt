      disrupted by seizures occurring during the night and/or during the day. Inadequate sleep has
      long been recognized as a trigger for seizure and poor sleep habits have been associated with
      unfavorable outcomes in children with epilepsy. Attention to sleep in children with epilepsy
      as a result is critically important for seizure control and health-related quality of life.
