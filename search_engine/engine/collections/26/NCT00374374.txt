      increasing interest in the relationship between the gastrointestinal flora and gut function.
      Several studies have shown promising results for the use of probiotics in patient with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      Aim: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of a probiotic suspension in
      patients with active colonic Crohn's disease.

      Methods: The study is a two-centre, randomised placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial.
      Patients above the age of 18 years, attending our out-patient clinic, can be included if they
      have Crohn's disease in the colon or colon and small bowel and have active disease with a
      CDAI: 220-400. Patients are not included if they have undergone larger bowel resections, have
      been treated with antibiotics within the last two months, if dose of prednisolone has been
      changed within the last 4 weeks, or dose of immunosuppressives has been changed within the
      last 2 months. During the study period no changes in medication is allowed. During an 8 week
      period patients are treated with a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain 19070-2 and
      lactobacillus acidophilus strain 18911-2 (10EE9 colony forming unit/ml). Freeze-dried
      probiotics are dissolved in sterile water to a volume of 1 ml which is ingested once daily,
      in the evening.
