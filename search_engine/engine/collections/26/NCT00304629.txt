      be evaluated. Only subjects who took trial medication during the 24-month trial period of
      GAL-INT-8 will be eligible. Safety will be assessed by periodic physical examination, vital
      signs, ECG and laboratory tests and reports of adverse events. The ADAS-cognitive scale and
      DAD scale will be used to document long-term efficacy.

      Patients will be seen at 6 monthly intervals but the ADAS-cognitive scale and DAD scale will
      only be performed at end of trial. The treatment will consist of tablets which will contain
      12 mg of galantamine. Duration of treatment equals 12 months. Patients will receive 1 tablet
      twice daily preferably to be taken with food (breakfast in the morning at approximately 8 AM
      and a snack or meal in the evening at approximately 6PM).
