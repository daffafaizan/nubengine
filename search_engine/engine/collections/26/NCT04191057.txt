      measures kappa (K) and lambda (L) chains, and the calculation of the ratio of kappa to lambda
      (K/L). Previous studies have shown that the K/L ratio does not change over time (1 year). The
      hypothesis of this study is that healthy twins will have a K/L ratio that are close to each
      other in value, suggesting that this ratio is genetically linked.
