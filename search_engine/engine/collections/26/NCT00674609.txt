      blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of
      SativexÂ® and GW-2000-02 in subjects with cancer-related pain. Subjects are screened to
      determine eligibility and completed a two-day baseline period. Subjects then return to the
      centre for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. All subjects are allowed to
      continue using all their current medications, provided that the dose remains stable
      throughout the study period. Their progress is reviewed after seven to 10 days and at the end
      of the study (day 14 to 20), or upon withdrawal. Subjects in this study are given the
      opportunity to be enrolled in an open label extension study (GWEXT0101).
