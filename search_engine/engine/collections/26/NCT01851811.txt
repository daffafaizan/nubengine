      airflow during sleep, with resulting hypoxemia and hypercapnia that are terminated by
      arousals. This pattern of repetitive arousals and nocturnal hypoxemia leads to disruption of
      sleep architecture and daytime hyper-somnolence as well as a multitude of neurobehavioral and
      cardiopulmonary derangements. All patients diagnosed with OSA should be instructed to undergo
      behavioral changes such as weight loss, avoidance of alcohol and sedatives, sleeping on the
      side and improvement in sleep hygiene, such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and getting
      an adequate amount of sleep. Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) is currently
      considered to be the cornerstone of therapy for sleep apnea (OSA). However compliance with
      this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption,
      daytime sleepiness and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical and
      psychological/educational interventions have been proposed to try to increase the hours of
      use of CPAP therapy. In older male patients with OSA, compliance with CPAP therapy is
      associated with attendance at a patient CPAP education and support group. Resolution of
      symptoms with therapy also appears to be associated with enhanced compliance. Some studies
      suggest that there is no direct causal relationship between OSA and gastro esophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). The investigators hypothesize that the compliance and tolerance to CPAP is
      affected with the timing of last meal before bedtime and this may also affect the symptoms of
      GERD.
