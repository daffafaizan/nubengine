      39K-MRI at 7 Tesla to assess tissue sodium and potassium content. Measurements will be
      conducted before treatment of hyperaldosteronism and three months after adrenal surgery or
      medical treatment (Spironolactone or Eplerenone). Furthermore, blood pressure, body water
      distribution (by bioimpedance spectroscopy), serum electrolytes as well as monocyte function
      will be assessed.
