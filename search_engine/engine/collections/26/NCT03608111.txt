      Patients were randomly assigned to single task balance training (Group 1) or dual-task
      balance training (Group 2) groups. Balance activities were given to both groups for 3 times a
      week for 4 weeks. Patients in group 2 also performed cognitive tasks simultaneously with
      these exercises. Patients were evaluated with Berg balance scale (BBS), kinesthetic ability
      trainer (KAT 2000) static and dynamic scores, timed up and go test (TUTG) and walking speed
      for single and dual tasks, number of stopping and Activities Specific Balance Confidence
      (ABC) Scale at the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks.
