      large sample, multi-center, evaluator blinded, randomized and controlled methods. From
      September 1, 2019 to October 30, 2020, patients undergoing laparoscopic non-gastrointestinal
      surgery under general anesthesia will be recruited, based on the combination of dexamethasone
      and 5-HT3 antagonist, the efficacy of TEAS stimulation Neiguan (P6) and Zusanli (ST36) in the
      prevention and treatment of PONV will be verified. In TEAS group, bilateral P6 and ST36 TEAS
      intervention after removal tracheal intubation and on the first day after surgery, a total of
      2 times, 30 minutes each time, 2/10 Hz low frequency sparse wave, 6-9 mA. The patients will
      be given maximum intensity stimulation at all points during the intervention.To ensure the
      blindness of the evaluator, the time of evaluation will be on the afternoon of the first and
      the second day, and the 30 days after the operation, and three evaluations will be made. The
      main indicators are the incidence of PONV 24 hours after operation, and the secondary
      indicators are the quantitative indicators of PONV and the indicators of rapid recovery after
      operation.
