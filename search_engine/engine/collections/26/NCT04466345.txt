    
      This is a 16-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, involving 60
      obese individuals with MDD and pre-treatment cognitive dysfunction. Study participants will
      receive one of the following study interventions in addition to 'standard of care' treatment:
      once-daily semaglutide, initiated at 3 mg/day for 4 weeks, increased to 7 mg/day for 4 more
      weeks and titrated to 14 mg/day for the subsequent 8 weeks; or matching placebo. Participants
      will be assessed to examine the effect of semaglutide on their cognitive function.
