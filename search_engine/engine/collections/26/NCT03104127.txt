      order to develop more normal movement patterns, strengthen the quadriceps and improve quality
      of gait. Lower limb robotic devices have been shown to increase functional mobility, walking
      speed, step length, balance and endurance within a clinical setting. The purpose of this
      study is to see if a lower limb robotic device leg can be used in a community setting to
      improve biomechanical (gait, balance, lower-limb strength), physiological (vascular health)
      and performance outcomes (aerobic fitness, strength) in patients with chronic stroke
