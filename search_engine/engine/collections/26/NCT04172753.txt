      single device. The superior soft tissue contrast compared with cone-beam computed tomography
      based treatment and the possibility for daily plan adaptation promise a higher precision of
      treatment, better target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. In a first step the
      present study will test the feasibility of imaging and treatment on the 1.5 T MR-Linac.
