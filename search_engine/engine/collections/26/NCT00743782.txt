      hormone 1-34 (PTH) as a beneficial treatment for hypoparathyroidism, superior to conventional
      therapy with calcium and calcitriol. We are conducting a randomized crossover study comparing
      twice-daily subcutaneous injections vs. PTH pump therapy. We hypothesize that pump delivery
      of PTH 1-34, compared to twice-daily administration, will provide smoother metabolic control
      of serum mineral levels and normalization of urine mineral excretion. The two arms will be
      divided into an inpatient and an outpatient phase. There will be three inpatient admissions,
      baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Subjects will be randomized to either pump therapy or to
      twice daily injections at the beginning of the study and will cross over to the alternate PTH
      delivery system (injections vs. pump) at the conclusion of the initial 3-month treatment
      period.

      Patients between 10 and 70 years of age who have had chronic hypoparathyroidism for at least
      1 year may be eligible for this study. Participants have two 10- 12-day hospital admissions
      and one 5-day admission. The first two inpatient admissions are separated by 3-month
      outpatient periods. Outpatient monitoring will require weekly blood tests and monthly urine
      tests to monitor mineral levels. After third hospital admission, patients will be placed on
      conventional therapy.
