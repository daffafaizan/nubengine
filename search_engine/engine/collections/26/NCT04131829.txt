    
      The proposed study intends to recruit 2 groups:

        1. Matched healthy control participants will be imaged with one fMRI at baseline as a
           no-treatment comparison group; and

        2. a randomized, double-blind group of unmedicated OCD participants who will be assigned to
           begin either immediate or placebo-delayed treatment, and who will be imaged with fMRIs
           at baseline and over the course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake
           inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine.

      Hypothesis-driven analyses and exploratory analyses will be performed in parallel.

      This study will address the following Specific Aims:

        1. Identification of neural dysconnectivity associated with OCD symptomatology.

        2. Characterizing neural markers of clinical response to SSRI pharmacotherapy.

        3. Mapping neural predictors of clinical response to pharmacotherapy.
