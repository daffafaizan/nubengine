      the mother to nurture the newborn child and establishing an appropriate mother-child bonding.
      Therefore, effective pain management is crucial. In this study we would like to compare
      between two pain relievers' administration protocols:

        1. Oral pain relievers' administration in fix protocol without need for patient demand

        2. Spinal morphine given during the spinal anesthesia in the cesarean section
