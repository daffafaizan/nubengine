      This study falls in two fields:

      First 80 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes are followed with determination of cytokines and
      factors of the metabolic syndrome throughout the pregnancy. The correlation between these
      variables and the pregnancy and delivery progress is evaluated.

      280 overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m2) pregnant women with no medical conditions
      are examined in the same way. The women are randomized in week 14 to either continue their
      habitual physical activity or to elevate it by participating in a training program with other
      pregnant women 3 times weekly.

      Both groups will get blood samples taken during fasting approximately 50 ml 3-4 times during
      the pregnancy.
