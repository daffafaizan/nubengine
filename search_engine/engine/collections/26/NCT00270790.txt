      continue to represent a significant therapeutic challenge. The bulk of tumor burden often
      proves to be overwhelming for conventional radiotherapy. Attempts to improve upon these poor
      outcomes have led investigators to explore several new strategies, one such being
      chemoradiation. One of the trials conducted at the University of Maryland with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel with daily radiation showed 82% CR at the primary site. But the most commonly
      encountered grade 3 toxicities were mucositis (70%), leukopenia (30%) and 3% grade 4
      leukopenia. Amifostine: An organic thiophosphate is radioprotective and has shown to protect
      experimental animals from lethal doses of radiation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that
      amifostine can provide protection against the hematological toxicities and mucositis seen
      with various chemotherapeutic agents. Theoretically, drug interactions between amifostine and
      chemotherapeutic agents are not likely to occur, due to amifostine¿s rapid clearance from
      plasma (90% of the drug is cleared within 6 minutes). A promising venue would be the
      investigation of amifostine¿s role in reducing the toxicities associated with chemoradiation
      (which is standard of care of treating squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck).

      Principal objectives of the study: Primary: To evaluate whether the addition of the
      radioprotector amifostine can reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis and
      hematological toxicities caused by chemoradiation. Secondary: 1.To determine the toxicities
      of amifostine given in this setting. 2. To determine the response rate of this regimen in the
      population.
