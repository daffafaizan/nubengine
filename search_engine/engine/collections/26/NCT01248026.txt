      participants being subjected to 2 consecutive treatments of 4 weeks each, in random order,
      during which they will consume 45g of buttermilk and a macro- and micronutrient matching
      placebo. The treatments will be different in their content of MFGM (present in buttermilk,
      absent in placebo). Buttermilk and placebo will be fully characterized and formulated in
      ready-to-use pouches, each pouch containing 22.5 g of artificially flavored products that
      will have to be mixed in a fixed amount of water for consumption. Participants will have to
      consume two pouches every day. Based on a 2500 kcal/day regimen, we have calculated that
      these placebo and buttermilk formulation will contribute to approximately 200 kcal (from 5%
      and 10%) of the daily energy intake of participants, who will be asked to maintain other
      aspects of their nutritional habits constant throughout the study.

      Fluctuations in female hormones have been shown to influence metabolic variables. For that
      reason, outcomes at the end of each dietary phase will be measured during the follicular
      phase of menstrual cycle (day 3 to day 9) in pre-menopausal women. This is another argument
      for using a 4-wk intervention, which essentially corresponds to the mean duration of the
      menstrual cycle of most women. Pre-menopausal women will start the first diet during the
      first week of their menstrual cycle.
