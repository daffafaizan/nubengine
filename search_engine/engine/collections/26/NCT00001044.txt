      with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro
      may be induced, but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in
      individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition
      or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.

      Volunteers are randomized to 20 treatment arms containing four patients each. rsgp120/HIV-1MN
      is administered at four dose levels: 0, 100, 300, and 600 mcg, and QS-21 adjuvant is
      administered at three dose levels: 0, 50, and 100 mcg. Some subject cohorts receive alum in
      the vaccine formulation. Sixty volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 10, and 20
      volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 6. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: All
      consenting volunteers who have received three immunizations will be tested for DTH response
      to HIV-1 envelope with use of intradermal MN rsgp120. Follow-up is extended to 56 days after
      administration of the intradermal injections.
