      Eligible patients who agree to participate will be randomized to the control and experimental
      groups in a 2:1 ratio respectively because experimental group size is limited by health coach
      availability and greater loss-to-follow up is expected among the control group. Repeated
      measures analysis will be used to compare each outcome over the study period. In addition,
      subgroup analyses will be performed in order to stratify by baseline survey measures or
      amount of ED visits in the pre-observation period.
