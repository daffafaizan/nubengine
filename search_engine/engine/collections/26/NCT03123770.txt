      EC-T in suitable breast cancer patients.

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        1. Arm I: Participants receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide
           followed by docetaxel before surgery.

        2. Arm II: Participants receive epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel
           before surgery.

      Patients in arms I and II will undergo physical examination, MRI, estimating of side effects
      every 4 cycles referring to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor) guideline.
      To adjust for potential bias, patients in DC-T arm were matched 1:1 to patients in the EC-T
      arm based on Her-2 and ER status. After finishing 8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, every
      patient will receive mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and then assess the pCR rate of
      primary lesion and axillary lymph nodes. Adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy will be
      taken if necessary. Every patient will be followed-up for five years to monitor survival
      condition.
