      cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device.
      Asymptomatic obstruction of the access vein reported to have a high incidence (30-50%) in
      some studies. This complication can cause some difficulties in follow up procedures such as
      device upgrading. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Aspirin or Clopidogrel
      are effective in the prevention of venous obstruction after implantation of cardiac pacemaker
      or defibrillator.
