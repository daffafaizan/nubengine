      measures included degree of postoperative pain, the amount of postoperative analgesia,
      procedural duration, number of days to recovery normal activity, surgical complications,
      cosmetic results, and patient satisfaction. The outcome was recorded at the outpatient visits
      10 days, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the surgery. The cosmetic result was
      scored (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3) by the patients or
      parents, the attending nurse, and the surgeon (maximum points = 9). The patient satisfaction
      was scored similarly (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3). The
      long axis of the testes was measured.
