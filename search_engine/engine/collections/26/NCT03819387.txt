      or colorectal cancer, with or without KRAS mutation. Five dose levels will be explored. In
      dose level 5, only patients with previously-treated NSCLC with KRAS mutation will be
      included.

      Patients in Part B must have previously treated NSCLC with confirmed KRAS mutation. Two dose
      levels will be explored further in Part B. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled in Part B,
      with 10 patients enrolled in each of the two cohorts. Once dose level 5 has been confirmed to
      be safe in Part A (i.e. 0-1 DLT in 6 patients), an additional 4 patients will then be
      enrolled for a planned total of 24 patients in Part B.
