      and washout period, participants will take lycopene, 30 mg per day for 12 weeks. The
      expression of intermediate biomarkers will be determined upon study entry after 8 weeks of
      run-in/washout, and after 6 and 12 weeks of lycopene supplementation. It takes at least 20
      weeks to complete the course.
