      reproductive function. Unfortunately, osmotic effects of freezing and thawing during the
      cryopreservation process negatively affect sperm morphology and motility .

      Myoinositol is the most biologically important form of inositol in nature. In male
      reproductive system, myoinositol appears to regulate sperm motility, capacitation and
      acrosomal reaction.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of in-vitro myoinositol supplementation
      of human sperm on the outcome of cryopreservation.
