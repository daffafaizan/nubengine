      and transbrachial routes are also coming up in practice. We compared transradial versus
      transfemoral routes for ease of operability, time for procedure, complications, and failure
      rates through a prospective study. Methods: 400 Patients admitted in department of cardiology
      for percutaneous interventions were enrolled in the study. 200 patients were assigned to each
      group randomly. A single team did all the procedures. Pre procedure, intra procedure and post
      procedure data of all the patients was collected, tabulated and analysed properly.

      The variables studied include Access time ,Fluoroscopy time and overall procedure time, post
      procedure complications( ecchymosis ,Thrombophelibites, Hematoma, procedure access bleed),
      Failure rates,post procedure myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure and
      infections.
