      which reported that D3 lymphadenectomy conferred a survival advantage over D2 in tumours that
      were 50-100mm in diameter, with or without lymph nodal disease.

      Of the three published randomised controlled trials(RCT) comparing D2 versus D2+paraaortic
      nodal dissection (PAND), two of the studies in which the long-term results are available,
      were carried out in Japan. In both these studies, the patients were not offered chemotherapy
      until after they developed a recurrence. Another reason is the benefit on survival, albeit
      modest, in patients undergoing D3 lymphadenectomy that has been noted in the study by Wu et
      al.

      Another important reason for comparing D2 versus D2+PAND, lies in the fact that none of the
      aforementioned RCTs have been performed after the 1998 revision in the definition of lymph
      node stations by the Japanese Gastric cancer association. Hence, none of these results can be
      considered representative of the current classifications.

      Duly considering the possible higher morbidity that has been shown with a complete para
      aortic lymph node dissection, the investigators propose to study a more extensive
      lymphadenectomy than D2 but without increasing the risk of morbidity in the patient.

      D2 lymphadenectomy has been performed at Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), since 2002 with
      morbidity and mortality rates comparable to world literature It is the standard form of
      lymphadenectomy in TMC. Hence, the trial will be performed by surgeons experienced in the
      technique. D3 is performed in some centres in Japan, Italy and Taiwan (where the only
      randomized controlled trial demonstrated a survival benefit of D3 over D1). Both the
      procedures are well established and regarded as standards in different parts of the world.
