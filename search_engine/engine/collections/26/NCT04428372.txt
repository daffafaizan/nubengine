    
      A randomized crossover trial of hypertonic mannitol vs. placebo in IDH-prone participants
      will be performed over a 4-week period to determine the effect on:

        -  Patient symptoms

        -  The magnitude of intra-dialytic hypotension

      The hypothesis to be tested is that the use of hypertonic mannitol will result in fewer
      adverse symptoms and less decline in intra-dialytic BP, compared with the use of placebo.
