      This study will determine whether the presence of a portable high-efficiency indoor air
      filter in the bedroom improves respiratory symptoms (based on St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire - COPD - SGRQ-C score) during a period of high air pollution compared with
      placebo in former smokers with respiratory symptoms.

      The primary outcome will be the change in SGRQ-C score associated with using a portable
      high-efficiency indoor air filter during the study period.

      Secondary outcomes will assess the effect of using a portable high-efficiency indoor air
      filter on healthcare utilization, other symptom scores, COPD exacerbation frequency,
      medication use, median daily step counts, inflammatory markers, oxygenation, indoor
      particulate counts and indoor-outdoor particulate count difference, and pulmonary function
      tests.

      Baseline descriptive statistics will report baseline air filter type, duration of use, and
      particulate weight prior to study enrollment.

      Evaluation of change in symptom scores and other secondary outcomes from baseline to study
      air filter (Visit 1 vs. Visit 2).
