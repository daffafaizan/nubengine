      medical advances have led to small improvements in survival, but the overall rate of survival
      remains low, making new treatment approaches necessary.

      Chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy are often both used in treating esophageal cancer.
      The combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) is a commonly used chemotherapy
      combination. Sometimes chemotherapy is given as an "induction" therapy, before the radiation
      is given.

      The drug RAD001 is a targeted drug that acts specifically on a protein inside cells (called
      mTOR), which is important for cancer development. The combination of RAD001 and radiation
      therapy has been shown to improve anti-cancer effects.

      This study will look for the ideal dose of RAD001 when given in combination with radiation
      therapy after induction chemotherapy with XELOX, and test the anticancer effects of this
      treatment approach in patients with esophageal cancer.
