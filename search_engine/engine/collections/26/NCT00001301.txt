      which time a number of different treatment protocols have been used. Approximately 110
      patients have apparently been cured of their lymphoma. The present protocol has no
      therapeutic component, but is designed to document the late effects that may have been
      encountered by our patients, either as a consequence of the disease or its treatment. In
      essence, patients who consent to participate will be asked a series of questions pertaining
      to the quality of their life and possible medical problems that they may be encountering. In
      addition, they will receive a complete physical examination and undergo non-invasive
      investigations designed to identify the presence of unsuspected late effects. Investigators
      in the Eye Clinic, Dental Clinic, Audiology, Cardiology and Endocrinology departments will
      participate in the protocol. As a part of the study, blood samples will be obtained to
      investigate the possibility that predisposing genetic factors may be identifiable in the
      patients normal cells (e.g., p53 mutations, evidence of DNA instability). If such
      abnormalities are detected, blood samples from family members will also be examined to
      determine whether the defect was inherited.
