      of the distal body part has long been recognized in stroke rehabilitation practice but lacks
      scientific evidence. This study plans to examine the effects of proximal priority robotic
      priming and impairment-oriented training (PRI) and distal priority robotic priming and
      impairment-oriented training (DRI).

      Methods. This is a single-blind randomized comparative efficacy study involving 40
      participants with chronic stroke. Participants will be randomized into PRI or DRI groups and
      receive 18 intervention sessions (90 min/d, 3 d/wk for 6 weeks). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment
      Upper Extremity subscale, Medical Research Council Scale, Revised Nottingham Sensory
      Assessment, and Wolf Motor Function Test will be administered at baseline, after treatment,
      and at the 3-month follow-up. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and the
      Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector Method will be used to examine the comparative
      efficacy and predictors of outcome, respectively, after PRI and DRI.
