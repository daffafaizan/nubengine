    
      This is a randomized, 3-arm, saline-controlled study involving women undergoing surgical
      management of DCIS. Forty-five (45) women who have been diagnosed with DCIS by core biopsy
      will receive intraductal administration of either carboplatin or normal saline (NS) into the
      DCIS-involved breast duct. Thirty (30) patients (i.e., 15 patients per arm) will receive two
      intraductal infusions of either 100 mg of carboplatin or NS on Days 1 and 15. Fifteen (15)
      patients will receive an intraductal infusion of 100 mg carboplatin on Day 1 and an
      intraductal infusion of NS on Day 15. Patients will undergo surgical resection 2 to 4 weeks
      following the Day 15 intraductal infusion (i.e. 4 to 6 weeks from diagnosis).

      The effect of carboplatin on DCIS in the pre-treatment core biopsy specimen and the resection
      specimen will be assessed. Venous blood samples will be collected for carboplatin PK analysis
      pre-dose and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours following intraductal infusions on Days 1
      and 15.
