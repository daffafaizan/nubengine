      randomized into active and control groups. A clinical pharmacist identified TRPs for all
      participants. Adherence, depression and anxiety scores were assessed. Active group patients
      received the MMR service: pharmacist-delivered counseling and a letter with recommended
      changes in the patient's treatment plan was sent to the patient's psychiatrist to be applied.
      Control group participants did not receive the intervention. Follow-up assessments were
      completed for all patients at 3 months from baseline. Main outcome measures were TRPs,
      adherence, depression and anxiety scores.
