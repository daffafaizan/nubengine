      and neovascularization in retinal vein occlusion will be evaluated by ultra-wide field
      fluorescence angiography (UWFA). UWFA has a wider range than conventional angiography, and
      can clearly observe the peripheral retina. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively
      analyze these changes and investigate the effect on macular edema and neovascularization
      secondary to retinal vein occlusion.
