      treat people who have non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with underlying
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study will look at changes in fibrosis staging in
      people who take vedolizumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 258 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups in ratio 1:1:1-which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W)

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 8 weeks (Q8W)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be administered vedolizumab or placebo via intravenous infusion

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 124 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be
      contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
