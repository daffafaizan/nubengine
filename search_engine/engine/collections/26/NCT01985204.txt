      in the Atlas foot mountains in Morocco, an iodine deficient area. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized into intervention and control group and will receive the respective supplement for
      6 months. At baseline, midpoint and endpoint anthropometric as well as metabolic profile will
      be assessed. A health questionnaire will further be administered monthly when the tablets for
      the following month are distributed. Urine samples to determine iodine status will also be
      collected monthly.
