      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and Tai Chi Chih (TCC) on objective and subjective
      measures of sleep, on mood and fatigue, on health functioning and on two biological
      parameters, sympathovagal tone and proinflammatory cytokine activity in older adults with
      insomnia. One hundred breast cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to CBT, or TCC.
      Patients will be assessed at pre-treatment, during midtreatment, post-treatment, 3-month
      follow-up and 12-month follow-up. At all 5 assessment periods, indices of sleep quality as
      measured by sleep diaries and clinical ratings will be obtained along with measures of mood,
      health functioning, proinflammatory cytokine activity and heart rate variability (HRV). The
      pre-treatment and post-treatment assessment periods will also include all-night
      polysomnography along with nocturnal sampling of proinflammatory cytokine activity and HRV
      tone. Hence, polysomnographic measures of sleep which are coupled with nocturnal measures of
      cytokines by serial blood sampling will occur at the baseline assessment and again at the
      post-treatment assessment. During midtreatment and at 3 month follow-up and 12 month
      follow-up, we will obtain questionnaire ratings of sleep quality along with a single morning
      sample of cytokine levels.
