      proportion of target population.

      To our knowledge, there is no interactive video been developed, that can be used as
      educational tool for CRC screening in Malaysia. By developing an educational video, we hope
      that it can be used by health professionals to promote CRC screening, favoring their
      empowerment for prevention and control of disease.
