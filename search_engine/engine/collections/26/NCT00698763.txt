    
      This is a prospective, multicentre, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      2-arm parallel group study with 5 escalating dose-levels of oral levosimendan, each given for
      13-18 days. The study population will be randomly allocated either to the levosimendan group
      or to the placebo group. The double-blind phase with either placebo or levosimendan is
      preceded by a 13-day long single-blind treatment with placebo (placebo run-in). The study
      consists of 9 visits (screening visit, 7 visits during the treatment period and an
      end-of-study visit). Each subject will be on study treatment (including placebo run-in) for
      78-108 days and the duration of the study for each subject, including the screening and the
      end of study visit, is approximately 17 weeks.
