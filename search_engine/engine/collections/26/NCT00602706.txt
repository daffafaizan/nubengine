        -  To find the maximum tolerated dose of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium when given
           with fixed high-dose melphalan as a conditioning regimen for autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. (Phase I)

        -  To assess the response rates of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium
      followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium IV once between days
           -14 and -10. Patients also receive melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium at the MTD determined
           in phase I .

      Blood samples are collected periodically to determine clearance of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam
      pentasodium and bone marrow dosimetry.
