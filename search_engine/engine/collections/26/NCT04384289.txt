      advances in medical technology and surgery. To improve patient convalescence results and
      reduce rate of post-discharge readmission to hospital and unplanned post-discharge
      rehospitalization, home-care and follow-up process of patients should be managed
      successfully.

      A total of 66 elderly patients who agreed to participate in the study between November 2017
      and December 2018 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n: 33) and control (n: 33)
      groups. Patients in intervention group were given care based on the TCM until the post
      discharge 9th week starting from date of hospitalization. Patients in control group were
      given standard care services. Functional autonomy and quality of life levels of patients were
      evaluated at admission to the clinic and at the post-discharge 9th week whereas their
      repeated admission rates to the clinic and re-hospitalization rates were evaluated at post
      discharge 2nd, 6th and 9th weeks and finally 6 months. The CONSORT checklist was used to
      check the procedure.
