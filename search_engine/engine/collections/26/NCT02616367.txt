      ropivacaine injectate into the knee for acute postoperative pain relief. This provides pain
      relief for a duration of 6-18 hours after surgery. All patients in this study will also
      receive multimodal analgesia following surgery in both arms of the study. This will be the
      first study to prospectively analyze these two regimens.

      Study group 1 (ropivacaine arm) consist of 100 mL (1 mL ketorolac, 2.5 mL morphine, 28.95 mL
      normal saline, 300 mcg of epinephrine, and 200 mg ropivacaine) Study group 2 will consist of
      100 mL (one syringe with 50 mL total: 40 mL 0.25% bupivacaine, 300 mcg epinephrine, 1 mL
      ketorolac, 2.5 mL morphine, 6.5 mL normal saline) (one syringe with 50 mL total: 20 mL
      liposomal bupivacaine 30 mL normal saline). The periarticular injection will occur at the end
      of the procedure. Adequate analgesia will be defined as < 3 VAS at rest and if VAS is greater
      that 3 adjustments in oral or intravenous pain medications. Postoperatively the study team
      will evaluate for any signs of complications. Pain scores and opioid usage will be recorded
      daily while the subject is in the hospital. A quality of recovery survey will be completed at
      72 hours post injection. All subjects will be contacted by phone at day 14 to determine if
      there have been any adverse events and report their pain level.
