    
      A)Specific Primary Objective:

      1. To determine if HUK, administered within 72 hours of AIS onset is superior to regular
      treatment in improving NAA values and CBF on day 14 post stroke.

      B) Specific Secondary Objectives:

      1. To determine if HUK, administered within 72 hours of AIS onset is superior to regular
      treatment in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome on day 14 post
      stroke.

      Recruitment of study subjects:

      Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to the Neurology department in XWh (Xuan hospital)
      during the study period who are eligible to participate in this study based on criteria
      stated above will be invited to participate in this study.

      The time window for enrolment will be within 72 hours of symptom onset. All eligible patients
      will be identified by the ward and on-call Neurology/Medical teams and referred to the study
      research assistants or investigators; who will then screen the patient for participation in
      this trial.

      STUDY INTERVENTION The assigned treatment 0.15 PNA units of HUK injection or regular
      treatment will be administered once daily for 14 consecutive days soon after informed consent
      is taken and the patient is enrolled into the study.

      Follow-up Assessment:

      The neurologic deficits, global functional abilities and level of handicap will be scored
      using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at baseline and on day
      14(plus or minus 14 days).
