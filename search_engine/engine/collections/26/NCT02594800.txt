    
      This is an prospective, randomized, single-blind, single center clinical trial to evaluate
      the effect of intensive rosuvastatin therapy compared with standard rosuvastatin therapy on
      improve the cerebral perfusion in Chinese patients with atherosclerotic intracranial arterial
      stenosis between 50-99%.

      The study will enroll 44 patients and randomly divided into 2 groups: standard dose
      rosuvastatin therapy (SRT 10mg/day)and intensive dose rosuvastatin therapy (IRT 20mg/day)in a
      1:1 ratio. Both groups will be prescribed with statin based on other routine medication for
      stroke for 52 weeks. CTP will be performed at baseline and 52 weeks after treatment. Lipid
      levels and biochemical examinations will be obtained at baseline and 13, 26, 39, 52 week.
      AEs(Adverse Events)/SAEs(Serious Adverse Events) will be collected and recorded in CRF(Case
      Report Form) from the signing of informed consent throughout the study until and including
      the last visit.

      Study Endpoints: Primary endpoint: Compared with standard dose rosuvastatin therapy 10mg/day,
      the change of relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) by CTP after intensive dose rosuvastatin
      therapy 20mg/day treatment for 52 weeks.Secondary endpoints: (1) Compared with standard dose
      rosuvastatin therapy 10mg/day, the changes of relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) by CTP
      after rosuvastatin 20mg/d treatment for 52 weeks (2) Compared with standard dose rosuvastatin
      therapy 10mg/day, the changes of relative mean transit time (MTT) by CTP after rosuvastatin
      20mg/d treatment for 52 weeks (3) Compared with standard dose rosuvastatin therapy 10mg/day,
      the changes of lipid parameters (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG(Triglyceride), TC(Total Cholesterol), Apo A
      and Apo B ) after rosuvastatin 20mg/d for 52 weeks (4) Safety.
