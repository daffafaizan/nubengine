      first spoke of sarcopenia in 1989. A progressive loss of muscle mass occurs from
      approximately 40 years of age. This loss is estimated at about 8% by decade until the age of
      70 years, after which the loss increases to 15% by decade. Healthcare costs attributable to
      sarcopenia in the United States (US) in 2000 were estimated to be 18.5 billion dollars.

      It would be natural to assume a direct relationship between muscle mass and strength, but
      loss of muscle mass is not the main mechanism for loss of strength.

      Proximal femur (hip) fracture is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in the
      elderly. One-year mortality after a hip fracture ranges from 12% and 37%, with an 11%
      incidence during the first few months.

      Twenty-five percent of elderly patients with hip fracture require institutionalization, at
      least temporary, and only 40% fully recover their pre-fracture functional status.

      Nutritional therapy, particularly beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of the
      essential amino acid, leucine, has aroused great expectations. All prior studies about
      nutritional supplementation with HMB have shown an improved muscle metabolism, decreased
      protein degradation, and a significant increase in fat-free mass in both young and elderly
      people.
