    
      Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a chronic progressive disease that is the main
      cause of visual disability in elderly patients (aged over 60 years) in industrialized
      countries. Due to increased human longevity, it is expected for the number of patients with
      this disease to grow worldwide up to 288 million people by 2040. The highest risk of vision
      loss is posed by neovascular (exudative or wet ARMD) macular degeneration observed in 10-20%
      of cases. The pathological changes of ARMD are based on the increased production of the
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which affects proprioceptors located on the surface
      of endothelial cells and causes an anomalous permeability of vessels and stimulates
      neovascularization GNR-067 (JSC "GENERIUM", the Russian Federation) is a humanized
      recombinant monoclonal antibody selectively binding to the human vascular endothelial growth
      factor [VEGF-A] and is a biosimilar of of the original product Lucentis® ("Novartis Pharma
      AG", Switzerland).

      This III phase study is aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of GNR-067 (JSC "GENERIUM", the Russian Federation) and Lucentis® ("Novartis
      Pharma AG", Switzerland) in order to register of the drug GNR-067 (JSC "GENERIUM", the
      Russian Federation), a solution for intraocular injection administration, in the Russian
      Federation.

      The study included patients (n = 408) aged 50 years and older with neovascular (wet)
      age-related macular degeneration, types 1 and 2 (occult and classical) choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) with the following activity signs: accumulation of intraretinal
      and/or subretinal (under the neurosensory retina or pigment epithelium) fluid, extravasal dye
      exit from the newly formed vessels, and the presence of a subfoveal and/or juxtafoveal
      membrane and the presence of CNV foci of more than 50% of the total lesion area. With block
      randomization, the patients were divided into two groups in a 2:1 ratio
      (investigational/reference product): 272 patients to the group of the investigational product
      GNR-067 and 136 patients to the group of the reference product Lucentis®. The duration of the
      study for each patient will be approximately 52 ± 4 weeks, including a screening period (3
      weeks), treatment period and a follow-up period (4 weeks). In this study GNR-067 and
      Lucentis® will be used intravitreally once every 4 weeks (thirteen injections in total) in
      0.5 mg doses (the injection volume is 0.05 mL).
