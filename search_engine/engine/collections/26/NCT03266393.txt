    
      This is a randomized, prospective, single-center, pilot study assessing once daily Envarsus
      XR® medication efficacy, adverse events, medication non-adherence, patient-reported outcomes,
      and abbreviated pharmacokinetics/ dose finding to evaluate a population of adolescent renal
      transplant recipients while on stable tacrolimus (twice daily) and then after conversion to
      Envarsus XR® to provide critical efficacy, safety, dose-finding, adherence, and patient
      reported outcome data that could lead to adoption of Envarsus XR® as a mainstay of
      pediatric/adolescent post-transplant immunosuppression.

      Following randomization, and independent of the formulation of tacrolimus, each patient will
      have a "run-in" period of 14 days to optimize the dose to reach a tacrolimus trough level of
      4 to 10 ng/ml.

        -  Drug Administration: After randomization (to either twice daily tacrolimus or once daily
           Envarsus ®) and the "run-in" period, patients will be continued on their assigned
           tacrolimus formulation for 4 months. He/she will then be then switched to the opposite
           tacrolimus formulation. Following the switch, there will be a 14 day run-in period to
           establish the optimal trough level (4-10 ng/ml) (analogous to the first run-in period)
           and then continued on that tacrolimus formulation for 4 months.

        -  Pharmacokinetics: Irrespective of whether a patient starts on Envarsus XR® after
           randomization or is switched to Envarsus XR® after 4 months of immediate release
           tacrolimus, the dose of Envarsus XR® will be determined by using a dose conversion ratio
           targeting 0.7 (but may range from 0.66-0.8 because of dosage strengths of Envarsus XR®
           dosing formulations) relative to the immediate release formulation that he/she was
           receiving as maintenance.
