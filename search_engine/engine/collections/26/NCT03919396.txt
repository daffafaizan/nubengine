      in myopia is on the rise and approximately 80% of children are myopic by the end of
      childhood. Orthokeratology is one of the most successful myopia control methods adopting the
      strategy of peripheral defocus, in which the natural emmetropization process is harnessed by
      the myopic defocus induced by the orthokeratology lenses.Currently, Breath-O correct lenses
      are new designed ready-made orthokeratology lenses which are made of new material with higher
      elasticity as compared traditional lens material.

      A recent study has shown young children with an initial weakened central electrical signal
      from the inner retina had faster myopia progression as measured by multifocal
      electroretinogram(ERG). We will classify the slow and fast progression group based on the ERG
      results, so as to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the newly designed lenses in
      controlling myopia in children with different rates of progression.
