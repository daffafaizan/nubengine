      Pipelle or Explora curette? Currently, the instrument selected for endometrial biopsy is
      solely dependent on provider preference. This study aims to elucidate advantages and/or
      disadvantages of the Pipelle versus the Explora curette in terms of pain perceived by the
      patient, adequacy of sample, and provider ease of use to better aid in the selection of the
      appropriate device.
