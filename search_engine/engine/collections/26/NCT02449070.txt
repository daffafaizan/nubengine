      To investiage whether nicorandil treatment reduce infarct size measured by cardiac MRI at 6
      months after primary PCI

      Allocation :

        1. Nicorandil arm :

           Recieve nicorandil 4 mg i.v. before undergoing PCI, additionall 2mg i.c. just before 1st
           ballooning, additionall 2mg i.c. just before stenting, After successful PCI, 10 mg/day
           (or 5 mg/day) p.o. for 6 months.

        2. Control arm :

      Recieve standard treatment including PCI, but avoid nicoranil and adenosine.

      Follow-up and Measurement :
