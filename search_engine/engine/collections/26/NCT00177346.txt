      effectiveness of CAS with and without CP. The study population will be comprised of subjects
      with atherosclerotic, post endarterectomy restenotic or other obstructive lesions in native
      carotid arteries. Other carotid artery pathology not amenable to surgical repair (for example
      carotid artery dissection) will also be considered. Subjects at high risk for complications
      from standard CEA will be the target population for this study. High risk status will be
      confirmed by two physicians, one of whom is a vascular surgeon. Both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic subjects will be enrolled. This will ensure that the proportion of symptomatic
      subjects is the same in the two arms of the study. "Symptomatic" is defined in the exclusion
      criteria. The expected duration of this clinical trial is 3 years.

      In this study there are there are two arms that a subject may be randomized to:

      Group1: CAS with the use of the RX ACCUNET Group 2: CAS without the use of the RX ACCUNET
      This study has been designed to test whether the addition of CP enhances the safety and
      effectiveness of CAS.
