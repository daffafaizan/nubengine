      (veledimex) and INXN-2001 (Ad-RTS-hIL-12) alone and in combination with palifosfamide.

      Part 1 is the safety run-in where a safety assessment will be made after 1 cycle of therapy.

      Part 2, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to active treatment Arms A or C.

      Once the monotherapy (Arm A) is determined to be safe and tolerable, Part 1 combination
      therapy (Arm C) will begin.

      Subjects should receive six cycles of study treatment, in the absence of meeting withdrawal
      criteria.
