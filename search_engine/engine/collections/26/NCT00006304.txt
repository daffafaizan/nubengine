      therapies cannot be assessed within the time frame of most clinical trials. There is a need
      to better assess both positive and negative late outcomes and late treatment effects in
      growing children. This prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate the effects and their
      impact on children.

      Children in this study will include patients who are HIV infected, were exposed to HIV or
      anti-HIV drugs prior to or at the time of their birth, or children of patients followed at
      Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (PACTG) sites. Children will have a study visit every 3
      months through the first year of life. After age 1, children who are HIV infected will
      continue to have study visits every 3 months, while children who are HIV uninfected will have
      study visits once a year. Study assessments will include complete physical exam, medical
      history, Tanner staging, neurologic exam, growth and quality of life assessments, and
      laboratory tests such as hematology, chemistries, and urinalysis. Not all assessments will be
      performed at each study visit. Patients will be followed until age 24.
