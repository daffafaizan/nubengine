    
      Non-melanoma cutaneous carcinomas [NMSCs], predominantly squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], as
      well as basal cell carcinomas [BCCs], are the most common malignancies occurring in kidney
      transplant recipients [KTRs]. SCCs and BCCs, account for more than 90% of NMSCs in KTRs. New
      NMSCs in KTRs with a prior NMSC develop at 3-times the rate reported in non-KTRs with the
      same clinical history. The unique aggressiveness of SCCs in KTRs increases patient morbidity,
      due to the high rate of new lesions requiring treatment, frequently surgical excision. This
      non-fatal morbidity also results in significant medical costs. KTR SCCs have a greater
      potential for metastasis, and death. Reduction in the incidence and complications associated
      with SCCs, in particular, and more generally, overall NMSCs, as well as Actinic Keratoses,
      would mark a significant advance in the management of KTRs.

      Specific Aims of this study are: To evaluate the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day,
      given in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, on the total number of
      actinic keratoses which develop in stable chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history
      of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer; To demonstrate our ability to create a system for
      diagnosing, capturing, and recording all new non-melanoma skin cancers which develop in
      stable chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin
      cancer while receiving oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given in two divided doses, for
      12-months, versus matched placebo; To evaluate the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day,
      given in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, on sirtuin enzymatic
      activity in chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma
      skin cancer; To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given
      in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, in stable chronic kidney
      transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer; To evaluate
      the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given in two divided doses, for 12-months,
      versus matched placebo, on serum phosphorus concentrations in stable chronic kidney
      transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer.
