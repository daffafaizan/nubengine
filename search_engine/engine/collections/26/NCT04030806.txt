      carry out this research was estimated using GPower software. The power and standard deviation
      were estimated from previous studies (Park et al., 2015) with a similar design. The sample
      size estimate for the present research project was 13 individuals per group (Mirror Therapy
      group and control group), totalizing 26 individuals, considering a level of significance (p)
      5% and power of 80%.
