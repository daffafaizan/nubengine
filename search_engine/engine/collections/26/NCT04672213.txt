      Because TXA has been shown to significantly reduce the need for blood products during total
      joint replacement, it is now the standard of care for these procedures at many institutions.
      Oral and IV TXA have been found to be similarly efficacious in total joint replacements, but
      oral TXA is cheaper and allows for ease of repeat dosing.

      Although low preoperative hemoglobin is a risk factor for transfusion, no studies that have
      compared standard single-dose oral or IV TXA dosing to repeated oral dosing of TXA in
      patients undergoing open spine surgery. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine
      whether or not repeated dosing of oral or a different method of delivery like intravenous
      (IV) TXA reduces the post-operative reduction in hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of
      transfusions, and postoperative blood loss following open spine surgery.
