      in Latin America and directed by the Coronavirus and Liver interest group of the Latin
      American Association for the Study of the Liver (ALEH), coordinated by Dr. Marcelo Silva.
      This project has been presented to ALEH, which has considered it of high interest and will
      promote its dissemination among partners and related Associations with the aim of obtaining
      the greatest participation from the centers in the region.

      Design Observational cross-sectional study to describe the prevalence of liver disease in
      patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The administrative period of the study will be from
      04/25/20 to 12/15/20. The enrollment date of the patients will be the date of the diagnosis
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the date of end of follow-up will be the day of hospital
      discharge, referral to another center or death.

      Participating centers will identify patients who meet the selection criteria during the study
      period. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 can be made at any time during hospitalization. All
      included patients will be evaluated and treated according to the specific protocol of each
      institution. The follow-up period will run until the day of hospital discharge or death.

      A specific coded form will be prepared for data registration, which will be subsequently
      downloaded to a computerized database for subsequent analysis. The exposure variables
      included in the form will be collected by the investigating doctors.

      The following study will be performed following international recommendations for
      observational studies STROBE guidelines
