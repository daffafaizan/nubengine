      Primary

        -  To assess acute and late toxicities in patients with high-risk, locally advanced
           prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the biochemical-free survival of these patients.

        -  To assess metastasis-free survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the molecular characteristics of the tumor before treatment and correlate with
           outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 7.5 weeks.

      Beginning the week before radiotherapy, patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily for 1
      month and oral everolimus twice daily for 8.5 weeks. Beginning on the first week of
      radiotherapy, patients receive leuprolide acetate subcutaneously every 3 months for 2 years.
