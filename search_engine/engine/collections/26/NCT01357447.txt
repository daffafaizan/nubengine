      This manifestation of the disease leads to the common complaint of persistent dry cough that
      is seen in many of these patients. The investigators theorize that regular use of Pulmozyme
      will result in decreased cough and improved quality of life, by improving mucus clearance.

      Primary Objective:To determine if the use of Pulmozyme, twice a day improves cough-related
      quality of life or cough severity in patients with chronic cough due to Sjogren's disease.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the DNA content in sputum from patients with chronic cough due to Sjogren's
           disease.

        2. To determine the effect of Pulmozyme use on pulmonary function in patients with chronic
           cough due to Sjogren's disease.

        3. To determine the safety of Pulmozyme, taken twice a day in patients with chronic cough
           due to Sjogren's disease.
