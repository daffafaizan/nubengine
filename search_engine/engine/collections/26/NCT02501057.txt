      increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality.
      Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care
      patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those
      co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death
      among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance,
      reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems.
      Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health.
      This study aims to evaluate two evidence-based approaches when combined with an innovative
      smart phone application designed to help users track drinking and other aspects of health. An
      effective, easily implemented alcohol-reduction intervention could be incorporated into
      standard care in HIV clinics to help prevent or slow the progress of some medical problems in
      HIV-infected individuals, improve medication compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease risk
      behavior associated with alcohol use.
