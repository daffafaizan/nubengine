      Because TXA has been shown to significantly reduce the need for blood products during total
      joint replacement, it is now the standard of care at many institutions. Oral and intravenous
      TXA are equivalent, but oral TXA is cheaper and allows for ease of repeat dosing. Although
      low preoperative hemoglobin is a risk factor for transfusion, no studies that have compared
      standard TXA dosing to risk stratified dosing of TXA. The investigators hypothesize that a
      multi-dose TXA regimen will significantly minimize post-operative blood loss and transfusion
      requirements compared to the use of a single dose regimen.

      At the pre-operative clinic appointment and before the day of surgery, the study staff will
      assess the potential subject's eligibility. Once eligibility is established, the potential
      subject will be approached regarding their participation in this clinical trial. The
      investigators will provide 48 hours before the date of surgery to allot for questions and
      consideration of the Informed Consent document. Once all patient questions have been
      answered, patients willing to be in the study will sign the Informed Consent. Patients will
      be randomized, via standard randomization tables that provide a 1:1 distribution of subjects
      between the two groups through blocked randomization, no later than the morning of surgery to
      either of the two treatment groups: Conventional Oral TXA Group or Multi-Dose Oral TXA Group.
