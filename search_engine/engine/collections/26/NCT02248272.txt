      has been studied in several studies so far, both in healthy individuals and in individuals
      being at risk for diabetes mellitus, with or without concurrent weight loss. In addition, few
      studies have investigated the effect of different meal frequency on glycemic control in
      patients with diabetes mellitus under conditions of weight maintenance. However, the results
      regarding the ideal number of meals remain controversial.

      To our best knowledge, there is no study available that has investigated the effect of meal
      frequency on glucose and insulin metabolism in lean and obese women with PCOS, in lean and
      obese individuals with hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and in obese
      individuals with type 2 diabetes, independently of weight loss.
