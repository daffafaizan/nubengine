      combination therapy to that of oseltamivir treatment alone for hospitalised paediatric
      influenza patients. This prospective, single-blinded study included patients hospitalised for
      influenza infection aged 1 year to 18 years, at MacKay Children's Hospital, Taiwan, between
      December 2017 and December 2019. The primary outcomes were respiratory symptom severity and
      the signs that presented within hospitalisation. The durations of fever and hospital stay
      were also documented. The secondary outcome measures were serial changes in the virus titres,
      as detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Totally 54 patients were enrolled (28 in
      the control group and 26 in the combination group). There were no differences in the
      patients' baseline characteristics between the groups. The time to defervescence was
      significantly shorter in the combination group than the oseltamivir group (13.2 hours vs 32.1
      hours, p=0.002). The decrease in the virus titre was more pronounced from days 1 to 3 (log
      Δ13) in the combination group than the oseltamivir group.(log Δ13: 39% vs 19%, p=0.001). In
      paediatric settings, combination therapy may be used selectively among patients with a
      history of febrile convulsion or families anxious about the discomforts associated with the
      fever itself.
