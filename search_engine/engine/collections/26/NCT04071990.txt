      Gent) located in Belgium. A group of 80 patients and 80 live-in family members (partner,
      parent, sibling), between 18 and 65 years old. The patients with OCD will be selected based
      on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive
      disorder using the semi-structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI
      screening version 7.0.2)(60). Other inclusion criteria are (a) the OCD patient with a score
      of at least 16 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), (b) patient and family
      member fluent in Dutch and (c) both willing to attend all treatment sessions together. To
      maximize the generalizability of our sample, we did not exclude patients if they had comorbid
      mood or anxiety disorders, as long as OCD was the principal diagnosis. Patients and family
      members will be recruited before randomization, because the aim of this study is to
      investigate the impact of the involvement of the family in the CBGT. At the start of the
      experiment we will ask patients and their family members to sign the informed consent.
      Randomization occurs after oral and written informed consent and patients and family members
      will be notified about the treatment condition after randomization. After randomization the
      patient and family member will be allocated to one of the two treatment arms: (a) CBGT with
      involvement of family of family-based CBGT (FB-CBGT) (intervention) or (b) CBGT without
      involvement of family (control). The CBGT program exists of a fixed 12-week protocol,
      involving psycho-education, exposure and response prevention (ERP), cognitive restructuring,
      and the discussion about the family system.
