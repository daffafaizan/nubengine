      to study the transplacental passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the pregnancy outcomes
      (miscarriage, intra uterine fetal death, medical termination of pregnancy or living birth)
      during COVID-19 pandemic. The biological and tissue collection will be made up of systematic
      samples taken from parturient women and their pregnancy outcome at the time of their arrival
      at the maternity unit to deliver whatever their term and pregnancy outcome. This inclusion
      will concern all pregnant women, both symptomatic and asymptomatic positive COVID-19 women,
      and negative COVID-19 women. All women included will have a serological test to check their
      immunity status to SARS-CoV-2 in order to study pregnant women with an unnoticed COVID-19
      infection during their pregnancy. The inclusion time will extend from the epidemic period
      until a year after, in order to document the outcomes of pregnant women potentially exposed
      to SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. Samples analyses will be carried out after the epidemic
      peak to not overload laboratories in times of crisis.

      The challenge is to have a better knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological and virological
      characteristics in particular its involvement in maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality, and
      to better understand the organs affected and the pathways of contamination within this
      particular mother-child duo.
