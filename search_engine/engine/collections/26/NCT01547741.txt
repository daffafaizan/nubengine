    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) regimen is non-inferior to the
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens in terms of invasive disease-free survival
           (DFS) by combining B-49 data with the docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC)
           and TC arms of NSABP B-46-I/US Oncology Research, Inc.(USOR) 07132 and the data from
           USOR 06-090.

      Secondary

        -  To determine rates of DFS-ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for the TC and
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To determine rates of overall survival (OS) for the TC and anthracycline-based
           chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To determine rates of recurrence-free interval (RFI) for the TC and anthracycline-based
           chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity associated with each of the regimens.

        -  To determine the role of TOP2A in prognosis and prediction of degree of benefit from
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy over TC. (exploratory)

        -  To develop predictive markers for benefit from doxorubicin. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter randomized study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of positive nodes (0 vs 1-3 vs 4-9 vs 10+) and hormone-receptor status (estrogen receptor
      [ER] and/or progesterone receptor [PgR] positive vs ER and PgR negative). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
