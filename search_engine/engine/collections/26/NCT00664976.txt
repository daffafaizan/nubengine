      treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of treatment resistant depression (TRD) in bipolar
      disorder. The purpose of the trial is to document the effect size, relative effect size and
      adverse effects of ECT in this condition. A specific purpose is to gain more knowledge about
      the effect on cognitive function.

      In a national collaboration project the investigators will compare the antidepressant and
      cognitive effects of ECT with the effects of a drug treatment in use for this condition; a
      treatment algorithm combining antidepressants, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic drugs. The
      investigators will use a neuropsychological test battery to disclose possible ECT induced
      changes in cognitive function, and investigate any long-lasting changes.

      In addition, several studies have implemented inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of
      depression; inflammatory processes will be examined as a function of changes in clinical
      status and of treatment modality.

      The study is a national collaboration, using the Bipolar Research And Innovation Network-
      BRAIN, and all the patients are included in the BRAIN-study. The study is funded by Helse
      Vest RHF, Regional research network on mood disorders (MoodNet) and Norwegian hospitals.
