      new onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Although the exact
      pathophysiology is unclear, it's related to abnormal placentation and subsequent vascular
      pathology. Endothelial dysfunction was found to play a significant role in the risk of
      cardiovascular event in general. Moreover, few studies found a relation between endothelial
      dysfunction and PET. There are several methods for the assessment of endothelial function,
      with Peripheral Artery Tone (PAT) plethysmography being an emerging non-invasive promising
      technique. However, scarce data exists regarding the effectiveness of PAT plethysmography use
      in women with PET and whether adverse results are found compared to healthy gravidas.

      Thus, we aimed to assess endothelial function using PAT plethysmography in women with PET and
      compare their results to both healthy gravidas and those with only gestational hypertension.
