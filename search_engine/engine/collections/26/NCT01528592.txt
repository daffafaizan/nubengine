      "off" state (PD medications withheld for approximately 12 hours prior to the scan). Following
      the initial scan, the subject will receive 125% of his or her usual daily morning dose of PD
      medications which is calculated as levodopa dose equivalents (LDE) and is given as
      carbidopa-levodopa. The subject will then wait for an hour allowing for the medication to
      begin working. During this time the subject will complete cognitive assessments,
      questionnaires regarding the history and current state of PD, and motor assessments. The
      subject will then undergo a second MRI scan of approximately 25-30 minutes. The subject after
      completing the second MRI scan is free to leave. The entire study is approximately 2 and 1/2
      hours long.
