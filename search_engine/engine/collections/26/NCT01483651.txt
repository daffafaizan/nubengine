      pancreas) insulin and glucagon infusion system since 2005 and are part of the Juvenile
      Diabetes Research Foundation Artificial Pancreas Consortium. As part of our studies, we give
      small doses of glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia. As we assessed the success and failure of
      glucagon administration during these studies, we found the use of glucagon reduced the
      frequency of hypoglycemia by about 75%. However, the fact that approximately 25% of
      administrations of glucagon are ineffective remains a concern.

      The primary question to be addressed by this study is, in the setting of low dose
      subcutaneous glucagon administration, how do plasma glucagon and plasma insulin
      quantitatively interact? In other words, as the rate of insulin administration is increased,
      how much more glucagon is necessary to overcome the effect of insulin to prevent
      hypoglycemia? This study is designed to address this question. Subjects will be brought in to
      a Legacy Hospital for four 10 hour experiments on each of four separate days. On each study
      day, there will be a continuous infusion of a different rate of IV Regular insulin in order
      to achieve different steady state free insulin levels. At each insulin level, there will be
      four subcutaneous glucagon doses given. Octreotide will be infused by IV at a constant rate
      to suppress endogenous production of glucagon. A stable glucose isotope will also be infused
      to allow for measurement of hepatic glucose production and glucose turnover. Arterialized
      venous blood glucose will be measured by the HemoCue Glucose 201 Analyzer.
