      criteria. The planned treatment was given to the participants after enrollment. Objective
      remission rate, disease control rate, tumor size, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed,
      to assess the sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox could or couldn't effectively control the progress of metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.
