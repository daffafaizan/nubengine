    
      The objective of this study is multi-site, standardized observation and characterization of
      kidney stone patients.

      Furthermore, an adequate structure should be established for the execution of studies with
      kidney stone patients, in order to then, if necessary, develop recommendations for useful
      monitoring or prophylactic measures, as well as new treatment options for kidney stone
      patients.

      A control group of 250 stone-free volunteers matching patients cohort participants for sex
      and age started recruitment in October 2017 and will serve the purpose of comparison in
      future studies.
