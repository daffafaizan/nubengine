    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single
      center study designed to evaluate the safety/ tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of UCB5857 following oral administration of single ascending doses
      (SAD) in healthy subjects (Part 1) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy and
      mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects (Part 2).

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of UCB5857
      when given as single oral doses in healthy subjects and as ascending multiple oral doses in
      healthy subjects and mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects.
