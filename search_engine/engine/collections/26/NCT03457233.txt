    
      Induction of ovulation cycle:

        1. Gonadotrophines is started on day 2 with HMG(merional, IBSA) ,until the day of HCG
           administration(choriomon,IBSA10000IU) with starting dose 300 to 450iu.

        2. GNRH antagonist (cetrorelix 0,25mg s.c, cetrotide, serono laboratories, Aubonne
           Switzerland) is given using flexible protocol, it is given when at least one follicle
           reaches size 14 mm to prevent premature lutenization ,until the day of hCG
           administration

        3. Ovarian ultrasound scans were performed using a 5.0-9.0 MHZ multi frequency trans
           vaginal probe (mindrayDP-5)to assess the ovarian response till the mature follicles
           reach18-20mm when hCG administration 10000 IU is given.Serum E2 level is done on day of
           HCG trigger.

        4. Trans vaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is performed 34-36 hours after hCG
           injection

        5. Progesterone vaginal tablets (Prontogest,IBSA) are administrated 400mg twice daily as
           luteal support from the day of oocytes retrieval.

        6. Ultrasound -guided fresh embryo transfer is performed on day 2 or 3 after fertilization.

        7. Serum hCG assessment to detect pregnancy is performed at 14 days after embryo transfer
           .if positive(chemical pregnancy) ,women undergo trans -vaginal ultrasonography 2 weeks
           after, to confirm fetal pulsations as well as number of gestational sacs (clinical
           pregnancy).

        8. The implantation rate is calculated as the number of viable embryos divided by the
           number of transferred embryos multiplied by 100
