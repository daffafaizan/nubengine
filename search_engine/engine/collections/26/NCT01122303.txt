      study. Twenty to forty mL of peripheral venous blood is drawn and the serum is separated. The
      serum is diluted with Balanced Salt Solution (BSS) to provide 20% ASE. The levels of EFG,
      TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and fibronectin in 20% ASE are quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA) method and are compared between the two groups of samples. To study the
      stability of these serum factors under storage conditions used in clinical settings, 20% ASE
      are stored at different temperature and time i.e., at 4 ํC for 1 week and 1 month, and at -20
      ํC for 1, 3 and 6 month. Their levels are then measured following each storage condition.
