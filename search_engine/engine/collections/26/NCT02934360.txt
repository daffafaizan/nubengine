      TR(ACE) Assay measurements will be compared to the standard of care physician clinical
      assessment and RECIST 1.1 criteria evaluation relative to the previous visit. Significant
      changes in serial TR(ACE) Assay measurements are hypothesized to correlate with disease
      progression or response.
