      with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 600 participants
      (300 participants per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at approximately 75 study
      centers to receive either oral 0.25 mg CB-5945 BID or oral matching placebo BID for the
      12-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All randomized
      participants will be evaluated for clinical response for duration of their study
      participation. All participants will be followed for safety for 4 weeks after last dose of
      the study medication, regardless of when they discontinue study medication. The clinical
      study report for this study includes pooled results for studies 5945-OIC-12-02 (NCT01901302)
      5945-OIC-12-03 (NCT01901328), and 5945-OIC-12-04 (NCT01901341).
