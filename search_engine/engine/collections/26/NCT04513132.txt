      high-definition active stimulation (HD-tDCS) and sham stimulation (SH-tDCS). Each included
      participant will be given informed consent and then randomly assigned to different montage of
      stimulation. Participants are blind to the tDCS montage. Researchers in this study will
      include clinical evaluators, laboratory inspectors, tDCS operators, and statistical analysts.
      Before unblinding, each group of researchers will have no access to the information collected
      by the other groups. For example, except the tDCS operators, no one knows which stimulus
      montage any of the participants receive. The sessions of tDCS will be conducted twice daily
      for 5 consecutive days, and twice sessions of a day will be separated by 3 hours at least.
      Clinical assessments and laboratory tests will be administered at baseline, at the end of the
      last session, and at the three-month node after the end of tDCS treatment. After the
      three-month observation, first stage unblinding will be conducted. At this moment, tDCS
      operators will provide the groups of A and B, but no corresponding montage, to the
      statistical analysts. After analyzing the differences between the two groups, second stage
      unblinding will be performed and the results of the clinical trial will be further analyzed
      by revealing the corresponding stimulus montage of each group. This study will be implemented
      at a single center, the Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC).
