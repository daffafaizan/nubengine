      multi-agent chemotherapeutic or biochemotherapeutic approaches. Based on this, less toxic and
      more effective treatment options are needed.

      Ofatumumab has proven to be effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL.
      Previous studies have shown that ofatumumab is more effective than rituximab at activating
      complement and utilizing complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

      This study will investigate treating relapsed/refractory CLL patients with FFP in combination
      with ofatumumab. The hypothesis is that patients with CLL have low complement levels and when
      they get treated with humanized antibodies like rituximab or ofatumumab these levels drop
      even further. Both these antibodies utilize complement to exert their cytotoxic effect, thus
      we hypothesize that by replacing complement levels with FFP we can enhance the efficacy of
      ofatumumab.
