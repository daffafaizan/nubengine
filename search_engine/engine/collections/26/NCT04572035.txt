      reducing depressive symptoms among students with mild-to-moderate depression. This study has
      three treatment arms: exercise; exercise + self-compassion; exercise + behavioral coaching.
      Each participant will be invited to attend 3 supervised group-based sessions each week either
      virtually through Zoom or in-person at the Exercise and Health Psychology Lab for 10 weeks.
      Senior undergraduate Kinesiology students will facilitate a personalized exercise program
      adapted to the participant's abilities, teach participants how to exercise, and gauge
      exercise intensity in a safe manner. The CANMAT guidelines will be implemented, with the
      program consisting of supervised moderate-intensity exercise sessions lasting 30-minutes
      (plus 10-minutes for warm-up and cool-down), 3 times weekly, for a period of 10-weeks.
      Participants will start exercising at a low intensity and progressively increase until they
      are consistently exercising at a moderate intensity. The exercise intervention will integrate
      moderate intensity aerobic and resistance training activities while accounting for the
      physical abilities and interests of the individual participant and theh group.The exercise +
      psychoeducation groups will receive equal contact supplemental individual manualized
      strategies each session (+15-20 minutes) centered either on behaviour change strategies
      (i.e., action planning, implementation intentions, relapse prevention, and goal setting) or
      self-compassion strategies (i.e., mindfulness, self-directed kindness meditations, and
      writing tasks). The manualized psychoeducation sessions will be group-based with the trainer
      that is supervising the exercise sessions. Participants will fill out surveys before, after
      and three months following the intervention period.
