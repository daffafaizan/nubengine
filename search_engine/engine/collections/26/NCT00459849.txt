      tumor control in most cases. However, local failure has been reported in a substantial
      proportion of patients. Since local failure greatly increases the risk of metastatic death,
      identifying and correcting the causes of local treatment failure are of paramount importance.
      Poor plaque localization is an important contributing factor to local failure. With the aid
      of intraoperative ultrasonography, most malpositioned plaques can be identified and
      readjusted at the time of plaque insertion. However, little is known about plaque movement
      during the 4-5 days of brachytherapy, which could also contribute to local failure. To
      address this question, we perform intraoperative B-scan ultrasonography at the time of
      iodine-125 radioactive plaque insertion and removal in uveal melanoma patients.
