      at times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes and TG was at time 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
      and 6 hours.

        1. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and TG were analyzed by biochemical autoanalyzer. The
           area under the curve (AUC) changes in blood glucose, TG were computed by the trapezoidal
           method.

        2. Glycemic index(GI): the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a
           test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food
           containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the
           reference.
