      the world are not planned, most of them occurring in developing countries. Long-lasting
      reversible contraceptives such as the etonogestrel implant represent an option for the
      reduction of unwanted pregnancies, especially among patients at risk for a short
      intergestational period. In addition to preventing an undesired pregnancy, these methods have
      an impact on the reduction of the maternal-fetal morbidity-mortality known to be associated
      with these short intervals, also minimizing the malnutrition and the cycle of poverty caused
      by multiparity.

      On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, we will selected 40 puerperae aged 18 to 35
      years at the Low Risk Prenatal Care Program of the University Hospital of Ribeirão Preto,
      University of São Paulo (HC-FMRP). The subjects will be randomized to two types of treatment
      (etonogestrel-releasing implant to be inserted 24 to 48 hours after delivery or 150 mg
      medroxyprogesterone administered every three months starting 6 weeks after delivery). Blood
      samples (40 mL) will be collected in a single procedure from these patients and stored for
      later determination of multiple hemostatic and metabolic variables at 24-48 hours and at 6
      and 12 weeks after delivery. Data on maternal and neonatal clinical parameter will be also
      collected.
