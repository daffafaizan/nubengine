      aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using the hemostatic intrauterine suction cup for
      patients who present primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 500ml) after a vaginal delivery requiring
      administration of Nalador®. We will evaluate the placement of hemostatic suction cup in the
      uterus, the application of vacuum and its removal from the uterus.
