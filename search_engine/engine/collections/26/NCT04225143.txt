      is twofold. On the one hand, symptoms such as incontinence or retention affect quality of
      life and comfort. On the other hand, complications such as urinary tract infections or renal
      failure threaten health and even involve patients' vital prognosis. Several therapies are
      used to treat these urinary disorders including transcutaneous or percutaneous posterior
      tibial nerve stimulation (SNTP). SNTP is used in treating symptoms of bladder overactivity.
      This treatment is most often used unilaterally, but can be used bilaterally.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bilateral stimulation of the tibial
      nerve compared to unilateral stimulation in neurological bladder disorders.

      50 patients will be included, in two arms by randomization, one arm of 25 patients will be
      treated by unilateral stimuylation and the other arm of 25 patients will be trated by
      bilateral stimulation.

      They will be evaluate at 3, 6 and 12 months by auto questionnaire and the effectivess of each
      therapy will be compared.
