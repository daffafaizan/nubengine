      the DASH diet in a free-living situation; (b) considering the DASH diet alone and in
      combination with a behavioral weight loss program including aerobic exercise; (c) examining
      the impact of diet and exercise on cardiac, metabolic, and vascular function, including
      measures of arterial stiffness, endothelial function, baroreflex control, body composition,
      insulin resistance, cardiac hemodynamics, and left ventricular (LV) geometry and mass; and
      (d) following patients for one year to determine the longer term impact of the interventions
      on BP, body weight, and cardiovascular function.
