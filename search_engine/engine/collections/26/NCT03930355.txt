    
      The Turkish National Perioperative Transfusion Study (TULIP TS) was conducted by The Turkish
      Society of Anesthesiologists' Multicentre Clinical Trials Network.

      TULIP TS included 6481 patients undergoing major elective surgery, from 61 study sites across
      the country.

      Transfusion practices of clinicians working at diverse surgical fields; differences between
      current transfusion practices and patient blood management strategies; the areas for
      improvement and the obstacles that could prevent change were evaluated and identified.

      Data relevant to perioperative transfusion rates of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and
      platelets, the indications for transfusion and postoperative adverse outcomes including 1
      month all cause mortality was obtained.

      The TULIP TS group aims to collect further data concerning 1 year all cause mortality of the
      same patient population and to evaluate adverse outcomes in transfused and non transfused
      patients.
