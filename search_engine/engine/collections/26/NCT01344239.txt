      hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce intestinal and
      pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
      repair.The primary outcomes included the biomarkers reflecting intestinal injury (serum
      intestinal fatty acid binding protein, endotoxin levels and diamine oxidase activity) and the
      variables reflecting pulmonary injury (arterial-alveolar oxygen tension ratio,
      alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference and respiratory index). In addition, the severity
      of intestinal and pulmonary injury was assessed with different scoring methods, respectively.
      Markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation were measured as well.
