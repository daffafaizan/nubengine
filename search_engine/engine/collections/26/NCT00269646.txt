      rather a means to improve health. Several studies have been published suggesting that
      low-carbohydrate diets may be preferable to low-fat diets for weight loss and in terms of
      some health markers. On the other hand, considerable evidence suggests that low-carbohydrate
      diets, high in fat, are associated with a number of adverse health outcomes. The health
      benefits of high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets have also been demonstrated. This study is
      designed to assess the differences between the two different dietary strategies in terms of a
      number of health outcomes. Participants will consume, in random order, a
      non-calorie-restricted low-carbohydrate and a non-calorie-restricted high-carbohydrate,
      high-fiber diet for one month, with a 4-6 week washout period in between.
