      volumes.

      Methods: Seventy five patients with acute discogenic pain were included in the study.The
      patients were randomly assigned to three groups. All patients received a single epidural dose
      of triamcinolone [80 mg] and 12.5 mg bupivacaine combination. The patients in Group 1, Group
      2 and Group 3 received a volume of 10 mL, 15 mL, and 20 mL by epidural injections,
      respectively. The efficacy of treatment was assessed with VAS (visual analog scale) [O= no
      pain, 10 = unbearable pain], SLET(straight leg elevation test) [0° = worst, 85° = best], and
      Oswestry Disability Index; ODI [0% to 20%:minimal disability , 80% to 100%:bed bound
      patients] before and 2 weeks after the EPSI.
