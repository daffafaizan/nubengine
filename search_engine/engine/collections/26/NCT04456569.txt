    
      This is a single center, two-arm, open label, pilot study to assess feasibility and safety
      and obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of geniculate artery embolization in reducing
      pain compared to a control group undergoing conservative presurgical management. The 20
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 10 in 1:1 allocation. One group will
      have embolization of the geniculate artery branches and standard of care while the other will
      have only the standard care. Following the completion of the 10 participants in each arm, a
      safety and data review will be undertaken (Visit 4 in the GAE group and Visit 2 of the SOC).
      The data will be assessed regarding the trends between the groups as they relate to
      KOOS/WOMAC pain scale, MRI / Xray evaluation of OA, and presence of inflammatory biomarkers.
