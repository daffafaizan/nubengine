      Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem in our society with potential for significant
      morbidity and mortality. One of the treatments for LBP, opioid therapy, has been increasingly
      utilized for noncancerous pain,1 and has a 4.2% prevalence in the United States alone.2 The
      long term use of opioids carries its own risk for adverse events and risk of addiction.3
      Thus, with the lack of evidence based research for treatments of LBP, the rising epidemiology
      of LBP in the US, the rise in cost of medical care, along with the potential risks of opioid
      therapy, our attention needs to be drawn to find more affordable alternatives.

      Our study proposes to evaluate whether an inelastic lumbar brace will reduce chronic opioid
      use in the chronic low back pain population. The specific aims of this project are to perform
      a pilot study to assess the feasibility of this project and plan for a larger randomized
      controlled trial. Additional long-term goals of this study are to assess the effect of an
      inelastic lumbar brace in a chronic LBP population, and if there is a significant decrease in
      opioid use and subsequent control or reduction of pain. Secondary endpoints will note
      improvement in functional outcomes and other quality of life measures. The findings of this
      preliminary study conducted at the VA facility will provide data to perform a large
      multi-center randomized controlled trial and prepare for a NIH proposal to study other
      benefits of inelastic lumbar bracing.

      in-elastic lumbar brace group (BG), elastic abdominal binder (EG), and a control group [no
      brace] (CG) in the treatment of chronic low back pain patients are prescribed chronic opioid
      medications with follow-up monitoring up to 12 months.
