      adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Biologic plausibility rests on similarities in
      pathophysiology of the two conditions. The drug (efalizumab) will be administered according
      to the dosing approved for plaque psoriasis for a period of 24 weeks. The subjects will
      self-administer efalizumab weekly and measurements will be performed on a monthly basis.
      Efalizumab is not being compared to placebo or other drugs.
