      cases, the condition is recurrent and can result in serious psychological impairment. A high
      number of depressed adolescents never receive treatment; therefore, it is crucial to develop
      prevention programs for this disorder that are effective and can be easily disseminated. This
      study will evaluate and compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and
      supportive/expressive (S/E) therapy in preventing depressive symptoms in adolescents.

      This study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive six sessions
      of CBT, S/E therapy, or standard depression education over 2 years. The CBT intervention will
      focus on reducing negative thoughts and increasing engagement in pleasant activities. S/E
      therapy is designed to allow adolescents to express their negative emotions and talk about
      recent stressful events in a supportive environment of their peers. Surveys and psychiatric
      interviews will be completed by all participants and their parents at the beginning and the
      end of the study. The surveys and interviews will assess depressive symptoms.
