      1. Quantitative study

      Study of comparative prospective cohort clustered in two parallel groups:

      Group 'Telemedicine': establishments providing care for the dependent elderly (EHPAD in
      french) equipped for telemedicine (teleconsultation, casualty) as part of the regional
      project of the Aquitaine Regional Agency of Heath telemedicine device deployment.

      Control group: Defined and equipped for telemedicine EHPAD after matching on the number of
      residents, the GMP (average weighted GIR : "Groupes Iso Ressources" = score to reflects the
      average level of dependency of residents of a residential care facility for the elderly), the
      PMP (weighted average PATHOS = an evaluation system set up by the National Union of Clinical
      Gerontology and the Medical Service of the National Fund for Health Insurance for Salaried

      The rate of unscheduled hospitalizations will be collected during follow-up visits in
      clinical departments of the healthcare of the Gironde (french department) by a research
      staff.

      2 Qualitative study In the Group of nursing homes with telemedicine, said group
      "Telemedicine", will be identified four long-term care facilities, selected according to
      their degree of use of telemedicine (ratio number of teleconsultation per month / number of
      beds) (EHPAD 2 strong users, 2 nursing homes) low users) within these four long-term care
      facilities will be carried out observations of field and in-depth interviews with
