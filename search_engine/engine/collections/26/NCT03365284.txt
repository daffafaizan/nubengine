      participants will receive total knee arthroplasty, who will be randomly assigned into
      experiment or control group. Smart Kneebrace will be used for the patients during the
      rehabilitation for the patients in experiment group, while the patients in the control group
      will not receive such a smart kneebrace. Postoperative joint angles as well as visual analog
      scale pain score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index knee
      society score will be estimated before operation and at 6/12 weeks after operation.
