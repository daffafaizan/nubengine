      Exercise and Nutrition Group (ENG) or a Control Group (CG). The women received step-by-step
      instructions on how to complete a consecutive 3-day food record (including two week-days and
      one weekend day) and an exercise log for 7 days using a pedometer (YAMAX SW-200 Digi-Walker)
      to determine steps/day. The information and instruction were delivered to the women in
      English or Arabic. Body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm,
      respectively. Women came to the lab after a 12 hour fast and a blood sample was drawn. Waist
      and hip measurements were taken along with resting blood pressure. Estimated fitness levels
      was measured by a trained kinesiologist using a Step Test (Siconolfi et al. 1985). All
      baseline measurements, including the 3-day food intake record and the 7-day pedometer step
      count log were repeated at the end of the 12-week intervention in both groups. The ENG group
      attended a supervised women-only exercise program that presented Arabic music and traditional
      dance steps (the Lebanese Dabka) three times a week in the London Muslim Mosque Gym and
      received nutrition education over the 12 weeks, one session per week.
