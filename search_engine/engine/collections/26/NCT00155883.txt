      demonstrated that weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin
      is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Our in
      vitro and clinical studies suggested that long (24 hours or more) infusion of 5-FU/leucovorin
      may, compared with the conventional bolus regimens, enhance its anti-tumor activity in
      gastric cancer by prolonging suppression of thymidylate synthase, the target enzyme of 5-FU
      cytotoxicity. Docetaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, has good single-agent activity against gastric
      cancer, with a tumor response rate around 20 to 24%. Preliminary clinical data indicate that
      a biweekly administration of docetaxel will reduce the incidence of neutropenia and asthenia,
      two most bothersome side effects of tri-weekly and weekly docetaxel, respectively, while
      maintaining its anti-tumor activity. This phase II trial is designed to test the efficacy and
      toxicity of biweekly docetaxel and 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin as
      first-line therapy for patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer.
