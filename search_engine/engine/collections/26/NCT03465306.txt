      problem except obesity were randomized into an experimental and a control group. Forty-five
      people in the experimental group were connected with the therapist using digital healthcare
      apps, so they got daily feedbacks and assignments for 8 weeks. Twenty-five people in the
      control group also used digital healthcare apps but they were asked to do self-care without
      intervention.
