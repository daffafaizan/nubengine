      subcostal TAP block (n=56) or not (n=56), in addition to a standard postoperative analgesic
      regimen comprising of IV fentanyl-based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and NSAIDs as
      required. At the end of surgery, the TAP group patients will receive bilateral subcostal TAP
      block under ultrasound guidance with 15ml of 0.375% ropivacaine bilaterally. Each patient was
      assessed by a blinded investigator at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. The primary
      outcome is total fentanyl consumption at 24 h after surgery.
