        -  Identify tumor antigens that induce a humoral response in patients with cancer.

        -  Identify tumor-secreted proteins by special analysis in culture, and evaluate their
           expression patterns in tumors and preneoplastic lesions to further assess their
           potential specificity.

        -  Determine serum positivity and specificity of potential markers for early detection of
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy participants undergo blood collection. Patients with suspected or newly
      diagnosed disease undergo a second blood collection between 4-10 weeks after surgery (but
      before any additional cytotoxic therapy or radiotherapy) provided they had a surgical
      resection with negative margin. All patients are asked questions about family history of
      cancer, the development of their cancer, other medical history, past and present smoking
      history, and menstrual period for females.

      DNA is extracted from the blood and from patient tumor tissue samples obtained during
      surgery. Immunohistochemistry (including polymerase chain reaction) and in situ hybridization
      are used to analyze protein expression patterns, after proteins are identified by mass
      spectrometry and amino acid sequencing.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,150 patients and 1,200 healthy participants will be accrued
      for this study.
