      tumors using a group sequential adaptive treatment assignment. Patients will be allocated to
      different dose levels in small cohorts and will receive one single dose application on Day 1,
      followed by a repeated dosing period. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of Angiocal® when administered intravenously to patients with solid
      tumors. The secondary objectives of the study are the characterization of the pharmacodynamic
      response, evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of Angiocal®, observation of tumor
      response.
