    
      This is a phase II, single center, prospective, single arm, investigational study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of severe lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH in patients with prostate size greater than 90
      grams that either refuse surgical treatment or are considered poor candidates for traditional
      surgical therapy.

      30 patients will be enrolled in the single treatment arm with follow-up for no less than 12
      months.

      The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility will be determined.
      Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive PAE with Embosphere Microspheres within
      4 weeks of screening and transrectal ultrasound. After treatment, patients will return for
      follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post PAE. At each of these
      visits, patients will complete IPSS and IIEF questionnaires, undergo a physical exam, and
      perform a medication review. Repeat TRUS and urodynamic testing will be performed at the 6
      month and 12 month post PAE follow-up visit.
