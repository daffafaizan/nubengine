      consent, completing questionnaires, a medical history, modified physical exam and
      psychological interview to identify stressors, anxiety, depression and other conditions.

      The second visit is the MRI visit (both functional and structural) and also will take about
      90 minutes, with the scanning lasting about 45 minutes. There are questionnaires and a
      measure of skin conductance also.

      We have added a single stool sample for microbiota analysis and a food frequency
      questionnaire in the healthy control and IBS populations.
