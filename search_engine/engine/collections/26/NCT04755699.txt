      administered to properly map the area in relation to intended movements. Once mapping for
      placement is completed, the study team will proceed with administering electrical stimulation
      with the investigational stimulator to evoke specific movements. In order to facilitate the
      connectivity of these electrodes with the skin, electroconductive gels, lotions, creams, and
      sold hydrogels may be used.

      The improvement of the precision, specificity, and extent of functional movements over the
      course of focused electrical stimulation sessions for various electrical stimulation
      amplitudes at key locations will be assessed visually and through electromyography. The grip
      strength and evoked pressures at the limbs will also be measured using sensors placed at
      those locations. The specificity and quantification of the various movements will be assessed
      with a motion tracking device as well.

      The study will use the following clinical tests and graded tasks, as needed, to assess
      changes in functional movement over time: Range of Movement Evaluation; Spasticity Reduction
      Evaluation; Sensory Perception Evaluation; Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength,
      Sensibility, and Prehension; Jebsen-Taylor Test; Action Research Arm Test; Chedoke Arm and
      Hand Activity Inventory; Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Scale; Wolf Motor Function Test; Just
      Noticeable Weight Test; Grip Strength / Finger Strength Assessments; Fugl-Meyer Assessment;
      Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement; and Object Transfer Tests (including 9-Hole Peg
      & Cup/Cone/Ball Transfer). All of these tests and exams have been validated, and involve
      participants performing simple movement tasks or identifying a physical sensation.
