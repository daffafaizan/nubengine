      is a well-established technique. Opioids are extensively used as an adjunct to local
      anesthetics in neuraxial blockade to enhance the duration of postoperative analgesia.
      However, worrisome adverse effects like pruritus, urinary retention, postoperative vomiting
      and respiratory depression limit its use. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      effectiveness of Intrathecal dexamethasone as adjunct to local anesthetics.
