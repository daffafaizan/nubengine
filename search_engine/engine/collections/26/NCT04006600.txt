      low rectal cancers . A colo-rectal anastomosis under peritoneal reflection is, most of the
      time, protected by a temporary loop stoma to decrease the risk and severity of anastomotic
      morbidity. This stoma, which is intended to be temporary, appears to be permanent in 6 to 32%
      of cases in the literature. The main risk factor being anastomotic leakage. Two major risk
      factors for anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery are " male sex " and " Body mass
      index ", which are responsible of a higher anatomical difficulty (Narrow pelvis and bulky
      mesorectal fat) Studies focused on surgical difficulties usually evaluated criteria such as,
      total surgery duration, blood loss or surgeon's subjective evaluation. The investigators of
      this retrospective study hypothesize that when a stoma,primarily intended to be temporary, is
      not reversed after a long (2 years) post operative delay, it all comes to surgical
      difficulties and that these surgical difficulties are essentially represented by anatomical
      constraints. Therefore, the objective of this study is to look for a statistical link between
      permanent stoma and intraoperative difficulty represented by pelvic anatomical constraints.
