      in West Indies compared to other American countries. Most represented histological type is
      squamous carcinoma and several risk factors are involved , including tobacco exposure.
      Moreover, it is now clear that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a causal factor in the
      development of HNSCCs : as many as 5 to 10% of tumors are induced by HPV in the world, and it
      is responsible of 25,9% of HN tumors. HPV 16 is the most involved (87%). However, HPV
      epidemiology is different in West Indies with the implication of various genotypes. Detection
      of HPV infection can be achieved through several methods such as polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) or RNAscope, which is a new reliable precise technique which reflects the
      transcriptional activity of the virus. The differences between the genotype of HPV involved
      within both populations need to be consider to better identify therapeutic targets.Studying
      the microenvironment may allow a better understanding of anti-tumoral immunity and may help
      patient selection in order to achieved better responses to immunotherapy.
