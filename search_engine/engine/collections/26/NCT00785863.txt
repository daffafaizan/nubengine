      There are studies, both experimental 1-3 and clinical 4;5, which indicate that remifentanil
      after end of infusion trigger enhanced pain experience and enhanced opioid consumption
      postoperatively.

      Therefore it is important to look at possibilities to block this enhanced pain experience
      (opioid induced hyperalgesia - OIH). Ketamin has demonstrated to block this effect 5;6
      through the NMDA receptor. Unfortunately ketamin has some seriously side-effects like
      hallucinations, and is therefore not suitable in ordenary clinical use.

      Recently, it has been demonstrated that parecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor) can prevent
      remifentanil-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia in a study on healthy volunteers.7 COX-2
      inhibitors have some disadvantages because of the longterm adverse effects like cardiac
      arrest. Therefore it would be of interest to look at a COX-1 preferring NSAID, like
      ketorolac, to see if also non-selective NSAIDs can partly block remifentanil-induced
      postinfusion hyperalgesia.

      To investigate this and to provoke pain and secondary hyperalgesia we use an intradermal
      electrical pain model which is well established.1;7-9 Detailed description of this model look
      at reference 7. H0 : Parecoxib prevents remifentanil postinfusion secondary hyperalgesi.
      Ketorolac does not prevent remifentanil postinfusion secondary hyperalgesi HA : Parecoxib and
      ketorolac prevent remifentanil postinfusion secondary hyperalgesi.
