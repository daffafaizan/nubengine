      enrollment, they will be randomized to either the CMV risk-reduction intervention or an
      attention-matched control stress-reduction group stratified by their CMV serostatus.

      Women in both groups will attend an individualized behavioral skills session, watch a short
      video, receive a take-home packet, receive weekly text messages for 12 weeks that reinforce
      the experimental and control health messages, and attend follow-up visits at 6 and 12 weeks.
      Saliva, urine, vaginal, and blood specimens will be collected at enrollment and 6 and 12
      weeks follow-up visits. Additionally, at-home saliva and vaginal specimen collection will
      occur at 3 and 9 weeks and once during the third trimester of pregnancy. At delivery, a
      saliva specimen will be collected from both the mother and infant, along with a remnant cord
      blood specimen.
