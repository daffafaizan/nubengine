      their patients will be recruited and randomized to either Connect to Quit (CTQ) or Usual Care
      (UC), existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services. After PCPs are enrolled, we
      will begin recruiting their patients who meet eligibility criteria. The desire to quit
      smoking is not required for participation in the study, as the point of CTQ is to engage
      smokers at every level of readiness to quit. Target enrollment is 660 participants,
      approximately 330 in each treatment arm. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2
      years and a maximum of 4. Investigators will measure abstinence (biochemically-validated, 30
      day point-prevalence) throughout the study, assessed every 6 months.
