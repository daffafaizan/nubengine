      Palbociclib is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests as well as studies in
      animals and people show that it may help slow the growth of breast cancer. The most widely
      tested regimen of Palbociclib for patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer is 125 mg
      every day for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone)
      therapy. This study explores if administering a lower dose of palbociclib - 100 mg given
      every day of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy - may
      result in more tumour shrinkage and be better tolerated.
