      subjects from Quebec diagnosed with COVID-19 infections. Following informed consent, 216
      subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either
      hesperidin 1000 mg once daily (q.d.)) or placebo (1:1 allocation ratio) for 14 days.
      Investigational drug will be delivered to the patients' homes with an electronic oral
      thermometer and a symptoms diary. Follow-up phone assessments will occur after 3, 7, 10, and
      14 days following randomization for evaluation of COVID-19 symptoms. Electronic Case Report
      Form (eCRF) will be completed by the research personnel over the phone with the patients. The
      symptoms diary will be mailed back to the coordinating center at the end of the study in a
      pre-addressed envelope.
