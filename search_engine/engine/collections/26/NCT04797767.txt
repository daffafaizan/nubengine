      This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.

      Patients will receive induction with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on days 0-5 (if
      peripheral white blood cell count is less than 20,000/uL), cladribine on days 1-5, cytarabine
      on 1-5, and mitoxantrone on days 1-3. Patients also receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days
      1-14. Treatment repeats every 28-35 days for up to 2 induction cycles including mitoxantrone,
      and up to 4 consolidation cycles without mitoxantrone in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.
