      in elderly patients. With the exception of one known study, single agent erlotinib has not
      been studied exclusively in the elderly and the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab has
      never been studied exclusively in the treatment naive elderly. This is an important
      population that needs less toxic therapies.
