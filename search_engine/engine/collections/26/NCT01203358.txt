      efficacy of two surfactants -- Exosurf Neonatal (Burroughs Wellcome Co.) and Survanta (Ross
      Laboratories) -- for the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Newborn infants
      with birth weights of 501-1500g with respiratory distress syndrome who were receiving
      assisted ventilation with 30% oxygen or more within 6 hours of birth were enrolled between
      January 1991 and January 1992. Infants were randomly assigned to receive up to four
      intratracheal doses of either Exosurf Neonatal or Survanta.
