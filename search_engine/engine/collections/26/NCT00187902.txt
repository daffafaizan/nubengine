    
      For all subjects enrolled in the study, the following clinical data information will be
      obtained: 1) reason for exam, 2) subject's signs and symptoms and 3) clinical assessment.

      For each subject enrolled in the study, three clinician-collected pharyngeal, four rectal
      swabs (three clinician-collected, 1 self-collected) specimens, one glans swab
      (self-collected) and a first catch urine specimen (approximately 25 ml) will be obtained. The
      collection order of the clinician collected swabs will be randomized.

      Three pharyngeal swabs will be tested for: 1) CT/NG NAAT (TMA) at DPH, 2) NG culture at DPH
      and 3) NAATs for CT/NG (TMA, SDA) and CT culture at UCSF. Four rectal swabs will be tested
      for: 1) CT/NG NAAT (TMA) at DPH, 2) NG culture at DPH and 3) NAATs for CT/NG on Clinician-
      and self-collected rectal swab (TMA, SDA) and CT culture at UCSF. Self-collected glans swab
      and the FCU will be tested by NAATs for CT/NG (TMA, SDA) at UCSF. All NAAT specimens
      collected in a universal NAAT transport medium. After specimen processing, samples will be
      frozen at -70 C for discrepant analysis.
