      enable further progress in the treatment of depression. Reward motivation (and the closely
      related construct of "reward learning") is a core neurobehavioral domain.(1,2) In major
      depressive disorder (MDD), low reward motivation is a key aspect of anhedonia, a cardinal
      symptom of MDD, and is related to resistance to treatment.(2,3) Although much has been
      learned about reward motivation's neurobiology and relevance to psychopathology, important
      gaps in our knowledge have impeded the application of basic science findings to improving
      treatment of MDD. Reward motivation in healthy subjects involves ventrostriatal (VST)
      dopamine (DA)(4,5), and reduced reward motivation is linked to MDD and anhedonia.(3,6) These
      data suggest that VST DA dysfunction might be present in MDD and manifested clinically by
      anhedonia. While DA neuroreceptor imaging studies have failed to verify this, they have been
      methodologically compromised. Limitations include imaging methods with poor resolution of
      functional striatal subregions, MDD samples heterogeneous for antidepressant use, and use of
      self-report measures of anhedonia, rather than objective behavioral testing of the specific
      domain of reward motivation. This will be the first study of both VST DA release (by PET
      imaging) and reward motivation, and will include patients with MDD and healthy volunteers.
      Reward motivation will be captured and operationalized as reward learning in a probabilistic
      reward task (prior to imaging). This will clarify if VST DA dysfunction is linked to impaired
      motivation in MDD. To test clinical implications in MDD patients, we will assess the
      relationship of VST DA release, reward motivation, and anhedonia to outcome of subsequent
      open label treatment with the DA D2 receptor agonist pramipexole.
