      collected from patients with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Participants will also be
      evaluated for clinical outcome. The biorepository will include serum and plasma from
      CO-poisoned patients drawn at the time of injury as well as from blood drawn at clinical
      follow-up visits. The biorepository will also bank DNA from these participants.

      These specimens can be analyzed in the future to elucidate potential inflammatory and
      immunological mechanisms that cause brain and heart damage and identify possible biological
      and genetic predictors of poor outcome.
