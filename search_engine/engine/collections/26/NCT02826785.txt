      disability and reduced quality of life. Existing rehabilitative interventions, which focus on
      cognitive process training, have not been successful in mitigating its negative functional
      consequences. We have developed a client-centered cognitive strategy training intervention to
      enable people with PD to work around their cognitive deficits and maintain their functional
      performance. This study is an exploratory case series to assess aspects of its feasibility.
      Specifically, we will assess participant responsiveness to the intervention (acceptance,
      engagement, adherence), and we will track logistical information (e.g., scheduling). We will
      also administer an exploratory outcome measure of treatment effect to gain preliminary
      evidence on the effect of the intervention on self-identified cognitive performance problems.
      This information will guide modifications and enhancements in preparation for future clinical
      trials.
