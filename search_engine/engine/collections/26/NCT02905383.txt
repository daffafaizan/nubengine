      falls and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the post-discharge period. The
      reason for this is the cumulative effect of illness, bedrest during hospital stay and
      inactivity after discharge. Previous research indicates that exercise therapy should be an
      integrated part of the post-hospital treatment to prevent or postpone this functional decline
      and improve HRQOL. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      investigate the effect of a multi-component exercise program consisting of high intensity
      exercises on physical function, physical activity and HRQOL among older people living at home
      after discharge from hospital after treatment of an acute medical event.
