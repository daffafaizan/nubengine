    
      This is a Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center
      study in subjects with single-level, symptomatic lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (>6
      months) and unresponsive to conservative therapy for at least 3 months. The study will
      compare single intradiscal injections of high and low dose IDCT with one sham control group.

      6 study visits will be completed by all subjects; screening, day 1 (injection day), week 4,
      week 12, week 26 and week 52. The subject will be assessed for safety and efficacy utilizing
      VAS, ODI and JOABPEQ questionnaires alongside radiographic evaluations. The study will have a
      6 month follow-up and a 6 month extension period (total 1 year).
