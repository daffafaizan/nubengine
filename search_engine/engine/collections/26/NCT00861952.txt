      severity (lack of blood sugar control) and duration of diabetes. Estimates of rates of
      occurrence vary although one prospective study showed 7.2% of newly diagnosed ulcer-free
      diabetics developed ulcers within one year of being diagnosed. Current treatment initiatives
      aimed at educating diabetic patients on how to prevent diabetic ulcers and mange peripheral
      neuropathy have had varied success. Chronic pain is the number one reason that this
      population seeks help from medical professionals. Diabetics are particularly predisposed to a
      potentially disabling form of chronic pain known as peripheral neuropathy. In fact, over 50%
      of diabetics have painful neuropathy, or will develop this condition. Other than the primary
      goal of addressing blood sugar levels, conventional treatment of diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy involves prescription gabapentanoids or opiod analgesics, both of which have
      considerable cost and may be associated with side effects from long-term use and overall
      limited success rates. Neuragen is an over-the-counter natural health product that may be a
      safe and effective treatment option for this disease. Using a randomized double-blind placebo
      control clinical trial the effects of Neuragen on pain, function and quality of life will be
      assessed.
