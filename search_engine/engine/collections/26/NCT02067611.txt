    
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind (with dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel group, proof of concept, and dose range finding study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of X0002 spray in adult subjects with clinically symptomatic mild to moderate
      OA of the knee.

      After a screening period of up to 3 weeks and radiographic evaluation of the target knee
      joint space, 225 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1
      ratio with a 2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group in a 1:1:1 ratio with a
      2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group (i.e., 2 subjects to active treatment
      and 1 subject to placebo):

      Group A: low dose of X0002, twice daily (BID, approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo
      (low dose), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25); Group B: middle dose of X0002, BID
      (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo , BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) ;
      Group C: High dose of X0002, BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo, BID
      (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) .

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.
