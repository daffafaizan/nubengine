      Primary

        -  Evaluation of lung nodules (target and non-target lesions) detected during annual
           low-dose (ld) computed tomography (CT) scans and measured for three years after study
           completion in subjects enrolled in a randomized, phase IIb, placebo-controlled trial
           with inhaled budesonide (both person-specific and lesion-specific analyses will be
           performed).

      Secondary

        -  Lung cancer detection rate in the two arms.

        -  Appearance of new nodules in the two arms.

      OUTLINE: Low-dose CT scans are analyzed retrospectively for the natural progression of
      undetermined lung nodules. Nodule dimension will be evaluated according to maximum diameter
      and volume, when feasible. Volume measurements are performed using an automatic and
      semi-automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Lesion-specific and person-specific
      analysis are performed by measure of average change in size of the target lesions or number
      of lesions.
