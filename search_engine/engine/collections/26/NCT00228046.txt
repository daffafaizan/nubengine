      functioning in multiple areas, including home, school, and peer relationships. Additionally,
      children with ADHD often develop aggressive behavior, which is not usually adequately
      suppressed by standard stimulant treatments for ADHD. In order to address this problem, many
      physicians prescribe multiple medications at once. There is no clinical evidence, however,
      proving that this method is safe and effective. This study will assess whether adding a mood
      stabilizer, divalproex sodium, to stimulant treatment is more effective than stimulant
      treatment alone in reducing aggressive behavior among children with ADHD.

      Participants in this double blind study will first receive open label stimulant treatment for
      ADHD and a comorbid disruptive behavior disorder. Participants whose aggressive behavior
      subsides with stimulant treatment alone will not proceed into the next phase of the study.
      Participants whose ADHD symptoms lessen from the treatment but whose aggressive behavior
      persists will be randomly assigned to receive either divalproex sodium or placebo in addition
      to their stimulant treatment for 8 weeks. Study visits will be held weekly for 11 to 16
      weeks. At these visits, aggression levels and medication side effects will be assessed.
      Families will also meet with the researchers to discuss the child's progress, and attend
      behavioral counseling with a therapist. Participants who did not continue into the second
      phase of the study will be asked to return to the study site for a follow-up visit 8 weeks
      following the end of the first phase.
