      subanesthetic dose of ketamine versus placebo in parturients undergoing cesarean section
      under spinal anesthesia.

      The patients were randomized in two groups:

        -  Group Ketamine: these patients recieved 0.25 mg/kg of Ketamin intravenously 5 minutes
           after the spinal anesthesia.

        -  Group Placebo: recieved 20 ml of normal saline solution intravenously 5 minutes after
           the spinal puncture.

      The investigators recorded intra demographic, intraoperative and post operative data.

      The main outcome was the analgesic score: the visual analog scale (VAS). dynamic VAS was also
      monitored at 24 hours post operatively.
