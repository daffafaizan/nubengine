      index (BMI).1,2 . In addition, energy expenditure and hunger have been associated with
      exposure to heat or cold. Increased usage of central heating and air conditioning systems
      coupled with increased time spent indoors has created an environment where humans are
      expending less energy to regulate their body temperature.3 The human thermoneutral zone (TNZ)
      is the range of ambient temperatures in which a healthy adult can maintain body temperature
      without expending energy beyond the normal basal metabolic rate. Energy intake and
      expenditure are adjusted at temperatures above and below the TNZ.4 The temperature of the
      food, smell, time of consumption, and number of people present are established factors that
      influence food consumption in humans.5 In addition, evidence supports the role of the
      environment upon an individual's food intake. Wall color, lighting, and ambient noise,
      influence consumption preferences and quantities.6 Based on research in animal models,
      particularly mice and livestock,food intake and subsequently, weight gain is reduced in high
      ambient temperatures.7-10 In addition in young, physically active, healthy males, food intake
      is inversely proportional to TNZ.11 However, energy expenditure increases above and below the
      TNZ. These studies are based on extreme conditions, therefore there is a lack of information
      on how small changes in ambient temperature may affect food intake in the general human
      public. Recent research shows the effectiveness of small changes over time to lead to changes
      in consumption practices.12 Thus, altering the thermal environment subtly may lead to a
      greater understanding of long term effects in weight management. The investigators have
      previously examined the thermal environment of persons going about their daily lives in both
      urban and rural settings (X120217008). Preliminary analysis of the results suggest increased
      % body fat is associated with lower heat exposure.
