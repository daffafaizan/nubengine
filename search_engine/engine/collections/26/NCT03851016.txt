      Book intervention while the other half receives Usual Care intervention. The interventions
      were then switched, and the participants who received Usual Care intervention received the
      Life Story Book intervention while the home that received Life Story Book intervention
      received Usual Care intervention. The study consisted of two treatment periods of 3 weeks
      separated by a washout period of 1 week.

      Life Story Book provides a person with the opportunity to chronologically share their life
      experiences and memories. This three-1 hour reminiscence intervention is designed to provide
      a person with the opportunity to review their past and capture their life story into
      something tangible. The Life Story Book includes a combination of written information,
      photographs of significant people, places or events, and personal narratives from the stages
      of life that the person would like to include.
