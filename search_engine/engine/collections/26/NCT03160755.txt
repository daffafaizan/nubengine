      (PP) and motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that is adapted for patients with MetS.
      For this phase, participants will be primary care patients recruited through Massachusetts
      General Hospital's research opt-in program (Research Options Direct to You [RODY]). We will
      complete phone interviews with patients (n=20) with MetS within two weeks of enrollment in
      the study.

      In this project, we hope to do the following:

        1. Identify, through qualitative research, deficits in positive emotional states in primary
           care patients with MetS.

        2. Examine potential links between positive emotional deficits and impaired health
           behaviors (low physical activity, unhealthy dietary patterns), as well as links between
           positive emotional states and successful health behaviors.

        3. Identify other barriers to health behavior completion, such as social support and
           neighborhood resources.

        4. Explore strategies to enhance positive emotional states in MetS patients and inquire
           about the utility of potential PP exercises in these patients.

        5. Ask participants for feedback about intervention delivery preferences (e.g., session
           length, time of day, duration of intervention).

        6. Develop a preliminary PP-MI based group intervention using the above information.
