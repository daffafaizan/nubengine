    
      Potential participants are screened over an up-to-35-day period (with an extra 7-day period
      for participants who are required to repeat screening 24-hour urine collections or initially
      unanalyzable screening laboratory assessment samples) prior to randomization. Eligible
      participants will receive a single dose of DCR-PHXC or placebo on Day 1.

      In order to maintain the treatment blind, 24-hour urine oxalate (Uox) results that could
      unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or other blinded personnel
      until the study has been unblinded.

      It is expected that approximately 10 participants will be screened in order to randomize 6
      participants (2:1 randomization; 4 nedosiran:2 placebo) to the study.

      Following the up-to-6-week screening period, participants will return to the clinic for
      interim visits up to Day 85. Visits occurring between the Day 1 and the Day 85 visit may be
      conducted as at-home telemedicine visits at the discretion of the Investigator. The total
      time on study for each participant is approximately 18 weeks.
