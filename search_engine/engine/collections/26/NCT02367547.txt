      allergology, Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Lahti, with 99 clinically assessed superficial
      basal cell carcinoma on the body area, not face and scalp. Diagnoses is confirmed
      histologically by punch biopsies and hyperspectral images are taken before the biopsies. The
      lesions are randomised in three groups: interventions HAL and BF-200 ALA and comparator MAL.
      Photodynamic therapy is given by the standard procedure. Fluorescence is measured in A.U.
      (Arbitrary Unit) with standardised set-up, with Wood's light, digital camera and a yellow
      lens, before and after the exposure. Pain is measured in VAS-scale before, during and after
      the exposure. Efficacy is assessed clinically, histologically and by hyperspectral imaging
      system at 3 months, 12 months and 5 years.
