      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and the potential effect of food on the
      PK of MLN3126 and its M-I metabolite following single oral dose administrations.

      This study planned to enroll approximately 48 healthy participants, who were to be enrolled
      in 1 of the 6 dose cohorts or matching placebo in an ascending fashion. Participants were
      randomly assigned to MLN3126 or placebo within each cohort- which remained undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1 - MLN3126 300 mg or matching placebo

        -  Cohort 2 - MLN3126 600 mg or matching placebo

        -  Cohort 3 - MLN3126 1000 mg or matching placebo

        -  Cohort 3 - MLN3126 1000 mg or matching placebo (fed regimen)

        -  Cohort 4 - MLN3126 1500 mg or matching placebo

        -  Cohort 5 - MLN3126 2000 mg or matching placebo

        -  Cohort 6 - Did not taken place due to termination of the study

      All participants were asked to take the required tablets at the same time throughout the
      study.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in The United States. Participants were confined to
      the clinic for 5 days, and were contacted by telephone on day 14 (Â±2days) for a follow-up
      assessment.

      This study was terminated after completion of Cohort 5 due to findings of study site
      non-compliance to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regarding study documentation. There were no
      safety concerns.
