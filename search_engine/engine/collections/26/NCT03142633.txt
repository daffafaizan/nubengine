        1. A cross-sectional study of a cohort of women with PCOS with analysis of materials from
           the established biobank. (the PICOLO cohort) Data and blood samples from 266 women with
           PCOS was collected from January 2010 - February 2013 as a part of the PICOLO
           collaboration: "PCOS, infertility, Cardiovascular and Obstetric risk markers and
           Long-term Outcome" at Holbaek Fertility Clinic and at Herlev Hospital.

           Serum samples will be analysed with Reverse Transcript polymerase chain Reaction
           (RT-qPCR) for selected microRNAs.

        2. A follow-up study of local participants from the PICOLO study. 90 of the participants
           were recruited at Holbaek Fertility Clinic.

      Following tests will be performed at reexamination, in order to describe the clinical
      phenotype: Health interview, anthropometrics, acne score, Ferriman-Gallway score, blood
      pressure, Transvaginal ultrasound of uterus and ovaries, insulin Resistance (IR) assessed
      with Oral glucose Tolerance test (OGTT), Venous blood for hormone analysis and lipid status.

      MicroRNA analysis with Taqman microRNA array will be performed on serum samples.

      Detection and treatment of women with PCOS is a challenge due to the variability of the
      syndrome. If MiRNA could serve as marker of metabolic syndrome, it would be possible to
      detect and follow the women of greater risk at an earlier stage, and thereby preventing
      morbidity.
