    
      Euforvac-Hib vaccine manufactured by LG Life science in Korea, but it's not marketed in
      Korea. It is distributed to UN agencies in diverse countries. Thus, WHO recommended LG Life
      Science to conduct the safety study for assessing the vaccine safety if Euforvac-Hib is
      prequalified.

      The objectives of this safety study are to identify any problems and questionable issues
      likely to emerge from the actual use of Euforvac-Hib vaccine after launching in the market.
