    
      Methods: Thirty six subjects will be recruited who have a history of C-section surgery more
      than three months before entering the study and who report chronic pain in or around the scar
      stemming from the surgery. Subjects will initially be tested twice four weeks apart, before
      beginning intervention. This will allow the establishment of a baseline and the subjects will
      all be part of a baseline control group. They will then be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups. Group 1 will undergo four, 25 minute sessions of light massage to the trunk
      followed by superficial skin rolling of the C-section scar. Group 2 will undergo four,
      25-minute treatment sessions consisting of multi-planar pelvic and abdominal myofascial
      mobilization techniques and direct scar mobilization techniques..

      Outcomes: Outcome measures will include threshold pressure discomfort and pressure tolerance
      using a Pressure Algometer, Adheremeter measurements of scar mobility, the numeric pain
      rating scale (NPRS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Hip extension and shoulder flexion
      measured via goniometery, and the Global rating of Change scale. Follow up measures will be
      collected four weeks following the start of interventions and again at 12 weeks. In addition
      qualitative data will be collected from the subjects. The treating therapist will be blinded
      to the results of the outcome measures.
