    
      Unilateral or bilateral posterior crossbite (PXB) is a common malocclusion. In recent
      decades, RME has gained preference as the treatment of choice for PXB. However, the side
      effects, such as reported pain, relapse of the expansion, tipping of the molars, bone loss,
      gingival recession, and root resorption, have lead some clinicians to prefer SME.

      In this study the investigators will treat PXB using two techniques, RME and SME. Patients
      will be divided into two groups (a technique in each group) to evaluate the efficacy of each
      one using cone beam computed tomography.

      RME group: A Hyrax appliance modified as McNamara will be applied. SME group: A removable
      appliance with central expander will be applied. In order to evaluate the changes occurring,
      two CBCT radiography will be taken for every individual: first, before treatment, second,
      after three months of retention for RME group and one month of retention for SME group
