      assessment and then be randomized to one of four arms: 1) MIND foods and cognitive training,
      2) MIND foods and control training, 3) control foods and cognitive training, or 4) control
      foods and control training.

      All interventions are conducted through applications running on a tablet computer device that
      we will provide to all participants for the study duration. Cognitive training is delivered
      through the online BrainHQ program from Posit Science, Inc. The foods will be shown on the
      tablet device in an online shopping format. Selected foods will be prepared and delivered by
      the study team.

      Active intervention will last for 12 weeks. After the 12-weeks, free food deliveries will
      cease but participants who were allocated to cognitive training will continue to have access
      to BrainHQ. Those in the MIND food arms will be encouraged to maintain MIND food consumption.
