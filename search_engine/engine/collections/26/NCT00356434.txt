      determine if foot pumps will be better tolerated by obstetric patients, both antepartum and
      intrapartum. Patients in whom thromboembolic prophylaxis is deemed necessary and ordered by
      the treating physician, who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to
      receive SCDs or the foot pump as part of their thromboembolic prophylaxis regimen. The
      investigators will administer a questionnaire to assess patients' satisfaction and comfort
      with each device and they will be asked to complete a log of hours they wore their assigned
      device for a 7 day period (or as long as they are prescribed). Random spot checks to verify
      compliance will be performed.
