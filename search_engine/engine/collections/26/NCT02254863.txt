      of which involve a single gene mutation resulting in an enzyme defect. In the majority of
      cases, the enzyme defect leads to the accumulation of substrates that are toxic and/or
      interfere with normal cellular function. Often times, patients may appear normal at birth but
      during infancy begin to exhibit disease manifestations, frequently including progressive
      neurological deterioration due to absent or abnormal brain myelination. The ultimate result
      is death in later infancy or childhood.

      Currently, the only effective therapy to halt the neurologic progression of disease is
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which serves as a source of
      permanent cellular ERT.3 However, one barrier to the success of this therapy is delayed
      engraftment of donor cells in the CNS when administered through the intravenous route, which
      is associated with ongoing disease progression over 2-4 months before stabilization. The
      engraftment of donor cells in a patient with an IMD provides a constant source of enzyme
      replacement, thereby slowing or halting the progression of disease.

      This study will evaluate the safety of a potential new treatment for patients with certain
      IMDs known to benefit from HSCT using allogeneic UCB donor cells. The new intervention,
      intrathecal administration of UCB-derived oligodendrocyte-like cells (DUOC-01) will serve as
      an adjunctive therapy to a standard UCB transplant. The goal of this therapy is to accelerate
      delivery of donor cells to the CNS thereby bridging the gap between systemic transplant and
      engraftment of cells in the CNS and preventing disease progression. The DUOC-01 cells and
      cells used for HSCT will be derived from the same UCB donor unit.
