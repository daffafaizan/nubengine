      BSA and pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetics and toxic effects in women with recurrent
      solid tumors who receive a fixed total dose of paclitaxel. II. Determine the toxic effects of
      paclitaxel in these patients. III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive single fixed dose intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours on day 1.
      Blood samples must be drawn prior to the first paclitaxel infusion and then at 1, 6, and 24
      hours after the start of the infusion during course 1 only. Treatment courses of intravenous
      paclitaxel are repeated every 3 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients
      are evaluated for response after the second course. Patients are followed at the discretion
      of the physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued over 13 months.
