      databases in Germany and Italy to describe the proportion of PRILIGY (dapoxetine
      hydrochloride) usage among those patients with characteristics suggestive of the use of
      PRILIGY within versus outside (eg, those with contraindications) of the intended use (IU)
      population. This is an observational study; no investigational drug will be administered.
