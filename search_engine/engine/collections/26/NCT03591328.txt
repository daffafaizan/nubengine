      vulnerability, and the interaction between these factors may cause plaque instability and
      subsequent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Previously, the first-in-human study, EMERALD I,
      showed that the addition of hemodynamic parameters calculated noninvasively from coronary
      computed tomography (CCTA) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) improved the ability to
      predict the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with conventional approaches based
      on anatomical stenosis severity and adverse plaque characteristics. To validate the increment
      in discrimination and reclassification ability of a prediction model with hemodynamic
      parameters over a model with anatomical stenosis severity and adverse plaque characteristics.
      In this regard, we designed the subsequent EMERALD II study. In the EMERALD II study, we will
      refine methods for hemodynamic analysis and validate the previous algorithms on a much larger
      patient population. The study population will be divided into derivation and validation
      cohorts. Machine learning methods will be used to define a plaque rupture risk score based on
      plaque morphology, composition and hemodynamic forces in the derivation cohort, then the
      algorithm's prediction ability will be tested in the validation cohort.
