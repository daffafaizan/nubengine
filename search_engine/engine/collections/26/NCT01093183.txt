      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      lenalidomide administered in combination with oral cyclophosphamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (50% decrease in PSA
      levels sustained for at least 4 weeks) as defined by PSA working group criteria; or a
      decrease in absolute PSA or a decrease in PSA velocity, increase in PSA doubling time,
      duration of any responses.

      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of lenalidomide plus oral
      cyclophosphamide in patients with previously treated hormone refractory prostate cancer.

      III. To evaluate baseline and change of quality of life, particularly, bone pain and
      analgesic consumption, of the patients on this combination chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether related cytokines and biomarkers (serum levels of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], T
      cell inhibitory activity, phytohemagglutinin [PHA] and interleukin [IL]-2, mononuclear cell
      isolation, VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], IL-6) can help predict response to
      patients undergoing treatment with lenalidomide and cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and cyclophosphamide
      PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment modifications may apply according to
      response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
