    
      MS is a chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system affecting approximately 2
      million people worldwide and more than 400,000 individuals in the US. MS is the most common
      cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults. Symptoms typically first
      afflict individuals during the prime of their professional and reproductive lives, between
      the ages of 20 and 40. Many affected individuals are unemployed, physically disabled, and at
      high risk for social isolation. While disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can significantly
      reduce accumulation of disability in MS, patients still experience symptoms across a range of
      functional domains. Symptoms can include problems with bladder, walking, and mood (depression
      and anxiety). Often, these symptoms are only partially evaluated during routine MS clinic
      visits, and the long interval between clinic visits can result in them not being optimally
      managed.

      The goal of the current study is to pilot a system of proactively monitoring a combination of
      symptoms (bladder, ambulation and mood) using an activity monitor and a smartphone.

      Adult patients with MS who are experiencing symptoms in at least 2 of the 3 domains (bladder,
      ambulation, mood) will be enrolled. Visits will be at baseline (can be same day as routine
      visit to the MS clinic), and 3 months. Short surveys (<3 minutes to complete) will occur
      weekly, and longer surveys will occur at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months. FitBit activity
      monitors will be worn for the entire 3 months.
