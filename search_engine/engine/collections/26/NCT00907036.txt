        -  To document the toxicity, feasibility, and survival after reduced-intensity conditioning
           followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched sibling
           donor in patients with relapsed, chemosensitive Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -7 to
           -3, melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2, and alemtuzumab IV on day -1.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo donor stem cell infusion on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally on
           days -1 to 60, followed by a taper until 3 months post-transplantation, in the absence
           of GVHD.

        -  Donor-lymphocyte infusion (DLI): DLI is used for the eradication of mixed chimerism and
           for the management of residual or relapsed disease. If necessary, patients undergo DLI
           every 3 months until the desired endpoint is achieved or GVHD develops.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
