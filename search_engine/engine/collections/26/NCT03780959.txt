    
      This was a two-part study. In the first part of the study, all participants received
      open-label etanercept twice a week for 90 days. At the end of the 90 days, participants with
      disease response as defined by the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI) using the JRA Core Set
      Criteria were randomized in part 2 of the study to receive placebo or continued
      administration of etanercept until either disease flare occurred or 4 months elapsed,
      whichever was earlier.

      Participants who did not meet the DOI at day 90, participants who had disease flare during
      part 2 and participants who completed the blinded part of the study were eligible to receive
      open-label treatment with etanercept under protocol 16.0018 (NCT00357903).
