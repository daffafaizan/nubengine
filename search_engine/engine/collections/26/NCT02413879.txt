      Retraction and Protection System in Protecting Surgical Incisions from Intraoperative
      Contamination When Used during Colorectal Surgery, is designed to evaluate bacterial
      contamination at the wound incision site when the CleanCision is used during surgery. The
      CleanCision is a surgical tool that is designed to be used for the primary purpose of
      protecting the wound from contamination that occurs to the incision site during surgery
      ultimately reducing the occurrence of Surgical Site Infections (SSI).

      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm (non-randomized) clinical study.
