      During the study, randomized subjects will be fitted with a pair of study contact lenses,
      only one of which is embedded with a gold coil to receive electrical stimulation from the
      study spectacles, in the study eye. Subjects will also wear optical spectacles (study
      spectacles) that deliver the electrical stimulus the study contact lenses.

      Group A will receive electrical stimulation (test group), and Group B will not receive
      electrical stimulation (control group). Baseline IOP will be recorded prior to the 2-hours
      stimulation, and will be repeated post-therapy, at increments of 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60
      minutes, and 2 hours from the conclusion of stimulation. The total duration of participation
      for each subject is up to approximately 5 weeks. The total expected duration of the clinical
      trial is approximately 4 months.
