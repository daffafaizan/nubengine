      hours of evolution. However, retrospective studies suggested that laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy even after 72 hours was safe. Moreover, some randomized controlled-trials did
      not found any differences in term of complications between early and delayed cholecystectomy,
      however none of these studies did separate patients according to the onset of symptoms. The
      aim of our present study was to compare the clinical outcomes of immediate versus delayed
      cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis with more than 72 hours of symptoms.
