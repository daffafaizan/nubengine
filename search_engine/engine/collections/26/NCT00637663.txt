      of Lamivudine in nucleoside-na√Øve CHB patients. The switch from Lamivudine to Entecavir in
      patients who have undetectable hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA < 60 IU/mL) may lead to more
      prolonged viral suppression to undetectable level by PCR method, compared to patients with
      continuous lamivudine treatment. The results of this study will provide a rationale for
      switch treatment from one antiviral to another one, especially from LAM to ETV.
