    
      Open, randomised, self-contained, multicentric, multinational, long-term antibody persistence
      studies. Immune persistence was compared between subjects who received either two dose or
      three doses of GSK Biologicals combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine. The long-term
      follow-up studies involved taking blood samples at approximately 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after
      the primary vaccination of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine to assess antibody persistence.
      No additional subjects will be recruited during the long term follow-up period.
