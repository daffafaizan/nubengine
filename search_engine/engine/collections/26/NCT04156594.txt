      evaluation are based on complex risk scores, preoperative apparatus examinations, laboratory
      parameters and medical findings. The significance of apparatus diagnostics for the
      preoperative Pulmonary risk evaluation is highly controversial and guidelines recommend a
      reluctant use. A large prospective study (PREDICT, unpublished to date, NCT02566343) showed
      that lung function assessment in patients with COPD symptoms undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgery did not improve the anamnestic risk assessment. In a large study it could be shown
      that a subjective self-assessment of physical performance by means of a structured
      questionnaire (DASI), in contrast to a subjective medical assessment, suitable for predicting
      perioperative cardiac events. Our unpublished data show that a subjective self-assessment of
      "limited exercise capacity" in patients with COPD is predictive of PPC is suitable.

      Objectives:

        -  Development of a self-assessment questionnaire as part of a Delphi trial

        -  Validation of the self-assessment questionnaire

      Methodology:

      Prospective observational, case control study of 5000 patients undergoing surgery in general
      anesthesia (estimated enrollment of 5500 patients with a dropout rate of approximately 10%).
