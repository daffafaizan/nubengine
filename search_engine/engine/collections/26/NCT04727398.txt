      methods were used to detect the PVD after phacoemulsification. The former studies used
      indirect ophthalmoscopy and ocular ultrasound for diagnosis of PVD. The later studies used
      the optical coherence tomography (OCT) for PVD detection. The OCT device had higher
      effectiveness in evaluation of the posterior segment, and then it can detect
      post-phacoemulsification PVD more and early than previous studies. Ivastinovic et al
      demonstrated 59.2% of patients had PVD at 1 month after phacoemulsification, and increased up
      to 71.4% at 3 months.

      Tsukahara et al introduced wide-field OCT-based PVD classification. The advance OCT device
      will be useful in detection of abnormal PVD and it's sequelae. If the risk factors of
      post-phacoemulsification PVD were explored, the prevention of abnormal PVD and VMI disorders
      could be done.
