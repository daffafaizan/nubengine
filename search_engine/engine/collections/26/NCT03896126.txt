      diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pain, as well as gastrointestinal diseases such as
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and delayed stomach emptying
      (gastroparesis).

      Current technology only allows for measurement of vagal nerve activity that regulates the
      heart and diagnostic tests focus specifically on cardiac vagal activity. Measuring vagal
      nerve activity as it pertains to the gastrointestinal system is an unmet medical need. Its
      importance will continue to grow since vagal nerve stimulation is being used increasingly in
      a myriad of different diseases, and currently there is no way of knowing if patients are
      getting too little or too much stimulation.

      In this study, the gastrointestinal vagus nerve will be activated using normal stimulants
      like food ingestion and vagal activity will be measured using current non-invasive
      technology. Patients with gastroparesis and healthy controls will be asked to come in
      fasting, fill out surveys, and complete eating challenges while being connected to an
      autonomic function testing machine. Exploratory outcomes will also be measured - Participants
      will be connected to a Peripheral Intravenous Line in order to collect four vials of blood
      throughout the two hour clinic visit so that hormonal changes can be studied. Also,
      exploratory non-invasive electrogastrograms will be recorded remotely both during the
      autonomic function test and for three consecutive days as participants go about their daily
      lives.

      The investigators' goal is to establish a protocol for measuring gastrointestinal evoked
      vagal activity and correlating activity with digestive function in both healthy people and
      gastroparesis patients.
