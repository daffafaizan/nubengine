    
      BT5528 consists of a bicyclic peptide (BicycleÂ®) which binds to EphA2, and is covalently
      attached to a spacer and a protease cleavable peptide linker attached to MMAE.

      The Phase I/II multi-center, open-label trial will evaluate BT5528 administered once-weekly
      as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab. The Phase I portion is a dose escalation
      primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of BT5528 and to determine a
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following selection of a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D),
      a dose expansion portion will be initiated with the primary objective of evaluating the
      clinical activity of BT5528.
