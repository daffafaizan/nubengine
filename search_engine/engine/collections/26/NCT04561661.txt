      Most fractures heal without complications but these injuries can result in impaired hand
      function and prolonged inability to work and perform activities of daily living. If there is
      a dislocation that cannot easily be repositioned to a stable position, surgery might be
      required. Surgery is often performed with percutaneous pinning and immobilisation in plaster
      for 4 weeks. Good results of non-surgical treatment with a splint that allows immediate
      mobilization of the interphalangeal joints has been reported. This study will compare these
      two methods for treating fractures of the base phalanx of the fingers. Recruited patients
      will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms: 1. surgery with pinning 2. conservative
      treatment with a splint. Primary outcome is total active range of motion in the affected
      finger at 3, 6 months and 1 , 3 years. Secondary outcomes are number of sick days and various
      patient related outcome measures.
