      such as blue light could cause damage to the retina. The damage was more evident in the
      ageing eye. Since the tablets and mobile with blue LED backlight display are widely used,
      thus blue-light filtering spectacle lenses are now available in the market. However, whether
      this kind of lenses could affect the eye growth in schoolchildren is unknown. This study is
      then designed to investigate if the blue-light filtering spectacle lenses affect myopia
      progression in Hong Kong Chinese schoolchildren. The schoolchildren will be randomly
      allocated to either blue-light filtering spectacle lens group (treated) or conventional
      spectacle lens group (control). Their axial length and refraction will be monitored every 6
      months for 2 years. The changes between two group will then be compared.
