      malignancy, short doubling time, early and widespread metastasis, is sensitive to
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and has a high initial response rate, but is prone to
      secondary drug resistance and relapse. The treatment is mainly based on systemic
      chemotherapy.

      SCLC has a more abundant vascular network than NSCLC. Anti-tumor vascular therapy combined
      with chemotherapy is considered the most promising SCLC first-line anti-tumor strategy.
      Anlotinib Hydrochloride has an anti-angiogenic effect and inhibits tumor's growth. It has
      been reported that Anlotinib has the dual benefits of both overall survival and
      progression-free survival in the treatment of multiple tumors, and has initially demonstrated
      its safety and efficacy. The ALTER 0303 study results showed that Anlotinib benefited both
      the overall and progression-free survival of NSCLC patients. However, there is no clinical
      study to probe its relevance to small cell lung cancer, and few studies have examined the
      status of Anlotinib in first-line treatment.

      This randomized, open-label, controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      sequential EL regimen with Anlotinib hydrochloride as first-line treatment for
      extensive-stage SCLC. The study plan to enroll 60 ES-SCLC subjects and will provide evidence
      for the use of Anlotinib for SCLC first-line treatment.
