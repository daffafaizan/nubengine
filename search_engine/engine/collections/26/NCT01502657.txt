      weaning fails or when prolonged mechanical ventilation is required. Numerous complications
      have been described since the widespread use of Percutaneous Tracheostomy (PCT).
      Bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous tracheostomy was developed in this context. However,
      bronchoscopy cannot identify vascular structures and the thyroid gland in the neck, and
      therefore cannot prevent complications related to organ lesions in the neck. Several studies
      have demonstrated the value of ultrasound guidance in the neck before performing PCT. No
      studies have demonstrated the feasibility and the safety of ultrasound guidance for PCT.
      Ultrasound could improve the understanding of neck anatomy, prevents vascular puncture, and
      helps guide insertion of the tracheostomy tube.
