      function, including incontinence, impaction, lengthy bowel routines and extremely slow
      transit times.The anal irrigation system is a recently available system to help patients with
      bowel dysfunction empty their bowels by using pulse water irrigation. The system consists of
      a rectal balloon catheter, manual pump and water container.
