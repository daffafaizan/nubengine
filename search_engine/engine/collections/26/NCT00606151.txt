      infarction. While this risk has been ameliorated through the use of the oral antiplatelet
      agent clopidogrel, there is a small but important subset of patients who will require
      discontinuation of clopidogrel due to unplanned or emergency surgery. These patients are
      exposed to a high risk of stent thrombosis during this time period. It is not known whether a
      strategy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy to "bridge" these patients is effective at
      preventing the morbidity related to stent thrombosis in the perioperative period. We intend
      to assess, in a prospective observational manner, the clinical course of patients who have
      undergone stent implantation less than 6 months prior to a surgical procedure requiring
      discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy and the efficacy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy
      to prevent morbidity related to stent thrombosis.
