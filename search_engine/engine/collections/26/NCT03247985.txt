      into place for their hernia repairs. The other group will have self-fixating mesh into place.
      Both groups will have a piece of mesh that will widely cover the hernia defect. Before
      surgery, the participant will be asked to rate discomfort on a 0-10 scale. Zero stands for no
      pain and 10 is the worst pain they can imagine. Investigators will record information about
      general medical condition, medications and activity level. During the operation information
      will be recorded about the pain medicines the participant may receive. In the recovery room
      the participant will be asked to rate their pain on the 0-10 scale and more information will
      be recorded about any additional pain medicines that they may receive and assess activity
      level. Following surgery, Investigators will contact the participants by survey to obtain
      more information about pain level, medication use, and activity level.
