    
      Aim 1: The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT; n=60) to assess the
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Stress Management and Resillency
      Training program (SMART Pregnancy) delivered online versus a time and attention matched
      prenatal support group (Mama Support). It is expected that SMART-pregnancy participants will
      demonstrate high levels of treatment engagement and adherence. It is predicted that
      participants in the SMART-Pregnancy condition will demonstrate improvements in emotional
      distress and stress regulation (as indexed by hair cortisol concentrations) at post-treatment
      and 3 month follow-up. Aim 2: The investigators will conduct a postnatal chart review to
      explore secondary treatment benefits including pre-and postnatal maternal health and birth
      outcomes.
