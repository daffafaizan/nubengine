      of the lid margins) will be measured at baseline. All subjects will receive 4 treatments at 2
      weeks intervals. In each treatment session, a subject allocated to the study group will be
      treated with intense pulsed light (IPL) administered in the malar region, from tragus to
      tragus including the nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately following the IPL
      administration, the subject will undergo meibomian gland expression (MGX) in both eyelids of
      both eyes. Subjects in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that
      the IPL administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 10 weeks after the
      baseline (or 4 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the
      outcome measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.

      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 10 weeks: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline).

      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis
      that IPL treatment itself provides relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
