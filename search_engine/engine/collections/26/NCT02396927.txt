      converting the two-dimensional image of the operating field to a three-dimensional
      perception. This can potentially lead to a detrimental effect on the learning curve as well
      for the feasibility of the operation for the more inexperienced surgeon. In our hospital, the
      high frequency of cholecystectomy serves as a basis for the minimally experienced surgeons to
      explore whether three-dimensional laparoscopy provides a better ability for solving complex
      intraoperative tasks than the conventional laparoscopy.
