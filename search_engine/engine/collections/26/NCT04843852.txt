    
      This is an open-label, randomized, pilot study to assess the effect of CpG-adjuvanted
      vaccination among people with chronic hepatitis B. This study will evaluate the effect of
      CpG-adjuvanted vaccination on B-cells that produce anti-HBsAg antibody.

      The primary hypothesis is that TLR9 agonism with CpG-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine will
      increase the number of anti-HBsAg producing B-cells in people with chronic hepatitis B
      infection who are virally suppressed on nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) therapy.

      In this study, 40 people with chronic hepatitis B virally suppressed on NUC therapy will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive an 0.5ml intramuscular injection of HEPLISAV-B vaccine
      - an FDA approved vaccine for preventing hepatitis B infection. Participants will receive a
      total of 2 injections, at day 0 and week 4. Participants will be evaluated at weeks 2, 4, 8
      and 24 for adverse events, and blood sample collection to outcome evaluation.
