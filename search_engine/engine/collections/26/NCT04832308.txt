    
      This is a national randomized controlled study with approximately 10-15 sites enrolling
      patients with Rutherford II peripheral artery disease (PAD) in total. Patients will be
      randomized between the SVS SET Program and "usual care" for each site. The primary outcome
      will be to study the site-specific effect on utilization of exercise therapy. Secondary
      outcomes will be the effect on the 6-minute-walk test, passive activity and quality of life.
