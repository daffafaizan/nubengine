      (Dermabond) in urogynecological robotic surgeries. The primary outcome is incision cosmesis.
      Therefore, if the tissue adhesive is cosmetically comparable to that of sutures, that will be
      reason to use tissue adhesives over traditional sutures. In these surgeries, there are five
      to six port sites (compared to fewer for usual laparoscopic procedures) and the procedures
      are lengthy procedures (average duration about 300 minutes as per recent AUGS/ACOG committee
      opinion), so if the investigators can show significant time reduction for closure, that
      should reduce operative time and costs. To the investigators' knowledge, this will be the
      first study of its kind to make this comparison for urogynecologic robotic procedures.
