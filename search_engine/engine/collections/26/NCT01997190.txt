    
      The goal of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate if the
      administration of AdV-tk to patients with MPE followed by valacyclovir and chemotherapy is
      safe, can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy, and will have
      anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.

      The first and second dose levels have been completed, and the study is currently expanded to
      enroll more patients to dose level 2 with Celecoxib.

      Patients will receive one injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. The
      prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each
      AdV-tk injection. Celecoxib will be administered starting 3 days before AdV-tk and continuing
      for 2 days after AdV-tk administration.

      Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy
      depends on the treating oncologist.
