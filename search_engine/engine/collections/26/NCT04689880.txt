    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of the XLIF Decade Plate in patients undergoing a thoracic and/or lumbar
      interbody fusion, at one or two levels, with supplemental fixation using a lateral plate.
      Consecutive patients at a given site who meet all eligibility requirements will be asked to
      consent to participate in the study. Eligible patients include those with degenerative
      conditions in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and
      will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo
      XLIF surgery with lateral plating using the Decade Plate. At least 75 subjects will be
      enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after surgery.
