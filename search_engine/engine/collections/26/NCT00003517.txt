        -  Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 capsules in
           combination with total androgen blockade in patients with localized, regional or
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate by determining the proportion of patients who
           experience an objective tumor response.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally
      6-7 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least
      3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Concurrently,
      patients continue hormonal therapy with flutamide, leuprolide, or bicalutamide at the same
      dose as before beginning antineoplaston therapy.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
