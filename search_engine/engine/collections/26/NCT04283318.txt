      versus 36 hours) on blood sugar levels and other metabolic parameters and hormones. For this
      the following investigations are carried out:

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test with detailed laboratory evaluation

        -  Bio-impedance measurement to determine body composition (muscle and fat mass)

      The examinations are carried out on 4 different cohorts (normal healthy persons, obese
      patients, patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with type 1 diabetes).
