      improve the balance of people with non-specific lower back pain. During the exercise program,
      a computer game at home is controlled with the help of sensors attached to the body. Second
      aim is to record the daily activities of the participants and compare them with the back
      pain.

      The 120 participants in this study will be divided into four groups (A, B, C and D). In
      groups A and B 20 patients are included who are in treatment for chronic back pain and
      receive Medical Training Therapy (MTT). For groups C and D the investigators will invite each
      40 participants who have back pain but are not in treatment for their back pain. Only
      participants in groups A and C receive the digitally supported home exercise program. Who
      gets the training program is randomized using stratified block randomization.

      The balance of all participants is measured four times. Between the 2nd and 3rd measurement
      the digitally supported exercise program is carried out. Between the 3rd and 4th assessement,
      participants in group A and C can exercise as much as they wish. The person who carries out
      the balance tests will not be informed which participant is in which group.
