      disorder (MDD). After implantation of the DBS system, the effects of deep brain stimulation
      in ITP and CI/BNST will be evaluated.

      The design of the study consists of two consecutive crossover phases, interspaced with 2
      optimalisation episodes. After a period of optimalisation of CI/BNST stimulation parameters,
      patients will be randomised in two groups. Half of the group of patients will receive
      stimulation in CI/BNST. The other half will not. After one week both groups will switch
      conditions during a period of one week. This will give an idea of the effects of stimulation
      in CI/BNST on the outcome measures. Outcome measures will be evaluated after each week.

      After this first crossover patients will continue to an optimalisation phase of ITP
      stimulation parameters. A second crossover will then follow. The effects of ITP stimulation,
      CI/BNST stimulation and no stimulation will be compared. In this phase patients will again be
      randomised to receive one of the six possible combinations of three consecutive periods of
      two months for the three different stimulation conditions (ITP stimulation, CI/BNST
      stimulation and no stimulation).

      Evaluations of outcome measures will be performed by blinded evaluators. This design will
      limit the duration of periods in which these severly ill patients are not stimulated.
