      from home to child care, including 24-hour sleep duration, changes in the timing of daytime
      naps, and changes in nocturnal sleep periods; to describe potential sleep disrupters, such as
      temperature, light and noise, in home and child care settings that may impact sleep quality
      and sleep patterns; to describe markers of parent and infant stress levels during the
      transition to child care; to describe markers of infant circadian rhythm during the
      transition to child care.
