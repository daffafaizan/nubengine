      antitumor activity of doxorubicin in HCC, and the as yet unpublished results of a recently
      completed Phase I clinical trial (WU HRPO# 07-0447, NCT00703170) combining pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®) and temsirolimus (Torisel®) in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. In this Phase I study, twenty-two patients were enrolled and treated. The MTD and
      recommended Phase II dose for the combination regimen from this trial is is Doxil 25mg/m2 IV
      Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week. During the conduct of this study two patients
      experienced confirmed partial responses (PR). One patient had heavily pretreated metastatic
      breast cancer and remained on the study for 6 months. The second patient with a PR had HCC
      that was previously treated with sorafenib. She remained on the study regimen for 14 months
      and tolerated this treatment well. Based on the tolerability of the drug combination and the
      observed anti-tumor activity in HCC, the current Phase II study in HCC is proposed.
