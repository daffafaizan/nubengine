      a delayed treatment.

      PK/PD targets for caspofungin are the peak concentration over minimal inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) ratio which should reach 10 and the area under the inhibitory curve
      (AUIC) which should be over 200. High distribution volume in ICU patients and increase of
      MICs due to extensive use of antifungal agents make optimal concentration difficult to
      obtain. High doses up to 150mg of caspofungin have been reported to be safe. Thus, in our
      unit, a loading dose of 140mg of caspofungin is a standard practice but was never rigorously
      evaluated.

      The aim of the present study is to measure the impact of a loading dose of 140mg of
      caspofungin on the pharmacokinetic parameters in the first 24 hours of treatment.

      The AUIC and maximal concentration (CMax) / (MIC) according to the recovered yeasts will be
      measured. The investigators also planned a Monte-Carlo simulation using MICs obtained from
      clinically relevant candida strains isolated in Bichat and Grenoble hospitals in order to
      evaluate the percentage of patients appropriately treated within the first 24 hours according
      to Candida species and previous use of antifungals.

      Recovered strains from epidemiological studies will be used for PKPD modelling and will use
      s. A second Monte-Carlo simulation will be done using data from the Amarcand 2 study.

      All MICs will be determined using E-test ( BiomerieuxÂ® KIT's) without specifying any
      breakpoints as MICs and not breakpoints per se will be used.
