      Early recognition and appropriate excision play a crucial role in management of malignant
      melanoma, while the size of surrounding normal skin that should be excised is area of
      controversies.

      Objective

      To investigated the impact of the excision of melanoma 2mm≤ in thickness with 1cm surgical
      margins on survival of the patients compared with 2 cm surgical margins.

      Methods

      The investigators will conduct a retrospective population-based survey in patients with
      primary melanoma 2 mm≤ in thickness undergoing tumor excision with 1 cm and 2 cm margins in
      the investigators center. For both groups, the patients' charts reviewed for data including
      patient gender, age, tumor location, tumor type, Clark's level, Breslow thickness, tumor
      type, presence of ulceration, findings of sentinel nodes, local recurrences, locoregional
      metastases, disease free survival and overall survival were calculated for both groups.
