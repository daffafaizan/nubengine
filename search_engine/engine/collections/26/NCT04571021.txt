      Departments. The aim is to identify patient at risk of deterioration or death and/or with a
      imminent need of treatment. The triage algorithms are also developed to identify patients at
      low risk, who safely can be assigned to the waiting room.

      Currently, several different triage algorithms are used, and they are mostly based on
      consensus and exper- opinion. Therefore evidence concerning triage is limited.

      The investigators has developed a novel evidence-based triage algorithm with integrated
      individual clinical assesment. The vitals measured at admission assigns the patient to a
      triage category, and based upon the clinical appearance of the patients, the triage nurse can
      adjust the assigned triage category to better reflect the patient. The triage algorithm used
      in Denmark is "DEPT", this algorithm is based purely on vitals and cause of admission and can
      not be adjusted.

      I-DEPT is designed as a cluster randomized stepped-wedge non-inferiority study. The Aim is to
      implement and compare I-DEPT to the existing triage algorithm. All Emergency Departments in
      the Capitol Region and the Region og Zealand in Denmark will implement I-DEPT one department
      at a time (8 centers). The first will start the implementation on october 1, 2020 and after
      two months the next center will implement I-DEPT. Every two months a new center will start.
      During 16 months all centers will have implemented I-DEPT the sequence of centers was
      determined by randomization. The first 30 days of implementation will be censored and not
      included in the final analyses. The study will conclude with a period of 30 days follow-up.
      Patients will only be included once.
