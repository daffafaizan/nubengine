    
      The aim of this study is the observation, in psychiatric Italian real-world settings, of
      metabolic effects, effectiveness, side effects and therapeutic adherence in patients with
      schizophrenia who switched, for any reason (efficacy, safety, metabolic problems, therapeutic
      adherence or patient's request), from any mono-therapy or poly-therapy antipsychotic regimen
      to monotherapy with lurasidone or with one of the four most used atypical antipsychotics in
      Italy (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). Patient's past medical and
      psychiatric history of the last 12 months will be also evaluated.
