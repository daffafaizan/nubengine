      hemorrhage treated with an early vitrectomy versus ultrasound monitoring with late
      vitrectomy.

      The hypothesis is that an early vitrectomy could decrease the rate of retinal detachment
      occurring after a spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage.

      Scientific background Spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage may occur after spontaneous posterior
      vitreous detachment and causes retinal break and retinal detachment in about 70% and 40% of
      cases respectively. The fundus examination and ultrasound have limited sensitivity to detect
      retinal breaks in these cases. Some retrospective studies have highlighted the benefit of an
      early vitrectomy for decreasing the rate of visual loss due to retinal detachment in these
      cases. However, to date, there is no national or international consensus regarding the
      management of spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage and the timing of vitrectomy.

      Study design Prospective randomized clinical trial Primary objective To compare the results
      of an early vitrectomy versus ultrasound and fundus observation in spontaneous vitreous
      hemorrhage.

      Secondary objectives To evaluate the rate of retinal complications in spontaneous vitreous
      hemorrhage treated either with early or delayed vitrectomy.

      To evaluate the rate of visual loss in spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage treated either with
      early or delayed vitrectomy.

      Primary criteria Rate of retinal detachment in eyes with spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage
      treated with early vitrectomy versus ultrasound observation at 6-month follow-up Secondary
      criteria Rate of retinal breaks and vitreo-retinal proliferation in eyes with spontaneous
      vitreous hemorrhage treated with early vitrectomy versus ultrasound observation at 6-month
      follow-up Visual acuity and rate of eyes with a loss of 5 letters or more among eyes with
      spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage treated with early vitrectomy versus ultrasound observation
      at 6-month follow-up Participants Patients with a spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage secondary
      to posterior vitreous detachment, with a reduced visibility of the fundus Inclusion criteria
