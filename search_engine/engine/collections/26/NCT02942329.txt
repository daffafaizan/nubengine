      patients) iv every 2 weeks. The efficacy and safety will be observed.

      The dose escalation phase has completed for apatinib from 125mg, 250mg to 500mg. The dose of
      250mg showed best tolerance and efficacy especially in hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, for
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients, apatinib 250mg orally every day was chosed for the dose
      extension phase. In gastric cancer, the dose of 250mg also showed good tolerance but mild
      efficacy. Thus, for gastric cancer patients, the dose of 375mg daily for apatinib would be
      explored and then the investigators will decide the best dosage for these patients.
