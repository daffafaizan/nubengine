      machine that assists breathing) in patients newly diagnosed with nocturnal hypoventilation
      who are inexperienced in the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV is standard therapy
      for patients with nocturnal hypoventilation.

      The most common type of NIV is bilevel pressure support which assists patient breathing by
      delivering different levels of air pressure during inspiration and expiration via a mask
      covering the nose or nose and mouth. Standard bilevel NIV (VPAP™) has been further developed
      to create a new automatically adjusting NIV (AutoVPAP™). Automatically adjusting NIV varies
      the inspiratory air pressure according to the airflow rates generated by the patient. This
      may improve patient comfort, hours of NIV use and recovery time.

      Patients over the age of 18 referred to, or under follow up at, the Royal Brompton Hospital
      who require domiciliary NIV but are inexperienced with use of NIV will be considered for
      entry into this randomised crossover study. If eligible for inclusion and willing to take
      part patients will be setup on automatically adjusting NIV or standard NIV, assigned in
      random order. At the end of one month the patient will be swapped to the alternative NIV for
      a further one month of domiciliary NIV treatment. At the end of each one month treatment
      period the patient will undergo overnight polysomnography, transcutaneous CO2 monitoring and
      24 hour Holter monitoring.
