      factors implicated in the development of dystonic symptoms are excessive cortical
      excitability and impaired sensorimotor processing.

      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the functional efficacy and neural
      effects of a Dual intervention of rTMS and sensorimotor retraining. Our working hypothesis
      is: subjects receiving the combined intervention will (1) display significantly improved
      handwriting measures; (2) report significant improvement in daily functional ability; (3)
      display reduced hand cramping compared; and (4) demonstrate reduced corticospinal
      excitability after the Dual intervention when compared to the rTMS+ stretching and massage
      (Sham) intervention.

      METHODS: A randomized, single-subject, multiple baseline design with crossover is used for
      this study that will examine ten subjects with FHD with two interventions: five days of
      low-frequency 1 Hz rTMS + sensorimotor retraining (Dual intervention) vs. rTMS + stretching
      and massage (Sham). The rTMS is applied to the premotor cortex at 1 Hz at 90% resting motor
      threshold for 1200 pulses. For sensorimotor retraining, a subset of the Learning-based
      Sensorimotor Training program was followed.
