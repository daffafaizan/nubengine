      Toripalimab (JS-001) is a PD-1 antibody developed by Shanghai Jun Shi Biomedical technology
      Co. Ltd. Nowadays, eighteen clinical trials of this drug have been conducted in patients with
      different types of advanced malignant tumor. Until now, Toripalimab has exhibited favorable
      safety in recruited patients. Incidence rate of SAE is 14.7%. JS001-Ib-CRP-1.0 is a phase
      Ib/II basket trial, aiming at evaluating safety and efficacy of JS001 in treating advanced
      gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma.The interim analyses results of 161 patients show that the
      ORR is 22.4%.

      Now, the standard chemotherapies regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer include
      gemcitabine, platinum and fluorouracil; Considering the synergistic effect of chemotherapy
      and immune therapy, we choose GS regimen (gemcitabine+S1) to combine Toripalimab.

      We will shut down the study in advance, if unpredicted SAE or low efficacy occur.

      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.

      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)
      tumor volume increase >50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.
