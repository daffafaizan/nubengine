      target population consists of 50 families of young children ages 11-23 months with
      developmental disabilities who are eligible to receive IDEA Part C (Individuals with
      Disabilities Education Act Part C) services in one region of South Carolina. Families will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions (1) IDEA Part C services as usual or (2) IDEA Part
      C services plus SSTP. Project goals are to strengthen parent competence, enhance parent
      confidence, and strengthen child social, emotional and behavioral functioning. Ultimately,
      this should result in a reduced likelihood of child maltreatment
