      person with diabetes to better manage their blood glucose. The Diabits app connects to a
      user's continuous glucose monitor (CGM) such as an Abbott Freestyle Libre, and predicts what
      the user's blood glucose will be over the next 60 minutes, updating every 5 minutes. The
      Diabits app displays that prediction to the user so that the user may make proactive
      decisions about insulin and food, with the goal of achieving more stable blood glucose
      control.

      The study will evaluate the impact which having access to blood glucose predictions has on a
      user's time in range (TIR). The hypothesis is that having access to blood glucose predictions
      will improve the user's ability to stay within their target blood glucose range by 5% within
      a given 24 hour period. This is a randomized controlled trial. A control group with Abbott
      Freestyle Libre CGMs will be recruited, and given a version of the Diabits app which does not
      display any blood glucose forecasts. A treatment group, also with Abbott Freestyle Libres,
      will be given the Diabits app with glucose forecasts enabled. Both groups will be asked to
      use the app as their primary diabetes management tool for the duration of the study.

      The study will run for 3 months. At the beginning of the study the 90 participants will be
      separated evenly into two groups. A blood test will be done to measure HbA1c and each
      participant will complete a number of surveys. At the end of the study the same activities
      will occur. Following conclusion, results will be evaluated to determine what differences
      develop between the control and treatment groups.
