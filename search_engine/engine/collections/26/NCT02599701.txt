      the effects of slow-wave sleep and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea on the
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis indicate that interventions in the sleep structure and disorders
      impact on the age-related muscle loss. Thus, we propose to assess the acute effects of a drug
      potentially capable of increasing slow wave sleep, and consequently growth hormone release
      during sleep, on the physiological release of growth hormone, testosterone and IGF-1 during
      the night in older healthy men.
