    
      A multi-centered, double-blinded Phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      non-steroid, anti-inflammatory WBI-1001 cream in the topical treatment of patients with mild
      to moderate atopic dermatitis, expressed as lesions up to 20% BSA. For the first 6 weeks
      patients will be randomized to one of three treatment groups simultaneously in a ratio of
      1:1:1.

      Group 1: vehicle cream (placebo), BID; Group 2: 0.5% WBI-1001 cream, BID; Group 3:1.0%
      WBI-1001 cream, BID. Patients randomized to treat all lesion areas.

      After the first 6 weeks all patients will be treated, non-placebo controlled, with WBI-1001
      cream. The Group 1 patients will enter a double-blinded phase for a further 6 weeks with half
      of them being treated BID with 0.5% and half with 1.0% WBI-1001 cream. Groups 2 and 3 will
      continue with their treatments unchanged for the remaining 6 weeks.

      During the treatment period, patients will apply the cream (BID) from the kit that they have
      been provided, and they will visit the study centre at prescribed times for assessment of
      efficacy, safety and tolerability. After completion of the 12-week treatment period patients
      will have a 2-week follow-up visit.

      Patients who withdraw from the study before Day 42 for reasons other than a treatment related
      AE will be replaced so that at least 40 patients per group will complete the
      placebo-controlled phase.
