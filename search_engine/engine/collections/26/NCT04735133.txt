      colorectal cancer surgery on four SWCs, including surgical site infections, hematoma, seroma,
      and wound dehiscence, were studied. The study started before surgery and lasted up to one
      month after surgery.

      Preoperatively, patients fasted for eight hours before the operation and were required to
      take a shower with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate at night. The patients who required surgical
      hair removal were shaved with a clipper in the operating room before the operation. Also,
      patients received 1g of ampicillin + sulbactam/cefazolin within 60 minutes before the
      incision.
