      I. Proportion of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with
      altered signaling pathways after radioligand therapy assessed by phospho-proteomics of biopsy
      samples.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Generation of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to determine if tumor levels of
      activity for individual adaptive pathways are related to the best prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) response.

      II. Sequencing to identify frequently mutated genes such as TP53 and ATM.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo image-guided biopsy over 45 minutes prior to first RLT course and 1-2
      days after the third RLT course.
