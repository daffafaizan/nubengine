      TMX-101 is a new formulation of Imiquimod optimized for intravesical delivery. Imiquimod
      possesses immune-stimulatory properties. TMX-101 is being developed as a potential treatment
      for patients with non-invasive bladder cancer, including patients with CIS bladder cancer.

      Following confirmation of CIS by histology, patients will receive weekly instillations of
      TMX-101 for 6 weeks. Five to seven weeks after the last instillation, biopsies and cytology
      will be performed. Response to treatment will be determined based on cytology and tissue
      sample histology findings.
