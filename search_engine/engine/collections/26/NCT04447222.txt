      I. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (e.g.,
      exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family
      or friends); COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms); health, financial and social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support;
      and HRQoL and other psychosocial and behavioral factors in cancer survivors who participated
      in one of three prior clinical trials.

      II. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19 specific
      psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and
      social support, and HRQoL.

      III. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived
      benefits assessed concurrently and other psychosocial measures assessed in the prior trials
      moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological distress and
      HRQoL.

      IV. Examine group differences in the outcomes assessed in the protocol relative to prior
      group assignment in the behavioral clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a survey online over 35-45 minutes about their experiences regarding
      the COVID-19 pandemic.
