    
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a follow up time of 48 hrs. Patients scheduled for
      primary Total Hip Arthroplasty. A total of 120 patients randomly assigned to one of the two
      alternatives (general anaesthesia (GA) or regional anaesthesia (RA)).

      General anaesthesia compared to intrathecal anaesthesia will give shorter length of hospital
      stay (LOS) for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA).

      Primary endpoint:

      LOS.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Postoperative pain? Postoperative orthostatic function (dizziness) Time until the patient
      meets the discharge criteria from PACU How many patients will need at least one urinary
      bladder catheterisation
