      (pay-for-performance) for dental providers within Advantage Dental Services, LLC with the
      goal of incentivizing implementation of delivery system changes aimed at reducing disparities
      in access and oral health for low-income mothers and children living in rural Oregon
      counties.

      To implement delivery system changes where a team of dental providers (dentists, dental
      hygienists, case managers, community outreach workers and others) within Advantage Dental
      Services, LLC provide evidence-based screening, risk assessment and primary preventive care
      in non-conventional community settings (WIC, Head Start and similar settings) and seamless,
      timely and appropriate evidence-based care in Advantage dental clinics.

      changes result in (1) reductions in disparities in access for low-income mothers and
      children; (2) efficiency in allocation of limited resources with the application of
      evidence-based screening; (3) seamless and appropriate care for mothers and their child at
      high risk of dental caries
