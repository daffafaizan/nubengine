      patients (half year since onset) was very important. The training intensity and frequency of
      upper extremities is insufficient. The proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)
      movements of upper extremities are applied to all daily upper extremities movement. The goals
      of this study are that the investigators want to build up the motion trajectory system by
      head-mounted display virtual reality technique, and the investigators want to explore the
      effect of visual feedback on motion trajectory in a virtual reality environment. The
      investigators will record the motion patterns, motion trajectory and the deviation of
      position and angle comparing to the normal PNF movement pattern to analyze the motion
      accuracy.
