      PTSD, are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained
      interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain
      about one third suffer from comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already
      challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD,
      and in treatment of chronic pain, however they have not been studied in comorbid population
      and under rigorous control conditions. The investigators compared the effects of a single
      dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in
      chronic pain patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were
      collected before, during, 1 day and 7 days after the infusion.
