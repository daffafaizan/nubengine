      the formula fed premature infant that is similar to that of the term breast fed infant (a
      predominance of bifidobacteria). In the initial phase of this trial, 30 premature infants
      will be randomly assigned to receive increasing doses of one of four dietary supplements:
      Permeate (a pasteurized human milk concentrate containing human milk oligosaccharides
      processed by Prolacta), GOS (galacto-oligosaccharides manufactured by Friesland foods),
      Bifidobacterium infantis or Bifidobacterium animalis. Weekly stool specimens will be examined
      by PCR to determine content of bifidobacteria and total bacteria. This study is limited to
      formula fed infants in order to avoid the confounding effects of the human milk
      oligosaccharides in breast milk. An additional 12 human milk fed infants will be enrolled and
      will have their diet supplemented with ProlactPlus (a pasteurized human milk concentrate
      containing humna milk oligosaccharides) or powdered human milk fortifier for comparison
