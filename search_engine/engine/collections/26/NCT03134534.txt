      cancer (NSCLC) with surgical indications in China, its oncological long-term outcomes has
      been widely approved. As a new form of VATS, robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) was
      widely used in thoracic surgery, the 3D vision and flexible robot arm were helpful for
      surgeons to perform precise operations, and RATS was reported to bring extra benefits to
      patients. The surgical safety and feasibility of RATS lobectomy for NSCLC has been confirmed.
      However, the oncological long-term outcomes of RATS lobectomy has not been studied by
      randomized controlled trial. so we designed this randomized controlled trial to determine
      whether RATS lobectomy would be as effective as VATS lobectomy on short-term and long-term
      outcomes.
