      procedures: firstly, the fresh adipose tissue is digested with collagenase, filtered,
      centrifuged and then discard mature adipose cells to obtain adipose tissue-derived nuclear
      cells also called stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). In the end, haMPCs are prepared
      after being purified andamplified to P2-P5. When induced by specific factors, haMPCs have a
      potential for multilineage differentiation towards bone, cartilage and fat tissue both in
      vivo and in vitro. The haMPCs can secrete a number of soluble mediators to stimulate the
      proliferation of endogenous progenitor cells, to act as nutrients, to be immunosuppressive,
      to be anti-inflammatory, to prevent fibrosis and promote angiogenesis. The cytokines secreted
      by haMPCs play a synergic role in restoring the dynamic balance of synthesis and decompositon
      of cartilage tissue, and finally to repair the impaired cartilage.
