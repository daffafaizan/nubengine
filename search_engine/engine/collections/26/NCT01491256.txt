      to either high dose atorvastatin pre-treatment group(80 mg loading within 24 hours plus 40mg
      busting within 2 hours before PCI) or control group(atorvastatin 10mg administration within
      24 hours before PCI). An intracoronary pressure/temperature sensor-tipped guidewire is used.
      Thermodilution curves are obtained during maximal hyperemia. The IMR was calculated from the
      ratio of the mean distal coronary pressure at maximal hyperemia to the inverse of mean
      hyperemic transit time. Creatine kinase-myocardial band(CK-MB) and CRP level will be measured
      at baseline and at 12~24 hours after PCI.
