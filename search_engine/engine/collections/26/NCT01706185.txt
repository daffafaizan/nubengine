      will be taken from those already stored at the investigation sites. Clinical data collected
      will include patient demographics (age, gender), Tumor, Node, Metastasis (staging system)
      [TNM stage], and histopathologic description only. Strict anonymity of patient data will be
      maintained.

      This retrospective study is based upon the analysis of archived formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tissue samples and patient-related data already available at the
      investigational site.
