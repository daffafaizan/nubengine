    
      The study will be conducted at the Travel Health Network, a full-service travel medicine
      clinic located in St. Albert, Alberta. Care will be provided by a pharmacist with a
      specialized practice in travel medicine, authorization to prescribe vaccines and prescription
      drugs, and authorization to administer vaccines by injection.

      The study will be a prospective mixed-methods cohort study, describing patients receiving
      care from a pharmacist-managed travel medicine clinic and their travel health needs, and
      evaluating their adherence to recommended vaccines and oral therapies, satisfaction with the
      care provided, and their health status and management of health issues arising while
      travelling. Chart reviews will elicit descriptive quantitative data related to patients'
      travel medicine needs and adherence to recommended vaccinations and oral pharmacotherapy,
      followed by surveys containing open-ended qualitative questions to elicit overall patient
      satisfaction and the management of any health issues encountered during travel. Due to the
      nature of the study involving patients presenting to the clinic for a consultation, neither a
      control group nor blinding is possible.

      A convenience sample of 100 subjects will be enrolled.
