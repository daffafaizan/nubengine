      tumor volume to deliver a lethal dose of radiation. High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate
      brachytherapy is a particularly elegant brachytherapy dose sculpting method that is
      effectively used in the curative treatment of prostate cancer; however, it requires hospital
      admission and many temporarily implanted transperineal catheters to deliver the radiation
      source to the target volume, resulting in significant patient discomfort. CyberKnife delivers
      a form of radiation treatment that is so precise, it appears capable of reconstructing HDR
      prostate radiation dose sculpting, without the hospital admission and without the catheters.
      The CyberKnife device is also used for classic radiosurgery, with accuracy comparable to the
      Gamma Knife, but unlike the Gamma Knife, has the capability to target lesions anywhere in the
      body with similar accuracy. The aim of this study is to compare CyberKnife morbidity and
      efficacy with that of HDR and other local treatment methods such a permanent seed prostate
      brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.
