      with NG tube and without NG tube after surgery. Sequence generation was performed using a
      computer-generated sequence of random numbers with permuted blocks. Standard postoperative
      management protocols were followed in both groups to avoid potential bias, which including
      preoperation nasogastric decompression. Thoracic esophageal mobilization and mediastinal
      lymphadenectomy were performed by open thoracotomy surgery. The abdominal part of the surgery
      was performed by laparotomy, gastric tube reconstruction was performed using linear staplers,
      and the conduit was brought up to the neck through the posterior mediastinal route. A
      cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed by stapled (linear) techniques. All
      patients were mobilized early, began early enteral feeding through jejunostomy tubes.
      Randomization was performed during the surgery. The group without NG tube after surgery will
      discharge the NG tube during the surgery. While the control group(group with NG tube after
      surgery) will discharge the NG tube 6-7days after surgery. The variables recorded for each
      patient included pulmonary complications, wound complications, anastomosis leak as well as
      the duration of postoperative hospitalization and the need for placing replacing the NG tube.
