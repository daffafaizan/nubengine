      postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC), and chronic post surgical pain.

      Although the less invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been used extensively
      as it produces optimal surgical outcomes and possible less postoperative pain, there are
      reports of inadequate pain control.

      Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) has been introduced as an effective method in
      postoperative pain management after VATS. It is associated with improved pain control and the
      reduction of opioid analgesic consumption in several studies.

      The use of intravenous low dose ketamine infusion during and after surgery has been shown to
      produce superior postoperative pain control in upper abdominal surgery and thoracotomy.

      The aim of the present study is to study the efficacy of intravenous low dose ketamine
      infusion during surgery on acute and chronic pain after VATS.
