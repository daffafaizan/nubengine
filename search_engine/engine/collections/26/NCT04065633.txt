      the commercial formulation of PF-04965842 and a variant formulation with slower dissolution
      relative to the Phase 3 formulation, to demonstrate the bioequivalence (BE) of the commercial
      formulation relative to the Phase 3 formulation, and to estimate the effect of food on the BA
      of the commercial formulation. This study consists of 2 parts: Part A is to estimate the
      relative BA (rBA) of single 200 mg doses of the commercial tablet formulation of PF-04965842
      and a variant formulation of slower dissolution rate compared to the Phase 3 tablet
      formulation. The effect of food on the BA of the commercial tablet formulation will also be
      evaluated. Part B is to establish BE between the Phase 3 and commercial formulations. The
      study will follow a staged approach as the sample size for BE cannot be determined with
      currently available information.

      Therefore, it is proposed to assess the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under
      the curve (AUC) ratios between the Phase 3 and commercial formulations as well as the
      within-participant variability of Cmax and AUC values determined in Part A. Based on the
      results from Part A, the sample size of Part B will be determined and the decision to proceed
      to Part B will be made.
