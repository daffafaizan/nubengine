      with numerous risks and complications. The main ones are the residual neuromuscular block and
      the possibility of developing a recurrence in the patient. In connection with this, the
      development and introduction into practical anesthesiology of new, more effective drugs for
      arresting the action of muscle relaxants is still relevant.

      One of the them, sugammadex was recently introduced into clinical practice and provided a
      fundamentally new approach to the recovery of neuromuscular conduction. Often, children under
      two years of age need general anesthesia for MRI (prolonged stay in the device, apnea to get
      a high-quality image without respiratory artifacts, severe pain syndrome, severe neurological
      deficit, etc.). The aim of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of sugammadex,
      estimated by restoring neuromuscular conduction within 0-120 seconds after bolus
      administration, and the safety and tolerability of sugammadex in children under two years of
      age. Children will be observed in the hospital during 24 hours. A group of patients from 2 to
      18 years of age, in whom the drug sugammadex is used as standard therapy will be taken as a
      comparison group .
