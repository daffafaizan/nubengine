      War Syndrome were randomized to standard care or standard care plus an 8-week course of
      course of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Study measures were collected at
      baseline, immediate post-MBSR (within one week of completion of the MBSR class) and 6 months
      following completion of the MBSR course. Measures were obtained at equivalent time points for
      veterans randomized to usual care only. Following completion, veterans randomized to standard
      care only had the opportunity to enroll in MBSR.

      This pilot study will whether there is sufficient evidence of benefit to warrant further
      study, and gathered data that will allow estimation of the sample size needed in future
      studies. We also obtained measures working memory and attention, in addition to patient
      self-report measures of symptoms, in order to provide additional assessment of whether MBSR
      is effective. This project is prerequisite to a larger study.
