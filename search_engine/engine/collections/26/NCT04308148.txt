    
      This study will examine how medical cannabis use affects opioid analgesic use, with
      particular attention to THC/CBD content and adverse events. We will enroll adults with (a)
      severe or chronic neuropathic or joint pain, (b) prescribed opioid analgesic use, (c) active
      certification for medical cannabis, and (d) intends to have soft gel capsule products
      dispensed at Vireo (medical cannabis dispensary) (including a high THC:low CBD product, an
      equal THC:CBD product, and a low THC:high CBD product). Over the 14 weeks, data sources will
      include questionnaires; medical, pharmacy, and Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) records;
      and urine samples. The primary independent variable will be type of soft gel capsule product,
      and the primary outcome will be cumulative opioid analgesic dose.
