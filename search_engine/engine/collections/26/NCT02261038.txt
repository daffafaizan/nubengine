      factor for outcome. However, measurement of femoral component rotation is difficult to
      perform.

      Femoral TKA component rotation can be assessed on special radiographs (Kanekasu technique),
      axial CT slices and 3D reconstructed CT images.

      It was the hypothesis that measurements on radiographs are comparable to measurement on CT
      images.

      In agreement with our standard diagnostic algorithm for patients with pain and problems after
      TKA CT images as well as Kanekasu radiographs are performed. If the Kanekasu radiograph is
      comparable reliable, it could be possible to use this radiograph instead.

      Measurements of femoral TKA rotation will be measured three times by three different
      observers and inter- and intraobserver reliability is calculated. The absolute values of each
      measurement method is noted in degrees. The measurements are performed with two weeks
      interval and the different observers are blinded to their previous and the measurements of
      the others.

      The absolute difference of femoral TKA rotation is calculated between and inter the groups
      investigated.

      Intra class correlation coefficients are calculated for inter- and intraobserver reliability.
