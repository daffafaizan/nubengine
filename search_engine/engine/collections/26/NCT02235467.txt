    
      Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is an intervention with proven efficacy in treating
      impairments on social functioning and daily-life activities of individuals with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In Brazil we have a limited number of qualified professionals and an
      increasing demand of families non-served in the public health system.

      Our main objective is to standardize and test the efficacy of a model for parent training
      using video modeling for teaching eye contact and joint attention behaviors in children with
      ASD. These two behaviors are essential to develop adequate social interaction, the core
      impaired domain in ASD. It is a multisite study to be carried out at the Universidade Federal
      de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo and Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie. The sample
      will be composed of 70 children divided in control and intervention groups that will be
      randomly chosen. The intervention should be carried out in 21 weeks.
