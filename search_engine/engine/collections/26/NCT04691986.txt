      musculoskeletal declines. Nearly 9 million Veterans are now 65 years of age or older with
      impairments in functional capacity, reduction in quality of life, and an increase in the use
      of health care services and associated costs. An estimated 45-50% of those over the age of 85
      are frail, which could represent well over 1 million Veterans. Aging, which significantly
      contributes to frailty, is highly correlated with reduced levels of nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential mediator in mitochondrial function. Restoration of cellular
      NAD+ levels is gaining support as a therapeutic strategy to maintain and even enhance
      functional capacity during aging. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) - an NAD+ precursor - enhances
      physical activity and mitochondrial health in mice. Furthermore, NR was recently shown to be
      safe in human clinical trials for boosting NAD+, yet the benefits for human physical
      performance and muscle physiology are unknown. Therefore, the goal of this project is to
      establish a double-blind randomized control trial to assess the impacts of NR on functional
      capacity, muscle function and structure, and mRNA signaling in healthy older adults. Towards
      this goal, this study will investigate healthy older individuals between the ages of 65 and
      85 who will receive NR or a placebo for a period of 3 months. Participants will be tested for
      frailty, gait speed, and muscle strength at each time point. Additionally, muscle biopsies
      and serum will be collected to assess changes in muscle fiber histology, mitochondrial
      biomass and activity, and mRNA profiles. This project will provide greater insight into NR
      supplementation as a therapeutic strategy to stave off frailty and maintain resilience during
      aging.
