      suture to close a C-section incision can reduce blood loss. Patients undergoing C-section
      will be randomized with equal allocation to a barbed suture or a standard antimicrobial
      suture. The primary outcome is quantification of blood loss (QBL). Differences between the
      groups will be assessed using a 0.05 level Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Secondary outcomes include
      time for hysterotomy closure, need for additional hemostatic sutures, rate of
      endometritis/SSI (superficial wound infection, deep wound infection, and endometritis) within
      6 weeks postpartum, use of hemostatic agents, and differences in pain which will be assessed
      by a telephone screening in the days following delivery.
