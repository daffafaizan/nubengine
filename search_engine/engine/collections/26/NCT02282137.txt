      identify prostate cancer cells that have a specific protein target called prostate-specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA) on their surface. PET and CT make computerizing pictures of areas
      inside the body where the radioactive substance is lighting up. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET / CT may be
      able to see smaller tumors than standard imaging and may help determine whether prostate
      cancer has come back and where it is in the body.

      A 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET / CT scan may help doctors to better detect the location, extent, and
      characteristics of the tumor, allowing improved planning of subsequent therapy
