    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Examine the impact of SIGNATERA™ on adjuvant treatment decisions

        -  Determine the rate of recurrence of patients diagnosed with CRC while asymptomatic using
           SIGNATERA™

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Molecular residual disease clearance as assessed by SIGNATERA™

        -  Percent of patients undergoing surgery for oligometastatic recurrence

        -  Survival in patients treated with adjuvant versus no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients
           with SIGNATERA™ negative test results

        -  Overall survival

        -  Impact of SIGNATERA™ test results on patient quality of life
