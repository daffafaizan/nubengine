    
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult
      participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

      The study enrolled 26 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Alisertib 50 mg Fed + Fasted

        -  Alisertib 50 mg Fasted + Fed

      All participants will be asked to take one alisertib tablet (ECT), orally, with or without a
      standard high-fat breakfast Cycle 1, Day 1, with the respective alternate food intake
      condition (fasted to fed or fed to fasted) on Cycle 2, Day 1, each followed by 14-day rest
      period. Participants will take alisertib, ECT, orally BID on Days 4 to 10 of Cycles 1 and 2,
      each followed by 14-day rest period. From Cycle 3 onwards participants will continue taking
      alisertib 50 mg, ECT, orally, BID on Days 1-7, followed by a 14-day rest period in 21-day
      cycles until disease progression, occurrence of an unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.

      This multi-center trial conducted at 3 sites in the United States. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic and plus a final visit after 30 days of receiving their last
      dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
