      neuronal NOS (nNOS) isoform. By design, NXN-462 is a potent inhibitor of nNOS with good
      affinity, and has little or no affinity for a range of G protein-coupled receptors, ion
      channels, and enzymes. NXN-462 is being developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain syndromes, including PHN. This drug design strategy provides a new
      therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.
