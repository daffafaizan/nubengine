      breathing as a self managed, non-pharmacologic intervention for anxiety experienced by those
      with Parkinson's disease. Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      either an intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will be taught how
      to perform focused breathing and asked to practice it twice daily for six weeks for a minimum
      of four minutes each time. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep, self-efficacy and quality of
      life with be measured in participants in both the intervention group before beginning to
      practice focused breathing as well as in the control group. After six weeks of practice the
      same measurements will be collected from the intervention group. Additionally, intervention
      participants will participate in a brief interview at the end of their six weeks of practice.
      Control group participants will be taught how to perform focused breathing six weeks at the
      end of a six week wait-period, following collection of data using the aforementioned
      measures..
