      syncope is benign, and vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common type of syncope seen in
      children . The diagnosis of VVS is established by history, often confirmed by tilt tests. A
      wide range of drugs has been proposed for VVS , with β-adrenergic blocking agents being
      first-line therapy. However, clinical studies have shown conflicting results in terms of
      therapy effectiveness. β-blockers have been claimed to be effective for 60% to 100% of young
      patients in many uncontrolled studies but not in most short- and long-term controlled studies
      . Sheldon et al., in a recent multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized
      study of adult patients, reported that metoprolol was not effective in preventing VVS. To our
      knowledge, no pediatric randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up have
      demonstrated the efficacy of β-blockers for the prevention of syncope.
