      using numbers 1-15. The link to their identity will be stored in their records but will not
      be forwarded to other investigators. Only the originating site will have the identity log
      linking the participants to the study records. All patients over age 18 in the patient clinic
      are eligible for inclusion. Staff members and employees may also participate. Following
      informed consent, each patient will undergo visual acuity testing, keratometry readings by
      IOL Master, topography testing by Pentacam, and corneal staining evaluation with fluorescein
      using the Oxford scoring scale on both eyes. Once all three tests are completed, the Icare
      tonometer will be used to check the intraocular pressure (IOP) on one eye only. The
      investigator will be masked as to which eye will undergo applanation. Immediately following
      the IOP check, corneal staining, topography and keratometry readings will be repeated. The
      unchecked eye will serve as a control as there may be mild variations in topography or IOL
      Master even without applanation. Following the repeated testing, the control eye will also
      undergo applanation to document IOP.
