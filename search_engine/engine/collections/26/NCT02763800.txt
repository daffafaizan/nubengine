      study of three multiple rising doses in three sequential groups of 8 young male healthy
      volunteers (Part A) and a single group of healthy elderly volunteers (Part B).

      In Part B, 12 healthy elderly volunteers were to be enrolled. Ten were to be randomly
      allocated to BIA 3-202 and two to placebo.
