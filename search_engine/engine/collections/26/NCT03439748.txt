      depression, some types of anxiety, as well as substance abuse and schizophrenia. Anhedonia is
      a predictor of poor long-term outcomes, including suicide, and poor treatment response.
      Extant psychological and pharmacological treatments are relatively ineffective for anhedonia.
      Thus, there is an unmet therapeutic need for this high-risk symptom. Recent advances in
      affective neuroscience have elucidated processes that may underlie anhedonia and should be
      targeted in therapy. Specifically, anhedonia is associated with deficits in the appetitive
      reward system, including (1) reward approach-motivation, (2) initial responsiveness to reward
      attainment, and (3) learning of reward. We have developed a novel transdiagnostic
      psychosocial treatment for anhedonia, Positive Affect Treatment (PAT), designed to improve
      deficits in reward sensitivity. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the targets of
      this new treatment, PAT, and whether the targets are specific to PAT relative to traditional
      cognitive behavioral therapy designed to reduce negative affect, called Negative Affect
      Treatment (NAT), in individuals with depression or anxiety.
