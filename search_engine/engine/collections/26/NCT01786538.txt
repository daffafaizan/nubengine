      cancer (mCRC) at present and upfront doublet combination of fluoropyrimidines plus either
      oxaliplatin or irinotecan is regarded as reference strategy for patients appropriate for
      intensive therapy. Before the era of targeted agents, the treatment strategies in terms of
      either combination or sequence of cytotoxic agents were rather simple; survival outcomes did
      not differ according to either the administration sequence of oxaliplatin or irinotecan, or
      the sequential versus combination chemotherapy in the treatment continuum. However, the
      treatment strategies have become more complicated in the era of targeted agents.

      In case of failure to first-line oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines (FOLFOX or CapeOX) with
      or without bevacizumab, second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI would be administered for
      treatment continuum, and more various targeted agents can be combined in these setting;
      bevacizumab beyond progression only in patients who have been treated with first-line
      bevacizumab plus FOLFOX or CapeOX (TML and BRiTE), cetuximab (only for patients with
      wild-type KRAS), panitumumab (only for patients with wild-type KRAS), and aflibercept
      (VELOUR). However, there have been a few valid targeted agents which could be combined in the
      second line FOLFOX or CapeOX in those progressed after first-line FOLFIRI with or without
      targeted agents; bevacizumab beyond progression could be a valid treatment strategy only in
      those received first-line bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI. Higher dose of bevacizumab (10
      mg/kg/2-week) could be combined to FOLFOX as second-line chemotherapy; however, it is not
      recommended at present in terms of cost effectiveness and higher adverse events, and
      cetuximab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is neither recommended by current consensus.
      Thus, there have been unmet needs for the discovery of valid targeted agent combination for
      the second-line FOLFOX as above reasons.
