      of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disorders occurring in the developing
      fetal or infant brain, causing activity limitation. Motor disorders are often accompanied by
      sensory, perception, communication and behavioral disorders, epilepsy and secondary
      musculoskeletal problems.

      Kinesio Taping has been proven to increase local circulation, reduce local edema and provide
      a positional stimulus for muscle, skin, or facial structures, regulating sensory input, and
      activating regions in the brain. KT is currently used to improve oral control in children
      with neurological and neuromuscular disorders and provides a reduction in saliva flow and
      frequency. However, knowledge of the potential of using neuromuscular bandages to manage the
      dribble flow has been limited.
