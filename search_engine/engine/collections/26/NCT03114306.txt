      enhanced recovery after surgery and sufficient joint function. Analgesia is a crucial
      therapeutic element in this context. There is evidence that regional- anaesthesiological
      catheter techniques are very efficient to control pain postoperatively. On the other hand,
      motoric function may be reduced due to nerve blocks depending on location and concentration
      of drug used. Local infiltration of the knee during surgery is an alternative component in
      pain management that may reduce impaired motor function and allow early mobilisation of
      patients. However, currently it is not known which analgesia technique provides optimal pain
      control paralleled with sufficient motor function. Against this background, this RCT
      evaluates two analgesia regimens for patients undergoing primary total knee-replacement to
      assess impact on postoperative recovery.
