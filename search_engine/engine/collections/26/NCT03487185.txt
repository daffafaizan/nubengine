      outcomes. In particular, women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) appear to be at increased
      risk of both hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. In the
      non-pregnant population, OSA is typically treated with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) during sleep and has been shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
      Unfortunately, data on whether maternal and neonatal outcomes could be improved with
      treatment of OSA during pregnancy are extremely limited. This study aims to address this
      knowledge gap.

      A randomized controlled trial of 2,700 women to assess whether treatment of obstructive sleep
      apnea with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in pregnancy will result in a reduction
      in the rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
