      days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) on Day -1. On the morning of Day 1, all subjects will receive a single oral dose
      of 8 mg (as the hydrochloride salt) containing approximately 100 μCi of [14C]-poziotinib in
      the fasted state.

      Subjects will be confined to the CRU until at least Day 8.

      Subjects will be discharged from the CRU on Day 8 if the following criteria are met:

        -  ≥90% mass balance recovery in combined urine and feces, and

        -  ≤1% of the total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and feces) in
           2 consecutive 24-hour periods in which fecal and urine samples are obtained.

      If these criteria are not met by Day 8, subjects will remain in the CRU until all discharge
      criteria are met up to a maximum of Day 15 in order to continue 24-hour blood, urine, and
      feces collections, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Sponsor and Investigator.
