    
      Aurix is a platelet-rich plasma gel used in the treatment of non-healing chronic wounds.
      Prospective observational studies of the effectiveness of Aurix have demonstrated promising
      results in regard to the healing of DFUs, including severe Wagner grade 3 and 4 ulcers. The
      aim of this trial is to demonstrate the of complete wound healing in a prospective,
      open-label, randomized trial in which diabetic foot ulcers will be treated using Aurix to
      determine the time to heal at 12 weeks. Comparison will be made on a 1:1 basis of Aurix + UCC
      versus control subjects receiving undefined UCC.
