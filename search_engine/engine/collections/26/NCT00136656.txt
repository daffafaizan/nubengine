      one country to another. The main question is the incidence of renal scars.

      intravenous route (IV) treatment is supposed to give the best results, but no previous study
      has ever given the incidence of renal scars after PO treatment.

      This multicenter, randomised trial is an equivalence study of PO and intravenous route (IV)
      treatments.
