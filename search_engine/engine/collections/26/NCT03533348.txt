      practice can lead to real harms to patients and poor satisfaction with their care. The
      nothing per os (NPO) order is sometimes used in CT scans because gastrointestinal tract
      contents can interrupt visualization of the intestinal lumen, but more commonly NPO orders
      are are thought to protect all supine patients from aspiration during delivery of intravenous
      contrast. There is limited evidence to support such practice of NPO orders prior to
      contrast-enhanced CT scans. The authors' main objective is to determine if there is a need
      for preparative fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT scans.
