      coronary stenting (either acute coronary syndromes or stable coronary artery disease). The
      antiplatelet therapy included a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel and 500 mg ASA, followed
      by 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg ASA once daily. Clopidogrel low-response (CLR) and/or ASA
      (ASA low response) were treated according to a structured therapy plan.
