      disease that impairs immune function, primarily by decreasing CD4+ T lymphocytes. The
      progression can be contained by daily dosing with antiretroviral therapy (ART) but there are
      side effects that can be treatment limiting, and the development of HIV drug resistance can
      force the physician to modify the ART regimen. There are no effective vaccines currently
      available for HIV.

      LVsh5/C46 (also known as Cal-1) is a dual therapeutic, self-inactivating lentiviral vector
      that encodes for both a short hairpin RNA against the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 (sh5) and a
      HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, C46 and inhibits two processes required for HIV-1 infection:

        1. Binding of the virus to the cellular CCR5 co-receptor and

        2. Fusion of the virus with the host cell

      The rationale is that Cal-1 introduced into hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HSPC) and
      mature CD4+ T lymphocytes will protect these cells and their progeny cells from HIV-1
      infection and its pathogenic sequelae. This may provide a continuous means of controlling
      HIV-1 after a single or infrequent dose(s), thereby decreasing or delaying (partially or
      completely) the need for antiretroviral drug therapy.
