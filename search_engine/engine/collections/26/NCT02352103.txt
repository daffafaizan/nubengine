      the bladder. This technique necessitates the dissection and/or manipulation of many
      structures, which might compromise post-operative urinary continence recovery. These
      structures include the pubo-prostatic ligament, Santorini plexus, neurovascular bundle, and
      veil of Aphrodite. Recently, a "Retzius-sparing" technique to perform RARP has beed
      described. This approach passes posteriorly to the bladder, through the space of Douglas,
      which should minimize the damaged to the aforementioned structure. Theoretically, the latter
      technique should improve post-operative urinary continence recovery. However, a randomized
      comparison between the "traditional" RARP and "Retzius-sparing" RARP is still lacking.
