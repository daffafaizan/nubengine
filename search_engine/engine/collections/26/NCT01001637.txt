      longa) root, giving the spice its characteristic yellow color. Because of its
      anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid, and antioxidant properties, curcumin has shown positive
      effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a six month human study was
      conducted with unformulated curcumin showing insignificant trends, due to limited
      bioavailability and brain permeability of unformulated curcumin. In animal models of AD, oral
      dosing of solid-lipid curcumin particle (SLCP or Longvida) significantly reduced memory
      deficit and impacted biomarkers better than unformulated curcumin. This study is to determine
      the potential efficacy and safety of highly absorbed SLCP curcumin in subjects with AD.
