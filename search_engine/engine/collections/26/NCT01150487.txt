      Allospecificities assay.

      Our group has developed two novel assays to determine: 1) the number of donor-specific
      alloantibody (DSA) secreting bone marrow derived plasma cells (AlloELISPOT assay); and 2) the
      function of DSA-secreting Plasma cells (Allospecificities assay).

      These assays were developed over the past 3 years and already have provided an important
      means of testing new therapeutic protocols aimed at controlling DSA production. It is
      important to note that repeated attempts to isolate PCs from peripheral blood have been
      unsuccessful (PCs are extremely rare in peripheral blood) and the bone marrow is the only
      accessible source of PCs.

      It is now clear to that we have reached a point that we must validate these assays
      (coefficient of variation, etc), in order to appropriately evaluate data derived from these
      assays. Inter-assay variability can be assessed by performing two paired assays in the same
      patient. This could be done in two ways-paired bone marrow aspirations separated by time or
      two bone marrow aspirations performed at the same time. We have decided to pursue the latter
      approach. We will do both marrows either at the time of transplantation when the subjects are
      under general anesthesia or in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) using conscious sedation.. We
      believe that this is safe and will be well-tolerated and will provide the data that we need
      to validate the assays.
