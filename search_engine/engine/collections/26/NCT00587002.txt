      key features responsible for the increased peri-MI mortality in young women. In order to test
      this hypothesis the following specific aims are proposed using a special intravascular
      ultrasound technique called virtual histology and microvascular function (effect of
      intracoronary adenosine on coronary blood flow) in patients coming to the cardiac
      catheterization laboratory with an acute MI:

        1. To determine if plaque rupture or plaque erosion is more prevalent in young women (<50
           years) compared with older women (≥ 50 years) and men in the development of an acute MI

        2. To determine if inflammatory mediators of plaque rupture are higher in older women and
           men with an acute MI compared with younger women

        3. To determine if microvascular function is abnormal in young women undergoing
           percutaneous coronary revascularization with an acute MI compared to older women and men

        4. To determine if alterations exist in the number and function of EPCs in young women (<50
           years) compared with older women (≥ 50 years) and men who have had an acute MI and to
           determine the association with microvascular function
