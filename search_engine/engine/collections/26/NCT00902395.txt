      under. We investigated whether young children's behavior improves during dental treatment
      with combined oral ketamine and midazolam compared to midazolam alone or no sedation. Healthy
      children under 36 months of age, presenting early childhood caries and referred to a
      pediatric dental sedation clinic were randomly assigned to receive combined midazolam (0.5
      mg/kg) and ketamine (3 mg/kg) (MK), oral midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) (MS), or protective
      stabilization without sedative (PS). One observer scored children's behavior using the Ohio
      State University Behavior Rating Scale (OSUBRS) at determined points in a dental exam (no
      sedative) and treatment session. Data were analyzed using non-parametric bivariate tests.
