      sensitivity is contained in the fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as the insulin and
      glucose levels obtained shortly after an intravenous glucose load. We propose to test this
      hypothesis by performing both hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps as well as
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests on normal volunteers and groups of patients with
      diabetes, hypertension, or obesity (diseases known to be associated with insulin resistance).
      Data from these studies will be used obtain estimates of insulin sensitivity by the glucose
      clamp method, minimal model method, and a novel analysis that utilizes only fasting and peak
      levels of glucose and insulin. We hope to devise a simpler method for determining insulin
      sensitivity in vivo that is suitable for testing large populations. This method will require
      only a few blood samples, take less than one hour to perform, and correlate with glucose
      clamp estimates at least as well as the minimal model method.
