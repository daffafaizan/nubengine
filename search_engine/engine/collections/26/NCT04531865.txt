      Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the cluster of differentiation antigen 20
      (CD20) antigen on B cells, is safe and effective for children with complicated
      steroid-dependent/ frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (SDFRNS) without corticosteroid or
      immunosuppressive therapy. Single rituximab infusion has been shown to be efficacious for 6
      to 12 months, the reported median relapse-free period was 9 months. Our previous study found
      that Mycophenolate mofetil can further improve the sustained remission time.

      All patients will be treated with 2 doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv at time 0 and 7 days.
      Addition of Maintenance Mycophenolate Mofetil or placebo from 4 Month onwards. The expected
      duration of the follow-up is 12 months, consisting of 12 visits.
