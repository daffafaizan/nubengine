    
      Subjects (or their syngeneic donor) will give blood for investigators to make EBV-specific
      (GRALE) T cells in the lab. These cells will be grown and frozen for the subject.

      The GRALE T cells will then be thawed and injected into the subject over 1-10 minutes.
      Initially, two doses of GRALE T cells will be given 2 weeks apart.

      If after the 2nd infusion there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan
      as assessed by a radiologist, the subject can receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells
      if they wish (up to 6 times). Follow up testing will be collected just like after the 1st
      infusion.

      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

      We will follow the subjects after the injections. They will either be seen in the clinic or
      the subject will be contacted by a research nurse yearly for 5 years.

      If they receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells as described above, they will be
      followed until 5 years after the last dose of GRALE T-cells.
