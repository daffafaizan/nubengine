      resistance, hypertension, triglyceride elevation, low levels of high-density lipoproteins,
      and obesity. Metformin and rosiglitazone are two insulinosensensitizers used in the treatment
      of diabetes. Now there is controversy over the use of insulinossensitizers in non-diabetic
      patients with metabolic syndrome. To compare the effect of insulin sensitizing drugs
      (metformin and rosiglitazone) over glucose homeostasis (GH) in no diabetic metabolic syndrome
      individuals. Randomized blinded clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome without
      diabetes was done, sample size (n=30). Prior to detailed information and signature of
      informed consent by patients was randomized forming three treatment groups, a) Placebo, b)
      Metformin (850 mg/day), c) Rosiglitazone (4 mg/day), treatment was administered for 8 weeks.
      GH was measured before and after treatment using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and
      IR-index (Homeostatic Model). Determination was performed on weight, size, body mass index,
      plicometry, blood pressure, fasting glucose levels, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and
      insulin. Statistic no parametric (Kruskal Wallis, Wilcoxon, U Mann Whitney) to compare
      characteristics inter o intra groups was done. Exact Fisher test was used for qualitative
      variable, and consider significance with p<0.05.
