      Primary

        -  Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients with unresectable locally
           advanced or regional stage IV squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head
           and neck treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, and definitive radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response rate and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by immunohistochemistry,
           EGFR phosphorylation, map kinase, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription
           3 (STAT3), and other tissue and serum tests with toxicity of this regimen and outcomes
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor site
      (hypopharynx vs. oropharynx vs. oral cavity vs. larynx), primary tumor stage (T1-3 vs. T4),
      and nodal status (N0 vs. N1 vs. N2-3).

        -  Cetuximab therapy: Patients receive an initial loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2 hours
           on day 1. Patients then receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43,
           50, and 57.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning on day 15 of cetuximab therapy, patients undergo
           radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for at least 7 weeks. Patients also receive
           cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 15, 36, and 57.

        -  Cetuximab maintenance therapy: After the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
           continue to receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6-12 months.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years.

      ACCRUAL: A total of 69 patients were accrued for this study.
