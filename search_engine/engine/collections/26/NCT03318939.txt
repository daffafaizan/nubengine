    
      The Screening period (Day -30 to Day -1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1,
      Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study.
      Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to undergoing any study
      procedures.

      Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be seven patient cohorts and
      eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20
      mutation status and prior treatment status:

        -  Cohort 1: Previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive
           NSCLC (closed to enrollment)

        -  Cohort 2: Previously treated patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation positive
           NSCLC (closed to enrollment)

        -  Cohort 3: Treatment naïve patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive NSCLC
           (fully enrolled)

        -  Cohort 4: Treatment naïve patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation positive NSCLC

        -  Cohort 5: Patients who meet the criteria for enrollment in Cohort 1 to 4, but the
           enrollment in the respective cohort has been closed

        -  Cohort 6: Patients with acquired EGFR mutation who progressed while on treatment with
           first-line osimertinib

        -  Cohort 7: Patients with EGFR or HER2 activating mutations

      Toxicity will be assessed based on the grade of the adverse events using CTCAE version 4.03.

      On Day 1 of each 28-day cycle, the patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be
      ≥1.5×10^9/L and platelet count must be ≥100×10^9/L before administering poziotinib. All
      patients will be treated until disease progression (except for first progression in Cohort
      5), death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for patient
      withdrawal.
