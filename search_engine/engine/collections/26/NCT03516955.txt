    
      An observational, multicenter, prospective study of Lebanese adult (18 years or older)
      hypercholesterolemic patients administered generic Rosuvastatin (SuperstatÂ®).

      Eligible newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemic patients took generic Rosuvastatin as
      prescribed by their treating physician. Assigning patients to generic Rosuvastatin was
      decided within the current practice and medical indication and was independent from the
      recruitment into the study.

      Patients were followed-up at the clinic as per the standard practice of care. Each patient
      was followed-up for a period of 2 months.
