      acquisition, especially in rights-constrained settings such as Kenya, where men's access to
      HIV prevention has been impeded by homophobia, stigma, and discrimination. Pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to greatly reduce HIV acquisition risk in this key
      population if accessible, sustainable PrEP programming with tailored, effective adherence
      support can be provided. To this end, close collaboration between PrEP program implementers
      and GBMSM-led community-based organizations is essential. Based on preliminary qualitative
      work, this theory-based and culturally relevant PrEP support intervention is called Shauriana
      (Kiswahili for "we counsel each other"). The Shauriana intervention merges peer navigation
      and "integrated Next Step Counseling" (iNSC) to promote sexual health protection strategies,
      including PrEP uptake and adherence, among GBMSM in Kisumu. The present proposal aims to
      pilot the intervention among 10 participants for 3 months, and then to evaluate the Shauriana
      intervention for acceptability, feasibility, safety, and estimated effect on PrEP uptake and
      adherence, compared to standard of care, in a small randomized, controlled study with 60
      participants followed for 6 months after enrollment. Results of the proposed research will
      have high impact by ensuring GBMSM involvement in the scale-up of effective PrEP programming
      for this key population in Kenya and providing a peer-led PrEP support model for GBMSM and
      other vulnerable and marginalized populations in African settings.
