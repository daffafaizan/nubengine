    
      This is a retrospective, open-label, single-centre study for the collection of clinical data
      on the efficacy and safety of the CuteraÂ® GenesisPlus 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser for the treatment
      of nail fungus (onychomycosis). Safety and efficacy of treatment with the GenesisPlus laser
      will be evaluated by (1) assessment of subject's great toenail photographs at baseline and
      after two treatments with GenesisPlus Laser utilizing planimetry measurement of infected vs.
      clear nail area in target toenail photographs, (2) by clinical and subjective review of acute
      and follow up adverse events that may have resulted from laser treatment of the target
      toenails.
