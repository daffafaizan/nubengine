      pain (SSP). Guidelines suggest exercise therapy for at least three months and research
      underlines the importance of progressive loaded exercise therapy at high dosage. However, it
      is not clear which is the best type of exercise and if pain should be provoked or avoided
      during exercise. Recent research found that painful exercises are beneficial in short term on
      pain and function in patients with different kinds of chronic musculoskeletal pain. The aim
      is to investigate if one painful exercise can give better and faster results in the
      management of SSP than non-painful program.
