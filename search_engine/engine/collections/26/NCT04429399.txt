      significant shunt effect when ventilated with higher PEEP levels could be prone to
      significant alveolar de-recruitment at the PEEP weaning attempt. To do so, the investigator
      has to measure the total shunt at higher PEEP level in patients ready to be weaned from the
      PEEP (according to the Mercat protocol), at three FiO2 levels (i.e. 0,3, 0,6 and 1). The
      shunt effect is quantified as the difference in total shunt between FiO2 0,3 and .The
      hypothesis of this study is that the shunt effect could predict alveolar de-recruitment when
      weaning PEEP.
