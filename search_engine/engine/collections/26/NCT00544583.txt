      (2). A major surgical complication after laparotomy is abdominal fascia dehiscence which
      might appear either as early (burst abdomen with evisceration) or as late complication
      (incisional hernia). These patients usually undergo surgery for secondary fascial closure
      associated with markedly increased morbidity (3) including high recurrence rates (up to 45%)
      (4). The applied surgical strategy of abdominal wall closure (i.e. the combination of suture
      technique and material) is of high relevance for prevention of fascia dehiscence and,
      moreover, constitutes the main factor directly controllable by the surgeon. While several
      randomized controlled trials (RCT) (3; 5-8) as well as meta-analyses (9-12) exist that
      address the issue of optimal fascia closure in elective laparotomies, there is no RCT dealing
      exclusively with the emergency setting. As a result abdominal fascia closure is performed
      according to the surgeon's individual preference rather than according to evidence-based
      data. Therefore, the present RCT is designed to compare the most established strategies
      (continuous slowly absorbable sutures and interrupted rapidly absorbable sutures) for
      abdominal wall closure in order to determine differences between both strategies after
      midline incisions.
