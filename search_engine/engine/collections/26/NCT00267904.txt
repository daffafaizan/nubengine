      functions of endogenous catecholamine systems. This Protocol is designed to enable ongoing
      quality assurance of diagnostic and research assays of catechols and their metabolites and to
      identify possible influences of dietary constituents and conditions of sampling.

      Study Populations: The study population is healthy volunteers.

      Design: Arm venous blood is drawn via an indwelling i.v. catheter from healthy volunteers, to
      obtain quality control plasma. Levels of catechols and their metabolites are related to
      dietary influences (cereal with milk, coffee, olives) and conditions of sampling (temperature
      at the skin).

      Outcome Measures: The main non-experimental outcome is an ongoing pool of quality control
      plasma. The main experimental outcome measures are plasma concentrations of catechols and
      their metabolites, physiological measures, and results of common clinical pathology tests.
      Effects of the experimental manipulations are assessed within subjects.
