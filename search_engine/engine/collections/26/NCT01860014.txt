      with PH included the severity of the associated illness, intrauterine growth restriction,
      patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coagulopathy, and the need for assisted ventilation.
      Currently, PH occurs mainly in preterm ventilated infants with severe respiratory distress
      syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant. Currently, PH complicates
      the hospital course of 3-5% of preterm infants with RDS. The cause of PH is thought to be due
      to a rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left to right shunting
      across a patent ductus arteriosus and an increase in pulmonary blood flow. Prospective
      uncontrolled studies that used surfactant for PH in neonates have shown promising results in
      treating PH.In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of two different natural
      surfactants in neonates with pulmonary hemorrhage.
