      eligible myeloma patients between 18 - 70 years of age. Patients will have four IRd cycles of
      28 day each as induction consisting of ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 and lenalidomide 25
      mg on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. After autologous stem cell
      mobilisation and transplantation patients will receive 2 consolidation cycles with the same
      combination as during induction. This is followed by risk based maintenance so that high-risk
      patients will have ixazomib plus lenalidomide maintenance and standard-low risk patients
      lenalidomide alone. The treatment will continue until progression or excess toxicity. The
      primary endpoint is minimal residual disease < 0.01% assessed by 8-color flow cytometry
      (EuroFlow) and secondary endpoint is achievement of minimal residual negativity status
      assessed by 8-color flow cytometry. Other secondary endpoints are safety, improvement of
      response during maintenance treatment, progression free survival, time to next treatment,
      quality of life and overall survival.
