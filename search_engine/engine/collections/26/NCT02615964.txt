      Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma at UIC rheumatology clinic and compare these results with
      previously established volumetric flow data for non-Raynaud's patients. Through this
      analysis, the invstigators will be able to better understand and correlate subjective and
      objective measures of both disease presentation and progression. Collection of cross
      sectional data will allow us to better address the following questions Is it possible to more
      precisely diagnose patients with Raynaud's disorder based on NOVA analysis as well as
      clinical findings

      Is it possible to stratify patients with Raynaud's disorder into categories which may allow:

      i. Prediction of disease course and prognosis ii. Prediction of response to specific
      treatment modalities (vasodilators vs anti-coagulation vs surgical or chemical denervation)
      The investigators propose to collect measurements of disease severity as well as functional
      assessment of patients Raynaud's and scleroderma in order to address the following questions
      c. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with measures of Raynaud's and scleroderma
      disease severity index d. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with OT assessment of hand
      functionality.
