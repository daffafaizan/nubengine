      cardiovascular complications.

      Perioperative and post-operative respiratory changes are secondary to anaesthesia (general
      anaesthesia, elongated position, tidal volume) and to surgery in particular abdominal and
      cardiothoracic surgery.

      Several risk factors related to patients were identified: age, ASA score> 2, functional
      dependence, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, obesity,
      smoking.

      Pulmonary ultrasound is a simple and rapid means of monitoring, widely used in resuscitation
      and developing in anaesthesia.

      The hypothesis of the study is that anaesthesia and / or ventilation is responsible for lung
      lesions observable by ultrasound from the recovery room, even after extra-thoracic surgeries.

      To do this, it will perform 3 pleuro-pulmonary ultrasound scans, preoperatively on the day of
      surgery, post-operatively in the recovery room and the day after surgery. LUS score will be
      calculated. Preoperative data (morphology, comorbidities), preoperative (ventilation,
      filling, position, type of anaesthesia - general anaesthesia with intubation or laryngeal
      mask, spinal anaesthesia- , type of surgery) and postoperative data (constants, oxygen
      therapy, complications) will be collected.
