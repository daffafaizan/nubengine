      romidepsin in conjunction with brentuximab vedotin in patients with untreated or previously
      treated (up to 2 prior systemic regimens, including photopheresis) CTCL. Dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT) will be determined during cycle 1. The first 3 subjects will begin at dose
      level 1. If no DLT is encountered another 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level.
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the dose level at which â‰¤ 1 of 6 of subjects
      experience DLT. If more than one subject at any one dose level encounters a DLT, the dose
      will be de-escalated for all subsequent subjects. Should no DLTs occur, the investigators
      will not escalate beyond dose level 1. Once the MTD has been confirmed, the investigators
      will enroll an additional 9 patients in a toxicity refinement cohort for a total of 15
      evaluable patients at the MTD.

      Treatment will continue for up to 16 cycles (one cycle is 28 days) or until disease
      progression or toxicities, whichever occurs first. Drugs can be continued after 16 cycles if
      a patient has derived a clinical benefit from treatment after discussion with the
      sponsor-investigator.
