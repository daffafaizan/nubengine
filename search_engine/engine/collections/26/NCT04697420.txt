      of post operative respiratory complications . A lot of patients presented to these operations
      may have comorbidities as impaired renal function and respiratory problems , conditions like
      these may contraindicate aministration of systemic analgesia as opioids .

      There are a lot of techniques to provide analgesia postoperatively as paravertebral block
      (PVB) and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block .

      Paravertebral block is effective technique for post operative analgesia for upper abdominal
      surgeries , but it may be associated with some complications as : pneumothorax , spread of
      local anesthetic to the epidural space and paravertebral blood vessels , and this may lead to
      systemic toxicity of local anesthetic .

      TAP block has been used to provide postoperative analgesia in a lot of abdominal surgeries
      including upper abdominal surgeries , but it is safer technique than PVB , but the
      effectiveness of TAP block is unknown in comparison with PVB in post operative analgesia
      after renal surgeries .
