      forms have a normal gamma globulin level.

      The level of gamma globulinemia has not yet been studied as an evolutionary predictive
      factor. Furthermore, there are disseminated granulomatoses sharing common characteristics
      with sarcoidosis, associated with Common Variable Immunodeficiency deficit (DICV) type
      Primary Immunodeficiency syndrome (DIP), thus occurring in hypogammaglobulinemic patients.
