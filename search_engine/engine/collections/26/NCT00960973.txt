      metabolism. The suggested mechanisms connecting vitamin K metabolism and glucose metabolism,
      are inflammation responses and osteocalcin effect on glucose metabolism. Most of the studies
      have investigated fasting glucose and insulin sensitive index, few have assessed
      glucose-intake-stimulated responses in regard to vitamin K supplementation. The purpose of
      this study is to test whether vitamin K supplementation has an effect on glucose metabolism
      in terms of acute beta cell response using intravenous glucose tolerance test.
