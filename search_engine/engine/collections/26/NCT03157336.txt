      motor deficits associated with chronic dietary reliance on cyanogenic cassava, a staple food
      crop for more than 600 millions of people living in the tropics. Aim 1 will implement a novel
      cassava processing method (wetting method, WTM) that safely removes cyanogenic compounds from
      cassava flour prior to human consumption in a stratified village-cluster randomized
      non-inferiority trial so as to compare the effectiveness of a peer-led intervention (women
      training other women in the WTM) with that by community-health worker specialists (2
      intervention training arms). Aim 2 will determine whether post-intervention reductions in
      cassava cyanogenic content and child U-SCN are associated with changes in biomarkers of
      cassava neurotoxicity particularly 8,12-iso-iPF2Î±-VI isoprostane (oxidant marker),
      carbamoylated albumin fragments KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR (residues 438-452) and LDELRDEGKASSAK
      (residues 206-219), or homocitrulline (carbamoylating markers), and scores at the KABC-II
      cognition and BOT-2 motor testing.
