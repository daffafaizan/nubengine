      regional anesthesia has the advantages of long-lasting pain relief & avoidance of airway
      instrumentation.Brachial plexus block is a very reliable method of regional anesthesia for
      the upper limb. It achieves ideal operating conditions by producing complete muscular
      relaxation and stable intraoperative hemodynamics.However,Local anesthetics alone have a
      shorter duration of postoperative analgesia. Hence,various adjuvants have been added to local
      anesthetics to achieve quick, dense, and prolonged block. This study assess and compare the
      efficacy of using 8 mg dexamethasone or 10 mg nalbuphine as adjuvants to local anesthetics
      mixture (Lidocaine 2% + bupivacaine 0.5% 1:1 mixture) in Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular
      brachial plexus block for upper limb surgeries below the level of the shoulder.
