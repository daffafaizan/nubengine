    
      This is a single-site, two-arm, 1:1 randomized, prospective, interventional, pilot study to
      determine whether clinician directed swallowing therapy will improve patient swallowing
      function outcomes when compared to patient-directed home-based swallowing therapy.

      The investigators anticipate at least 40 subjects will need to be enrolled/consented in order
      to obtain the accrual goal of 15 evaluable subjects for each group for a total of 30
      participants.

      All subjects in each group will receive a face-to-face education session with a speech
      pathologist to review a recommended program of swallowing exercises prior to initiation of
      chemoradiation at their baseline (pre-treatment evaluation session).
