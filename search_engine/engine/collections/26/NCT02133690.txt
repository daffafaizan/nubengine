      infants, with the initial dose given at 6-8 weeks of age and followed by vaccinations at
      monthly intervals, will significantly reduce the incidence of severe rotavirus
      gastroenteritis (SRVGE). Duration of follow-up is until aged 2 years of each enrolled child.
      The study is powered to detect vaccine efficacy significantly greater than 10% (95%
      confidence interval lower bound > 10%) if the true vaccine efficacy is 50% or higher.
