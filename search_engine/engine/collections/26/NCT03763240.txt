      (BSE) on blood glucose in pre-diabetic individuals without metformin treatment. This will
      address whether BSE could be used to improve glucose control in drug-na√Øve pre-diabetic
      individuals. The participants will receive BSE or placebo in a randomized double-blind
      parallel arm study. The participants will take their study compound once daily over 12 weeks.
      The primary study variable is fasting glucose.
