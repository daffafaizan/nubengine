    
      The DETOUR2 study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, international, non-randomized,
      safety and effectiveness clinical investigation of the PQ Bypass system.

      The PQ Bypass System is intended to improve blood flow in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral arterial disease due to symptomatic femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions ≥ 20
      cm (TASC D) that can include de novo, restenotic, or in-stent restenotic lesions; or
      Symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions ≥ 24 cm (total lesion length) that can include a chronic
      total occlusion or a ≥70% lesion that includes de novo, restenotic or in-stent restenosis
      (complex TASC C), with reference vessel diameters ranging from 5.0 - 6.7 mm, by investigator
      visual assessment.
