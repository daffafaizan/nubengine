      women. The progressively increasing trend of delay in first conception increases such
      patients who wish to have children.3 The recommended treatment for EH without atypia is
      primarily hormonal, whereas the preferred treatment for EH with atypia is hysterectomy given
      the significant risk for both concurrent and subsequent development of endometrial carcinoma.
      A dilemma results when EH with atypia is diagnosed in women who wish to retain fertility or
      declining doing hysterectomy due to concomitant medical morbidities. In these women, a trial
      of hormone therapy can be considered.4,5 In recent years, progestin therapy has been
      successfully used to treat selected women with endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia
      who desire to preserve fertility or having severe medical co-morbidities precluding
      (immediate) surgery. The most common progestin regimens include Megestrol acetate (MA) and
      the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUD).5-7
