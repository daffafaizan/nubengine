    
      Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common injuries. In recent
      years, arthroscopic techniques have rapidly evolved with advanced tools such as suture
      anchors, resolvable pins and internal bracing techniques. One of the very latest developments
      in internal bracing and repair for proximal ACL ruptures is the InternalBraceTM (Arthrex
      Inc., Naples, Florida, USA). The purpose of this study is to quantify 2-year postoperative
      clinical and functional outcomes including side-to-side differences in gait function,
      balance, proprioception and muscle strength in patients treated by ACL repair with Internal
      Brace Ligament Augmentation.
