      Treatment is based on the principles of 'minimally invasive treatment techniques'.

      Main difference with the 'standard' treatment protocol and the standard procedure of placing
      composite restorations is the fully digital workflow. In the traditional workflow a silicon
      impression is made, after which the dental technician produces the (indirect) composite
      restorations in by hand. These restorations are then adhesively cemented on the teeth by the
      dentist. In the fully digital workflow, digital 3D-scans are made using the 3D LAVA scanner
      (3M ESPE). Based on these digital 3D-images a digital wax-up is made by the dental technician
      after which all composite restorations (uplays and backings) are designed digitally before
      being milled and finally adhesively cemented on the teeth by the dentists. An important
      benefit for the patients is the rehabilitation of their worn dentitions. Functionality (teeth
      are less sensitive, improved chewing ability, a better occlusal stability, etc) and
      aesthetics will be improved immediately after finishing the treatment. Moreover, the
      estimated treatment time will be less (estimated treatment time approx. 12hours) than the
      traditional methods when using the standard treatment protocol (estimated treatment time
      approx. 18hours).

      Another potential benefit is a better control and more predictable results by using 3D-images
      with the pre-designed computer simulation.

      A risk of these indirect composite resin restorations is the unknown survival rate compared
      to other indirect as well as to direct application technique
