      knowledge about the mechanisms in the development of viral pneumonia and the influence of
      other organ systems at SARS-CoV2, we believe that in the future it is better to be able to
      identify precisely those persons who are at risk of serious illness. To this we will gain
      knowledge of how humans develops immunity to the virus and also how human epigenetic
      (acquired) ability to activate inflammatory genetic systems can limit the harmful effects of
      the virus. Thus, patients who have had mild or no symptoms are just as interesting from a
      study point of view as those who have had severe symptoms. Hopefully, such understanding can
      also contribute to other opportunities for targeted treatment (by identifying patients who
      can mount effective inborn and adaptive host defenses) in order to prevent severe disease and
      death in pandemic corona infection.
