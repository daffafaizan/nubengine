    
      Approximately 60 subjects who require at least one posterior maxilla implant in the areas of
      the second pre-molars or (first or second) molars with 6 to 9 mm of crestal bone below the
      sinus floor, as determined on the computerized axial tomographic (CT) scan, will be recruited
      for the study. Subjects will receive dental implants to replace a missing tooth (second
      pre-molar or first/second molar) on one side of the maxillary arch. Each subject will receive
      one type of implant: platform switched (PS) or platform matching (PM). Each site will receive
      either a bone graft material composed of anorganic bovine bone mineralized (ABBM, Bio-Oss,
      Geistlich Pharma) or no graft material (collagen membrane used for wound healing (Collatape,
      Zimmer)). At implant placement surgery and post-surgical follow-ups, the treated site will be
      examined, clinically measured, and radiographs and photographs will be taken.

      The central hypothesis is that the mean crestal bone level for the platform switched (test
      implants) implants will be superior to the mean crestal bone level for the platform matching
      (control implants) implants when placed in limited maxillary residual bone in the posterior
      regions, regardless of the use of bone graft material or collagen membrane.
