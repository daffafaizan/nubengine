    
      Primary objective: to analyze the effect of citrate dialysate on acid base balance decreasing
      chronic metabolic acidosis and avoiding / reducing post-dialytic alkalosis.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the effect of dialysate on the variation of calcium pre and post-dialytic, as
           well as on the parathormone (PTH)

        -  Assess the effect of dialysate on inflammation

        -  Assess the effect of dialysate on the Elimination of small and medium-sized molecules

        -  Assess the effect of dialysate on the tolerance to the hemodialysis sessions

        -  Assess the effect of dialysate on nutritional parameters

      Patients: Adult patients dialysed three times per week for at least 3 months will be enrolled
      in 12 Spanish dialysis centres. Catheter as vascular access will be excluded.

      Design: prospective randomized multicenter, cross-over trial of chronic haemodialysis
      patients to compare the effect of citrate dialysate with acetate dialysate.

      Duration of study: 32 weeks, in two phases. Randomised to 16 weeks of hemodialysis with
      acetate followed by 16 weeks of citrate or 16 weeks of hemodialysis with citrate followed by
      16 weeks of acetate. Each patient will serve as control of itself and there will be no
      changes in the pattern of dialysis during the study with the exception of the dialysate,
      following the usual pattern of work
