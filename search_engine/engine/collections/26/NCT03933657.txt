      collect data on safety and efficacy based on clinical use of the SoundBiteâ„¢ Crossing System.

      This study will include a cost benefit analysis that will focus on wire and other
      Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) device usage during the procedure. The cost
      benefit will be compared to the sites data on their average costs for CTO crossing cases.

      The planned treatment pathway elected prior to procedure will be compared to subject's
      treatment pathway plan post -procedure (discharge, surgeries such as bypass, amputation etc.)
      will be collected to determine patient outcomes.
