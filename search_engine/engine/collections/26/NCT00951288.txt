      defects) and relatively preserved central retinal function and visual acuity will be
      enrolled. AMD patients will be randomly divided into two groups: 1. placebo group [n = 15),
      taking for three months an oral placebo; 2. Saffron group (n = 15), taking Saffron oral
      treatment (20 mg/day) for three months. After three months of placebo or Saffron
      supplementation, patients will be tested with standard ophthalmic examination and FERGs.
      Then, placebo with Saffron and vice-versa will be changed to the same patients in a
      cross-over design. After a further three month period of placebo or study drug
      supplementation, patients will undergo again a standard ophthalmic examination, and FERG.
      Throughout the study, both patients and experimenters will be masked as to the identity of
      pills (i.e. whether placebo or study drug), whose identification key number will be kept in a
      sealed envelope that will be opened only at the completion of the study. Therapeutic
      compliance will be tested by careful questioning, either at two weeks of treatment (by
      telephone interview) or at the end of the treatment period, as well as by pill count. Main
      outcome measures of the study will be FERG amplitude and phase.
