      transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more nicotine being absorbed
      through the skin than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known
      about how the release of nicotine is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that
      are also available over the counter. This study will use nicotine patches (brand name and
      generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are
      already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any
      placebos.
