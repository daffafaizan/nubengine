      Paclitaxel-eluting stent system in the treatment of stenoses in native coronary arteries
      compared to the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and to
      study the influence of both devices on endothelial function, coronary flow reserve, and stem
      cell mobilization. This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center, two-armed phase-II
      study. During the PEPCAD III trial, 40 patients of the Homburg / Saar center will be randomly
      assigned to ei-ther one of the treatment groups (20 patients treated with DEBlue, 20 patients
      with Cypher®). Patients with stable or selected forms of unstable angina or documented
      ischemia due to a significant lesion in a native coronary artery will be included. Vessels
      may not supply an en-tirely infarcted myocardial area. Additional 20 patients receiving
      uncoated stents (Coroflex® Blue, B.Braun) will undergo the same diagnostic procedures.
