    
      1/ Evaluating the frequency of mutations of the two main genes implicated in PCD, in a large
      cohort of patients with PCD confirmed by ciliary investigations.2/ Identifying and testing
      new candidate genes responsible not only for typical PCD and related disorders of the
      axoneme, but also for so far-unexplored "syndromic forms of PCD", taking advantage of data
      obtained through comparative genomic approaches between different species, ciliated or not.
