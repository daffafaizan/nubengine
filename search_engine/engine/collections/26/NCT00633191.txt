      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hens farm is under veterinary control according to Swedish rules.
      The drug is prepared with a water dilution method according to GMP standards (approved by
      Swedish MPA). Patients with CF who are intermittently but not chronically infected with P.
      aeruginosa get a short course of antibiotics to eradicate the bacteria. Thereafter they start
      to gargle with a solution of "anti-pseudomonas IgY" every night to prevent a new infection.
      Preliminary results have shown that it takes a significantly longer time to get a new
      infection and that the patients get fewer infections than control patients. In addition,
      results tentatively indicate that: patients have not got any new opportunistic bacteria or
      fungi (B. Cepacia, S. Maltophilia, A. Xylosoxidans, atypical Mycobacteria, Aspergillus
      Fumigatus); that use of antibiotics is greatly diminished; that the lung functions and
      nutritional conditions are maintained.
