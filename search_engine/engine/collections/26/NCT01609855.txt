      criteria included: glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia or urinary obstruction, previous
      intestinal resection, ongoing therapy with tricyclic antidepressants, chronic renal failure
      and history of IBD. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either 20 mg/2ml of HBB i.v.
      or 2ml of saline i.v.; both the endoscopist and the patient were blind to the administered
      drug. The endoscopist was asked to inspect the right, transverse and left colon for at least
      2 min for each segment. The number, size and location of polyps were recorded as well as the
      occurrence episodes of tachycardia (defined as bpm>140). As indirect estimation of the amount
      of air retained in the abdomen at the end of the procedure, the DAC (difference in the
      abdominal circumference measured before and after colonoscopy) was also calculated. At
      discharge (at least 1 hour after colonoscopy) the bloating perceived by the patient was
      measured by means of a VA scale (range 0-100).
