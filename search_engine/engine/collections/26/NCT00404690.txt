      groups of 4. Randomization sequence will be kept by the principal investigator. After
      permission is obtained, the next assignment will be obtained. This method assures that the
      physician obtaining permission will be blind to the treatment group.

      The treatment groups will consist of the same medical management, feeding regimen and
      discharge criteria.

      The interventions will be either bedside silo or operative attempt at closure. During attempt
      at primary closure, the abdomen will be closed completely if the staff anesthesiologist and
      surgeon agree the belly is not too tight based on ventilatory parameters, vital signs and
      appearance. If either the surgeon or anesthesiologist should feel the closed abdomen is too
      tight, a ringed silo will be placed in the operating room, the same silo used in the bedside
      treatment arm, and the child will continue in the study. When a silo is placed either in the
      operating room due to inability to close the abdomen or at the bedside, they will be managed
      the same way. The skin will be dressed in the standard fashion (betadine jelly, xeroform and
      kerlix). The dressing allows visualization of the bowel. No reductions will be done the day
      of placement. After one night of observation a tie will be gently placed to apply downward
      pressure on the bowel. This pressure will not be allowed to increase the peak ventilator
      pressure by more than 2 cm H2O. One tie will be placed each subsequent day until the tie is
      within 2 cm of the skin at which point the patient will be scheduled for operative closure
      the day following the placement of the tie.

      The medical management is controlled for resuscitation, sedation, ventilation and feeding
      between groups.
