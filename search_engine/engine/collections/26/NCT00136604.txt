      booster dose of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib (active control) at 15 to 24
      months in a single-blind manner so that the subjects' parents will not know which vaccine was
      administered to their child (this booster phase is no longer recruiting). In the Mencevax
      ACWY phase at 24-30 months a dose of Mencevax ACWY will be given to subjects who were not
      boosted with a MenA conjugate and/or MenC containing vaccine at 15-24 months in an open
      manner (this booster phase is not yet recruiting). Up to four blood samples will be taken:
      before and one month after the administration of the DTP booster dose and of Mencevax ACWY.
      To comply with the immunisation calender of Thailand, at 15-24 months all subjects will
      receive OPV. At 16-25 months 2 doses of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine or a dose of
      varicella vaccine will be offered and at 25-31 months a dose of varicella or JE vaccine will
      be offered.
