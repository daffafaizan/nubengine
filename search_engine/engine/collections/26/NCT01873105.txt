    
      Specific Aims are to:

        1. Describe patterns of communication about discharge and collaboration among members of
           the health care team

        2. Conduct psychometric testing of 3 forms of the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale
           (RHDS - MD, RN, Patient)

        3. Describe relationships between care team communication, patient perceptions of quality
           of discharge preparation and perceived readiness for discharge, care team (RN and MD)
           assessments of discharge readiness, and post-discharge outcome ( post-discharge coping
           difficulty, Emergency Department (ED) use, and 30 day readmission.

        4. Determine the impact of an intervention with the inpatient care team to improve
           discharge preparation communication.

      H1: Patient perceptions of discharge readiness, post-discharge coping difficulty, ED use and
      readmission will improve following a care team educational intervention about discharge
      preparation, compared to pre-intervention baseline measures.

      H2: Care team members will report improved frequency and amount of discharge preparation
      communication following a care team educational intervention about discharge preparation,
      compared to pre-intervention baseline measures.

      H3: RN-MD collaboration will increase following a care team educational intervention about
      discharge preparation, compared to pre-intervention baseline measures
