    
      The process objectives target focus on1) recruitment, 2) retention, 3) engagement with tools,
      4) time demand on dyads, and 5) eligibility criteria.

      The resource assessment objectives include: 1) equipment and internet accessibility 2)
      communication methods, and 3) timelines.

      The management assessment objectives address: 1) ethical standards, 2) researcher
      qualifications and 3) data storage and collection.

      Finally, when looking at the scientific assessment, the objectives relate to: 1) Is use of a
      concurrent multiple baseline single-subject design feasible with this population? 2)capturing
      dyad needs, 3) burden levels, and 4) safety protocols.

      This study will evaluate the above listed dimensions of feasibility using a embedded mixed
      methods approach that incorporates both a single-subject design and qualitative data gathered
      throughout the research process and post intervention individual interviews.
