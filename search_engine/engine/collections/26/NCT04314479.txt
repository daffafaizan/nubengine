      that integrates telephone coaching and printed materials about the ACS guidelines and healthy
      lifestyle behaviors in order to manage symptoms after treatment for cancer. The study
      population is 36 Latinas who have recently completed treatment for solid tumor cancers and
      their informal caregiver (36 dyads). Research suggests that family members can be
      facilitators to behavior change more specifically, Latinos rely on family support more than
      non-Hispanic Whites.

      Fewer than 20% of Latina cancer survivors meet the American Cancer Society's (ACS) Guidelines
      on Nutrition and Physical Activity. Healthier lifestyle behaviors (such as diet and physical
      activity) would result in an immediate benefit of reduced symptoms and long-term benefit of
      improved health while lowering cancer risk. This pilot study tests an intervention that will
      help in lessening survivors' symptoms to improve adherence to the ACS guidelines for cancer
      prevention ultimately improving overall health. A telephone-based intervention does not
      require any in-person meetings (outside of initial recruitment) and lessens participant
      burden.

      The Specific Aims of this project are to evaluate this intervention among 36 survivors who
      have recently completed treatment for solid tumor cancers and their informal caregivers to 1)
      Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention 2) Establish the preliminary
      efficacy for improvement in diet, physical activity, and quality of life for the dyads, and
      symptom burden for survivors through surveys given at baseline and study completion as well
      as a weekly symptom distress survey.
