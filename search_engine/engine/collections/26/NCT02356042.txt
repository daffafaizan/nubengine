      make older adults aware of their abilities through an improvement of emotional well-being
      (1). GIA protected against in-hospital mortality in demented older inpatients and has also
      been associated with shorter length of hospital stay in geriatric inpatients. These
      GIA-related positive effects suggest that GIA activity may improve health and functional
      status in the elderly. To date, effects of GIA on health and functional status in nursing
      home residents have not been examined.

      Based on the previous positive effects reported in older inpatients practicing GIA activity,
      the investigators hypothesized that GIA activity could improve health and/or functional
      status of nursing homes residents.
