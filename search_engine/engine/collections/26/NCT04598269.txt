    
      This is a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of ATI-1777 solution following
      twice-daily applications to target areas of patients with moderate or severe atopic
      dermatitis (AD).

      Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility up to 30 days prior to
      randomization. Patients who meet all the entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 to active
      or vehicle treatment. Patients will apply study drug (ATI-1777 topical solution 2.0% w/w or
      vehicle) twice daily for 4 weeks with weekly study visits and will return 2 weeks after the
      last dose of study medication for a Post treatment Follow-up (PTFU) Visit. Adverse event (AE)
      collection, physical examinations, clinical disease assessments (Eczema Area and Severity
      Index [EASI], Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA], AD body surface area [BSA], Peak
      Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS]), vital sign assessments, PK evaluations, and
      clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed as detailed in the Schedule of Events.
