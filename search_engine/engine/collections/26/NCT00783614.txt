      general hypothesis is that HIV-mediated inflammation and injury to vascular surfaces
      up-regulates thrombotic pathways and leads to damage of blood vessels that is promotes
      development of cardiovascular disease. HIV drug treatment (antiretroviral therapy; ART) may
      reduce inflammation and vessel injury via suppression of HIV replication, but also includes
      side effects or toxicity that may increase risk for cardiovascular disease in and of itself.
      In this context, additional anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic medications are needed.
      Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an excellent candidate and is commonly used for secondary
      prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population, but few studies have examined
      it's use in persons with HIV infection. The goal of this study is to generate pilot data
      regarding changes in measures of cardiovascular risk, as determined by reductions in
      inflammatory and thrombotic blood markers and a decrease in blood vessel injury (blood
      markers) and dysfunction (assessment of arterial elasticity), that occur after starting ART
      and aspirin among persons with HIV infection.
