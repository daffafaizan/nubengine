      (duration 30 months) and cross-sectional with implementation of a blood bank in link with a
      multicenter database including clinical data on birth, auxology, endocrine functions and
      feeding behaviour. The cohort will include 200 infants from 3 to 48 months with PWS and 200
      controls matched on age recruited in the 6 participating countries. The investigators make
      the assumption that 3 blood sampling will be necessary during the first year and 6 monthly
      sampling thereafter. For measuring hormones and neuropeptides (ghrelin, insulin, leptin,
      pancreatic polypeptide, oxytocin, cortisol, melatonin, orexin A, GLP-1 and PYY) involved in
      feeding and appetite regulation the investigators will use primarily multiplex microplates
      technics requiring 50-200Âµl of sample. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons will be
      performed in order to describe the evolution of each hormone with time and to compare data
      obtained in the PWS group with those obtained in the control group.
