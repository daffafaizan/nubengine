      first postoperative hours after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The intraperitoneal
      administration of lidocaine solution (total dose, 3.5 mg/kg) will be done as follows:
      immediately after creation of the pneumoperitoneum, the surgeon will spray 50-75 ml of the
      total solution on the upper surface of the liver under the right sub-diaphragmatic space, and
      another 50-75ml of the total solution under the left sub-diaphragmatic space. In order to
      allow the sprayed solution to diffuse under the diaphragmatic space, the Trendelenburg
      position will be maintained for 2 minutes.

      In the infiltration group will be administrating 5 ml lidocaine at each port site before
      incision, then the surgeon will spray 50-75 ml of the total solution on the upper surface of
      the liver under the right sub-diaphragmatic space, and another 50-75ml of the total solution
      under the left sub-diaphragmatic space then 50 ml will be infiltrated in the bladder bed
      after clamping of the cystic duct and cystic artery. CO2 will be humidified and wormed.
