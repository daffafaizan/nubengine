      days a week, for 2 weeks. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated
      schedule. Subjects and scale-rater physician were blind to treatment status of individuals.
      Only the rTMS administrator was aware of group allocations. Treatment response was assessed
      by self-and clinician-rated scales before treatment, immediately after treatment and 3 months
      thereafter, with the same examiner following a subject throughout the study. All patients
      included in the study had failed adequate pharmacological treatment for at least 2
      antiobsessional drugs. Their prescription drugs were continued without change in dosage
      regimens throughout the study.
