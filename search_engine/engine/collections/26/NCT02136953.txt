    
      This study aims to determine if a standard, evidence-based 12-week aerobic exercise program
      results in significant reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and associated
      cognitive dysfunction as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with the first-line
      psychological treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). There are 3 broad aims to this
      study: 1) to compare the relative efficacy of Exercise, CBT, and their combination (CBT+Ex)
      versus a non-treatment waitlist control (WL), 2) to examine the extent to which
      neuropsychological features of OCD improve following treatments, and 3) to determine the
      extent to which the BDNF gene and protein are a) associated with learning and cognitive
      factors, and b) moderate symptom and cognitive change across treatments.

      The study design allows for a novel, well-powered and potentially landmark study on the
      impact of exercise on obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and cognitive functioning in OCD,
      both as a stand-alone treatment and when augmenting CBT. If this study can demonstrate that a
      short aerobic exercise program of 12 weeks duration can confer significant clinical gains for
      those suffering with OCD, then it could easily be translated into highly accessible, routine
      clinical care. Further, demonstration of improvement in OCD-associated cognitive dysfunction,
      given the refractory nature of the illness, would provide another avenue into the long-term
      enhancement of outcomes for this chronically affected population.
