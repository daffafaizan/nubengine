      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. Treatment is difficult. Most available therapies focus on
      habituation rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus is thought to be generated in the brain,
      as a result of functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and tonotopic maps in
      the central auditory system, following damage to the peripheral auditory system.
      Low-frequency rTMS has been investigated for the treatment of hyperexcitability disorders
      such as auditory hallucinations and tinnitus. Pilot data indicate that the beneficial effect
      of low-frequency rTMS can be enhanced by low frequency rTMS of the right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In the proposed study we investigate whether low frequency rTMS of
      the DLPFC improves therapeutic efficacy of low-frequency rTMS on tinnitus in a controlled
      trial.
