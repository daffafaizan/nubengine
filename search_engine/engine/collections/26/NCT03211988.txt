      system and other organs and comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Because NETs can
      arise in a broad spectrum of locations they are associated with a broad range of symptoms
      that may be caused by mass effects and/or by the production of hormones or biogenic amines.

      Most recently, entinostat has been shown to down-regulate the number and function of two key
      immunosuppressive cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells
      (Tregs), in the tumor microenvironment thereby enhancing the activity of immune checkpoint
      inhibition. To date, entinostat has been investigated alone or in combination in >900
      patients with cancer in clinical studies, including >600 patients with solid tumors.
      Entinostat as a single agent has been studied in metastatic melanoma and in combination has
      been studied in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, renal cell
      cancer, and colon cancer.
