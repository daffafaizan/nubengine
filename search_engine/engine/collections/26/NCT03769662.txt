      Treatment of Osteoarthritic Pain.

      Participants in this study will have been enrolled in the 0201 study and qualify for an
      intra-articular injection of XT-150 into the osteoarthritic knee.

      The study will assess XT-150 safety, tolerability, and efficacy in participants who received
      placebo in the 0201 study, or have a second qualifying knee, or a second injection into the
      same knee that was treated in 0201.
