    
      An assessor-blind, randomized control trial will be conducted. Eighty-four people with
      sub-acute stroke and fulfill the eligibility criteria will be recruited from the medical
      wards of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) or from the Physiotherapy Department of the QEH.
      Subjects will be randomly allocated into either dual-task training (DT) group (n=28) or
      single-task training (ST) group (n=28) or Control (C) group (n=28) by 1:1:1 randomization
      sequence after baseline evaluation. All subjects will receive usual physiotherapy training.
      Subjects in the DT group will undergo 30 minutes of dual task training with simultaneously
      performing balance and walking exercise and attention demanding tasks, and 30 minutes of
      stretching exercises whereas those in the ST group will undergo single task training with 30
      minutes of balance and walking exercise and 30 minutes of attention demanding task performed
      separately. Subjects in the control group will receive stretching and strengthening exercise
      only. The training program will last for 8 weeks with frequency of 2 sessions a week and
      duration of 60 minutes per session.

      The degree of the dual-task interference, the balance and walking performance in dual task
      conditions will be evaluated at three time points: (1) Baseline (within one week before the
      intervention (2) within one week after completion of training (3) 8 weeks after the
      completion of training by blinded assessors. Also, the subjects will have monthly telephone
      follow up on the fall incidence for 6 months after completion of the program.
