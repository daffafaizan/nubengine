      performed a clinical trial with 0.6mg/kg, which is lower than the internationally approved
      dosage of 0.9mg/kg, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of alteplase for the Japanese.

      The primary endpoints were the rate of patients with mRS score of 0-1 at 3 months and the
      incidence of sICH within 36 hours. Thresholds for these endpoints were determined by
      calculating 90% confidence intervals of weighted averages derived from published reports. The
      protocol was defined according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
      (NINDS) rt-PA stroke study with slight modifications.
