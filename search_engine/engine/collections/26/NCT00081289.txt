        -  Evaluate the pathologic complete response rate in patients with locally advanced rectal
           cancer undergoing surgical resection treated with 2 different regimens of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the time to treatment failure and patterns of failure in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Evaluate the incidence of hematologic and non-hematologic grade 3-4 toxicity
           (preoperatively, postoperatively, and overall) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      clinical stage of tumor (T3 vs T4). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, within 1 week after completion of radiotherapy,
      within 1 week after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (12 months), and then at 24 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
