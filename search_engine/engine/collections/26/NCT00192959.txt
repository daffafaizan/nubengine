      variables derived from four validated neuropsychological tests of cognitive function; Visual
      Verbal Learning test, Concept Shifting test, Stroop Color Word Interference test and Letter
      Digit Coding test. The parameter was used for comparing changes in test results between the
      screening and first postoperative follow-up testing for the treatment groups.Secondary
      endpoints:- Cognitive performance changes from baseline to the first post-operative follow-up
      judged separately for each of the seven variables from the changes in the test results.-
      Cognitive performance changes from baseline to the second postoperative follow-up judged
      separately and globally for each of the seven variables from the changes in test results.-
      Adequacy of ventilation (respiratory rate and pulse oximetry)- Adequacy of xenon sedation by
      monitoring depth of unconsciousness, signs of airway irritation, need for additional
      sedatives, time to recovery from anaesthesia. - Technical performance of xenon delivery
