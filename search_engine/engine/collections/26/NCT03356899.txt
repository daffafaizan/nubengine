      written informed consent, a hundred full-term pregnant ladies undergoing elective cesarean
      section were enrolled in this study.

      The pregnant ladies were randomly assigned using a computerised software to one of two
      groups, low dose bupivacaine (LB) and high dose bupivacaine (HB), 50 patients each according
      to bupivacaine dose. Group LB received low dose bupivacaine (8 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine)
      Group HB received high dose bupivacaine (10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine).

      Vital signs including heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure intra-operatively until the
      end of surgery.

      The severity of shivering was the primary endpoint. Shivering was graded using a scale: 0, no
      shivering; 1, piloerection but no visible muscle activity; 2, muscular activity in one group
      of muscle; 3, muscular activity in more than one muscle group but not generalized movement;
      and 4, shivering involving the movement of the whole body. Shivering score was recorded for
      the whole study period.
