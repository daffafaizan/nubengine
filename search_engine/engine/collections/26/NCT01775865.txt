    
      Aim 1: To measure aortic wall stiffness and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress during
      both acute (IV) intravenous infusions of saline and then the antioxidant vitamin C at
      baseline and after 4 weeks of salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults. Hypothesis 1:
      Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will decrease aortic wall stiffness in part by
      reductions in oxidative stress.

      Aim 2: To measure brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) and circulating
      markers of oxidative stress during acute intravenous infusions of saline and then the vitamin
      C at baseline and after 4 weeks of salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults. Hypothesis
      2: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve vascular endothelial vasodilatory
      function in older adults in part by reductions in oxidative stress.

      Aim 3: To measure left ventricular (LV) diastolic relaxation and filling dynamics and
      circulating markers of oxidative stress during both acute intravenous infusions of saline and
      then vitamin C at baseline and after 4 weeks of Salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults.
      Hypothesis 3: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve LV diastolic function
      in part by reductions in oxidative stress.

      Exploratory Aim: To measure 24-hour pressure variability and short-term baroreflex
      sensitivity before and after 4 weeks of oral Salsalate or placebo treatment in older adults.
      Exploratory hypothesis: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve
      cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation in older healthy adults.
