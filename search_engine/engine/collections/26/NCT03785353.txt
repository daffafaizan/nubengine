      healthcare professionals. With the ever-growing opioid epidemic, there are a variety of
      discussions on different modes of treatment other than opioid prescription. Pain neuroscience
      education, or PNE, is one of these alternative treatment options. PNE focuses on a patient's
      understanding of pain itself and relates this to the current pain they are experiencing. PNE
      is often a discussion between provider and patient that utilizes a series of stories,
      metaphors, and examples where pain is described from a point of view that is not strictly
      medical. Recent literature suggests there is a lack of knowledge regarding pain in the United
      States, particularly in the Spanish-speaking population. This population is also less likely
      to seek a physician's advice for pain management. For these reasons, this study will focus on
      the Spanish-speaking population within the Winchester community. Due to success within prior
      PNE studies, this study will be conducted through a classroom lecture. The overarching
      purpose of this study is to examine the change in knowledge of pain in the Spanish-speaking
      population immediately following a PNE lecture composed of stories, metaphors, and examples
      about pain. Because Spanish-speaking individuals are less likely to seek out a medical
      provider, the study may support an additional treatment option for managing chronic pain. Not
      only will this provide further research to support the benefits of PNE, but there is the
      potential to modify a participant's perception of their own pain through this educational
      lecture.
