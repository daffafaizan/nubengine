      to improve their long-term health. A randomized-control trial in four northern California
      counties will compare changes in pesticide exposure among child care centers assigned to an
      IPM intervention versus an attention control intervention on physical activity. Eighty-eight
      child care centers serving socio-economically and ethnically diverse preschool-age children
      will be enrolled. This study will be modeled on a successful nurse-led child care health
      consultation intervention comprised of an educational workshop, materials and tools, and
      center-specific consultation over seven months. In addition, the study will include novel
      methods of measuring pesticide concentrations in child care centers (dust) and to individual
      children in the child care settings (silicone wristbands). The study aims are to determine if
      a nurse-led IPM intervention (1) increases child care center staff's IPM knowledge, (2)
      improves center's IPM policies and practices, (3) reduces pest problems (i.e., pests present,
      pest residue), (4) increases director's self-efficacy, (5) reduces pesticide exposures in
      child care center environments, and (6) reduces child-level pesticide exposures in the
      intervention child care centers compared to the control centers.
