      I. To compare response rate (RR) of gemcitabine and nivolumab (G+N) after 4 cycles (8 weeks)
      to historical controls treated with nivolumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare median overall survival (OS) of G+N to historical controls treated with
      nivolumab alone.

      II. To compare median progression-free survival (PFS) of G+N to historical controls treated
      with nivolumab alone.

      III. To evaluate for tolerability of G+N at each treatment cycle and then every 8 weeks after
      treatment is completed.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate immunophenotypic changes among lymphocytes (quantitative measurements of CD4
      and CD8 T-cells) with radiographic response and overall survival before treatment, after
      treatment and between 8-12 weeks after treatment.

      II. Among those patients with tumor mutation burden (TMB) status available, to describe the
      association between TMB (low, medium, or high) and RR, OS, and PFS.

      III. Assess the patient perspective of symptomatic adverse events using self-reported items
      from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, 6-10 weeks, and
      every 8 weeks thereafter.
