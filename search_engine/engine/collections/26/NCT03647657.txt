      177Lu-PP-F11N and tumor uptake in all patients. Co-injection of Physiogel (Gelofusin) showed
      insignificant reduction of kidney uptake and can therefore be omitted for a radionuclide
      therapy with 177Lu-PP-F11N. In this study, the effect of the NEP-1 inhibitor Sacuitril on the
      in-vivo stability of 177Lu-PP-F11N and the uptake, respectively radiation doses in MTC
      metastases and organs will be evaluated, using a cross-over design already used for the Lumed
      part A study. Each patient will receive two injections of 177Lu-PP-F11N, with and without
      additional medication with Sacuitril Imaging findings, acquired by SPECT/CT, will be compared
      to imaging with 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The inclusion of 8
      patients is planned.
