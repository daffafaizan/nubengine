      acid) or placebo before a mixed meal. Plasma samples will be taken for 300min from the radial
      artery and from a forearm vein for measurements of glucose, insulin, triglycerides,
      non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol. Muscle blood flow will be measured with
      strain-gauge plethysmography. Glucose flux will be calculated as the arteriovenous difference
      of glucose multiplied by the blood flow rates.
