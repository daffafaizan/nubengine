      newborns.Patients were identified by chart review and consent was received by nurse
      researcher. Newborns were randomized into either the control group who received no pain

      performed by a hospital technician following standard protocol. Pain scoring was assessed by
      two research nurses after the hell lance and through the procedure. Neonatal Pain, Agitation
