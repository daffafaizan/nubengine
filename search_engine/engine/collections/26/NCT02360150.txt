      presentation myocardial infarction, and myocardial viability needs to be evaluated before the
      procedure. The aim of the study is to evaluate the sensibility and specificity of dual-energy
      CT for the evaluation of myocardial viability in comparison to cardiac MRI.

      The experimental procedure is limited to a second CT acquisition performed 10 minutes in dual
      energy mode.

      Sensitivity and Specificity of delayed enhancement >50% of myocardial thickness provided by
      dual-energy CT will be evaluated in comparison to cardiac MRI.
