      AF is the most common arrhythmia and the leading cause of stroke. Despite robust evidence
      oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is effective and safe for stroke prevention in patients
      with AF; there is a lack of real-world application. Alternative strategies to deliver stroke
      prevention therapy need to be explored. Although pharmacists' prescribing of antihypertensive
      and lipid lowering drug therapy has been shown to increase adherence to guideline-based
      targets and warfarin management improve control of international normalized ratios in
      anticoagulation clinics, the role of pharmacist initiation of OAC therapy compared to usual
      care in AF patients for stroke prevention in a community setting is unclear.

      In this study, the investigators will screen participants presenting to community pharmacies
      to identify participants with unrecognized AF and/or known AF but not taking blood thinners
      or not on optimal OAC therapy and randomize care to either the pharmacist or enhanced usual
      care (family physician notification by pharmacist).
