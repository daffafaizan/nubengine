      most clinical consequences of cirrhosis. Accurate assessment of portal hypertension is
      essential for strategy of treatment and judgement of prognosis. Although measurement of the
      hepatic venous pressure gradient(HVPG) is the gold standard for evaluating the presence and
      severity of portal hypertension, this technique is considered invasive and is not routinely
      performed in all centers. Therefore, it is urgent to explore a noninvasive assessment of
      portal hypertension.

      Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) is a secreted
      N-glycoprotein, which has been reported as a novel marker in assessing liver fibrosis.
      Recently, a retrospective study investigated the role of WFA+-M2BP in assessing the degree of
      liver cirrhosis and predicting mortality. However, the correlation of WFA+-M2BP with HVPG is
      unclear. And the role of WFA+-M2BP in predicting the clinical outcome of liver fibrosis
      patients is needed to be further evaluated.

      The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between WFA+-M2BP and HVPG, as well as
      its predictive ability of complication rate, including large varices, bleed status, and
      ascites, and liver disease-related mortality.
