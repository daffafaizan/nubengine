      both disease entities frequently co-exist. Additionally, AF symptoms may mimic CCS.
      Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis indicating lack of significant coronary lesions in
      AF vs. sinus rhythm (SR) patients.

      The prevalence of CCS in patients with AF varies from 17% to 47% whereas AF in patients with
      CCS is much less common, ranging from 0.2% to 5.Patients with AF more often have concomitant
      CCS as compared with sinus rhythm controls. Additionally, AF is more frequently present in
      patients with either peripheral- or cerebrovascular artery disease than in
      non-atherosclerotic individuals We conducted a multi-center retrospective study including
      consecutive patients referred for elective coronary angiography.
