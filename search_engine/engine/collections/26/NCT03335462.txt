    
      Patients scheduled for hernia repair who will agree to undergo different number of
      paravertebral injections in the thoraco-lumbar plexus area under CT guidance.

      While the patient is in lateral decubitis position, LPB injections will be made using a 100
      mm 22 G nerve stimulator needle (Stimuplex, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The site of
      injection is determined by manual palpation. The number of injections ranges from one to five
      and the level of injections ranges from T11 to L3.

      The needle is penetrated perpendicular to the skin using the following nerve stimulator
      settings: 5mA, 9V and 2Hz. The stimulating needle is gently manipulated into a position to
      allow an adequate muscular response with a stimulating current of 0.4-0.8 mA. At this point,
      4-5 ml of the contrast (Telebrix 35, 350 mg/ml, Roissy CDG Cedex, France) is injected. The
      patients will receive the same amount of contrast, despite the different number of
      injections. The needles are kept in their position and afterwards followed by CT scan.

      A radiologist who is blind to the study will interpret the radiological results and document
      the level at which the needle tip is found, the distance from the kidney and the spread of
      the injected contrast. In order to ensure patient's safety, different measures will be taken
      to keep the radiation as low as reasonably achievable.

      Following the radiological practice, patients will be transferred to the operating room to
      undergo inguinal herniorrhaphy, and will not followed for the purpose of this study.
