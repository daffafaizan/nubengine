    
      College students have reported increasing stress levels in the last 5 years with 1 in 6
      students experiencing anxiety levels that adversely impact school function. This study's
      intervention uses a variety of media and both online and in-person delivery strategies. For
      example, students will have the opportunity to participate in yoga, Tai Chi, guided imagery
      meditation, creative arts, journaling, and pet therapy. Students will additionally have the
      opportunity to participate in activities delivered through online media and accessible at all
      times throughout the study. Approximately 50 occupational and physical therapy students will
      be recruited to participate in this study. Half will be selected by chance to participate in
      the 8-week program; the remaining half will be selected by chance to participate in a
      non-intervention group in which they do not receive the program but are still assessed at
      pre- and post-program to measure perceived stress levels. It is anticipated that study
      results will provide information to educational institutions to help students better manage
      stress levels.
