    
      A Phase 1b Study of ACP-196 in Combination with Obinutuzumab for Patients with
      Relapsed/Refractory or Untreated CLL/SLL/PLL Study started with two cohorts, on Acalabrutinib
      and Obinutuzumab, cohort 1 for relapsed or refractory patients and cohort two for treatment
      naïve subjects. Then for longer survival data and combination therapy, two new cohorts added
      to the study, cohort 3 with relapsed or refractory subjects on Acalabrutinib, Rituximab and
      Venetoclax, and cohort 4 with treatment naïve subjects on Acalabrutinib, Obinutuzumab and
      Venetoclax.

      Primary endpoints: For Cohorts 1 and 2, the ORR (PR or better) at the 12-month response
      assessment will be calculated and 95% exact binomial CIs will be provided. For Cohorts 1 to
      4, toxicities will be tabulated by type and grade using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 criteria or
      higher and displayed in summary form.

      Currently study is in maintenance phase and we don't expect a major change in the near
      future.
