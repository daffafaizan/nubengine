    
      Multicenter study (4 centers in Denmark), including 120 patients with stable chest pain and
      hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease as assessed by FFRCT. By using two lipid
      lowering treatment strategies ("usual" vs "intensive" care) over 18 months, the effect on
      coronary plaque regression and flow recovery are assessed from repeated CT angiograms with
      plaque and FFRCT analyses at 9 and 18 months.
