      detection and treatment of breast cancer has resulted in survival gains, but a consequence of
      therapeutic advances is an increasing number of long-term survivors who may be at risk for
      development of cardiovascular disease. Several studies suggest that women treated for breast
      cancer may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, the probable causes being
      multi-factorial. Importantly, therapies for breast cancer, including radiotherapy, anti-HER-2
      regimens and certain chemotherapeutic regimens, may increase the risk of subsequent
      cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerotic disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and
      heart failure.

      In the current study we propose to undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial,
      double-blind trial to assess whether left ventricular dysfunction and/or injury is
      preventable, completely or partly, by the concomitant administration of the angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan, and the beta blocker, metoprolol, during postoperative
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      The proposed study addresses an important clinical problem in a large patient group. Thus,
      the possibility of preventing cardiovascular side effects of contemporary therapy for breast
      cancer is important both clinically and scientifically.
