      which picks up sound and sends it through an electrode into the cochlear.

      With a cochlear implant people, that are profoundly deaf or have severe hearing loss, can get
      their hearing back.

      Vertigo is one of the most common side effects to cochlear implant surgery. In this study we
      will investigate if one type of CI surgery (insertion of the electrode via paracentesis of
      the round window) leads to less vertigo than another type of CI surgery (cochleostomy).

      In the randomization there will be stratified according to age (60+/-), residual hearing
      (yes/no) and gain before surgery (+/-0,68). Three different surgeons will do the surgeries.
      All technical aspect of the surgery, other than the insertion of the electrode into cochlea,
      is being done identically.

      Electrodes from Cochlear, MEDEL and AB is being used. We will compare the findings from the
      vHIT examination with the subject dizziness perceived of the patient.

      The patients will be examined before surgery, the day after their surgery and one month after
      their surgery. The same examinator will perform all the vHIT tests. The test will be
      performed in continuation of the patient's other visits at the Department of Audiology and
      Department of Otorhinolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery.
