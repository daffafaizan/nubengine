    
      More than 1,000 obese people are screened for genetic mutations (MC4R). Those with positive
      screenings as well as 320 randomly selected people without MC4R mutations are randomized to 2
      consultation types: one including recommendations for eating and physical activity behavior,
      the other with an additional part on genetic determinants and actions in obesity. Their
      results are compared to a control group (n>100). It is hypothesized that obese people with
      obesity-specific genetic mutations, and obese people with a family history of obesity,
      benefit more if the consultation includes additional elements on genetic determinants.

      The following variables are used: BMI, SCID interview for mental disorders, Stunkard's body
      silhouttes for participants and their parents and siblings, Restraint Eating Scale, PANAS,
      Well-being scale, body acceptance, shame and guilt, coping with obesity, participant's
      satisfaction with consultation.

      Assessment Points: before consultation, after consultation, 6 months later.
