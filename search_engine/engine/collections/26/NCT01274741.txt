      helps clients explore the past as a step in their recovery process. It has major public
      health relevance in that it is a low-cost, flexible model designed for all trauma and
      substance abuse types, both genders, and all clinical settings. It has particular relevance
      for VA in that many veterans suffer from PTSD and SUD. The new model demonstrated positive
      results in two pilot studies.
