      (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles to adult patients with advanced solid tumors which have
      progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. This study is
      designed to determine the MTD or RP2D and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK
      profile of KBP-5209.
