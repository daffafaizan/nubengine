      with manifest atherosclerotic disease or at high risk of vascular events. However, data
      derived from meta-analyses of existing trials suggests that the efficacy of statins may
      decline sharply amongst those over 70-75 years of age. Insufficient patients of this age
      group have been included in major trials to be certain of the benefit. Within this age group
      part of the benefit of statin therapy may be offset by adverse effects including myopathy,
      development of diabetes, cancer and cognitive impairment, all of which are more prevalent in
      the elderly in any event.

      The use of statins in the over 70 age group raises fundamental questions about the purpose of
      preventive drug therapy in this age group. When a preventive agent is used in the context of
      competing mortality, polypharmacy and a higher incidence of adverse effects its use should be
      justified by an improvement in quality of life or some other composite measure that
      demonstrates that the benefit outweighs other factors.

      STAREE will determine whether taking daily statin therapy (40 mg atorvastatin) will extend
      the length of a disability-free life, determined from survival outside permanent residential
      care, in healthy participants aged 70 years and above.
