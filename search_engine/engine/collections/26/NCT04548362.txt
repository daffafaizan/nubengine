    
      In a two-dimentional randomized cross-over meal study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed in a
      randomized sequence four test meals: chicken, pork, beef, and a control made of egg white and
      pea. At the same time they were independently randomised to four starchy foods to be consumed
      together with the meats: boiled potatoes, fried potatoes, potato crisps or boiled white rice.
      Fasting and postprandial urine samples were collected to cover 48 h after each meal and
      samples were profiled by untargeted LC-ESI-qTOF-MS metabolomics. The profiles following the
      meal challenges were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses and single and combined
      markers of intake identified chemically by MS/MS fragmentation experiments and statistically
      by ROC curves and error rates as well as FDR statistics.
