      etiology and pathogenesis have not been clearly defined, it has a chronic course. Systemic
      sclerosis is estimated to affect approximately 300,000 people in the United States. Most
      commonly, it affects adults and women.

      Narrowing of the mouth opening and mouth pain are the two most important causes reported by
      adults with systemic sclerosis. In patients with systemic sclerosis, orofacial findings such
      as microstomy or reduced mouth opening are frequently seen. Microstomy is defined as the
      distance between the incisors is less than 40 millimeters. In severe microstomy, this
      distance is less than 30 millimeters. It is approximately 33 millimeters in adults with
      systemic sclerosis. Microstomy in systemic sclerosis mainly results from submucosal collagen
      deposits that contribute to fibrosis in the perioral tissue. Microstomy is seen in 43% to 80%
      of adults with systemic sclerosis.

      When the current literature is examined, Bongi et al. evaluated the effectiveness of
      face-specific programs, which are applied together with general rehabilitation programs in
      patients with systemic sclerosis; they demonstrated that these techniques improve disability,
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and facial functionality.

      In this study, it is aimed to investigate the mouth handicap in Systemic Sclerosis.
