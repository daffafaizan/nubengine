      non-critically ill patient populations; however, trials in the critically ill are lacking.
      The investigators hypothesize that melatonin, administered on a scheduled nightly basis
      during ICU admission, will be efficacious and safe for the prevention of delirium in
      critically ill adults. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in delirium
      incidence between placebo and melatonin. Prior to conducting an adequately powered
      multi-centre, blinded randomized, placebo-controlled trial in critically ill patients, there
      is a need for a better understanding of melatonin pharmacokinetics (PK) in critically ill
      patients. This will help to determine appropriate dosing, drug administration issues
      (specifically protocol adherence), adverse drug effects, and recruitment rates based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The specific aim is to conduct a phase II triple blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial
      comparing two doses of melatonin (low dose = 0.5 mg and high dose = 2.0 mg) to assess the
      feasibility of a future full-scale RCT. Feasibility of the larger trial will be based on
      protocol adherence and participant recruitment rates. Data on PK properties of melatonin will
      be assessed to determine dosing for future studies of melatonin for delirium prevention in
      the critically ill.
