      program promoting the Mediterranean diet, none has used a theoretical model of dietary
      adherence. Accordingly, the Self-Determination Theory suggests that the different behavioral
      types of regulation are associated with one of the three forms of motivation which are
      intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation. The use of the Self-Determination
      Theory as a theoretical model of adherence will provide original data on the potential
      contribution of self-determination to gender differences in adherence to an intervention
      promoting the Mediterranean diet. The purpose of this study is to document gender differences
      between men and women in diet adherence and in changes in specific dietary intakes and energy
      density in response to a 12-week nutritional education program promoting the Mediterranean
      diet in both the short term (immediately after the end of the intervention) and longer term
      (3 and 6 months after the end of the intervention). Considering that previous studies have
      shown that women were more likely than men to take action to improve eating habits, rated
      higher their knowledge of nutrition than men and also indicated that they read product labels
      more frequently than men, we hypothesize that both in the short and the longer term, women
      will have a better adherence to recommendations promoting the Mediterranean diet than men
      namely because of higher self-determination. Data will be collected before and after the
      12-week nutritional education program, as well as 3 and 6 months after the end of the
      intervention.
