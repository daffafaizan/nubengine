      about to begin their obstetrics rotation. After having had the usual standard front-lecture
      on anatomy and technique, they will be randomized into two groups to receive (study group) or
      to not receive (control group) the additional SDM (Structured Didactic Model). The additional
      SDM will consist in two standardized video lessons (anatomy and technique), construction of a
      3D epidural plastic module, practical training by using an epidural simulator with the
      CompuFlo Trainer instrument, and practical training with the eye-tracking assisted technique.

      After the randomization and before their practice on the patients, all the trainees will
      undergo eye-tracking measurement of their visual patterns while performing the epidural block
      on an epidural simulator.

      All trainees will perform lumbar epidural anesthesia under the supervision of their
      instructors in accordance with local Institutional policy and practice, with the standard
      routine equipment and monitoring. Every time the trainee will perform an epidural technique,
      the number of attempts, needle redirections, and effectiveness of the epidural block will be
      noted and used to construct the corresponding CUSUM curve.

      When enough epidurals will be performed by each trainee to reach competence according to the
      CUSUM curve, a post hoc Power Analysis will be carried out to verify the 95% significance
      level and the 80 % test power. To study and compare the evolution of the success rate in each
      group a linear regression model will be applied.
