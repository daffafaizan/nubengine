      the next 12 hours. Then the ultrafiltration rate for the zero balance is calculated. From
      there, the ultrafiltration rate progressively increased to 50 ml per hour, up to a maximum
      ultrafiltration rate of 300 ml per hour.

      After each increase of the ultrafiltration rate, the sublingual microcirculation is assessed
      by SDF.

      After obtaining the desired ultrafiltration rate, the microcirculation will again be assessed
      before and after the patient is temporarily placed in Trendelenburg position. This could
      possibly show that underfill has the greatest influence on the microcirculation, and not
      other factors like a rising hematocrit.
