      (iTBS) were both demonstrated to have therapeutic potentials to rapidly induce neuroplastic
      effects in various rehabilitation training regimens. Recently, the investigators have
      developed a novel transcranial electrostimulation device that can flexibly output an
      electrical current with combined tDCS and iTBS waveforms. However, limited studies have
      determined the therapeutic effects of this special waveform combination on clinical
      rehabilitation. Herein, the investigators aiming to brain stimulation effects of tDCS-iTBS on
      upper-limb motor function in chronic stroke patients.

      Twenty-four subjects with a chronic stroke were randomly assigned to a real non-invasive
      brain stimulation (NIBS; subjects received the real tDCS+iTBS output) group or a sham NIBS
      (subjects received sham tDCS+iTBS output) group. All subjects underwent 1 h treatment of a
      conventional rehabilitation program (3 days a week for 6 weeks), where a 20-min NIBS
      intervention was simultaneously applied during conventional rehabilitation. Outcome measures
      were assessed before and immediately after the intervention period: Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), and
      Finger-to-Nose Test (FNT).
