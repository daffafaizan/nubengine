    
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as "Lou Gehrig's Disease", is a fatal
      disorder that causes breathing failure due to progressive weakness of the muscles of
      breathing. Breathing assist devices known as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are offered to ALS
      patients when their breathing function worsens. These devices deliver breathing assistance
      via a mask on the nose or nose and mouth, and are thought to be particularly important to be
      used during sleep, when breathing often becomes more shallow and irregular. However, although
      these devices have become the standard of therapy in ALS patients once their lung function
      worsens, it remains unclear how effective these devices actually are when a patient is
      sleeping, partly because of the practical difficulties in applying the device properly and
      keeping it applied throughout the sleep period, and partly because they are most commonly
      prescribed without objective evidence regarding how much breathing support the patient needs
      as the disease progresses and the breathing muscles weaken further.
