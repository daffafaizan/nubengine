      which approximately 35 will be enrolled at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).
      Neuropsychological testing will consist of a battery of paper and pencil tests that examine
      abilities such as memory, motor skills, attention and speed of information processing.
      Questionnaires that assess quality of life will also be administered. These noninvasive tests
      are administered by a trained examiner or neuropsychologist and last about 30 minutes.
      Subjects will also undergo an MRI of the head which provides a picture of the brain's
      structure by placing an individual inside a powerful magnet. Statistical analyses will
      examine the relationship between the neuropsychological test scores and magnetic resonance
      (MR) images as well as examine the contribution of factors such as radiation, age, surgery,
      chemotherapy etc. to cognition.
