      relative to their peers, which in turn increases cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac
      rhythm problems. To the best of our knowledge, physical fitness and objectively measured
      physical activity levels of children with a pacemaker have not been studied. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate physical fitness and physical activity levels of pediatric arrhythmia
      patients with a pacemaker compared with their healthy peers.

      Investigators enrolled clinically stable pediatric patients and used the echocardiogram to
      evaluate cardiac functions of all patients. Physical fitness was assessed using the Munich
      Physical Fitness Test (MFT). The SenseWear Armband metabolic Holter device was used to record
      the physical activity level for consecutive 7 days.
