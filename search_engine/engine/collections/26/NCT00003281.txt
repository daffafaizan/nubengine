        -  Determine the toxicity of combination topotecan and paclitaxel in previously treated
           patients with small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of time
      since prior treatment (less than 3 months (stratum A) vs 3 months or more (stratum B)).
      Stratum A closed to accrual effective 06/20/2000.

      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on
      day 3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks.

      Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease continue treatment in the absence of
      complete response or disease progression. Patients who develop disease progression in the CNS
      only should receive whole brain radiotherapy and then continue treatment. Patients who
      achieve complete remission receive a maximum of 6 courses of treatment. Patients may then
      undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation and/or thoracic radiotherapy at the discretion at
      the attending physician.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then at 3 years after study.
