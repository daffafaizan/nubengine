      placed into three possible groups based on genetic information obtained during screening.
      Rolling admissions will continue until at least 10 participants have been recruited for each
      genetic group. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the control
      (propranolol and saline) or combined drug (propranolol and atropine) treatment in a
      non-blinded fashion. The participant will return over one week later to receive the alternate
      treatment. Continuous heart rate/blood pressure data will be recorded until the end of the
      study period. Respiratory rate will be maintained at a fixed rate. Participants will undergo
      an orthostasis task, receive the drug or control infusions, and blood samples will then be
      obtained to determine drug concentrations at specific time intervals. Several relatively new
      mathematical techniques will be applied to the data.
