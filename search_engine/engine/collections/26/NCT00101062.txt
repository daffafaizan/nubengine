      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive
           locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with letrozole and
           celecoxib as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare cyclooxygenase activity in blood and tumor cells from these patients before and
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on aromatase activity, tumor proliferation, and
           angiogenesis in tumor samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral letrozole once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-72 patients will be accrued for this study.
