      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) in patients
           with nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine prostate-specific antigen-modulating effects of NDGA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NDGA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
