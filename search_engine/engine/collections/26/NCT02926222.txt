      treat (ITT) population. Secondary aims are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS),
      safety, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) in the ITT population, and
      the evaluation of quality of life (QoL). Additional exploratory objectives include the
      analysis of antiangiogenic and metabolic biomarkers in tissue at first and second surgery (if
      performed) by the evaluation of certain metabolic features of tumors that could be involved
      in tumor responses to antiangiogenic drugs.
