      (INSTI) to protease inhibitor (PI) switch on insulin sensitivity and fat metabolism
      (ADIPOSITY): a sub-study of DEFINE

      Endpoints and objectives:

      The following endpoints will be determined 12 and 24 weeks after switch from an INSTI-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen to a PI-based regimen:

      Primary endpoint: Change in insulin sensitivity (SI) at 12 weeks assessed by using a 3-hour
      frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance testing (fsOGTT).

      Secondary endpoints: 1) Change in insulin sensitivity (SI) at 24 weeks assessed by using a
      3-hour frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance testing (fsOGTT); 2) Change in insulin
      secretion during the fsOGTT assessed by using C-peptide deconvolution; 3) Change in
      intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4)
      Change in adipocyte size by the osmium tetroxide fixation technique; and 5) Change in
      expression of genes associated with adipose tissue development, lipogenesis, inflammation and
      endocrine function by RNA sequencing.

      Hypothesis: Insulin sensitivity will improve following switch from INSTIs to PIs
