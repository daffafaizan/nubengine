      affected with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and autosomal dominant neurocutaneous condition.
      NF1 carries a significant psychosocial burden for affected individuals. Aspects of NF1 that
      are especially challenging include the unpredictable nature of the disease, variability in
      severity of symptoms and medical complications, uncertainty in progression, and vulnerability
      to stigmatization due to the highly visible and often cosmetically disfiguring features of
      the condition. The literature suggests that because of these and other challenges posed by
      NF1, affected individuals may struggle to adapt to their condition and, consequently,
      experience poor quality of life. In this study, Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of
      Stress and Coping is used as a framework to conceptualize adaptation and quality of life to
      NF1. A cross-sectional design with quantitative methodology will be employed to investigate
      the relationships of appraisals and stigma as predictors of adaptation and quality of life.
      Adults affected with NF1 will be recruited via regional and national NF organizations and
      websites, as well as through ongoing NIH clinical research protocols for NF1. Eligible
      participants will be invited to complete a web-based, self-administered survey.
