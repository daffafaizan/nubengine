      examined the effect of motivation on home exercise program and children's functional scores.
      33 OBPP children (Narakas Type 2) aged between 0-18 months were divided into two groups.
      Intervention group was motivated via phone. Both groups were informed about OBPP, performed
      home exercises and filled exercise diary. Intrinsic Motivation Scale was used for measuring
      motivation and Gilbert and Raimondi Scoring and Active Movement Scoring were used for
      evaluating functional improvements at first assessment, 6th week and 12th week. For final
      comparison, parents were divided into two more groups (highly motivated and motivated group)
      based on motivation scores.
