        1. To determine whether TL during early development, which is primarily reflected in muscle
           TL, and LTL attrition during development, which is primarily expressed in the difference
           between muscle TL and LTL, are associated with indices of arterial aging.

        2. To examine the relation between EPC-TL to endothelial regenerative capacity and
           endothelial function. In order to attain this objective the investigators will perform
           two types of experiments:

             -  Measure TL in progenitor cells and relate it to clinical phenotypes of arterial
                aging and atherosclerosis, as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction

             -  Generate in vitro progenitor cells with different TL induced by the environmental
                factors (oxidative stress) and assess their phenotypes concerning inflammation and
                microvesiculation, in order to show a possible mechanistic relationship between TL
                in PC and the atherogenic and the regenerative capacities of these cells.

      The project is composed of 6 tasks:

      T1: Recruitment and sample collection (skeletal muscle, total blood) of 170 patients with
      atherosclerosis and 170 controls. Performed by surgeons and cardiologists of Marseille and
      Nancy University hospitals T2: Characterization of arterial aging in all patients (Geriatric
      Dpt, Univ. hospital Nancy, Pr Benetos and AP-HM, Internal Medicine, Marseille, Dr Rossi) T3:
      Characterization of early and late endothelial progenitor cells (EPC): laboratory of
      hematology and vascular biology and in UMR_S1076 in Marseille (Prs Dignat-George and
      Sabatier) T4: Measurements of TL in all samples (skeletal muscle, leukocytes and EPC):
      UMR_S1116 Nancy (Dr Lacolley) in collaboration with Pr Aviv (University of Medicine of New
      Jersey) T5: Characterization of inflammation markers in blood samples: UMR_S1116 and the
      UMR_S1122 (Dr Siest-Visvikis, Nancy) T6: Database construction and statistical analyses
      (UMR_S1116)

      The results of this program could completely modify the present concept on the association
      between TL and cardiovascular risk: Actually, if our concept of early determination of TL is
      valid, therefore TL could be a true determinant of the arterial aging pace, through
      limitation of repair capacity of cells.
