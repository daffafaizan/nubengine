      process and pathogenesis of atherogenesis and to recognize clinically important metabolic
      biomarkers correlated with the severity and clinical presentation of Coronary Artery Disease
      (CAD). 1050 patients who will undergo coronary angiography will be enrolled in the study.
      SYNTAX score will be calculated for all participants and their blood samples will be
      collected before coronary angiography. Metabolomics-based analysis will be performed in order
      to confirm CAD prognostic biomarkers previously reported in the literature and to investigate
      their correlations with CAD clinical data. The ultimate aim of this study is to predict the
      risk of cardiovascular events by incorporating metabolomic information into the SYNTAX score
      and provide personalized therapeutic guidance to patients.
