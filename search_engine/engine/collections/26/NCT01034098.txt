      exercise, altered breathing mechanisms increase potential for expiratory flow limitation and
      compromise exercise capacity. Estrogen and progesterone are potent respiratory stimulants,
      and their effects in the physiologic regulation of breathing are down-regulated after
      menopause. Therefore, we theorized that the combined obesity and reduced sex hormone levels
      after menopause work as a double jeopardy to cause mechanical ventilatory constraint which
      aggravates dyspnea sensation during exercise, and thus a reduction in exercise capacity. The
      purpose of this study was to exam the dynamic lung volumes in obese post-menopausal women
      (without hormone replacement therapy) during exercise and their correlations with dyspnea.

      From doctoral referral and advertisement, 24 obese (BMI â‰§ 27 kg/m2) and 26 lean
      post-menopausal women were recruited for the study. Pulmonary function and body composition
      were measured at rest. A maximal flow volume loop (MFVL) was obtained at baseline. All
      subjects then performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer with workload
      increasing 25 watts every 3 min. During exercise, at each workload, the tidal exercise FV
      loops were obtained and an inspiratory capacity (IC) maneuver was conducted to assess changes
      in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and end inspiratory lung volume (EILV). Dyspnea and leg
      fatigue were assessed using the Borg scale. Analysis of variance with repeated measurements
      was used to test the significance of the mean differences between the two groups during
      exercise. Linear regression analysis was used to determine whether changes in dynamic lung
      volumes during exercise were related to changes in Borg scores. Statistical significance was
      established at p<0.05.
