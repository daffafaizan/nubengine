      This may be due to an altered intestinal adaptations several months after the surgical
      procedure. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic parameters after single application of 10 mg rivaroxaban in patients with
      prior bariatric intervention (Roux-en-y-gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy 6-8 months ago).
      PK/PD parameters will be assessed during 12 hours after application of rivaroxaban.
