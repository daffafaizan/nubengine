        -  Develop a predictive model for sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity in patients with
           melanoma who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy.

        -  Develop a survival model for relapse based on sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity.

        -  Assess the genetic determinants in primary melanomas that predict a metastatic phenotype
           and thereby improve understanding of the biology of the metastases in melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, case-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to Breslow thickness of the tumor (0.75-1.50 mm vs 1.51- 4 mm vs > 4 mm) and
      gender.

      Archived tumor tissue is analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for AP2, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, MMP 2, MCM4, and others, if feasible. Sentinel node biopsies are analyzed by
      IHC for CD31, LYVE-1, and D2-40 expression. RNA and DNA are also extracted for genetic
      expression studies and mutation analysis (e.g., BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, CDKN2A).

      Patient data related to relapse and recurrence is collected, if available.
