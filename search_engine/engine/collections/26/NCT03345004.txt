    
      The study is a 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical
      trial. Eligible patients will receive injections of Diamyd/placebo into an inguinal lymph
      gland at three occasions, with one month intervals in combination with an oral vitamin
      D/placebo regimen (starting 1 month ahead of injections) during 4 months. All patients will
      continue to receive intensive insulin treatment from their personal physicians during the
      whole study period. The patients will be followed in a blinded manner for a total of 15
      months. All patients that have not performed the 15 months visit when the updated protocol is
      implemented, will be asked to participate in the Extension Study Period which includes an
      additional visit at month 24.
