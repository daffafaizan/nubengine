           in different vascular beds in vivo.

        2. The secondary aim is to investigate differences in leukocyte activation between diabetic
           and CAD subjects and patients suffering from both.

        3. The third aim is to investigate the relationship between complement components,
           triglycerides and leukocyte activation markers in order to gain more insight into the
           causative processes leading to activation of leukocytes.

        4. The fourth aim is to get more insight in the MBL genotypes and serum levels of CAD
           and/or diabetic patients and the 'healthy' groups included in our study.
