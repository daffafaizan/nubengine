      physician-diagnosed asthma, and another age- and gender-matched children without asthma to
      join our study. First, obtaining clinical data of disease status, and ask participants to
      fill out questionnaires after recruiting. Second, participants have to record body
      temperature, peak expiratory flow, heart rate, finger O2 saturation percentage, asthma attack
      frequency continuously by care-giver every day. Third, the investigators will perform indoor
      environmental assessments in the subject's house, including indoor air quality, dust samples,
      culture for fungi and bacteria, and cockroaches. The investigators will also count the dust
      mites and measure phthalates concentration in every dust sample.

      Then, health behavior intervention for one month will be provided to every participant. The
      investigators will teach children's guardians (care-giver) how to change the health behaviors
      to clean indoor environment, including the health behaviors in bedroom, kitchen room,
      restroom, refrigerator, washing machine, and incense burning hall. After 1 months, the
      investigators will investigate whether changing health behavior affects the exposure of
      phthalates, dust mites, fungi, bacteria, and cockroaches, and evaluate the effects of health
      behavior intervention on the clinical status of children's asthma. Children's asthma severity
      assessment will be recorded by ACT and also by symptomatology every day. Household health
      behaviors (cleaning habits) questionnaires also will be completed per week and continuously
      for 4 weeks.
