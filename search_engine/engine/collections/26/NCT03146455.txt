      monitor the whole process of perioperative coagulation. TEG can evaluate the coagulation
      cascade, from platelet aggregation, clot strengthening and fibrin cross-linking to eventually
      clot lysis in small volume of whole blood. The reference range is one important element to
      influence the TEG results. At present, a number of studies have shown that reference range of
      TEG exists significant differences between different racial and geographic. At the same time,
      reagent manufacturers also suggested that each TEG laboratory should establish its own
      reference range. So it is important to establish our own reference range of TEG to guide the
      clinical blood transfusion and treatment.
