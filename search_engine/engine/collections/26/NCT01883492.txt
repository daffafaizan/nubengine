      different materials (CoCr and Delta ceramic) articulating against E1 Highly Crosslinked
      polyethylene in Hip Replacement.

      Patient population is 160 (80 each). Follow-up period is 10 year postoperatively. E1 liners
      with thickness of 4.8mm at 45 degrees position (load bearing direction) will be used in all
      cases.

      Randomization will occur via random number generator by 4 blocks randomization.
