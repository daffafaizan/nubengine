    
      At present, many clinical studies have shown a link between malnutrition and infectious
      complications in intensive care particularly because of immune disorders.

      Many studies testing different nutritional strategies used as the main criterion infectious
      complications.

      So this is a robust standard, well documented in the literature as a reflection of
      malnutrition in intensive care, and we also want to use in our study.

      In a pilot study in the surgical ICU of the Hotel-Dieu report the urea / creatinine urine as
      a biomarker of poor outcome of nutritional status in the ICU seems extremely discriminating
      in predicting the existence of nosocomial infection.

      Furthermore the kinetics of the relationship between the intake and the 5th day of
      resuscitation, also appears to be relevant in predicting the occurrence of nosocomial
      infection.

      Surgical ICU of the Hotel-Dieu proposes to conduct a multicenter study to confirm the
      relationship between the ratio of urea / creatinine urine, malnutrition marker, and
      nosocomial infections (NI) in intensive care.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the predictability of the ratio of urea / creatinine urinary J5 on the occurrence
      of nosocomial infection in intensive care.
