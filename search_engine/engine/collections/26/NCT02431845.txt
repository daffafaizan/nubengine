    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of (epi)genetic variants on the
      response to SSRIs in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subject.

      The investigators will recruit drug-naive or drug-free(> 3 months) OCD subjects (n=200). The
      participants will get SSRIs for their OCD symptoms. The type and dose of SSRIs will not be
      restricted and will depend on the individual participant's state. However, the investigators
      will be recommended to follow usual clinical guideline (the Korean treatment algorithm for
      OCD, 2004). At baseline, 4 month, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment, the participants will
      be evaluated by Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale(YBOCS), Montgomery Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale(MADRS), Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale(DOCS), Toronto alexithymia scale
      (TAS), interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS), and the
      Measure of Constructs Underlying Perfectionism(M-CUP), Beck Depression Inventory(BDI), Beck
      Anxiety Inventory(BAI), Intolerance of Uncertainty (IOU), Metacognition, Disgust scale, Early
      Trauma Inventory (ETI). And a part of participants will be taken resting state functional
      MRI.

      And all the participants will donate 5 ml of whole blood and DNA will be extracted.

      Using various (epi)genetic analyses methods such as genotyping, exome sequencing, and so on
      we will analyze the association of various (epi)genetic variants and the
      anti-obsessive-compulsive responses.
