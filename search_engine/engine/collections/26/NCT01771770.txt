      volunteers under conditions of controlled chronically reduced ambient pressure and oxygen
      partial pressure in the mountains. Obtaining indications regarding the adaptation of the
      retinal vascular system behavior to controlled, long-term hypoxic changes. Comparisons with
      blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation level and the appearance of symptoms of acute
      mountain sickness are made in order to obtain a better understanding of the development of
      high altitude illness.
