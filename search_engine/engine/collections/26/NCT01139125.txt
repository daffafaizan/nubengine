      unsatisfactory. Many patients have persistent positive psychotic symptoms or negative
      symptoms despite treatment, and any improvement in cognitive function is small. New
      approaches to the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia that are not based primarily on
      dopaminergic blockade are needed.

      The rationale for a trial of cysteamine comes from the evidence that cysteamine increases
      brain concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

      We will conduct an open-label study of tolerability and efficacy of cysteamine as an adjunct
      to second-generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia and schizoaffective subjects with
      partially responsive symptoms.

      Our objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of cysteamine administered as an
      adjunct to second-generation antipsychotic drugs in adult outpatients with
      partially-responsive schizophrenia. Additionally, we are evaluating the effect of cysteamine
      on the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by changes in the Positive
      and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and on cognitive impairment as measured by the Brief
      Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS).
