    
      Surgery for breast cancer is followed by acute undesirable sequelae (pain, nausea, vomiting,
      psycho-social adaptation) and late sequelae with discomfort or more severe neuropathic pain
      problems in the surgical area due to nerve damage or adjuvant-/radiotherapy. The late
      sequelae occur in 30-50% of patients but the exact mechanisms (preoperative disposing
      factors, intraoperative nerve damage/inflammatory response), acute postoperative pain and
      psychosocial factors remain to be determined in large, detailed, well-described studies,
      including stratification to modern breast cancer treatment (sentinel node strategy/
      radiotherapy/ chemotherapy). The present study will describe in detail preoperative
      psychosocial/genetic pain mechanisms, intraoperative technique, multi-modal anaesthesia and
      opioid-reduced analgesia with a detailed, early and late postoperative follow-up with
      neurophysiological assessment in the surgical area and randomised studies on preventive
      therapy.
