      I. To identify the optimal imaging time point using fludeoxyglucose F-18 (F18-FDG) positron
      emission tomography (PET) that gives the best lesion conspicuity as defined by the best
      lesion to background (L/B) ratio when evaluating spinal cord lesions of unknown etiology.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify malignancy specific factors in F18-FDG metabolism derived from metrics such as
      maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), mean standard uptake value (SUVmean), total lesion
      glycolysis (TLG), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and L/B ratio.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) over 1 minutes and then undergo
      PET-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 15-60 minutes at 60, 300, and 480 minutes after
      fludeoxyglucose F-18 injection in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
