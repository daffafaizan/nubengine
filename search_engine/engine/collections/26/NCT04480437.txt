      typically undergo breast ultrasound examination as a supplemental imaging modality. Findings
      are then used for tumour classification according the American Collage of Radiology (ACR)
      Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS) lexicon. Suspicious findings then
      undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy, which causes discomfort for the patient and introduces high
      emotional stress, and may involve - albeit very-small - risk of complications (such as
      bleeding and infections).

      Today conventional breast ultrasound B-mode images do not have the specificity to reliably
      differentiate malignant and benign tissues in all cases and hence a biopsy intervention or
      close follow-up is necessitated. Multiparametric imaging bio-markers such as the novel method
      of speed-of-sound imaging may provide additional indicators to help to better classify
      lesions prior to biopsy and avoid any further work-up.

      The study collects data with an ultrasound device during normal BUS examination which is then
      retrospectively processed to extract the desired multi-parametric BUS (mp-BUS) information of
      imaged tissue.
