      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the C5aR inhibitor
      CCX168 in subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The aim of this trial is to test the
      safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of the complement C5a receptor CCX168 in patients
      with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).
