      be tested using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at central laboratory. Central
      laboratory of this study is the department of pathology at Seoul National University Hospital
      (SNUH) and tumor specimen should be sent to department of pathology at SNUH. Only patients
      whose tumor have confirmed RET gene fusion are eligible for this study.

      Enrolled patients will begin on once daily vandetanib at 300 mg with one cycle of 4 weeks.
      Renal-impaired patients (defined as patients with creatinine clearance â‰¥30 to <50 mL/min at
      screening) will start treatment at the lower dose of 200 mg. Treatment will be continued till
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or till 1 year. Vandetanib can be administered after 1
      year to the patients with benefit from vandetanib.

      During the administration of vandetanib, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance
      status, height, weight, hematology and chemistry test, ECG, adverse events and concomitant
      drugs will be evaluated every four weeks (one cycle, for the first 6 months) or eight weeks
      (two cycles, from 6 months to 1 year) and, if necessary, chest X-ray and pregnancy test will
      also be performed. CT for tumor assessment will be performed once every 8 weeks for 1 year.
      If the disease progression is suspected, the test can be additionally conducted at the
      investigator's discretion.
