      are at risk of suffering from life threatening adrenal crisis with a considerable mortality.
      A former prospective study revealed a frequency of about 8 adrenal crisis/ 100 patient years
      and a crisis associated mortality of 0.5 per 100 patient years for patients; furthermore,
      patients with a previous adrenal crisis were at higher risk of crisis. The aim of the current
      trial was to reevaluate the frequency of adrenal crisis and risk factors by contacting the
      patients of the initial prospective study (see above) within a six-years follow-up. Patients
      are contacted by questionnaire and additionally by phone (in case of an adrenal crisis or
      implausible statements).
