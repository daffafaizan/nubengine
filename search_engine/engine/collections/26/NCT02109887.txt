      immunocompromised patients including HIV-infected patients, transplant recipients, and
      immunosuppressant users. About one third of non-HIV patients with PCP have the evidence of
      co-infection with CMV. In this difficult clinical situation, physicians have difficulty to
      decide on whether anti-CMV treament will help patients with any evidence of CMV co-infection.
      However, there is no objective test to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from innocent
      bystander of CMV in those with PCP. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of
      CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in patients with PCP to differentiate true co-infection of CMV
      from inocent bystander of CMV. This findings may guide physicians to decide anti-CMV
      treatment in patients with PCP and CMV co-infection.
