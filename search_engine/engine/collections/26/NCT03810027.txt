      evaluation were reviewed. The classification of OAB-wet or OAB-dry is based on the record of
      the three-day bladder diary of each patient. The diagnosis of OAB in each patient was based
      on the presence of at least one episode of urgency in her three-day bladder diary and with
      the absence of stress urinary incontinence. The presence of at least one episode of urgency
      associated incontinence was defined to be OAB-wet, otherwise, OAB-dry.

      Nocturnal polyuria was defined when the proportion of nighttime voided volume over 24-hour
      voided volume was greater than 33% for â‰¥65-year-old women, and when the proportion of
      nighttime voided volume over 24-hour voided volume was greater than 20% for <65-year-old
      women.
