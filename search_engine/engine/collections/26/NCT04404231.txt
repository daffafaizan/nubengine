      pregnancy can lead to the first episode of major depression. Complications of intrapartum
      depression include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, low birthweight,
      gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, decreased prenatal follow-up and suicide. For this
      reason, the standard of care has been to screen for depression during pregnancy and treat
      this illness, reducing maternal and fetal morbidity. Unfortunately, many first-line
      pharmacological approaches, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may cause fetal
      malformations, persistent pulmonary hypertension and withdrawal syndrome. Thus, a
      non-pharmacological approach, without risk of fetal complications, would be ideal. The
      investigators propose a photobiomodulation based approach that uses non-ionizing
      near-infrared light (IRL) to upregulate mitochondrial function (through modulation of
      cytochrome c oxidase activity), which in-turn increase neurosteroid production and modulates
      GABAA receptor activity, thus alleviating depression. The investigators will perform a pilot
      study using IRL for the treatment of intrapartum depression. While other trials have shown
      success using IRL for depression in non-pregnant patients, this will confirm that
      photobiomodulation can modulate mitochondrial function and mitigate depressive symptoms
      compared to untreated controls in pregnancy by using real-time app-based depression scoring
      system and neuroimaging.
