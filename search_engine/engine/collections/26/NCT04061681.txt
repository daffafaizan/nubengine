      behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity and reducing RLS severity in persons
      with MS and RLS. Secondarily, the investigators will be assessing changes in sleep quality
      and daytime sleepiness following the behavioral intervention. The study includes a proposed
      sample of 20 persons with MS and RLS that will complete a baseline testing session for
      measures of physical activity, restless legs syndrome severity, sleep quality, and daytime
      sleepiness. Participants will then be randomized into one of two study arms: (1) a 16-week
      Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral intervention aimed at increasing physical activity;
      or (2) 16-week waitlist control with the option of completing the intervention upon
      completion of the study. All participants will complete a follow-up testing session at the
      conclusion of each 16-week arm.
