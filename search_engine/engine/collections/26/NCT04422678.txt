      vaccine, researchers are looking among the arsenal of available drugs, for a potential cure
      or medication to improve patients' outcome. A highly elevated levels of cytokines in COVID-19
      patients requiring ICU admission, has suggested that a "cytokine storm" was associated with
      disease severity. Data from cellular, animal models and clinical trials, showed a beneficial
      role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the regulation of inflammation, the maintenance of
      endothelial barrier integrity, as well as the expression of antiviral properties. This data
      is especially derived from imatinib, the most studied Abl family kinase inhibitor, that is
      currently in clinical use for multiple medical conditions. Based on this encouraging data, we
      hypothesize that imatinib might be beneficial for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2
      pneumonia, in the aim of preventing disease progression into the severe phenotype of hypoxic
      respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
