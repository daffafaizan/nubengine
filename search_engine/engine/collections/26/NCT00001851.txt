      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous
      tissue. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome
      originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe au lait pigmentation of the skin, and precocious
      puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring and painful. In addition, depending on
      the location of the lesion, they can cause significant morbidity. Lesions in weight-bearing
      bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull can lead to compression of
      vital structures such as the cranial nerves.

      Currently there are no clearly-defined systemic or local therapies for the bone disease, and
      results of the use of conventional surgical treatment of sites of impending fracture have
      been universally disappointing. In this study, we will treat osteolytic lesions in the long
      bones of the upper and lower extremities, the sites of potential fracture, with a novel
      surgical approach. This will involve 1) the removal of abnormal tissue through percutaneous
      aspiration, and 2) the use of skeletal precursor cells taken from the unaffected sites, mixed
      with a bone grafting substitute, and injected into the affected sites to bring about an
      improvement in local bone quality and overall patient function.
