      I. To determine the safety of niclosamide (PDMX1001/niclosamide) and enzalutamide in patients
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PDMX1001/niclosamide and
      enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with CRPC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of PDMX1001/niclosamide. II. To determine the number of
      patients who have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is a 50% or more reduction
      from the baseline.

      III. To identify overall responses as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
      (PCWG2) criteria.

      IV. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of CRPC patients treated with
      PDMX1001/niclosamide and enzalutamide.

      V. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the analysis
      of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of niclosamide.

      Patients receive niclosamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and enzalutamide PO once daily
      (QD) on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
