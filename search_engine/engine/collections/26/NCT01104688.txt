      hemodynamic stress contributes to aneurysmal growth, and the relevance of inflammation is
      gaining in terms of pathological influence. The technical advances of imaging now enable one
      to utilize magnetic resonance in reconstructing aortal blood flow. Newer post-imaging
      software then enables one to perform complex data analysis, wherein shear and wall-stress can
      be calculated. The goal of this study is to analyze the aneurysms of twenty patients. Values
      will be obtained for shear and wall stress. Additionally, the utilization of short tau wave
      inversion recovery (STIR) sequences will be performed to evaluate the presence or absence of
      acute edema and inflammation of the region. It should also be noted that particular attention
      will be placed on the so-called "neck" of the aneurysm, where the aneurysm typically tapers
      into what is often regarded as normal aortic tissue. This region is important for both the
      placement of a surgical bypass prosthesis or a deployed stent graft.
