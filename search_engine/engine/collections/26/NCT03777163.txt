      Seasonal Influenza Vaccine is not inferior to that elicited by a single dose of Sanofi
      Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in adult and elderly populations measured by HI GMT for
      the three vaccine components 21 days post-immunization.

      To describe the safety profile of Butantan Institute Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine and
