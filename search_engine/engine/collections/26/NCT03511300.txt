      between-subjects variable (goal-setting instructions versus standardized instructions) and a
      within-subjects variable (pre-post instructional manipulation). It is a one-time intervention
      lasting 1-2 hours. Investigators plan to enroll 72 patients in this study. All participants
      will complete neuropsychological measures to assess their baseline performance. The baseline
      measures include Trial 1 of the CVLT-II Alternate Form, the Digit Span Test, Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Semantic
      Fluency Test, Apathy Evaluation Scale and Trail Making Test. After the baseline measures are
      completed, all participants will rate their level of motivation on a scale from 1 (extremely
      unmotivated) to 100 (extremely motivated), which will act as a pre-manipulation check
      measure, their level of fatigue on a scale from 1 (extremely not fatigued) to 100 (extremely
      fatigued), and their level of anxiety from 1 (extremely not anxious) to 100 (extremely
      anxious; 1 minute).

      After completing the baseline measures and rating scales, half (n = 36) of the participants
      will be randomly assigned to the goal-setting instruction group ("goal-setting group").
      Motivation will be enhanced by asking participants to perform 20% better than their previous
      performance on a similar task, and translating that into a number (e.g., "On this task, you
      generated 10 words when I asked you to name as many words as you could that start with the
      letter "F." Now, for the next letter, I want you to generate 12 words."). The remainder of
      the participants (n = 36) will be assigned to the "standard instruction group," where they
      will only receive the standardized instructions for completing the tests.
