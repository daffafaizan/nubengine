    
      Background: Bacterial antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem.

      Aims: This study aims to implement judicious antibiotic prescription habits among 30
      physicians and their treated population as compared to a control group of 30 physicians and
      their treated population. The outcomes to be measured are:

        1. Change in antibiotic prescriptions to the treated patients of the intervention vs.
           control physicians during the study period (4years).

        2. Change in carriage of antibiotic resistant pathogens, specifically nasopharyngeal
           penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae,nasal MRSA, and rectal quinolone resistant E. coli.

      Study design: All primary care pediatricians of Hashfela district of Macabbi Healthcare
      services who will agree to participate will be randomly assigned to an intervention or
      control group. The intervention group will be led by local leaders (primary care physicians
      from that district) and will take part in educational activities involving annual workshops
      and quarterly focus group meetings. The intervention is a multifacet intervention that will
      include guideline preparation, knowledge building, dealing with uncertainties, etc.

      The patients of both intervention and control physicians will be screened twice a year for
      carriage of the bacteria mentioned above. Cross-sectional screening of the treated population
      will be carried in Summer and winter for 5 consecutive years. Screening will include signing
      an informed consent, filling a questionnaire and screening with nasal, nasopharyngeal and
      rectal swabs.
