      subjects (15 per dose) with active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD.
      Subjects who are under active anti-VEGF treatment and have demonstrated a meaningful response
      to anti-VEGF therapy will be considered for participation in this study. The primary endpoint
      for this study is safety and tolerability of ADVM-022. All subjects will continue to be
      assessed for 104 weeks following treatment with ADVM-022.
