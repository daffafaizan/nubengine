      (BMD), using axial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and/or the lumbar spine
      at special healthcare.

      Application of diagnostic thresholds determined against BMD have been suggested by
      International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) for use with peripheral bone
      densitometry devices (90% sensitivity and 90% specificity). These thresholds have been
      determined and validated for Bindex in Caucasian female population.

      This study focuses on clinical validation of the ultrasound device (BindexÂ®, Bone Index
      Finland Ltd., www.boneindex.com) device and Density Index (DI), a diagnostic parameter
      reported by Bindex. The predetermined thresholds for DI will be evaluated by measuring 70
      osteoporotic and 70 healthy patients with Bindex and DXA in each selected patient groups. The
      feasibility of DI for diagnostics of osteoporosis in these groups will be assessed.
