      lung inflammation, including acute and chronic rejection. AAT may provide more specifically
      targeted prevention of pathogenic inflammation, superior to that of general
      immunosuppressants, with little risk. AAT is the main inhibitor of Neutrophil elastase(NE) in
      the lower airways and patients with AAT deficiency have low concentrations of the protein in
      this region of the lung. This explains the proteinase/antiproteinase theory of the
      development of emphysema in deficient patients in which the amount of elastase released in
      the lung exceeds the amount of AAT. The net result is persistence of elastase activity
      leading to lung destruction and the pathological changes of emphysema. Administration of AAT
      will help to prevent further destruction of the lung architecture and reduce the inflammatory
      dysregulation that causes pulmonary dysfunction. It is expected that by attacking a specific
      and previously untreated key component of the pathophysiological cycle of BOS, AAT therapy
      would decrease the prevalence of BOS in lung transplant recipients and prolong life
      expectancy of these patients. This will be an open label study in order to ensure safety, in
      the frame of POC study.
