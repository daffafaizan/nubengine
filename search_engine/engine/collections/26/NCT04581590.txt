      condition present in everyday life. It is possible that strategies such as Transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation can be associated with motor training enriched with dual-task and
      cognitive training to improve the performance of two concurrent tasks. It is currently
      unclear whether specific tasks and clinical conditions of PD patients have different results
      after the intervention. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled trial will examine
      task-dependency in enhancing the effects of tDCS-linked rehabilitation training on PD and the
      relationships between baseline outcomes in responders and non-responders to therapy.

      Discussion: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention protocol with
      transcranial direct current stimulation, dual-task training and cognitive training in
      patients with Parkinson's disease. The study will also highlight whether the clinical factors
      and variability between individuals that could interfere in the training of a specific task
      and influence the therapeutic effect.
