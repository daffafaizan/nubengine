      of lower extremity injuries and 40% of catastrophic knee ligament injuries. The majority of
      these collisions are unanticipated, and associated with reduced neuromechanical and
      perceptual-motor fitness underlying an athlete's adaptability to on-field conditions. Thus,
      training collision anticipation necessitates a method that taps into neuromechanical and
      perceptual-motor fitness. Virtual reality (VR) is a tool that can target these mechanisms,
      while providing a safe, well-controlled environment for assessment and training. The current
      proposal innovates on VR with the integration of genetic fuzzy tree (GFT) artificial
      intelligence (AI) to drive scenario configuration designed to target modifiable mechanisms
      and tailored to the individual athlete's performance capabilities, for the optimization of
      behavior modification and skill transfer. The current study will examine test a GFT AI-driven
      VR collision anticipation training compared to a sham-VR training system in healthy soccer
      athletes.
