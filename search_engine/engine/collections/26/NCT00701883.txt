      2 week screening period, 5 week run-in period, 8 week treatment period, and 2 week follow-up.
      During the run-in period patients taking statins, statin combination or Zetia will undergo a
      'washout'. All patients will be instructed to follow a weight-maintenance diet (i.e., their
      same diet prior to entering the study). They will be asked to defer initiating any weight
      loss diets or meaningful changes in their activity level until after they have completed the
      study. Once randomized into the double blind study, patients will visit the clinic every two
      weeks thereafter until the end of the study. At the end of the 8-week treatment phase, the
      double-blind study medication will be discontinued. Patients will attend a follow up visit
      two weeks after their final dose for safety evaluation.
