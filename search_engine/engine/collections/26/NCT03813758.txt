      whereas a denervated digit does not exhibit normal skin wrinkling while a finger with a
      regenerated or repaired nerve shows at least partial reappearance of wrinkling. This is the
      basis for the bedside immersion-wrinkling test of autonomic digital nerve function. The exact
      mechanism of fingertip skin wrinkling is still subject to controversy. the purpose of this
      study is to examine the Inter-observer and Intra-observer Variability of the Wrinkle Test.
