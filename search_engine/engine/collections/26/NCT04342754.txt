      influence in the quality of life of these patients. Patients will be submitted to a
      neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the surgical target. After the surgery
      all patients will have the device turned ON for 6 months.

      After the first 6 months participants will be randomly in two groups, one to stay with device
      ON or turned OFF at a period of 3 months. After that the groups will cross over for more 3
      months. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before the surgery, at end of open
      fase, in the moment of cross over and at end of all.
