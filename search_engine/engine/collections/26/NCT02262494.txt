        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography performed
           with and ultra-portable device (V-ScanÂ®) with that of emergency compression
           ultrasonography performed with a classic device

        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography between
           patients suspected of having DVT arriving through the emergency department versus
           similar patients sent in by their generalist

        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography among
           patients with suspected DVT according to pre clinical probability testing based on the
           Wells score (low, medium or high probability).

      Currently, the use of ultra-portable ultrasound in this indication is not part of routine
      care, and this study is therefore considered interventional in nature.
