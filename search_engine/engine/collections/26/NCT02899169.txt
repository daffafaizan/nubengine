      accounts for 10-15% of acute myeloid leukemia. It is characterized by the PML-RARA fusion
      gene generated by the t(15;17)(q22;q21) chromosomal translocation. The application of ATRA
      and ATO, make APL from highly fatal to highly curable. APL0406 study proves that ATRA plus
      arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in
      the treatment of patients with non-high-risk APL. Now, the arsenic trioxide has already
      became the based regimen as targeted first-line treatment without chemotherapy. A study shows
      that oral RIF plus ATRA is not inferior to intravenous ATO plus ATRA as maintenance treatment
      of APL. The investigators design a multicenter randomized controlled trial to prove that RIF
      plus ATRA is possibly superior to ATO plus ATRA as consolidation and maintenance treatment
      for the patients with non-high-risk APL. Application of oral RIF decrease the total
      hospitalization days.
