      factors for stroke. In most cases, the presence of FOP has no clinical impact. Certain
      hemodynamic conditions inducing a right-left pressure gradient can promote the reopening of a
      FOP and allow the passage of blood, presenting micro or macro-thrombi, from the venous system
      to the arterial system, explaining the mechanism of paradoxical embolism. OSAS generates a
      pressure increase in the right cavity during inspiratory efforts, which increases the number
      of right-left shunt embolus and therefore the risk of stroke. OSA and FOP are often thought
      as two separate entities, however, due to their high frequencies, they sometimes coexist and
      can influence the pathophysiology of each other. Evidence of a clinically significant
      interaction and causation in the genesis of stroke remains limited. More researches are
      needed in this area to confirm this complex association and its role in triggering stroke.
