    
      Icotinib Hydrochloride is an oral, small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for treating advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) in China. Over-expressions of EGFR and its downstream signaling proteins are
      implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and TKIs have been considered as potential
      antipsoriatic agents. Icotinib hydrochloride is being developed as a cream for the treatment
      of mild to moderate psoriasis. This is a multicenter , randomized, doubleblind, four-arm
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      icotinib hydrochloride cream (1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0%) in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.
      Approximately 260 subjects will be enrolled.
