    
      This is a randomized, prospective, single-blind study that evaluates the effect of removal of
      scar tissue during pacemaker/ICD pocket revision on infection and complications. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to either removal of the scar tissue surrounding the implanted
      device during device replacement or to device replacement without removal of this tissue.
      Subjects will be followed for one year post-procedure for the occurrence of infection,
      bleeding/hematoma, or other complications.
