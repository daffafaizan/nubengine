      corticosteroid (eg, prednisone), a calcineurin inhibitor (or CNI, most commonly tacrolimus),
      and an antimetabolite such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Cyclosporine and azathioprine are
      less commonly used for maintenance immunosuppression Tacrolimus level is a main maintenance
      immunosuppressant in kidney transplantation .In the early days of posttransplant period,
      hematocrit concentrations are generally low and increase significantly as patient recovers.
      Because tacrolimus binds strongly to erythrocytes in systemic circulation, the effect of
      hematocrit on distribution of tacrolimus is important for the methods used to measure
      tacrolimus concentrations ,hematocrit correction could be a step towards improvement of
      tacrolimus dose individualization Thearputic drug monitoring of MPA has been proposed to
      optimize drug dosage avoiding potential hematologic and digestive side effects .MPA
      monitoring is generally based on the determination of the plasma MPA trough concentration
      (C0) .
