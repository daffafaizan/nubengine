      various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During
      the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or
      octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still
      difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.

      Doctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called
      somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission
      tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better
      diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have
      somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better
      pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.

      However, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible.
      Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE
      PET scans to:

        -  Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour

        -  Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour

        -  Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where
           standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours
           despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed

        -  For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact
           clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.

      This registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the
      participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.
