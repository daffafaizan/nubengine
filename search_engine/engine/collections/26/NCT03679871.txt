      Health Organization's (WHO) understanding of health(care) and would improve health care for
      this patient group. An applicable screening tool for chronic pain patients' spiritual
      concerns and needs must be empirically based. Based on preceding focus group interviews with
      patients and with health care professionals in various clinical settings and literature
      analysis, a screening tool has been constructed. This tool aims at supporting health care
      professionals as well as chronic pain patients in gaining access to spiritual concerns and
      needs for incorporation in multi-modal, interprofessional pain therapy. In this project the
      screening tools' psychometric properties will be tested with in five distinct clinical in-
      and out-patient settings.
