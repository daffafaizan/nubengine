      Primary

        -  Determine changes in peripheral nerve function in older patients with diabetes and
           metastatic solid tumors treated with taxane or platinum-containing chemotherapy
           regimens.

        -  Determine the extent to which age, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and level of glycemic
           control predict a differential pattern in outcome beyond the effect of the drugs in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Develop a clinical assessment that would predict whether or not patients with diabetes
           mellitus are more or less susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal study.

      Patients undergo an interview and clinical evaluation to measure demographic data, cutaneous
      sensation, gait and balance, vibration, lower extremity muscle strength, orthostatic blood
      pressure, and glycemic control. Patients are evaluated at baseline, every 3 weeks during
      chemotherapy for up to 4 treatments, and at 2 months after completion of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
