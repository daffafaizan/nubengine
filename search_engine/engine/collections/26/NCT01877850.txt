    
      All patients with prolonged weaning and who required tracheostomy are enrolled in the study.
      These patients are randomized as "Case or Control" by a computer program.

      Patients can start the weaning process when the acute phase of the respiratory failure has
      been resolved and pressure support ventilation was setted.

      For all this patients are calculated modified-BWAP(BWAP-M) and TOBIN indexes. The "Case"
      patients started the weaning protocol process only if BWAP-M value is more than 15 or BWAP-M
      10-15 with Tobin index < 100.

      If not, the BWAP-M and Tobin will be calculated every day. The Control patients will start
      weaning by clinical judgement even if the BWAP-M value is less than 10.

      For all patients are calculated: the duration of weaning process, the ICU length of stay and
      the duration of the mechanical ventilation.
