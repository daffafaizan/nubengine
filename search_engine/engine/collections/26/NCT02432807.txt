    
      Bacterial conjunctivitis is common ocular disease caused by various types of bacteria
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). External ocular infections such as those caused by MRSA or
      MRSE frequently are not serious but in rare cases may be severe enough to threaten vision.
      When ocular infections due to resistant organisms such as MRSA/MRSE do not respond to empiric
      treatment with approved antibiotics, there are few treatment options. Vancomycin is one of
      the few treatment options that has been shown to be effective against all clinical isolates
      of MRSA/MRSE.

      This study is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a vancomycin
      hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment in patients with moderate to severed Gram-positive
      bacterial conjunctivitis including those with MRSA and MRSE. Subjects, who are adenovirus
      negative, will be dosed with vancomycin hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment or placebo
      (vehicle) 4 times daily for 7 days and evaluated for clinical and bacterial resolution of
      their infection along with an assessment of the safety of the investigational product.
