      with advanced solid tumors would be enrolled. Patients will receive escalating dose groups of
      HWH340 tablet.

      Part two is a multiple-dose study on tolerance and pharmacokinetics. Based on the safety
      assessment, three or four groups would be chosen to conduct the study. 9-24 patients with
      advanced solid tumors will be enrolled.

      Part three is a dose expansion stage on safety and efficacy. Two to four dose-groups would be
      chosen to conduct the study. 40-60 patients with advanced solid tumors with BRCA mutation OR
      homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) will be enrolled.
