    
      The first step is divided into 3 parts. 9 patients will be sequentially enrolled (3 patients
      in each part). The patients will be followed during 45 days and the following rules will be
      used to assess the safety:

      First part: if no toxicity: initiation of the randomised part. If 1/3 toxicity: start of the
      second part. If 2 or 3/3 toxicity: end of the study.

      Second part: same rules and possible start of the third part. Third part: if no toxicity:
      initiation of the randomised part. If 1 or more toxicity: end of the study.

      The safety will be assessed after each part by an independent data safety monitoring board.
