      Relapse of depression is common and leads to considerable morbidity and decreased quality of
      life for patients. Estimates suggest that at least 50% of patients treated for depression
      will relapse after a single episode. The majority of these will relapse within 6 months and
      the risk of relapse increases for each successive episode of depression. GPs see a largely
      undifferentiated case-mix of patients and, once patients with depression reach remission,
      there is limited guidance and no validated tools to help GPs stratify patients according to
      risk of relapse.This study will potentially derive a statistical model to predict relapse of
      depression in remitted depressed patients in primary care.

      The investigators have created a longitudinal cohort of patients drawn from seven randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological primary care-based interventions for
      depression and one longitudinal cohort study. The investigators will use logistic regression
      to predict the outcome of relapse of depression within 6-8 months. The investigators plan to
      include the following well-evidenced relapse predictors in the model: residual depressive
      symptoms; number of previous episodes of depression; co-morbid anxiety; and severity of the
      index episode. They will also control for RCT intervention received by participants.

      If sample size and availability of predictor information allows, the investigators will
      include the following predictors in an exploratory analysis: age; relationship status;
      multi-morbidity; employment status; gender; and ethnicity. Generalisability will be assessed
      through internal-external cross-validation and net benefit will be explored.
