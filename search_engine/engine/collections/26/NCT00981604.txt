      hospital with an indication for cholecystectomy. We will offer enrollment to several
      institutions provided they receive institutional approval.

      This will be a definitive trial design. Based on our operative times with SILS compared with
      our recent experience in standard laparoscopy, a sample size of 60 patients will give us a
      power of 0.8 with an Î± of 0.05.

      After the procedure, both groups will be managed in the same manner per routine care. They
      will be discharged when tolerating a regular diet and their pain is well-controlled on oral
      pain medication.
