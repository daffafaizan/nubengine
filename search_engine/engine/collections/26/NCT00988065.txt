      were to leave the unit the morning of the day after each dose. In cases of suspected
      hypersensitivity symptoms, healthy subjects were to remain confined to the study center until
      all signs and symptoms regressed, the subject was stable, and the investigator considered it
      safe for the subject to leave the study center. Four sites participated in this trial.
