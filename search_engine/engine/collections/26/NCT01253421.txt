      with a pharmacological challenge, the goal of the current study will be to investigate the
      role of dopamine in MDD. Participants in this research will include 36 MDD subjects and 36
      demographically matched healthy participants recruited from the community by Dr. Pizzagalli's
      laboratory at McLean Hospital's Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research. This
      study will include two sessions:

        -  The first session will involve a diagnostic interview, and a series of questionnaires
           and assessments.

        -  The second session will take place at the McLean Hospital's Neuroimaging Center, and
           include the administration of a low-dose of amisulpride (50 mg capsule) or placebo,
           followed by an fMRI brain scan and administration of two behavioral tasks.
