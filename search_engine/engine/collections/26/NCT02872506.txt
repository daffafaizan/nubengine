      (A2, A3), the time evolution of the disease, the length of the diseased ileal segment (less
      than 10 cm; 10 to 30; 30 to 50 cm) and the Montreal classification (B1, B2). The medical
      treatment group will be chosen among patients receiving anti-TNF therapy for the first time.
      The surgical group are the patients operated on for the first time by means of ileocecal
      resection by laparoscopy or laparotomy without any severity criteria or perianal lesions and
      do not require prophylactic treatment of recurrence.
