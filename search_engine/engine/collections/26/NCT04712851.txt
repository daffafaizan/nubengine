    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Clinical response rate at 6 months - percent of patients with complete response at 6
      months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Histologic response rate at 6 months - percent of patients with regression from grade 2 or
      3 intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma in situ to a lower grade.

      II. Clinical complete response rate at 9 months and 12 months. III. For vulvar
      intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) only, clinical partial response rate at 6 months, 9 months,
      and 12 months.

      IV. Safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with VIN, vaginal intraepithelial
      neoplasia (VaIN), and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in VIN, VaIN, and CIN lesions as a biomarker of response to
      therapy.

      II. Evaluation of HPV status as a biomarker of response to therapy. III. Evaluation of HPV
      clearance as a surrogate endpoint.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for a minimum of 24 weeks (4 cycles) and up to a maximum of 24 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.
