      humerus fracture to receive early passive mobilisation or conventional-treatment. The primary
      outcome was functional assessment of the shoulder (Constant score) at 3 months. Secondary
      outcomes were functional assessment at 6 weeks and at 6 months, change in pain (on a visual
      analogue scale) and passive range of motion.
