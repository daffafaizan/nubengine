      Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CACBT) for youth anxiety and (b) the BASC-2 TRS to identify
      anxious youth in the school setting using a cohort-sequential design (i.e., three years at 20
      schools over the span of five years). There are 3 phases: Phase I (baseline): Gather data on
      prevalence and services provided via screening measures and treatment trackers: Phase II
      (implementation): Train school staff in the identification of anxious youth (i.e. BASC-2 TRS)
      and the provision of the intervention (i.e., CACBT), modifying assessment and treatment
      procedures so as to best fit each individual school. Identify barriers and facilitators of
      implementation by gathering the qualitative experience of school staff: Phase II
      (sustainability): Discontinue training and supervision. Assess sustainability of the
      assessment and intervention. Identify barriers and facilitators of implementation by
      gathering the qualitative experience of school staff.
