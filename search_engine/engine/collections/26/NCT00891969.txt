      Primary

        -  To determine the association between women's and physicians' participatory communication
           behaviors (e.g., patients asking questions, physicians soliciting questions) on
           treatment decision-making process and health outcomes.

      Secondary

        -  To capture the language used in the treatment-decision interactions.

        -  To assess the degree of variation in the language used among physicians and patients who
           are active participants and those who are less inclined to participate in the treatment
           decision-making interaction.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their companions undergo consultation with the physician for treatment
      decision making. The treatment discussion is audio/videotaped for approximately 45 minutes.

      Patients complete one short survey prior to physician consultation. After the treatment
      discussion, patients complete two short surveys, one immediately after the visit in the
      waiting room before leaving for the day, and the second one a week after the visit by a
      web-based survey or by mail.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 women with breast cancer and 600 companions of these women
      will be accrued for this study.
