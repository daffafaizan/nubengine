      regeneration has many benefits, which ultimately affect the total treatment plan. The
      immediate placement of implants provides significant advantages, including fewer surgical
      procedures, shorter treatment time, and improved esthetics. The goals of osseous replacement
      are maintenance of contour, elimination of dead space, and reduce postoperative infection,
      provide good support for dental implant and enhance bony and soft tissue healing. allograft
      bone has gold standard over other augment techniques including favorable bone quality and
      minimal bone resorption.
