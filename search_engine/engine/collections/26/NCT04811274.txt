    
      Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare respiratory disease characterized by the
      accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material within the pulmonary alveoli, resulting in the
      majority of cases from a defective clearance of the surfactant by intra-alveolar macrophages.

      Mutations in the MARS gene encoding methionyl-tRNA synthetase are responsible for a genetic
      form of alveolar proteinosis, but the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to mutations in
      the respiratory phenotype are not known.

      The main hypothesis is that the alveolar proteinosis phenotype in these patients is secondary
      to a defective clearance of the surfactant by the alveolar macrophages.

      The main objective of the study is to study the clearance capacity of lipoproteinaceous
      material by macrophages of patients with MARS related PAP. This will be investigate in
      cultured macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes of patients (patients with MARS
      related PAP) and controls (patients without MARS related PAP).

      The subjects and the controls will be included during a hospitalization during which a blood
      sample and a bronchoscopy with broncoalveolar lavage must be performed as part of their care.
