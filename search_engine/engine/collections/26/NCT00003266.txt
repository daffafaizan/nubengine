      patients receiving interferon alfa. II. Determine whether the use of methylphenidate in this
      patient population decreases the number of dose reductions of interferon alfa due to
      toxicities other than myelosuppression or elevated liver function tests. III. Assess whether
      efficacy or toxicity of methylphenidate in this patient population is concentration
      dependent. IV. Compare the fatigue subscale and the proposed Brief Fatigue Inventory.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm study. Patients are
      stratified according to initial fatigue level (high vs moderate), and treatment with tumor
      vaccine (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive oral methylphenidate twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily.
      Treatment is continued for 21 consecutive days with dose escalations as tolerated and as
      needed by patient judgement, followed by an additional week to evaluate the effect of drug
      withdrawal. Patients are contacted by telephone at least twice weekly during the 21 day
      treatment and 7 day washout phase to assess adverse or rebound effects. Before the study
      begins and at weekly clinic visits for the 4 week study period, patients complete a series of
      questionnaires to measure mood, levels of fatigue and lethargy, and sense of well being.
      Patients also keep a short daily diary of study medication doses and degree of tiredness.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued into this study within 39 months.
