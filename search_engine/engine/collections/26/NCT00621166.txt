      providing adequate treatment for the mother. Levels of HIV RNA at delivery and the use of
      antiretrovirals (ARV) are independently associated with decreased transmission[1]. With a
      HAART regimen the transmission rate can be reduced till under the 2 %[1, 2]. Possibly
      suitable drugs which can be used during pregnancy is lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. In
      Thailand, aluvir is not available therefore a generic lopinavir/ritonavir tablet formulation
      will be used in our study.

      In order to prove adequate levels of lopinavir/ritonavir, we will record 12-hour PK at third
      trimester. Second trimester and post-partum 12-hour PK are optional. Furthermore, we will
      collect safety and efficacy throughout the study.
