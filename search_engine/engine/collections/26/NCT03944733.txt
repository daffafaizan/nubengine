      postpartum to understand the relation between iron status and mother-child interactions and
      depressive symptoms. During this period, iron deficient anemic mothers will receive an
      intervention with iron with the scope of improving iron status, reducing their depressive
      symptoms, and in turn, increasing the quality of parenting behaviors during mother-child
      interactions. The control group will be iron sufficient mothers who will receive a placebo.
