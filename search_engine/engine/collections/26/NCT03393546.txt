    
      A waitlist pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of a 4-week APA
      intervention. Participants and their caregivers will be enrolled into the study. Following
      the baseline assessment (1st home visit), participants will wait one month and will be
      randomized to an interventionist or caregiver-training group.

      Both groups will have a home/office visit at pre-intervention, followed by three home visits
      weekly, and a final home/office visit at post-intervention. Participants in both groups will
      have 1 monthly follow-up phone call after the completion of APA.
