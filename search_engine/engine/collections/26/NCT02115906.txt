      including ectopic lipid deposition in insulin sensitive organs like liver and skeletal
      muscle. Direct inhibition of growth hormone action by a receptor antagonist has been shown to
      induce hepatic steatosis and growth hormone replacement decreases liver fat content in obese
      humans. Of note, recent evidence indicates that the GH-IGF1 axis affects body composition via
      regulating mitochondrial oxidation capacity.

      Hypothesis: Direct and/or indirect effects of GH on mitochondrial function might mediate the
      changes in body composition and lipid deposition. Thus, excessive GH secretion by a pituitary
      adenoma (Acromegaly) might be accompanied by increased mitochondrial activity leading to
      inappropriately low intracellular lipid depots, especially in metabolically active tissue
      like liver and skeletal muscle.

      Aim: Assessment of metabolic activity and intracellular lipid content in skeletal muscle and
      liver in patients suffering from acromegaly compared to controls.

      Methods: Non-interventional study:

        -  31P/1H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and in follow up examinations 3, 6 and 12
           months after initiation of GH lowering treatments including surgery, somatostatinanalogs
           or pegvisomant.

        -  oral glucose tolerance tests at each examination to assess treatment responses and
           calculate validated parameters for insulin sensitivity and resistance.
