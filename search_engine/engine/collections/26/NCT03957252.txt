      refine the prediction of clinically-significant prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of
      men to be recruited in Alberta, Whitehorse and in the United States of America when they are
      scheduled for a biopsy as a result of on an elevated PSA.

      This prospective training and validation cohort study will consist of up to 2,800 consenting
      men in total, between ages 40-75 years old, without prior diagnosis of prostate cancer, who
      have been selected to undergo a prostate biopsy to rule out prostate cancer.
