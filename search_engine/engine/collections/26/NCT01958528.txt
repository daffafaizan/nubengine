      progression to multiple myeloma in patients with MGUS and SMM. The secondary objective are to
      correlate CMMCs with the Mayo Clinic prognostic models in MGUS/SMM, to compare bone marrow
      genomic findings with genomic findings in CMMC (utilizing multiple myeloma FISH panel), to
      perform immunophenotyping of bone marrow plasma cells, to perform gene expression profiling
      on CD138+bone marrow plasma cells and correlate with progression, to perform serum microRNA
      profiling and correlate with progression, to correlate bone marrow immunohistochemical
      studies evaluating the microenvironment with CMMC, to perform proteomic profiling on
      peripheral blood to evaluate serum biomarkers of progression and to establish a biorepository
      of samples of peripheral blood for future studies.
