      poorly studied. The investigators evaluated the effect of one week's unhealthy lifestyle on
      glucose metabolism and liver parameters in a group of young, healthy males participating in
      Roskilde Festival 2016.

      Festival participants were studied before and after participation (one week) in Roskilde
      Festival 2016 and matched with controls who lead a normal life for an equivalent period of
      time. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), abdominal ultrasound and strain elastography for
      liver stiffness were performed together with a bioimpedance scan and cognitive tests.
