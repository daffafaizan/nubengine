        -  Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients
           with advanced breast cancer by determining the proportion of women who experience an
           objective tumor response.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 6 to 7 times per day.

      Treatment continues for at least 6 weeks. Patients achieving complete or partial response may
      continue on therapy until disease progression or toxic effects occur.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
