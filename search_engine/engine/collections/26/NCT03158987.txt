      therapy. Regional differences in referral approach and patient behavior are presumably
      associated with considerable delays in infection recognition and therapy onset. Comparison of
      records of new cases which were diagnosed in 2014 in several eastern federal states and a
      major western German city is expected to disclose whether the regionally preferred type of
      the primary care institution affects the time point of first diagnosis and the elapsed time
      since the emergence of the infection, as assessed by Cluster of Differentiation 4 positive
      (CD4+) lymphocyte counts and manifestation of clinical symptoms of immune deficiency.
