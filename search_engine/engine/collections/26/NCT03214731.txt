      with a poor long-term prognosis. Artesunate, one analogues of antimalarial agent artemisinin,
      have immunomodulatory properties that might be useful for treating autoimmune diseases
      including SLE. it is still lack of solid evidence from RCT to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      artesunate plus standard of care in active LN. Regarding no data could be referred to decide
      the sample size and optimal dosage, we designed this pilot study. The result and experience
      of pilot study will answer these questions, and guarantee the multicenter RCT to be conducted
      successfully.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Study subjects
      are class III, IV, V, III+V, IV+V lupus nephritis patients, according to ISN/RPS 2003
      classification of LN, with active lesion needing corticosteroid in combination with
      immunosuppressant therapy.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria during screening will be randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: 25mg bid artesunate, 50mg bid artesunate or placebo plus
      standard of care (prednisone plus mycophenolate mofetil ［MMF］) for 6 month.

      All the subjects were asked to visit the hospital for weekly follow-up for four weeks, then
      monthly thereafter.
