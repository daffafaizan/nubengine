    
      This is a prospective study evaluating the reaction time among attending anesthesiologists,
      and anesthesiology residents who take night shift call and are suffering from sleep
      deprivation. Investigators plan to examine clinical performance by measuring reaction times
      using a 10 minute psychomotor vigilance test device on physicians in training as well as
      experienced physicians in pre and post call situations.

      All subjects will be informed of the scope and purpose of the study.

        1. Attending Anesthesiologists: Gender, age, years of experience, years of employment at
           the institution, hours of sleep and circadian rhythm will be taken into effect.

        2. Residents/Fellows: Gender, age, years of experience, years of employment at the
           institution and circadian rhythm will be taken into effect.

      All study subjects will be asked to fill a questionnaire regarding demographic data, coping
      strategy Index.

        1. Baseline instruments; including demographics, and coping strategy indicator (CSI), will
           be administrated.

        2. Reaction time, mood and simple cognitive test will be measured at approximately 7 am of
           a regular day, (when the subject is not on call).

        3. Reaction time, mood and simple cognitive test will be measured at approximately 7 am of
           after a call night.

      This proposal attempts to examine the impact of night shift on mood, cognitive and motor task
      performance in physicians as compared to regular hours.
