      and over-inflation between electronic (VBM©) and pneumatic (Nosten©) devices (continuous
      monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure), in critically intubated children. This study aims to
      determine the effectiveness of the electronic device in the continuous monitoring of tracheal
      cuff pressure.
