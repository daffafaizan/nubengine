      locally advanced, inflammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer. The patients enter the
      trial period after signing informed consent. This study aims to evaluate trastuzumab The
      pathological complete response rate (pCR) of anti-combined pyrrotinib and chemotherapy
      (TCbH+Py) in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

      The subjects began to take continuous medication after joining the group, and the total
      duration of medication was 6 cycles. Three to four weeks after the end of treatment, the
      surgeon will choose radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy or breast-sparing surgery
      according to the individual conditions of the patient. Regardless of whether the pCR is
      achieved, the adjuvant trastuzumab therapy or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab therapy is
      continued after the operation, and the total course of anti-HER2 therapy is up to 1 year
      (about 18 treatment cycles). According to the clinical stage and molecular classification of
      the tumor, it is necessary to decide whether adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and
      endocrine therapy are needed.

      After the subject finishes all treatments, the subjects who are out of the group for non-PD
      and non-death causes need to receive the validity Follow-up until PD, start receiving other
      anti-tumor drug treatment or death (whichever comes first).
