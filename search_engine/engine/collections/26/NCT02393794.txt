      in American women. Despite recent improvement in the treatment of breast cancer, 40,000 women
      per year still die in the U.S.as a result of breast cancer. Once the disease has gotten worse
      (progressed) after standard chemotherapy treatments, there are limited treatment options and
      the likelihood for patients to recover is very small.

      The study will be done in two phases:

      Phase I will determine the highest dose of romidepsin that is safe and tolerable to take in
      combination with cisplatin.

      Phase II will determine if taking romidepsin (at the dose determined in Phase I) in
      combination with cisplatin and nivolumab is safe and effective in treating patients with
      breast cancer.

      Phase I will complete before Phase II begins.
