      complex interplay of neurophysiological and psychological factors. Cognitive interpretations
      of social-evaluative threats have been found to be very potent emotional stressors. Apocrine
      sweat glands are stimulated by emotional stress, fear or mental tension. Upon secretion,
      apocrine sweat is odorless. By enzymatic action of the bacterial microbiome on apocrine sweat
      in particular, body malodor is formed. This is perceived as offensive by most societies. As a
      result, self-confidence and social relationships can be influenced by undesired body odor. A
      good understanding of the complex sweat-microbiome interactions leading to malodor formation
      is required for the development of effective malodor remedies.

      In the MOIST study it will be assessed whether the adapted Sternberg short-term working
      memory task (STMST) is an effective method to induce malodor formation by emotional stress,
      as assessed by expert assessments of stress-induced malodor formation in the armpits of 30
      healthy male volunteers.

      Before, during and after being exposed to the adapted version of the STMST, saliva will be
      collected to determine cortisol levels, subjects have to rate their momentary feelings of
      anxiety and embarrassment and heart rate variability will be monitored continuously with a
      wireless signal transmission device. Before and after exposure to the adapted STMST, malodor
      levels will be assessed by two expert judges, axillary volatiles will be collected by cup
      scrubbing and microbiota samples will be taken to determine microbial species.
