    
      Goal of study: To evaluate the safety, effectiveness as well as cost- effectiveness of Global
      Endometrial Ablation (GEA) as an initial treatment for menorrhagia.

      Specific aim #1: To determine if global endometrial ablation (GEA) is more effective than
      medical therapy in the initial management of menorrhagia.

      Specific aim #2: To determine disease-specific resource utilization and costs associated with
      the treatment alternatives and the cost effectiveness of global endometrial ablation (GEA)
      compared with medical treatment (oral contraceptive pills) in the initial management of
      menorrhagia.
