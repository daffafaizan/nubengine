      activity promotion program. The investigators will work with a local Parks and Recreation
      department to recruit and deliver programming to three cohorts of fathers and their children
      2-5 years old. To evaluate program feasibility, the investigators will assess recruitment
      efforts, program attendance, and participant engagement and satisfaction with the program.
      The investigators will also assess change in father-child outcomes post program including
      objectively measured physical activity, fathers' parenting, and father involvement.
