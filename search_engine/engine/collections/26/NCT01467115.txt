      Fluorouracil. This will be followed by six weeks of radiation therapy along with Cetuximab.
      Patients will get two more cycles of chemotherapy with the same agents after the completion
      of radiation therapy course. Patients will be watched very closely during the trial period,
      with close follow up of treatment responses and monitoring of any adverse effects.
