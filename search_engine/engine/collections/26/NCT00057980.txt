        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of epirubicin when administered with celecoxib in
           patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 6-month and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on serum levels of vascular endothelial growth
           factor and correlate these effects with response in these patients.

        -  Correlate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor tissue and nonmalignant liver
           tissue with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of epirubicin.

        -  Phase I:Patients receive epirubicin IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral celecoxib twice
           daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 3 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated as in phase I at the MTD of
           epirubicin.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-52 patients (3-15 for phase I and 12-37 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
