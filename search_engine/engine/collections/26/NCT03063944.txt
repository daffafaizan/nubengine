      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 (OPB-111077) in
      combination with decitabine and venetoclax.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe any preliminary efficacy of OPB-111077 in combination with decitabine and
      venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and perform metabolomics in patients
      with AML who are receiving OPB-111077 and decitabine and venetoclax.

      III. To assess apoptosis and proliferation assays in patients with AML who are receiving
      OPB-111077, decitabine and venetoclax.
