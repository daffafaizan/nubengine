      of Mashhad Dental School. The patients are selected according to the RDC/TMD criteria to
      include those having temporomandibular disorders with muscular origin. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (treatment group) will receive low level laser
      therapy. The laser light will be applied with 890 nm diode laser (Mustang 2000+, Russia) with
      frequency of 1500 Hz, and dose of 2 J/cm2 per point in the painful muscles.

      In Group 2 (placebo) the low power laser will be applied with a minimal dose that is very
      lower than the threshold necessary for therapeutic effects. Laser therapy for both the
      treatment and placebo groups will be applied on all painful muscles three times a week for
      four weeks. Patients will be evaluated at the start of the treatment, after the 6th and 12th
      sessions of laser therapy and also one month after the end of the treatment. At each
      evaluation, the maximum mouth opening with or without pain and masticatory muscle tenderness
      will be measured. Pain will be measured through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The range of
      lateral and protrusive mandibular movements, and the difficulty in chewing food will also be
      evaluated.
