      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the esophagus
      or gastroesophageal junction treated with erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      degree of dysphagia relief in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. V. Correlate
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression with response to treatment in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
