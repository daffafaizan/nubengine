      most women are prescribed opioids after discharge that were significantly in excess of the
      actual opioids used. However there is a subset of women (~25%) who use all opioids and
      complain that they were not prescribed enough. The only variable predictive of post-
      discharge opioid use was Inpatient opioid use. These data were used to develop a formula for
      estimating outpatient use based on inpatient use. Currently there are no guidelines for
      outpatient prescribing either at our institution or on a national level. On average, most
      patients at our institution received 30 tablets of 5mg oxycodone at discharge. In surveying
      providers, very few looked at inpatient use and most had a standard prescription that they
      gave everyone.
