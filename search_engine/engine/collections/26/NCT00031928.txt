        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of mafosfamide in patients with
           progressive or refractory meningeal malignancy.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive intrathecal mafosfamide over 20 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks (induction
      therapy). Patients then receive intrathecal mafosfamide once weekly for 4 weeks
      (consolidation therapy), twice a month for 4 months, and then monthly thereafter (maintenance
      therapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mafosfamide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3000 patients will be accrued for this study.
