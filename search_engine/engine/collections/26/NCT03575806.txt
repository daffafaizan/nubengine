      cause of cancer related deaths. Radical hepatic resection remains the main treatment for
      hepatocellular carcinoma, the 5-year survival rate of HCC after surgery was 60-70%.
      Unfortunately, HCC is prone to postoperative recurrence that more than 50% of patients
      relapse within 2 years, which has become the key to restrict the therapeutic effect of
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Microvascular invasion (MVI) is one of the main risk factors for
      poor prognosis in HCC.

      Autologous cell immunotherapy is to collect patient's own immune cells and then given back to
      the patient after amplified in vitro that can improve the anti-tumor immune response. Tcm
      (central memory T cells) are effective anti-tumor immune cells that exhibit the long-term
      survival and self-renewal capacity in vivo. Autologous Tcm immunotherapy combining
      chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy would effectively prolong survival period, prevent
      tumor recurrence and metastasis, then improve quality of life in patients.
