      treatment of confirmed patients of Middle-East respiratory syndrome.

      In first step, we collected the base-line (pre-exposure) serum from the HCP who worked in the
      hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated. Pre-exposure serum was collected in
      a few centers. If the serum was drawn within 3 weeks from initial exposure, then the serum
      was considered adequate as pre-exposure. (Because, antibody against the MERS-CoV would be
      produced after more the 17-21 days of exposure). The serum was frozen.

      In second step, we will collect the post-exposure serum from the HCP who worked in the
      hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated or detected. We plan to include 25-30
      centers. The timing of sample collection is 6-8 weeks after last contact with confirmed MERS
      patients. The serum will also freeze.

      In third step, we will assay the presence of antibody in collected sample. We will use
      MERS-CoV ELISA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.) as screening test and MERS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.)
      as confirm test.
