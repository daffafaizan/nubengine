      Interventional Study Consortium (CCISC) as reported by Golden and Hellenbrand [1]. The CCISC
      experience from 1989 to 2005 shows a true procedural success rate of 98.6%.

      The patient population will be subjects with coarctation of the aorta. A total of 70
      subjects, children, adolescents and adults, will be enrolled at up to 15 study sites.
      Baseline clinical and angiographic assessment will determine the subject's eligibility for
      enrollment in the study. Subjects will continue in the study for long term annual follow-up
      through 3, 4, and 5 years.
