      filling.

      60 patients have been selected from a group of 490 patients, who had a full mouth
      radiographic status taken in connection with a population study of apical periodontitis in
      Aarhus Community. The selection criteria for the 60 patients were patients with a persisting
      apical periodontitis, Periapical Index (PAI) score 3-5, on front teeth and premolars in the
      upper jaw. The orthograde root filling in the tooth must be at least 2 years old and
      sufficient regarding density and length.

      The 60 patients will be randomised into the two groups of apicectomy with and without
      filling. A radiograph will be taken just before the operation and 6 and 12 months after the
      operation. In the assessment of bone healing, we will use two different techniques,
      subtraction radiography and the Periapical Index (PAI).

      We will also evaluate the benefits of using the operation microscope during the operation,
      and if clinical photos can be useful as documentation of treatment result.
