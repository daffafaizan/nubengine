      the pathophysiology of diabetes during pregnancy. During the study:

        1. fat tissue, Umbilical cord blood, placenta tissue and subcutaneous fat will be taken
           from pregnant diabetic woman over going a C-section.

        2. Bloods will be analyzed for insulin, c-peptide, glucose and fat profile

        3. Placenta and fat tissue will be analyzed for miRNA and total RNA

        4. Clinical and anthropometric measurements will be taken from the mother

        5. Placenta status will be taken
