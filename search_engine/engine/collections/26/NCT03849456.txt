    
      This is a 52-week, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GWP42006.
      Participants who satisfy all eligibility criteria will start GWP42006 at a dose of 2.5
      milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and titrate to a target dose of 10 mg/kg/day or
      800 mg/day, whichever is smaller, during the first 4 weeks of treatment. If there is
      intolerance during titration, the participant may be maintained on a dose below 10 mg/kg/day.
      The maximum dose participants aged 6 years or older can receive will be 20 mg/kg/day or 1600
      mg/day, whichever is smaller. Following the final treatment dose, participants will taper
      GWP42006 10% per day. The investigator will withdraw participants who fail to demonstrate any
      perceived benefit and may withdraw participants for whom tolerability is poor.
