      the parent protocol "Effect of Teriparatide, Vibration and the Combination on Bone Mass and
      Bone Architecture in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury (NCT01225055)". This study will allow those
      individuals who received Teriparatide (20ug/day) and vibration (10 min/day) during the parent
      study to be treated for a second year and will allow those individuals who received
      teriparatide-placebo to have the opportunity to have a full year of teriparatide therapy.
      This study will determine if two years of exposure to teriparatide will result in a greater
      increase in Bone Mass Density (BMD) than that seen after a single year's treatment. Subjects
      will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months after initiating treatment with measurement of bone
      density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption.
