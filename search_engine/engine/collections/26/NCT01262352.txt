      with mild lung disease. Lung clearance index (LCI) derived from inert gas multiple-breath
      washout (MBW) testing hold considerable promise to evaluate early lung disease as studies
      have detected abnormalities in a high percentage of CF patients with normal spirometry in
      both infants and children.

      This study explored the effect of ivacaftor on LCI and the efficacy of ivacaftor on other
      clinical and biomarker endpoints of CF lung disease in subjects aged 6 years and older with
      CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele.
