      suspected of having venous thromboembolism.

      These patients will first be evaluated using the Wells score:

        -  patients with low or moderate pretest probability will be considered for D-dimer
           testing, those with D-dimer positive will be considered for an imaging procedure,

        -  patients with high pretest probability will be considered for an imaging procedure.

      Patients with "low or moderate" pretest probability and a negative D-Dimer result will be
      followed for 3 months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or
      pulmonary embolism.

      These patients will be contacted by phone 3 month after their first visit.
