    
      A prospective randomized controlled trial of adult patients diagnosed with BP in the
      otolaryngology emergency department within 72 hours of symptoms onset.

      Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following steroids regimens:

        1. Prednisone 1 mg/kg (max. 60 mg) daily for 7 days, 40 mg for 2 days, 20 mg for 2 days
           (Total 11 days)

        2. Prednisone 1 mg/kg (max. 60 mg) daily for 7 days (Total 7 days)

      In addition, both groups will receive the following treatment when indicated:

        -  Mosturizing eye drops for 14 days or until complete recovery (HB-1)

        -  Mosturizing eye gel for 14 days or until complete recovery (HB-1)

        -  Omepradex once daily during prednisone treatment (unless the patient receives chronic
           treatment with any proton pump inhibitor).

        -  Acyclovir for 7 days in cases of severe BP (HB 5-6).

      Patients' follow-up visits: 14 days, 1 month, 3 months. If recovery will be completed before
      1 month, no more follow up visits will be taken.

      In addition, side effects of prednisone use will be assessed as well as compliance to therapy
      and duration of additional symptoms.
