      main theme in the field of contemporary surgery. As a rising star, the Da Vinci robotic
      surgery system provides surgeons with a more comprehensive surgical vision, more flexible
      instrument control, finer anatomy, and more natural comfort compared to open surgery and
      laparoscopic surgery. However, due to the lack of long-term theoretical basis, the evidence
      to support its clinical benefits is limited, and its application is limited by related
      postoperative complications and high operation-related costs. At present, the number of Da
      Vinci robotic surgery is steadily increasing around the world, but what are the expectations
      of patients that robotic surgery may be better than open or laparoscopic surgery? It is also
      unclear what reasons are related to this established expectation. Therefore, we intend to map
      and characterize the prevalence of the patients' expectation that robotic surgery might be
      superior to open or laparoscopic procedures and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical
      and organisational factors associated with this expectation.
