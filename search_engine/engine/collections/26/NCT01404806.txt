    
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe first dose and steady state
      pharmacokinetics of GSK1349572 in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) and vaginal (VT) and cervical
      (CT) tissue compared to blood plasma (BP) in HIV-1 negative women. Based on current
      literature, GSK1349572 has demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetic profile in BP, including
      low to moderate pharmacokinetic variability (CV% 9-41), extended t1/2 (13-15h) and trough
      concentrations which remain 25-fold higher than the protein-adjusted IC90 ~0.064Âµg/mL for
      wild type virus. Understanding pharmacokinetic behavior of GSK1349572 in multiple female
      biological compartments will inform its role in sterilizing the genital tract in HIV-infected
      women, as well as protect mucosal tissue against HIV infection (pre/post-exposure
      prophylaxis).
