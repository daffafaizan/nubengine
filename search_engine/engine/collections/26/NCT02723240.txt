    
      This is a two-part, Phase I dose escalation study of NUC-3373 as a single agent, administered
      weekly or fortnightly as an I.V. infusion.

      In both parts participants will undergo evaluations of the safety, PK, PD and anti-tumour
      efficacy of NUC-3373

      â€¢ Participants may continue to receive NUC-3373 until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs.

      Part 1: Establish the RP2D and assess the safety and tolerability for single agent NUC-3373
      administered as an I.V. infusion on day 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle. Participants can
      remain on study and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      occurs. The RP2D will be determined by dose escalation with sequential participants receiving
      increasing doses of NUC-3373 in a standard '3 + 3' cohort design.

      Part 2: Establish the RP2D and assess the safety and tolerability for single agent NUC-3373
      administered as a fortnightly I.V. infusion on day 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Participants
      can remain on study and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      occurs. The RP2D will be determined by dose escalation with sequential participants receiving
      increasing doses of NUC-3373 in a standard '3 + 3' cohort design.

      Finally, to assess preliminary efficacy signals and further characterise the safety profile,
      expansion cohorts of up to 20 additional participants per cohort will receive the RP2D of
      NUC-3373 as determined in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Participants can remain on study
      and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
