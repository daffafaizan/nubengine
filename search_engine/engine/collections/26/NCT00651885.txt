    
      This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, single-center, evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy of UT-15C SR compared to placebo in patients with CLI with a planned infra-popliteal
      endovascular intervention procedure. Conventional therapy should be continued for all
      patients in the study. Conventional therapy is defined as the customary best medical practice
      at this investigative site for CLI, including analgesics for rest pain, debridement and wound
      care for ischemic wounds, etc., as long as such care meets the other requirements of the
      study and does not include prohibited therapies or investigational medications. A total of 20
      patients will be prospectively randomized (1:1) to conventional treatment and placebo therapy
      in conjunction with an endovascular procedure or conventional treatment and UT-15C SR therapy
      in conjunction with an infrapopliteal endovascular procedure. Treatment is UT-15C sustained
      release (SR) tablets (1.0 mg dosage strength) or placebo. Treatment will be initiated at 1 mg
      twice daily with dose escalation of an additional 1 mg twice daily every 5 days if clinically
      indicated based upon the presence of known prostacyclin adverse events or adverse events that
      in the opinion of the investigator are attributable to UT-15C SR. Doses should be maximized
      throughout the Treatment Phase up to a maximum dose of 5 mg twice daily at the end of
      12-weeks. Patients will return to the institution for the endovascular procedure at least 4
      days after starting study drug and continue study drug, throughout the endovascular procedure
      and to Week 12. All patients will return to the clinic at Weeks 2, 6 and 12 for Treatment
      Phase assessments, and then Weeks 26 and 52 for follow-up assessments.
