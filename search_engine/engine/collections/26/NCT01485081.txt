    
      The DEBSIDE clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional
      study evaluating the investigational Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Balloon for the
      treatment of Side Branches (SB) of de novo bifurcation lesions with a side branch reference
      vessel diameter ≥2.0 mm and ≤3.0 mm. During the procedure, a dedicated drug-eluting
      bifurcated stent will be implanted in the main branch. The trial will allow the treatment of
      lesion of all Medina type except (0,0,1) in native coronary arteries with sequential
      predilatation of the main and side branch.

      The DEBSIDE clinical trial will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive Quantitative
      Coronary Angiography (QCA) before and after Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) inflation and at 6
      months follow-up. All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months.
