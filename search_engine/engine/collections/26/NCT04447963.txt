      equipped with BTL-785-2 applicator for non-invasive treatment of facial wrinkles. The study
      is a multicenter single-arm, open-label, interventional study. The subjects will be enrolled
      and assigned into one experimental study arm. The subjects will be required to complete three
      (3) treatment visits and two follow-up visits. At every treatment visit after the first,
      prior to the procedure, the participants will be assessed for adverse effects resulting from
      the previous treatment(s) with the BTL-785F device.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) during and after the
      procedures.

      Follow-ups visits at 3 months and 6 months after the final treatment will be held.
