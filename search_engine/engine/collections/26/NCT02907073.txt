      imaging biomarker for expression of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) in tissues.
      Imaging of functional hNIS activity in tissues with [18F]BF4 is anticipated to provide
      superior sensitivity and image quality to I-123 or Tc-99m SPECT for monitoring hNIS
      transduction effected by viral therapies. The proposed work is designed to 1) evaluate its
      safety, biodistribution, metabolism and radiation dosimetry characteristics in 8 healthy
      human volunteers and 2) evaluate the imaging feasibility in comparison with I-123 or Tc-99m
      SPECT of hNIS expression in a) 10 myeloma patients treated with Edmonston Measles virus-NIS
      (MV-NIS) and b) 10 endometrial cancer patients treated with vesicular stomatitis virus
      engineered to express human interferon and NIS (VSV-hINF-NIS). This data will be necessary to
      support future regulatory submissions.
