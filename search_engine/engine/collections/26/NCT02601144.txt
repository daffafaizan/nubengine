      as bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. FOG has responded poorly to HFS and tends to continue
      to deteriorate over time, but this can be alleviated by relatively LFS. Evidence has
      indicated that LFS-STN can improve axial signs in some but not all PD patients, but most of
      them experienced loss of efficacy in the short term. Then comes to the little improvement or
      even worse of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia, which consists of the three main symptoms of
      Parkinson's disease. Thus even if axial problems could be solved by LFS in a long way, it
      could also be hard to tolerate by those patients. The effect of VFS on FOG will be studied.
      The investigators hypothesize that VFS could have better effect on Freezing of gait than HFS
      and LFS.
