      role in the development of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) resulting in epilepsy. We would
      also like to examine what influence the virus has on the neurotransmitters glutamate and
      GABA, since we believe that an imbalance of the major excitatory and inhibitory
      neurotransmitters plays an important role in epilepsy.

      Study population: The study population will consist of adult patients with epilepsy and MTS
      and adult patients with epilepsy and no MTS as confirmed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
      scan of the brain. We will compare findings in these two groups to those in healthy adult
      volunteers.

      Design: This is a natural history study in which we will demonstrate the presence or absence
      of human herpesvirus-6 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from each of three
      adult study groups: patients with epilepsy and MTS, patients with epilepsy and no MTS, and
      normal controls. We will measure in all three groups the concentration of GABA and glutamate
      in CSF. In all three groups we will perform proton MR spectroscopy to non-invasively measure
      these metabolites in the brain.

      Outcome measures: The three subject groups will be compared in terms of the presence or
      absence of the human herpesvirus-6 in the serum and CSF and in terms of the levels of
      glutamate and GABA as measured in the CSF and by magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the
      hippocampus and temporal lobe.
