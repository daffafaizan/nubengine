      administration of a single dose of a cell based medicinal product (CBMP) ALECSAT.

      ALECSAT is an autologous CBMP that is made from the patient's own blood cells. ALECSAT
      contains a large amount of tumour specific cytotoxic Lymphocytes (CTL) and Natural Killer
      (NK) cells that are isolated activated and amplified in number.

      The CBMP is given as a slow i. v. injection to patients with prostate cancer. The patients
      are in the late stage of the disease where they have received hormone treatment but their
      disease is progressing.

      The primary objective of the study is to observe if any side effects or tolerability issues
      occur as a consequence of the cell administration, secondarily it will be observed if any
      positive anti tumour effect may be observed. The study has the purpose to investigate whether
      treatment with ALECSAT in any way is toxic.

      Trial Design: The study is an open, prospective phase I safety study of ALECSAT in prostate
      cancer patients.

      A group consisting of 6 patients will be treated with ALECSAT according to the protocol. Then
      an interim analysis will be done. If there are no signs of significant toxicity related to
      the treatment, the study will continue with 8 more patients that will be included and treated
      with ALECSAT according to the phase I protocol. Thus this study will include a total of 14
      patients.

      The patients will after a single administration of ALECSAT be hospitalised for 3 days and
      will furthermore be followed closely for 7 weeks by 5 planned study visits, by the
      investigators at Urologisk Klinik at Fredrikssund Hospital.
