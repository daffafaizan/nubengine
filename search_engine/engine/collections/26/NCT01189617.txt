      all over body and personal lubricant product in home-use conditions via clinical assessment.
      The study will consist of 2 visits. Subjects who meet the entrance criteria will receive
      investigational product (IP) and 2 subjective questionnaires for at-home completion. The
      subjects will be required to use the IP at least 2 times, as instructed over the 1-week
      home-use period. At the end of the study (visit 2) subjects will return to the study site, at
      which time the unused IP and questionnaires will be returned and a final clinical assessment
      will be performed.
