      treatment for radicular pain. Over the last decade, rare but serious complications have been
      reported following transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI). Recent research
      indicates that certain types of corticosteroids containing microscopic particles may be
      responsible for these adverse events. Dexamethasone (DXM) is a non-particulate
      cortico-steroid that has not been implicated in these adverse events. However, there is
      inadequate evidence up to date to support the use of Dexamethasone (DXM) for transforaminal
      epidural steroid injections (TFESI). This study aims to bridge that gap.
