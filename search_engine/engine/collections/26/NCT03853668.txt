      There are still many gaps in research concerning the effect of different physical training
      modalities on sleep quality in the cardiac population. Thus, the objective of the present
      study was to compare the quality of sleep in subjects who underwent coronary artery bypass
      surgery submitted to two types of training (ie, aerobic exercise alone or combined aerobic
      and resistance training).

      PATIENTS/METHODS:

      80 Participants aged 45-65 years were randomized to two groups: aerobic group (AG), combined
      aerobic and resistance group (ARG). Training lasted ten consecutive weeks with 30
      uninterrupted sessions. The actigraph (Actiwatch Minimitter Company, Incorporated (INC) -
      Sunriver, OR, USA) was placed on the non-dominant wrist and activities were monitored
      continuously while being recorded at one minute intervals. The participants kept the device
      for a period of 96 hours before the first and last training sessions.
