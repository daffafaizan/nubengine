      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD33 vector (referred to as CART-33 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-33 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-leukemia response due to CART-33 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over
      time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-33 cells in bone marrow.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible leukemia blasts, determine leukemia cell killing
      by CART-33 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD33, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-33 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-33 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD33-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.
