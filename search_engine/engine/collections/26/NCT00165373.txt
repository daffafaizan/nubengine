    
      -  Patients will receive rhEndostatin intravenously continuously for 28 days and will be
           enrolled into one of 2 dosing groups.

        -  During the initial course of treatment, subjects will be evaluated for treatment-related
           side effects. If there are no side effects or disease progression, they may receive an
           additional 28 days of continuous rhEndostatin.

        -  During the infusion of rhEndostatin, blood samples will be collected before, during and
           after the drug is given to determine how much of the drug stays in the blood. Blood will
           be drawn on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. After the completion of therapy, a blood sample will
           be collected at least 3 days after to determine the level (if any) of rhEndostatin still
           in the patients blood.

        -  Blood and/or urine samples to determine immune reactions against rhEndostatin as well as
           molecules that tumors may use to stimulate new blood vessel growth will be drawn at the
           start of the study as well as after the completion of each 28-day cycle and completion
           of the study.

        -  When a tumor-specific marker that can be used to monitor the status of the disease is
           present, blood samples for the measurement marker will be obtained at the start of the
           study as well as after each cycle.

        -  Appropriate imaging studies (MRI, CT scan, x-ray) will be done after the completion of
           the first two 28-day cycles and then at the completion of each 28-day cycle for the
           duration of therapy.

        -  Treatment will be continued for 1 year and may be extended if the drugs are well
           tolerated and disease progression has not occured.
