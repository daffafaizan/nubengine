      outcome of pregnancy in women that have high risk of developing preeclampsia (PE). It is a
      challenge for the clinician to identify the high risk women. Doppler blood flow measurements
      in uterine arteries in second trimester have been shown useful to predict the development of
      the disease but prophylactic treatment with ASA from this point in pregnancy has not been
      proven effective. Fetal Medical Foundation has developed an algorithm that calculates
      individual risks for PE/ PIH based on Doppler blood flow measurements and anamnestic
      information.
