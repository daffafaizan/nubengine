      surfaces of 12-to-17-year-old adolescents, who present at least one proximal surface with
      initial caries lesion. Patients will be randomly allocated to treatments, according to the
      technique to be employed: (I) resin infiltration (II) 30% diamine silver fluoride, (III) just
      daily flossing by the patient. All subjects will receive placebo treatments performed in
      other groups. The teeth will be evaluated by clinical and radiographic exams at baseline and
      after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. In 1, 3 and 18 months will just be evaluated aspects
      related to the biofilm.
