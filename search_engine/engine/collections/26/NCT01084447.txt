      and decreases of the respiratory muscle strength in the post-operative periods. Depending on
      the occurrence of pre-existing disturbs, obese patients may exhibit severe declines of
      respiratory function after these surgeries.

      Post-operative respiratory physiotherapy is a valuable intervention, involving a set of
      techniques aimed to expand pulmonary volumes and to improve arterial oxygenation, leading to
      decreases on the development of atelectasis and pneumonias. It induces faster recovery of
      respiratory function and reduction of lung complications, what may be particularly important
      in high-risk patients like over-weighted subjects.

      There are scanty data about the role of respiratory muscle training in the post-operative
      period. This is particularly true regarding inspiratory muscle training of obese patients
      submitted to gastroplasties.
