      PCP and may be effective in preventing PCP in patients who have never developed it. Because
      SMX/TMP can cause side effects, this study will attempt to determine the safest and most
      effective dose of this combination.

      Patients receive SMX/TMP orally on a daily or thrice-weekly basis. Patients are clinically
      evaluated every 4 months. Patients on daily SMX/TMP who develop a drug-related toxicity may
      be switched to thrice-weekly SMX/TMP. Duration of follow-up is 12 months.
