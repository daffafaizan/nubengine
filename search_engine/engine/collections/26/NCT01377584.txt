      sleep apnea (OSA), but adherence is poor. CPAP adherence interventions to date have been met
      with limited success. Intervention strategies would be optimized by added support for
      patients and alternative strategies for intervention delivery. Significant others (SO) are
      likely to exert positive and negative effects on the patient's adoption and use of positive
      airway pressure (PAP) therapy and are frequently described as the greatest source of social
      support for patients with chronic illness. Beginning the intervention before PAP initiation
      would capitalize on the teachable moment shortly following diagnosis when education and
      social support may be most essential. The aims of the research plan are to examine the
      effects of a couple-oriented education and support intervention on patient- and
      partner-reported outcomes as compared to a patient-oriented education and support
      intervention and usual care and to examine the relationship between PAP adherence and
      patients' and partners' sleep quality and daytime functioning. Patients in the pilot study
      will be randomized to the couple-oriented intervention, patient-oriented intervention, or
      standard clinical care group.
