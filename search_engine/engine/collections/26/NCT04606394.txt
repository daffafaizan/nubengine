        -  The expected FEV1 response to a bronchodilator is uncertain as multiple factors
           influence this measure, including severity of disease, day to day variability, varying
           reversibility in COPD patients, the delivery of the drug to a patient and the
           effectiveness of the medication delivered. Thus, the measurement of an acute
           bronchodilator response after delivering a long acting bronchodilator may not identify
           whether a medication has been effectively delivered to a patient.

        -  However, if a long acting bronchodilator has not been effectively delivered to the lung,
           then subsequent delivery of a short acting bronchodilator should produce a significant
           additional bronchodilator response. On the other hand, if a long acting bronchodilator
           has been effectively delivered to the lung, then subsequent delivery of a short acting
           bronchodilator should not produce any further significant bronchodilation.

        -  Based on this rationale, comparison of the acute bronchodilator response to a short
           acting bronchodilator after receiving a long acting should identify whether drug
           delivery is ineffective in a selected patient population, irrespective of baseline FEV1
           and of any partial response to the long acting bronchodilator. Comparison of the short
           acting bronchodilator measurement between patient groups with differing PIF thresholds
           should identify whether PIF has an impact of drug delivery of a long acting
           bronchodilator via a DPI.

        -  Open label design comparing the acute bronchodilator response after delivery of a long
           acting bronchodilator via Ellipta DPI in patients with normal, suboptimal and minimal
           PIF.
