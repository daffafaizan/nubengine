      performance of these prosthesis to surgical valve ones.

      The experience with the early generation of aortic valve prostheses revealed some important
      differences regarding the incidence of paravalvular leakage, need for pacemaker or valve
      thrombosis among them. Currently the new generations of valve prostheses such as Sapien 3
      balloon-expandable valve and Lotus, repositionable valve are the most frequently used
      devices. There are registry data about the clinical performance of these valve types but a
      randomized comparison is missing.
