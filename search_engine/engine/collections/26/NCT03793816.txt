      tonsillectomies are still performed very frequently. Post-surgical bleeding can potentially
      be life-threatening, and occur within 3 weeks after tonsillectomy. A broad survey in Great
      Britain revealed a postoperative hemorrhage rate in 33.921 patients between 1.5 and 5.4 %,
      varying on hospital size. Small collectives also showed rates up to 21.7%.

      Worldwide, different techniques are used. Generally, "cold" steel and "hot" techniques can be
      distinguished, although often current-carrying ("hot") and "cold" instruments are used
      alternately. Postoperative pain seems to be uninfluenced by technique, whereas postoperative
      hemorrhage rates seem to be higher in "hot" techniques.

      LigaSure® is a bipolar "current-carrying" device, which is able to seal vessels.
      Simultaneously tissue impedance is measured to control energy application. In this way only
      the required energy levels are applied. Therefore LigaSure® can also be referred as a
      "softened hot" technique.

      In 2005 Lachanas et al. compared the LigaSure®-technique with the "cold" steel technique in
      200 patients and found significantly less postoperative pain in favor of the
      LigaSure®-technique. Postoperative hemorrhage rates were not higher with LigaSure®. Based on
      the LigaSure®-scissors, Medtronic introduced a device specifically developed and licensed for
      tonsillectomies (BiZactTM).

      Aim of this study will be the evaluation of handling, surgical time, postoperative pain and
      postoperative hemorrhage rates in comparison to traditional techniques on the contralateral
      side. In one patient, two different techniques will be used. This side-controlled evaluation
      of surgical techniques in tonsillectomies has been proven successfully in previous studies.
