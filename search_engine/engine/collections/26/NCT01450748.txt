    
      This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50mg/ml) 20ml 3 times daily for the
      treatment of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) in Taiwan. Patients will be
      enrolled into study if they are at the age of 12 to 75 years old, have at least one symptom
      consistent with LPR and lasting for more than 4 weeks before study, with a total reflux
      symptom index (RSI)>10, with a total reflux finding score (RFS)>5, and have signed the
      informed consent form. Patients will be excluded if they are diagnosed as erosive
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)as evidenced by upper GI endoscopy, viral or bacterial
      laryngitis, or occupational exposures causing laryngitis, laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer,
      esophageal or gastric cancer, with history of neck radiation therapy, with history of
      esophageal or gastric surgery, with active pulmonary infection (pneumonia, tuberculosis) as
      evidenced by chest X-ray, with endotracheal tube intubation within 2 months before entering
      study, or taking any alginate preparations within 2 days; H2-blocker, prokinetic agent or
      antacid within 7 days; or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) within 14 days before screening. The
      primary efficacy endpoint is mean reduction in the total RSI from baseline to Week 8. The
      secondary efficacy endpoints are mean reduction in the total RSI from baseline to Day 2 and
      Week 4; mean reduction in the RFS from baseline to Week 4 and Week 8; mean change in the
      individual component of RSI from baseline to Day 2 , Week 4 and Week 8; mean change in the
      individual component of RFS from baseline to Week 4 and Week 8; and mean change in the total
      numbers of reflux episodes as measured by 24-hr ambulatory combined impedance-pH monitoring
      from baseline to day 2 and week 8. The safety endpoint is incidence of adverse events. The
      study hypothesis is that sodium alginate is superior over placebo in treating patients with
      LPR.
