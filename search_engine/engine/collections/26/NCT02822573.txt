    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 24 weeks of exposure to drug or
      placebo followed by a 12 week wash-out period. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria
      will be stratified by age (<50, 50-59, 60-69, â‰¥70) and randomized to donepezil or placebo
      with equal probability. A total of 276 patients will be enrolled (138 per arm). We expect an
      accrual rate of 7-10 participants per month based on our prior feasibility study. We expect
      the study to be complete within 40 months.

      Participants will be asked to take one 5mg tablet of donepezil or one tablet of matching
      placebo orally once a day for 6 weeks followed by two 5mg tablets (10mg total) of donepezil
      or two placebo tablets orally once a day for 18 weeks. After 24 weeks, participants will
      begin a 12 week wash-out period.

      Time points for performing study assessments. Participants will be administered the cognitive
      battery of tests and questionnaires at baseline, week 12, week 24 and week 36. In addition, a
      single vial of blood will be drawn at baseline for APOE genotyping and subsequent bioassays
      (pending supplemental funding).
