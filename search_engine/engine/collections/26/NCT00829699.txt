      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in 2000 indicated that mortality due
      to coronary artery disease is decreasing except in individuals with diabetes. Clearly the
      disordered metabolism, which includes abnormal metabolism of fats resulting in higher
      triglyceride and free fatty acid blood levels, occurring in diabetes predisposes these
      individuals to increased thrombotic events. Unless the underlying mechanisms responsible for
      these events can be identified, there will be an unprecedented number of diabetic patients
      suffering thrombotic episodes in the next 10 years.

      The specific aims of this study are to determine the effects of elevated free fatty acids and
      hyperglycemia (high glucose)on endothelial function and thrombolytic balance in patients with
      type 2 diabetes, and to determine the effects of increased insulin in this setting.
