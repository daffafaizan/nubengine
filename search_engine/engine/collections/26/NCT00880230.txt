      Cobalt-chromium (CoCr) is an alloy that has been used safely in the manufacture of surgical
      implants for use in contact with blood, soft tissue and bone for over 10 years. This study
      will evaluate the SCUBAâ„¢ peripheral balloon-expandable cobalt chromium tent system in iliac
      arteries.
