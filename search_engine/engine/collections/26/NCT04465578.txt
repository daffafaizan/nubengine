    
      A randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted in women over 18 years of age with
      stress urinary incontinence and indication for surgical treatment, who have not undergone
      previous surgical treatment. Postoperative follow-up will be 1 month when the incidence of
      urinary retention and the rate of cure after the procedure will be evaluated. The incidence
      of urinary retention in 1 month postoperatively will be evaluated in the two different
      techniques (post-voiding residue > 200ml or the need for intermittent bladder
      catheterization) and the cure rate for urinary incontinence (cough test and response "No" to
      the question 3 of the Urogenital Distress Inventory questionnaire).
