      complications in the experimental group that did not use prophylactic antibiotics compared to
      the control group using prophylactic antibiotics.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of surgical site infections within 30 days after
      surgery and the difference limit of the non-inferiority of the experimental group is assumed
      to be - 0.05 (5%). Assuming that the incidence of postoperative infectious complications in
      the control group is 5% and the incidence of infectious complications in the experimental
      group is assumed to be about 8%. It is assumed that the significant level is 5% and the power
      is at least 80%.

      According to the above method, a total of 260 patients (130 patients in each group) are
      needed when 117 patients are needed in each group and about 10% of drop rates and protocol
      violence are considered.
