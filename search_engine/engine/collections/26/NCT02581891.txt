      physicians aiming at maximizing outcomes by proactively treating the subject at each visit
      and by extending the treatment interval (if extension criteria are met), thus limiting
      visits, monitoring, and injections.

      To this day, there is limited evidence available addressing the question of what are useful
      intervals for treating and monitoring, how do they differ among subjects, and how are
      retreatment criteria applied to achieve long-term desirable outcomes in real-life practice.
      This study is designed to evaluate the optimal use, efficacy, and safety of the T&E regimen
      with intravitreal aflibercept in subjects with nAMD.
