    
      This protocol is a randomized phase II trial of maintenance chemotherapy versus consolidative
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus maintenance chemotherapy for patients with
      Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be treated with standard
      first-line chemotherapy. Patients who achieve a partial response or stable disease by imaging
      criteria with fewer than or equal to six sites of oligometastatic disease will be randomized
      to maintenance chemotherapy or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by
      maintenance chemotherapy at the medical oncologist's discretion). Choices of first line and
      maintenance chemotherapy will be determined by the medical oncologist based on clinical
      appropriateness.
