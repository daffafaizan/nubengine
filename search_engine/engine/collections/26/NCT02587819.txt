      10% Ointment topically applied twice daily for 28 consecutive days in male and female
      patients with BCC; and to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active
      pharmaceutical ingredient (total sheep Immunoglobulin G [IgG]) when BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10%
      Ointment is applied twice daily to BCC lesions. This was an open-label, single-arm,
      multicenter Phase 1 study that enrolled 21 BCC patients.
