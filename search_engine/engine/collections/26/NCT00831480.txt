      biomarker driven Phase II trial that will assess the activity of everolimus as first-line
      therapy for renal cell carcinoma. Following initial kidney tumor biopsy, everolimus is
      administered for 3-5 weeks before cytoreductive nephrectomy and everolimus is then resumed
      and continued until tumor progression or intolerable toxicities. Any correlation of tumor
      tissue biomarker changes from initial biopsy to nephrectomy specimen with long-term
      progression-free survival will be determined. This trial may enable the identification of
      factors predictive of significant benefit from everolimus administered as first-line therapy
      by employing the neoadjuvant therapy paradigm.
