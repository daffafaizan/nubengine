      I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination
      with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with
      gemcitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as judged by response rate and
      progression-free survival for this combination.

      III. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 given in combination with gemcitabine in
      an expanded cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      and 15 and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
