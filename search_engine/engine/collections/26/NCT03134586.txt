    
      This is a prospective, blinded, multicenter study of the diagnostic validity, inter-observer
      agreement, image quality and subjective experience of discomfort with PCCE, MREC and US in
      patients with suspected CD. Ileocolonoscopy serves as the diagnostic gold standard. Patients
      are recruited from 3 centers in the Region of Southern Denmark managing adult patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Each patient goes through a standardized work-up including
      medical history, physical examination, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin,
      ileocolonoscopy, PCCE, MREC and US. All examinations are reviewed and described in a
      standardized fashion. The radiologists and physicians describing PCCE, MREC, and US are
      blinded to the findings at ileocolonoscopy and the other imaging modalities.
