    
      Background: Systemic treatment with the 90Yttrium (90Y) labeled,
      tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA) modified somatostatin analog Tyr3-octreotide
      (TOC) was introduced in 1998 (Otte et al. Lancet 1998). [90Y-DOTA]-TOC is administered
      intravenously and binds to the somatostatin receptor subtype 2, located on the surface of the
      tumor cell, and exerts its cytotoxic effects by Î²-irradiation. The treatment has moderate
      acute hematologic and nephrologic toxicity and has developed into a promising therapeutic
      tool for tumors expressing its target receptor (Iten et al. Clin Cancer Res 2007, Iten et al.
      Cancer 2009).

      Study Aim: To explore the efficacy of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC and [177LuDOTA]-TOC therapy in advanced
      neuroendocrine cancer.

      Study Hypothesis: Response to DOTA-TOC is correlated with prolonged survival.

      Study Type: Clinical phase II, single-center, open-label trial

      Patients: 1500 patients
