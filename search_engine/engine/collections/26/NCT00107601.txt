      development of potentially lethal infectious, vascular and metabolic complications. We
      hypothesize that a control of glycemia by insulin will improve the vital outcome and the rate
      of complications in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients. This hypothesis is
      supported by the findings of a recent trial performed in one surgical intensive care unit,
      which demonstrated a significant improvement in vital outcome and in several indices of
      morbidity in patients randomized to a tight control of glycemia. However, these findings can
      hardly be extrapolated to other conditions, including different types of pathologies and
      management. The present prospective, randomized, controlled and multicentric study, will
      compare the effects of two regimens of insulin therapy, respectively titrated to achieve a
      blood sugar level between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/l (80 and 110 mg/dl, respectively) and between 7.8
      and 10.0 mmol/l (140 and 180 mg/dl, respectively) and will be powered to detect a 4% decrease
      in absolute intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Secondary outcome variables will include
      in-hospital and 28-day mortality, lengths of stays in ICU and in the hospital, length of ICU
      stay without life-support therapy, number and clinical signs of episodes of hypoglycemia,
      rates of infections and organ failures, number of red-cell transfusions.
