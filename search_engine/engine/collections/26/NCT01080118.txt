      anesthesiology will be studied. Firstly, a standard lecture will be provided in which the
      description and importance of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation will be explained. This
      will include descriptions of anatomy, relevant equipment and technique of tracheal
      intubation. Following the lecture , the students will be randomly allocated using sealed
      envelopes into two groups : a control group ( taught with a standard Macintosh Laryngoscope )
      and a study group ( taught with the Airtraq video laryngoscope).Each group will receive a
      demonstration and verbal instruction on how to perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation
      by their instructor.
