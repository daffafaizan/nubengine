      scheme, i.e. 69 Gy over 6 weeks, which might increase the loco-regional control. Besides, the
      co-registration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strengthens the precision of target
      delineation as well as higher possibility to spare adjacent normal brain tissue.

      In this protocol, the newly diagnosed, primary glioblastoma patients received SIB 69 Gy/30
      fractions to preoperative tumor bed and surgical cavity, while 60 Gy/30 fractions were
      covering preoperatively edematous area. To determine the status of surgical extent,
      postoperative CT scan and MRI was acquired within 72 hours and at 4th week after surgery.
      During the period of chemoradiation, acute neurotoxicity and hematological toxicity was
      assessed as well.
