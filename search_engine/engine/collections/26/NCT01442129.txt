      heart failure who are treated with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation may
      result in a renewable source of proliferating functional cardiomyocytes, as well as induce
      development of capillaries and larger size blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to
      endogenous myocardium and newly-implanted cardiomyocytes, and release factors capable of
      paracrine signaling. If safety is established and an efficacy signal is observed in this
      exploratory trial, then the investigators will design a follow-up trial (stage 2) based on an
      adaptive design. The next trial would randomize patients to active therapy at one of two
      doses (25 and 75 million MPCs) versus placebo, and based on a predetermined selection
      criterion drop randomization to one of the dose arms as results accrue. Should this
      exploratory trial demonstrate safety but no signal of efficacy, then the subsequent trial
      would be based on a single dose of 75 million MPCs versus placebo.
