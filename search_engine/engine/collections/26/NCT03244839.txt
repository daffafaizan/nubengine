      and post-operative care of morbidly obese patients. Outcome reporting in bariatric surgery
      mainly focuses on weight loss, improvement of co-morbidities and quality of life.
      Post-operative nutritional deficiencies are a complication of bariatric surgery, in
      particular after malabsorptive procedures. Deficiencies of protein, iron and vitamins B12 and
      D are frequently reported and may occur despite supplementation. Morbid obesity itself is
      associated with nutritional deficiencies as well, which become worsening after bariatric
      surgery. The occurrence of nutritional deficiencies has been reported in the literature but
      not in Taiwan. The goal of the current study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of
      nutritional deficiencies in diabetic patients underwent bariatric surgery and receiving
      standard supplementation in Taiwan
