      monotherapy with a nucleoside analog or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Use
      of combination therapy with two nucleoside drugs or convergent combination therapy with two
      nucleosides and a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor may minimize the evolution of these resistant
      HIV strains. Since toxicity is a major problem in patients with advanced disease who are
      receiving combination nucleoside therapy, alternating the two drugs may provide a way of
      retaining several benefits of combination therapy while minimizing the increased toxicity.

      Patients are randomized to receive either AZT/ddC, AZT/ddI, AZT alternating monthly with ddI,
      or AZT/ddI/nevirapine. Patients are evaluated at week 0 and every 4 weeks thereafter for 2
      years. Pharmacologic, virologic, and macroneurologic substudies will be conducted. Patients
      who are already enrolled on protocol ACTG 193 will be given the option of continuing on their
      originally assigned ACTG 193 therapy for an additional 6 months or undergoing
      re-randomization to one of the four treatment arms on ACTG 193A.
