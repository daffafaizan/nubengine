      Western countries. Due to increased detection of tumors by ultrasound (US) and computed
      tomography (CT), the number of incidentally diagnosed RCCs has increased. These tumors are
      usually smaller and of lower stage. Currently, partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered as the
      gold standard treatment modality for small renal masses. In this setting, robot-assisted and
      conventional laparoscopic approaches are gaining more consensus every day. However, until
      now, no superiority of one technique over the other has yet been demonstrated, especially on
      postoperative function recovery. This is a single center prospective randomized trial
      investigating the functional and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive (laparoscopic and
      robot-assisted) nephron sparing surgery. Patients will be assessed with renal scintigraphy
      and 24 hours creatinine clearance pre- and postoperatively. Furthermore, duration of the
      operation, resection and suturing times will be assessed. Renal function recovery is defined
      as primary endpoint; oncological outcome and positive surgical margin rate are defined as
      secondary measures. In addition, kidney volume variation will be calculated to describe the
      amount of healthy tissue preserved in both procedures.The aim of the study is to assess
      whether robot assisted partial nephrectomy in selective ischemia is superior to laparoscopic
      partial nephrectomy in global ischemia in terms of functional and oncological outcomes.
