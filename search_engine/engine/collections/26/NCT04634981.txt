      (Group G): will receive rapid sequence general anesthesia, and (Group S): will receive spinal
      anesthesia. After preoperative assessment and investigations by the attending
      anesthesiologist, the decision of the anesthetic approach will be decided by the attending

      establishing an IV access. On the operating table, vital signs will be monitored for all
      parturients throughout the surgery according to the standard departmental protocol.

      umbilical cord PH . in addition to maternal vital signs intra-operative then follow up any
