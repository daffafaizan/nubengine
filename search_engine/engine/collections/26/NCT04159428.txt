      has never been validated in French: that's why investigatosr want to test it on the French
      population, to determine its performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).
      Secondary, investigators study think that people that have high score on the hear loss
      screening survey, but a normal tonal audiometry have actually a hidden hearing loss. This
      corresponds to infraclinical cochlear lesions that we want to reveal thanks to a new
      audiometric test: an audiometry in a noisy ambiance.

      The study will take place in a research audiometric room in the department of ENT in
      Bordeaux. Patients will fill a medical survey the HHIE-S survey translated into French and
      perform a tonal audiometry test and after it a " speech in noise " audiometry test (VRB in
      French).

      The duration os study is one unique session of 45 minutes including patient information and
      consent.
