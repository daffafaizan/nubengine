      develop and finalize, preventive behaviors remain the most effective strategy thus far and
      may be needed until 2022 to control the pandemic. African Americans, who have 3-fold higher
      infection rate and 6-fold higher death rate compared to the white counterparts, are an
      especially vulnerable population to COVID-19. Immediately initiating a project that promotes
      and maximizes adherence to preventative behaviors is vital to addressing the ongoing COVID-19
      pandemic. The investigators propose a prospective single arm and longitudinal study to
      examine the effectiveness of SM-EMA in promoting adherence to COVID-19 preventative
      behaviors. The intervention will include two daily pop-up messages during Week 1 (one in the
      morning and one in the afternoon), one daily pop-message in Week 2, and two pop-up messages a
      week in Weeks 3 and 4. The duration for the intervention will be four weeks. The study
      outcomes will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention, T1), post-(completion of the
      intervention, T2, primary endpoint), and monthly follow-up for three months (T3-T5). The
      total study duration will be four months.
