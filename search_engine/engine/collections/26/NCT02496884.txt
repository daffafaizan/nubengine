      FM and moderate to severe renal dysfunction during 13 weeks of renally-adjusted dosing of
      DS-5565 compared to placebo, followed by a short-term (4-week) safety follow-up.

      This trial is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice,
      according to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite
      Guidelines. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is created to further protect
      the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects who participate in this study by monitoring
      their progress and results. The independent DSMB is composed of qualified scientists who are
      not investigators in the study and not otherwise directly associated with the sponsor.

      Additional protection is provided by special monitoring of liver enzyme elevations and liver
      dysfunction performed by a Hepatic Adjudication Committee (HAC), comprised of three qualified
      hepatologists who are not investigators in the study and not otherwise directly associated
      with the sponsor. The HAC completes assessments on an ongoing basis. Adjudication of hepatic
      events is based on evaluation of electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and source documents,
      as available, including but not limited to hospital discharge summaries, diagnostic imaging,
      histopathology, consultation, and laboratory reports.
