      receptors. Traditionally, estrogen receptors have been recognized as transcription factors
      regulating the expression of target genes, however, numerous studies have revealed rapid
      actions of estrogen in different systems, so-called 'extranuclear actions'. At this level,
      estrogen triggers rapid vasodilatation, exerts anti-inflammatory effects, regulates vascular
      cell growth and migration, and confers protection to cardiomyocytes. Our aims are to
      investigate estrogen´s chronic effects on microcirculation.

      The study will assess the potential benefits of estrogens on: chronic low-grade inflammation,
      metabolic profile, microcirculation and blood rheology. Postmenopausal obese women will be
      randomly submitted to estrogen (transdermal 17-β-estradiol 1mg/day) or placebo therapy during
      three months in a double-blind fashion. At baseline and after intervention, nailfold
      videocapillaroscopy, laser-Doppler flowmetry and venous occlusion plethysmography,
      inflammatory biomarkers, hormonal status, metabolic profile, plasma viscosity and
      anthropometrical measures will be assessed in all subjects.
