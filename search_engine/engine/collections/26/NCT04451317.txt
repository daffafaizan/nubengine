      integrated into a care procedure in accordance with the recommendations to accompany the
      patients with chronic pathology and athletes for the resumption of PSA after hypothetical
      deconditioning. Support will be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the
      HCSP and the Ministry of Sports. The objective of this study is to evaluate the data of this
      recommended medical follow-up.

      The questionnaires used for the subjects' self-evaluation are all validated in French
      language, used in the context of medical monitoring, and used in clinical research:
      assessment of physical activity levels by the questionnaire of RICCI and GAGNON (RG),
      evaluation of the level of Anxiety and Depression by the Hospital and Anxiety Scale
      Depression (AHH), assessment of sleep quality by the score of LEEDS.

      Medical questionnaires to assess the evolutionary stage of chronic pathologies (MS,
      Parkinson's disease and Fibromyalgia) will be informed by the investigating physician during
      the interview telephone with the patient.
