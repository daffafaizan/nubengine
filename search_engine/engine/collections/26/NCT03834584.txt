    
      The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-636 and characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when
      given by mouth to subjects with advanced lymphoma that is refractory to standard treatment.
      During the dose escalation part of the study successive cohorts of subjects will be treated
      with increasing doses of AG-636 in order to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
      Subsequently, in the dose expansion part of the study, additional subjects will be treated at
      the MTD in order to confirm that dose's safety, tolerability, PK and PD, and to provide an
      opportunity to detect anti-lymphoma activity. The dose expansion part of the study will
      support the selection of a dose for future clinical studies (a recommended Phase 2 dose
      [RP2D]).
