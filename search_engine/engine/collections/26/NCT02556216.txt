      clinical parameters are non-specific, unproven for the assessment of the bone metabolism and
      do not reflect the complexity and diversity of the underlying bone pathology.

      In this study bone histology parameters including results of tetracycline labeling will be
      compared to non-invasive parameters of bone metabolism (e.g. sclerostin, calciprotein
      particles) and bone structure obtained by imaging (e.g. bone density).

      The aim of the study is to establish a reliable decision model (diagnostic tool) with these
      non-invasive parameters that can be used to guide the individual therapy. The decision model
      will be based on single calculations of the area under the curve for each parameter,
      including determination of the optimal cutpoint, sensitivity and specificity. These results
      will be integrated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The resulting model will
      enable to calculate the individual probability of the underlying bone diagnosis as a single
      value (without a specific dimension).
