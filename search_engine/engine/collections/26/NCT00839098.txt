      standard of care- verbal instruction 2) verbal and written instruction and 3) same as #2 with
      addition of virtual coach. This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase I data will be
      collected for 8 weeks, during the time period that the subject is awaiting for delivery of
      their personal electric powered wheelchair (EPW) with powered seat functions. Phase II data
      will be collected for a total of 4 weeks, after the subject receives their personal
      wheelchair. During Phase I, Visit I, subjects will be fitted for a study EPW with powered
      seat functions. All subjects will be provided with the "standard of care" training on driving
      of the wheelchair and usage of the power seating functions. Subjects will be instructed to go
      about their daily activities as they normally would, while the instrumented wheelchair will
      track their usage of the wheelchair and seating habits. Phase I, Visit II-IV, subjects will
      be randomized into one of three study groups: Control Group; Instruction Group; and
      Instruction & Virtual Coach Group. Subjects assigned to the Control Group will receive
      'standard of care.' Subjects assigned to the Intervention Group will receive the "standard of
      care" and additional written instructional materials and feedback regarding activity and
      wheelchair usage. Subjects assigned to the Instruction & Virtual Coach Group will receive the
      same training and instructional materials as the Intervention Group. This group will also be
      instructed in use of the virtual coach system, which will be active during the in-home usage
      periods to provide personalized feedback. Phase II will involve mounting a wheelchair and
      seat function usage datalogger to the subject's personal wheelchair over a period of 4 weeks.
