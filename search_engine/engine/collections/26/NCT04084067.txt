      require resection either for therapeutic or diagnostic intent will be included.

      Indocyanine Green (ICG) is an FDA-approved drug. Prior to surgery, patients will receive a
      single dose of ICG intravenously.

      During surgery, after the surgeon identifies the mass through visual (seen with the naked
      eye) and or tactile methods (palpated), the patient will have his/her tumor field imaged by
      Iridium system optimized for detection of ICG (Visionsense Corp, Philadelphia, PA). The
      entire procedure will be photo- documented and recorded.

      The Visionsense system records images in real time, calculates percentages, and captures the
      data. At least three different areas of the tumor will be measured. If the tumor cannot be
      identified by visual inspection or palpation, NIR-imaging will be used in an attempt to
      locate the lesion. The surrounding area will be inspected and measured to screen for
      additional sites of metastatic disease. After tumor resection, residual fluorescence in the
      surgical resection bed will be measured.

      Direct subject participation in the trial will last for the period of time from injection of
      the ICG the day before surgery and until 24 hours post-surgery.
