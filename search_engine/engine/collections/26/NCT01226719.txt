      panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with KRAS mutant
      colorectal cancer. For patients with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer, improvement in
      response rates with newer chemotherapy regimens has led to a larger percentage of patients
      eligible for surgical resection. Treatment with FOLFOXIRI improves response rates when
      compared to FOLFIRI. Similarly, the addition of an EGFR inhibitor improves the response rate
      of FOLFIRI in patients with wild-type KRAS. In this trial, we will attempt to maximize the
      response rate and the surgical resection rate by using FOLFOXIRI and panitumumab.
