      and can be treated using both complementary and pharmacological strategies. However, children
      are often undertreated for pain which results in not only short term problems, but long term
      consequences such as trauma and stress-induced disorders; health care avoidance as adults;
      increased pain sensitivity; and decreased response to future analgesia. There have been
      variable efforts made to improve the ED management of pain in children, but adolescents are
      frequently overlooked. A review of the literature revealed that art therapy for pain
      management in adolescents is understudied. The majority of studies describe the effects of
      art therapy on the emotional well-being in surgical and oncology populations in adults and
      children. The studies that did evaluate the effectiveness of art therapy for pain management
      in children focused primarily on surgical and medical oncology populations with children aged
      2-14 years. Of these studies, none evaluated adolescents in the ED, which is a high volume
      and high stress environment that confers a distinct experience for patients compared to other
      medical settings. Evaluation of art therapy interventions using quantitative self-report
      measures with strong validity in children and further delineation of the patient experience
      related to art therapy is necessary. Advanced evaluation of aforementioned interventions
      would expand the evidence base needed to describe effectiveness of these interventions and
      support greater implementation and dissemination. These are the gaps in knowledge that the
      investigators aim to fill with the proposed study.
