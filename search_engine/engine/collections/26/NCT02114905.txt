    
      CBIT training materials designed by the study team have been used to train occupational
      therapists (OTs) at WC/NYPH and UAB to deliver CBIT, and data has been collected to measure
      training acceptability.

      OTs will be supervised in the practice of CBIT with youth in the New York City and Birmingham
      areas. Pre- and post-treatment assessment measures will be collected from 16 families (8 from
      each site) to evaluate intervention acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity. Patient and
      parent satisfaction of CBIT-OT will also be documented. The investigators will look within
      subjects to ascertain change in reported tic severity.

      This study is designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of treatment,
      feasibility of research design, as well as demonstrate the ability to disseminate the study
      protocol to a new care discipline in methodologically rigorous fashion across multiple sites.
