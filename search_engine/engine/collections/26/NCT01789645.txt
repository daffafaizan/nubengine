      review concluded that surgical treatment relieves symptoms significantly better than
      splinting but further research is needed. A systematic review focused on physical therapy for
      the management of CTS included 6 studies and found weak to strong effect of neural gliding
      exercises. Recent studies have revealed complex nociceptive mechanisms involved in CTS which
      should be carefully considered during the management of these patients. Proper physical
      therapy interventions can modulate nociceptive processes found in CTS. We will perform a
      randomized clinical trial nested within a prospective cohort as our study design to determine
      if proper physical therapy approach targeted to modulate sensitization processes is equally
      effective than surgical intervention for improving pain and function in patients with carpal
      tunnel syndrome.
