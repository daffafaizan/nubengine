    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose finding study
      of VERU-944 to treat hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms) in men with advanced prostate cancer on
      ADT. The study will have four arms with 30 subjects per arm. The subjects participating in
      the study will have advanced prostate cancer and will be undergoing androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) therapy (agonist or
      antagonist) for at least the three months prior to randomization and be experiencing regular
      moderate to severe hot flashes while on ADT. Subjects will all continue to receive ADT and
      will be randomized to receive, for the first four days, a loading dose followed by daily
      doses of placebo or VERU-944 (10 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg) orally for a total period of 12 weeks.
