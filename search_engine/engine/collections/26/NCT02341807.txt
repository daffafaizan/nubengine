      of AAV2-hCHM, in an inter-subject group dose escalation in individuals with choroideremia,
      based on a comprehensive clinical monitoring plan. The secondary objectives are to define the
      dose of AAV2-hCHM required to achieve stable, or improved, visual function/functional vision
      and to assess development of immune responses to AAV2 and REP-1.
