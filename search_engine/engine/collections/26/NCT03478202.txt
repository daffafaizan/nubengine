    
      Golo For Life (GFL) is a weight management program that helps people who are overweight or
      obese limit and portion their consumption of conventional foods and make healthier choices in
      their diets. GFL includes a point-based system from the four macronutrient food groups that
      is based on the individual's activity level and body mass. Additionally, GFL includes
      common-sense instructions, motivation and tips supporting compliance and requires a minimum
      of 15 minutes of exercise per day. GFL also includes a dietary supplement containing zinc and
      chromium, essential nutrients that support regulation of blood sugar.

      In case studies from clinician and wellness program use, GFL has shown the ability to reduce
      body weight in both healthy and diabetic people who are overweight or obese. Secondary
      endpoints including measures of blood sugar have been observed to decrease as a result of the
      GFL program.

      While GFL has been developed and used in private clinical practice in both healthy overweight
      and type 2 diabetic people, more systematic research is needed to determine to what extent it
      is able to support healthy weight loss. This open-label pilot study is intended to observe
      the effects of the program in a representative group of subjects with stable type 2 diabetes
      at one outpatient medical practice.

      The objective of this open-label pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the commercially
      available GOLO for Life (GFL) weight management program on body weight in a type 2 diabetic
      patient population after approximately 3 months.
