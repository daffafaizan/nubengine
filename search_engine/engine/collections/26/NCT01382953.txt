      may or may not be related to cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Common problems that may lead to
      the use of cardiac rhythm monitors are syncope (loss of consciousness), near-syncope (near
      loss of consciousness), palpitations (the sensation of an abnormal heart beat), or monitoring
      of known cardiac rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this research is to
      confirm the clinical value of a much easier-to-use cardiac rhythm monitoring system,
      hereafter referred to as the Investigational Monitoring System. Prior to discussing the
      investigational monitoring system, we will review standard electrocardiographic monitoring
      tools used to evaluate the heart's rhythm.

      Excluding a routine 12 lead electrocardiogram that takes a snapshot view of the hearts
      electrical signal, the most common tool for monitoring the heart rhythm is a Holter monitor.
      A Holter monitor is also called an ambulatory cardiac monitor. A Holter monitor records every
      heartbeat for 24 hours. It requires wearing multiple electrodes and carrying a recording
      system that is usually worn on a belt or on a holster strap. Such systems are relatively
      bulky and difficult to conceal in public venues. Also, their electrodes often disconnect,
      especially during sleep when the patient is unaware of electrode detachments that can occur
      when turning or during exercise. Moreover, they can't be worn during showering. These
      shortcomings notwithstanding, standard Holters remain the standard of care.
