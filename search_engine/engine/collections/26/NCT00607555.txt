      treatment. The exact cause of apnea is unknown, and may be related to a combination of brain,
      gut, and lung immaturity.

      Research in premature babies suggests that feeding may affect lung functions, but such
      effects may be lessened if feeds are given at a slower rate. Further research showed that the
      diaphragm, an important breathing muscle, may be fatigued by a full stomach. We speculate
      that, in premature babies, feeding might tire the diaphragm, thus impairing lung function and
      possibly causing apnea.

      We plan to study 10 stable premature babies less than 23 weeks and 1.25 kilograms at birth.
      By inserting a special feeding tube with sensors into the stomach, we can measure the
      electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi). By analysing EAdi before and after feeding, we
      want to directly measure how feeding might affect lung functions. We also want to compare
      feeding at the usual rate (5-15 minutes) versus a slower rate (90 minutes) to see how their
      effects on lung functions might differ.

      This important study will help us determine the most appropriate treatment for premature
      babies with apnea related to feeding.
