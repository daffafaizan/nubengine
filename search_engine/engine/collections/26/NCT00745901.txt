    
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study in healthy sexually
      active females to evaluate cycle control with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol versus
      drospireneone/ethinyl estradiol. The Open-Label Treatment Phase will last for three 28-day
      cycles. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion according to a
      predetermined randomization schedule. Patients will be seen for a baseline visit (Visit 1) up
      to 35 days prior to dosing to obtain informed consent, have a physical examination including
      a breast exam, height and weight, vital signs, a Chlamydia test and a urine pregnancy test
      performed, and to give their medical history. Patients will be instructed to report bleeding
      data using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) based diary on a daily basis. Patients
      will be instructed to continue taking 1 pill each day for 3 cycles, record this information
      daily in the IVRS and to contact the study site if they have any questions or adverse events
      they would like to discuss. The final study visit (Visit 2) will occur on Day 8 after
      completing 3 cycles of study medication. Patients will be weighed, have vital signs
      performed, report any adverse events and or changes in concomitant medications, and complete
      the satisfaction questionnaire at the final visit. Safety will be assessed by physical
      examinations, adverse events, body weight and vital signs. Patients randomized to
      drospireneone/ethinyl estradiol and taking any medication that could increase serum potassium
      levels (as outlined in the Package Insert) will also have their potassium level checked
      during their first cycle of treatment (Days 15 to 28 of treatment). Three 28-day cycles of
      either norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol or drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol.
