      control group. The study duration for each patient included in the trial is 6 months.
      Patients showing a decreased NYHA score by at least one class and an absence of major
      cardiovascular event during the period will be considered as "good responders". The
      otherswill be considered as "no responders".

      Based on this composite clinical score, the percentage of good responders in each group at 6
      months is the primary endpoint of the study.

      Main secondary endpoints :

        -  Evaluation of the left ventricular function

        -  Exercice capacity

        -  Serious adverse events'frequency

        -  Quality of life (SF36)

        -  Diagnostic and prognostic value of the "Brain Natriuretic Peptide"(NT pro BNP)evolution.
