      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of using [123-I] ADAM Serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as
      a putative biomarker to visualize the mechanism of effects of acupuncture for hot flashes
      involving serotonin.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture twice weekly for 2 weeks and then once weekly for 6
      weeks. Patients undergo single photon emission computed tomography imaging with iodine 123-I
      ADAM before and after completion of acupuncture.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
