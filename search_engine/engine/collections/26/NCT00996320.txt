      Providence St. Vincent Medical Center. Each intern will complete at least one traditional
      schedule and one intervention schedule. The traditional schedule consists of an 80-hour work
      week with overnight call every third night. The longest shift on the traditional schedule is
      30 hours. The intervention schedule consists of a 60-hour work week which eliminates
      overnight call by assigning a variety of shifts ranging from 8 to 16 hours in length.
