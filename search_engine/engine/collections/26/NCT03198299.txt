      the study group (insoles group) and the control group (without insoles group).

      All participants in the insoles group were evaluated at baseline, that was before the
      customized arch-support insoles were prescribed. All the evaluations, including functional
      performance, physical function, and quality of life, were re-evaluated up to 12 weeks after
      the insoles wearing in the study group (insoles group).
