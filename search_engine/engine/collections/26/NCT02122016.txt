      Breathing Trials (SBT) with pressure support ventilation after a daily weaning screen [1].
      Recently there has been an increased interest in automatic weaning trials, which consists of
      closed-loop ventilation, using ETCO2 monitoring during SBT [1, 2]. So far, there has been no
      clinical evidence to compare automatic weaning trials with those of SBT.

      Objective: To compare MV weaning times between an Automatic Weaning Ventilation System
      (SmartCare/PS) and SBT groups.

      Methods: A randomized, controlled study performed at a general ICU. Adult patients were
      enrolled who were ventilated for more than 24 hours. Tracheostomies patients, those with
      neurological conditions, and a Glasgow coma scales lower than 10 were excluded. Patients were
      randomized to either the control or Smart Care group. All patients were ventilated with a
      Drager Evita XL (Drager Medical, Lubeck, Germany) ventilator with SmartCare/PS software
      version 1.1 available for use immediately prior to randomization. The Control group consisted
      of a daily weaning screen and SBT with pressure support ventilation. If patients tolerated
      SBT, they were extubated. Smart Care group patients were also submitted to a daily weaning
      screen, after which they were ventilated with the SmartCare/PS mode. MV and weaning time,
      maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), vital capacity (VC),
      respiratory frequency to tidal volume ration (f/Vt), use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
      post extubation, and re-intubation rate we evaluated.
