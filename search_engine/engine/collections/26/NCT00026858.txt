      irradiation. Techniques for administering that treatment, including patient positioning, lung
      and soft tissue compensation, dose rate, total dose and fractionation differ between
      institutions. These differences are optimized at each institution to limit toxicity and
      maximize therapeutic outcome.

      Technically complex procedures such as total body radiation are subject to equipment
      failures. Such failures mid-treatment could be catastrophic to the patient, since therapy
      must be timely and compatible therapy may not be available elsewhere in the community. The
      purpose of this protocol is to provide backup between George Washington University Medical
      Center and the Radiation Oncology Branch of the NCI to allow for orderly, safe, and
      compatible therapies in the event of equipment failure; or replacement of a linear
      accelerator or any other malfunctioning equipment necessary to deliver TBI; or any emergent
      situation.
