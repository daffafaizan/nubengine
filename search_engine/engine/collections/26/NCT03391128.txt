      heart. The aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) is an extension peptide
      of type III procollagen, which is cleaved off stoichiometrically during conversion from type
      III procollagen to type III collagen and liberated to serum. Elevated serum concentrations of
      PIIINP are considered a marker of higher collagen turnover and tissue fibrosis including the
      heart and vascular system. In this study, the investigators prospectively examined whether
      serum levels of PIIINP could be a biomarker for predicting cardiovascular events in
      hemodialysis patients.
