      disease (CVD) which may be related to this state of chronic inflammation. HIV infected
      individuals are at up to four times higher risk of suffering a heart attack (also know as
      acute coronary syndrome).

      The medicine rosuvastatin, commonly used to treat high cholesterol, has been shown to reduce
      inflammation in arteries in the general population and also in patients with high risk for
      heart problems.

      72 subjects with HIV infection will be enrolled and divided into 2 groups of 36.

      Group 1: Treatment Group: Participants will receive a low dose of rosuvastatin, 10mg, for 6
      months in addition to their current medical therapy.

      Group 2: Control Group: Participants will not receive rosuvastatin for 6 months and will
      continue with their current medical therapy.

      Participants in both groups will undergo blood tests, Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography
      (MCE) scan and a Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography PET/CT scan using a
      radioactive tracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET), monocyte and serum cytokine studies
      at baseline and 6 months.

      10 subjects without HIV will also be enrolled to undergo monocyte and serum cytokine blood
      tests only, for comparison.
