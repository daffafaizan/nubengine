    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of
      vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with CCR5-tropic virus only and who have
      documented resistance to at least 2 of the 3 antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI or PI)
      or at least 6 months experience with at

      least 2 of the following: one NRTI, one NNRTI, or two PIs (excluding low-dose ritonavir)and
      failed at least one standard triple-drug regimen. The study will compare the virologic
      benefit of adding vicriviroc to an optimized background regimen to a control group receiving
      placebo plus the new optimized background therapy. The optimized background regimen will be
      chosen by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility tests performed at
      Screening, history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the patient, and drug toxicity. OBT
      must include a PI boosted by ritonavir (>=100 mg of ritonavir), and at least 2 active drugs
      (ie, to which HIV isolate is fully susceptible). Primary efficacy analysis will be conducted
      when all subjects have completed 48 weeks of treatment. An interim analysis will be performed
      when all subjects have completed 24 weeks of treatment. After completing Week 48 of the
      study, subjects will be offered open-label vicriviroc 30 mg QD, if appropriate, until the
      drug is commercially available or until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of
      vicriviroc. Additionally, subjects who discontinued early from the study prior to Week 48 may
      be eligible for the open-label segment of the study.
