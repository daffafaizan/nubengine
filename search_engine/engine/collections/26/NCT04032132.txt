      periodontitis with 24 intrabony defects. Patients were divided into two groups; group I was
      subjected to open flap debridement only. Group II was subjected to curcumin paste
      (2%curcumin)in conjunction with open flap debridement Clinical parameters including plaque
      index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were recorded
      pre-surgical. Moreover, radiographic examination was performed by cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) just before the surgery . Vertical bone defects were exposed by full
      thickness mucoperiosteal flap following intrasulcular incision and thorough debridement was
      performed. Group II received local application of curcumin paste.The same initial clinical
      parameters were recorded three and six months postoperatively. Radiographic measurements were
      recorded six months post surgically.
