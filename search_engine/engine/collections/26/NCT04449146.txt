    
      This is a mono-center trial. Patients in the process of pre-operative care of a reverse
      shoulder arthroplasty (CT Scan already available as part of the care course in supine
      position) will be offered the study. A localizer ultrasound will be performed during surgical
      consultation or the day before the surgery in standing position (duration: 1/2 day). This
      consultation takes place during the course of the surgical consultation or when the patient
      is admitted the day before his surgical procedure.
