    
      The purpose of the present study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess
      the effects of a commercially available weight loss program (WW; formerly Weight Watchers) on
      neural response to food cues and memory tasks, as well as on structural brain morphology.
      Participants with obesity will be randomized to either 16 weeks of an in-person, group-based
      WW program (n=30) or a wait-list control (WLC; n=30). Both groups will have structural and
      blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at
      baseline and after the 16-week intervention. Participants will complete the following fMRI
      tasks: 1) structural scan; 2) food cue task to measure reactivity to high and low-calorie
      food images and 3) N-back task to measure working memory (i.e., the ability to temporarily
      hold information available for processing). In addition, participants will complete
      self-report and behavioral measures of eating behaviors, appetite, physical activity, mood,
      quality of life, attention and memory at baseline, and weeks 8 and 16.
