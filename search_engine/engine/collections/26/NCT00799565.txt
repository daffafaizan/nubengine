      (myxomatous) disease or the fibroelastic degenerescence (thin and redundant leaflets).

      MVP adult patients (> 18 year-old) will be included if they present the following 1) or 2)
      criteria :

        1. 2D-echocardiographic mitral leaflet prolapse on the parasternal long-axis view > 2 mm
           AND leaflet thickness > 4 mm or mitral regurgitation > 2 + (using color Doppler)

        2. Previous surgery for pure severe mitral regurgitation due to MVP with Barlow disease or
           fibroelastic degenerescence (with operative report available)

      Patients will be excluded in case of associated heart disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
      rheumatismal disease…) or syndromic disease (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos…).

      Around 30 (cardiology, cardiovascular surgery) french centers will participate to this study.
      An e-CRF will be used to collect clinical data. A genetic core lab will collect the DNA
      samples. An echocardiographic core lab will collect and read all the echo recordings.

      DNA analysis will be compared between the patient group and spouses of the patients used as
      controls. In case of inadequacies concerning group size or age, available genotyped cohorts
      will be used.
