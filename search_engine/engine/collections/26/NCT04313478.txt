      postural patterns while reaching a toy, fewer movement reactions, trunk rotation, head
      control, and muscle tone than term infants. To distinguish between the infant with typical
      motor development and the one with atypical / abnormal motor development and to follow up the
      level of their trunk controls is important to identify of the motor development delay in the
      early stage of life.

      This cross-sectional study included 42 preterm infants and 43 term infants at between 3 and 9
      months of age. We investigated the association between the gross motor function and the
      segmental trunk controls of the preterm infants at the 3-9 months of age compared to term
      infants.
