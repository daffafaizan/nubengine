      designed to prevent GVHD.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive rATG through a
      needle in your vein over 3-4 hours on each of the 4 days before the stem cell transplant.

      Beginning 2 days before the transplant, you will take sirolimus by mouth once per day. You
      will continue to receive sirolimus until 90 days after the transplant. Beginning on Day 60,
      you will start taking increasingly lower doses of the study drug. This is done so you can
      taper down slowly, and be off of the drug on Day 90.

      Beginning on the day of the transplant, you will take MMF by mouth 2 times a day. You will
      continue to take MMF until 27 days after the transplant.

      Every week (for the first 90-100 days after the transplant) you will have study visits. At
      this visit, you will have a physical exam. Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      You will remain on study for up to 90 days after transplantation. You will be taken off study
      if intolerable side effects occur.

      Starting on Day 90 after the transplant, you will continue to follow up with your transplant
      doctor at least every 3 months through 1 year after the transplant. During these visits you
      will have physical exams. Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Your
      doctor may request additional testing.

      This is an investigational study. RATG, sirolimus, and MMF are all FDA approved for their use
      in the transplantation of solid organs (like kidney and liver). All 3 drugs are commercially
      available. This particular combination and dose schedule is considered investigational. Up to
      30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.
