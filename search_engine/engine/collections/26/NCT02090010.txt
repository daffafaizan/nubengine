      unintended arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, malposition of catheter etc,. We
      assume that using modified Seldinger technique (MST), guiding sheath is easily slid over the
      needle, providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively.

      We aimed to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique(MST) on success
      rate and complications during subclavian central venous catheterization in this prospective,
      randomized , controlled trials.
