    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study that will enroll consecutive
      patients with a confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cancer and who consent to a blood draw, a tissue sample analysis, and follow up
      for collection of data. 900 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients will be enrolled and
      evaluated for Breast Cancer Susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline and somatic
      mutations (BRCAm). Approximately 170 BRCAm positive patients and 170 negative patients will
      be followed in the Follow-up Period. This study aims to answer very important questions
      regarding the prevalence of gBRCAm and sBRCAm in a population of newly diagnosed ovarian
      cancer patients, and the relationship of these mutations to patient treatment and clinical
      outcomes. These answers may be extremely helpful in the counseling and treatment of genetic
      risk in these populations and may aid in making treatment decisions in the future.
