    
      Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer will be randomised 1:1 to
      either control group (standard of care) or intervention group (CTC-guided treatment). All
      patients will commence first line chemotherapy with docetaxel three-weekly and will receive a
      minimum of 3 cycles of treatment before any recommendation to discontinue first-line
      docetaxel.

        -  Control Group (standard of care): patients will receive first line docetaxel until
           disease progression according to treating clinician or completion of 10 cycles. Patients
           and treating clinicians will not be disclosed to the results of CTC determinations.

        -  Intervention Group (CTC guided treatment): patients will receive first line docetaxel
           until progression by CTC, and/or disease progression according to treating clinician or
           completion of 10 cycles. CTC results will be available to the treating clinician to
           guide decision-making. A progressing CTC count on Day 1 will require confirmation with a
           second CTC count performed on Day 15 (-/+ 5 days) of that cycle. If a patient is found
           to have two successive CTC determinations showing progression by CTCs, the clinician
           will receive a recommendation to discontinue docetaxel on the following cycle.

      The reasons of the treating clinician to discontinue docetaxel will be reported in both
      groups. Patients who discontinue first line docetaxel according to the criteria for each
      group will be switched to second line chemotherapy with cabazitaxel. After progression on
      cabazitaxel or completion of 10 cycles, patients will be followed up for survival every three
      months until end of study.
