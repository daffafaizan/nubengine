      depression. Attentional bias modification training (ABMT), an experimental paradigm that uses
      training to induce adaptive attentional bias, was developed to test the causal model and this
      has therapeutic implications in depression.To test the effect of ABMT on treatment of
      depressive symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, placebo and blank controlled trial is
      conducted in college students who are experiencing mild-to-severe symptoms of depression.
