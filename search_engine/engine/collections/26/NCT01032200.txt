      Primary

        -  To estimate study accrual, adherence, retention, and participation of patients with
           primary brain tumors undergoing partial- or whole-brain radiotherapy who are randomized
           to receive armodafinil or placebo.

        -  To estimate the variability of fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive function in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain a preliminary estimate of the effect of armodafinil on fatigue as measured by
           the fatigue subscale of the FACIT-F and the Brief Fatigue Inventory.

        -  To estimate the rates of toxicity and adverse events associated with armodafinil.

        -  To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of armodafinil on sleepiness as measured
           by the Epworth Sleep Scale; overall quality of life and brain-specific quality of life
           as measured by the FACT-G with the brain subscale; and cognitive function as measured by
           a comprehensive Wake Forest Cognitive Function Battery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to therapy
      (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and Karnofsky performance status
      (60-80% vs 90-100%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral armodafinil once daily beginning no later than the fifth
           fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily beginning no later than the fifth
           fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires assessing fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive
      function at baseline and periodically during study.
