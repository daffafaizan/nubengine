      (BCI) systems hold the potential for facilitating recovery in the chronic phase after stroke
      by synchronizing central or brain activity with peripheral movements and thereby harnessing
      brain plasticity.

      The specific aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: To investigate the efficacy of active FES vs. passive FES, as measured by changes in
      behavioral measures. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in motor function will
      be significantly greater using the active FES therapy than the passive FES therapy.

      Aim 2: To investigate the relationship between brain functional activation patterns and
      behavior changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators
      hypothesize that changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain fMRI and EEG measures)
      will show greater adaptive brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate
      with improved outcomes) than that induced by the passive FES.

      Aim 3: To investigate the relationship between brain white matter integrity and behavior
      changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators hypothesize that
      changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain DTI measures) will show greater adaptive
      brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate with improved outcomes) than
      that induced by the passive FES.
