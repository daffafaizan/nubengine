      discounting, which is a decrease in the subjective value of a good as a function of the
      amount of and delay to reward. The ability to decide between immediate versus future rewards
      depends on self-control and consideration of the future. We can reconceptualize suicide as
      intertemporal discounting with an interaction between cognition and mood. Someone
      contemplating suicide weighs the time value of costs and benefits with shifting negative and
      positive valence systems. To the best of our knowledge, no one has assessed the interaction
      between mood symptoms, anxiety, and their impact on the temporal discounting paradigm in
      bipolar patients. If we better understood the difference between anxious, suicidal and
      non-anxious, suicidal bipolar patients, we could design more effective interventions to
      prevent this tragic outcome. We propose a novel paradigm to explore the link between bipolar
      disorder, anxiety, and suicide. If we conceptualize suicidal behavior and death by suicide as
      decisions, then it makes sense to examine key aspects of decision making in these patients.
      In particular, we can examine how mood, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and behaviors arise
      from patterns of decision making, along with neural correlates of decision-making, as
      assessed with fMRI.
