      receptor) to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenesis effect of apatinib has been
      viewed in preclinical tests (see protocol). This phase I clinical study is going to evaluate
      its toxicity and to find an appropriate dose level to be used in a phase II study in heavily
      treated solid tumor patients.
