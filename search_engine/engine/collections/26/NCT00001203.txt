      subcutaneously on a regular basis, can indefinitely prevent the cardiac, endocrine and
      hepatic complications of transfusional hemochromatosis; and 2) to determine whether cardiac
      disease can be reversed by intensive intravenous treatment in patients who already have
      objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. The clinical manifestations and course of patients
      who require regular blood transfusions is well established. Those with congenital anemias who
      require transfusions from birth develop cardiac disease in their teens and their mean of
      survival is only 17 years. Adults with acquired anemias begin to exhibit cardiac
      manifestations of iron deposition after 100-200 units of packed red cells. Deferoxamine, when
      given by the subcutaneous route, has been shown to reduce substantially the total iron burden
      in thalassemic patients. Our results indicate that cardiac complications are delayed or
      prevented. We plan to continue to follow our cohort of patients on optimal medical management
      to determine if chelation alters disease outcome. Patients with heavy iron burdens who
      already manifest cardiac disease will be chelated intensely to determine whether reducing the
      iron burden is associated with reversal of cardiac complications.
