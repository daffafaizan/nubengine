      five to ten million patients treated at the time of the most recent estimate in 2002. The
      side effects of opioids such as fatigue, loss of libido, Impaired cognition and sexual
      dysfunction have long been recognize and strikingly, resemble symptoms of hypogonadism in
      men. Many studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of hypogonadism in male subjects who
      are long-term users of opioids. The aims of this pilot study are, in hypogonadal men being
      treated with opioids for chronic pain, to: 1) determine the effect of TRT on pain; 2)
      determine effects of TRT on fatigue; 3) determine the effect of TRT on mood; 4) determine
      effects of TRT on cognition and 5) characterize the effects of TRT on sexual dysfunction.
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-week pilot study.
