      recruitment in adult patients with corticospinal tract dysfunction using electrophysiologic
      measures. We wish to determine whether the intrinsic spinal mechanisms for recruitment are
      abnormal or whether only inputs to motoneurons are changed. This information is pertinent for
      assessing ways that can ultimately be used to enhance strength in patients with corticospinal
      tract dysfunction using the existing spinal circuitry.

      Study Design: Comparison of physiological observations in patients and age - matched control
      subjects.

      Study Population: Adults with spastic paresis aged 21-80 and healthy volunteers.

      Outcome Parameters: Measures of motor unit firing in response to peripheral nerve stimulation
      and transcranial magnetic stimulation.
