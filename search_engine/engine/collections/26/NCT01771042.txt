      There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that autonomic dysfunction, comprising
      elevated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and blunted sympathetic neural
      responsiveness plays a role in both the pathogenesis and target organ complications of
      obesity and diabetes. The proposed project will undertake a detailed comparative analysis of
      neuroadrenergic function along the diabetes continuum, its inter-relationship with insulin
      sensitivity and secretion, and target organ function, and the benefits of active weight loss
      and weight loss maintenance within different strata of metabolic risk.
