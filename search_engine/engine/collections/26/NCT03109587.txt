      diabetes mellitus (T2D). Probiotic treatment has been proposed to alleviate glycemic
      dysfunction and prevent/delay development of T2D. The investigators will test probiotics to
      improve insulin sensitivity and preserve beta cell function in obese children.

      The probiotic strains are known to improve glycemic control.
