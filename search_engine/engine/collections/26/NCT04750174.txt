      and its effectiveness is controversial. These small-scale studies conducted to improve
      control of drooling in the oral phase of swallowing in CP. However, there are no studies that
      have evaluated swallowing as a whole. Moreover, there is a need to carry out studies
      evaluating the efficacy of KT in dysphagia treatment with a high level of evidence and
      duration of effectivenes for a period longer than 3 months. This study is designed to answer
      the following research questions: "Is KT application effective in the treatment of dysphagia
      in CP?" ''If it is effective, whether the effect of KT therapy persists more than 3 months''.
