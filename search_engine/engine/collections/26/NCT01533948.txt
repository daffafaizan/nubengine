    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to axitinib in advanced melanoma. This will
      be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate toxicity of axitinib as a single agent. II. Determine progression-free survival
      and overall survival. III. Explore the utility of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine-labeled
      positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) as a predictive marker for response and compare to
      standard radiographic imaging.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the prognostic and predictive significance of circulating melanoma tumor cells.

      II. To examine whether functionally relevant polymorphisms in axitinib-related genes
      (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] 1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) correlate with
      efficacy and toxicity of axitinib in advanced melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
