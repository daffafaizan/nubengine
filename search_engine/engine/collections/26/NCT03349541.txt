    
      Rationale:

      A structured program evaluation considering a hierarchy of outcomes is essential to determine
      whether improved training in complex care is associated with increased skills in this area,
      and whether these skills transfer to a clinical setting where they will influence quality of
      care for CMC.

      A paediatric resident's sense of self-efficacy, or perceived capability, in caring for CMC is
      therefore important to foster for the graduating paediatrician to assume a leadership role in
      coordinating care, co-developing goals of care with families, advocating in the face of
      health challenges, and ultimately striving for high-quality clinical care for CMC.

      We anticipate that participation in a complex care curriculum will result in sustained high
      performance on simulated clinical scenarios in complex care and increased resident
      self-efficacy in caring for CMC, compared to paediatric residents that have not participated
      in the curriculum. This study will examine if a standardized complex care curriculum for
      paediatric residents has a positive effect on the acquisition of key competencies in the care
      of CMC using a rigorous experimental research design. To our knowledge, this is the first
      national, standardized, population-specific curriculum for Canadian paediatric residents to
      be developed and evaluated with this systematic approach.

      Study Objectives:

      The overarching aim of this project is to develop a robust evaluation of the national complex
      care curriculum, and identify whether dedicated educational modules have an impact on
      improving clinical performance and resident self-efficacy.

      Primary Research Question:

      What is the comparative effectiveness of participation in a standardized curriculum on
      acquisition of clinical skills in complex care for paediatric residents, relative to
      paediatric residents receiving a standard educational session not related to complex care,
      evaluated by OSCE scores in a complex care scenario?

      Secondary Objectives:

      To explore changes in paediatric residents' sense of self-efficacy and comfort in caring for
      CMC following participation in the curriculum using semi-structured interviews.
