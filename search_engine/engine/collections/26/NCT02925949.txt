      sexual or gender minority couples and randomizing 75 couples each to one of two conditions:
      1) DuoPACT, a newly-developed couples intervention; or 2) LifeSteps, a standardized
      antiretroviral adherence intervention for HIV+ individuals. After randomization, intervention
      sessions will be delivered weekly (6 DuoPACT sessions, or 3 Life Steps sessions). All couples
      will be assessed pre/post intervention to evaluate intervention effects via behavioral
      indicators of engagement in HIV care, the couple's relationship dynamics, and the primary
      outcome of HIV viral load.
