      surgery using interscalene nerve blocks. Participants will be randomized into one of four
      groups:

        -  Ropivacaine: 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine plus 2 ml 0.9% saline (placebo) for interscalene
           block;

        -  Bupivacaine: 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine plus 2 ml 0.9% saline (placebo);

        -  Ropivacaine and steroid: 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine plus dexamethasone 8 mg (2 ml) mixed
           with the local anesthetic;

        -  Bupivacaine and steroid: 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine plus dexamethasone 8 mg (2 ml) mixed
           with the local anesthetic.

      The primary outcome is the duration of the interscalene nerve block which is time to first
      analgesic request after PACU discharge.

      Kaplan-Meier survival density estimation and stratified Cox proportional hazard regression
      were used to compare groups.
