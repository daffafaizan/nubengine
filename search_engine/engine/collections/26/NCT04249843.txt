    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1a/1b (dose escalation and expansion) study of BGB-3245 in
      participants with tumors harboring B-RAF mutations that are likely to respond to a RAF dimer
      inhibitor. BGB-3245 is a second-generation B-RAF inhibitor that has demonstrated potent
      inhibitory activity against the RAF family of serine/threonine kinases preclinically. In
      preclinical studies, BGB-3245 showed it inhibited tumor cell lines harboring non-V600 B-RAF
      mutations; it was also active towards B-RAF/MAP-ERK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor-resistant tumors.

      Phase 1a will consist of a dose-escalation and dose-finding component to establish the MTD
      and/or RP2D and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3245 3245 in participants with MAPK
      pathway aberrations. Phase 1b will consist of an expansion component to further evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of BGB-3245 at the RP2D and to assess the
      preliminary antitumor activity of the compound in participants with select tumor types and
      B-RAF mutational status.
