      may have high levels of spiritual distress, an important aspect of the surrogate's
      well-being. Second, surrogates include their religious and spiritual beliefs when making
      serious medical decisions . Therefore unmet spiritual needs may have a negative effect on the
      surrogate's ability to make good decisions for the patient, especially when facing extremely
      distressful decisions such as whether to continue life sustaining treatment or enroll in
      hospice.

      The specific aims of this proposed study are:

        1. To determine the effect of the spiritual care intervention on psychological well-being
           for family surrogates at 3 months post discharge, including anxiety (primary outcome:
           GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), Posttraumatic stress (IES-R), and overall distress.

        2. To determine the effect of the spiritual care intervention on spiritual well-being for
           family surrogates, (FACIT-SP- non-illness) and on religious coping (Brief RCOPE positive
           and negative).

        3. To determine the effects of the spiritual care intervention on other aspects of the
           surrogates' experience, including satisfaction with spiritual care (Patient Satisfaction
           Instrument--Chaplaincy) communication (FICS), overall satisfaction with the hospital
           stay (Picker single item) and decision conflict (DCS).

        4. To determine the effect of the intervention on treatment at the end of life (life
           sustaining treatments and hospice utilization) for patients who die in the hospital.

        5. To determine differences in outcomes between the intervention group, who will receive
           our intervention, and the control group, who will receive the usual care provided by the
           hospital chaplaincy service.
