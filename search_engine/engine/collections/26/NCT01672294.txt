      preparation and completion with Veterans and their caregivers during serious illness.
      Specific aims are to 1) Evaluate the impact of the caregiver Outlook intervention on
      caregiver anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, completion, and burden; 2) Evaluate the
      impact of the home versus in hospital, emergency department, or nursing facility; 3) Evaluate
      the impact of the intervention session's qualitative content, examining variation associated
      with selected demographic variables, quality of family communication, and stage of illness on
      change.

      Caregivers in the first group ("Treatment", or "Preparation and life completion") will meet
      with a facilitator three times for a period of forty-five minutes each. In the first session,
      subjects will be asked to discuss issues related to relationship life review.

      In session two, participants will be asked to speak in more depth about issues such as regret
      and forgiveness. In the final session, subjects will focus on legacy and celebration.
      Caregivers in the second group ("attention control" or "relaxation meditation") will meet
      with a facilitator three times for a period of forty-five minutes each and be asked to listen
      to a non-guided relaxation compact disk (CD) or participate in a guided relaxation exercise.

      Participants in both groups will receive pre and post-test measures administered by a blinded
      interviewer. Outcome measures will be measures by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      - General (FACT-G), Quality of life scale, FACIT-sp sub-scale, Anticipatory Grief Scale,
      Caregiver Reaction Assessment, the Qual-E completion and preparation sub-scales, and patient
      days at home.
