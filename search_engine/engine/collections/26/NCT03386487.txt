    
      The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the FAAH Inhibitor PF-0447845 in reducing cannabis
      use will be studied in a 4-site randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      outpatient clinical trial comparing PF-04457845 (4mg) and placebo in DSM-5 CUD individuals.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either PF-04457845 or placebo using random
      block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by site and degree of cannabis use. Participants will
      receive motivational interviewing for 2 weeks before being randomized to receive study
      medication to make a quit attempt within the first week of treatment. Participants will
      receive active or placebo PF-04457845 for 8 weeks during which time they will be evaluated
      weekly in face to face visits. In addition, daily assessment of adherence to study medication
      and cannabinoid use will be conducted daily by cellphone. Measures of cannabinoid exposure
      (self-reported and urine toxicology), and problems related to the use of cannabis, will be
      assessed.
