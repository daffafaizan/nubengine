      3.2% to 12.1% of children have habitual snoring and 0.7% to 10.3% have obstructive sleep
      apnea syndrome (OSAS). Children OSAS is associated with a series of daytime and nighttime
      signs and symptoms. Nighttime symptoms include heavy snoring, restless sleep, heavy seating
      and enuresis, etc. Daytime symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal
      behavior such as aggressiveness and hyperactivity, etc. Untreated OSAS was reported to result
      in serious morbidity, such as failure to thrive, poor learning, attention deficit and
      hyperactivity disorder, etc.

      There is an increasing concern related to sleep disordered breathing(SDB) of children by
      orthodontists. Since not only the tonsilar and adenoid hypertrophy is the main cause of
      paediatric OSA, but also craniofacial anomalies such as retrognathic mandible, narrow
      maxillary palatal arch and increased lower facial height can also contribute to it,
      orthopedic treatment such as rapid maxillary expansion (RME) and mandibular advancement
      device (MAD) may potentially permanently cure the children OSA. RME which is used to widen
      maxilla, thus increasing the nasal cavity and improving the nasal flow, has been thoroughly
      researched. However, only a few previous studies focused on the treatment effect of MAD for
      treating OSA children. These studies showed sorts of MAD such as jaw-positioning appliance,
      mono-block, and Herbst appliance were effective to OSA children, but it remains unclear how
      to choose a functional appliance, and if there is any treatment difference between removable
      functional appliance and fixed functional appliance for improving airway dimension.
