      dual-therapy strategy, which combines a sirolimus-eluting coating with an anti-CD34 antibody
      layer to promote vessel healing. Sirolimus release (5 Î¼g/mm) is completed in 30 days, and the
      biodegradable polymer disappears within 90 days.

      CD34 antibodies are immobilized on the surface of the stent and capture circulating
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The captured EPCs are triggered by sheer stress from the
      circulating blood and other cell signals to differentiate and mature into endothelial cells.
      COMBO Plus is the only stent with a biological coating that actively repairs the vessel
      morphology. However, little is known regarding the endothelial function after stent
      implantation.
