      risk of forming blood clots inside the heart, that can then fragment and break off,
      travelling through the circulation to the brain, where it can cause blockage of the small
      blood vessels resulting in a stroke. Most patients with AF are prescribed blood thinning
      medications in an attempt to prevent such clot formation. The body has the ability through
      enzymes circulating in blood, to dissolve a clot once formed, such that even if a clot is
      formed, it is rapidly dissolved and no lasting damage is sustained. This is known as
      endogenous fibrinolysis. If this defence system is faulty or suboptimal, there is an
      increased risk of clot formation, resulting in stroke or heart attack. Currently, there are
      no available tablets to favourably modify this defence system of endogenous fibrinolysis. The
      investigators will assess how this defence system functions in patients with AF who are on
      different blood thinners. Then the investigators will also assess a group of patients before
      and during treatment with a relatively new blood thinner called apixaban, to assess the
      effect of this on the stickiness of blood and the ability of the blood to dissolve clots
      (endogenous fibrinolysis). All the blood thinners will be prescribed for clinical
      indications, not as part of the research. The research aspect of the study is that we will
      perform a blood test to assess endogenous fibrinolysis.

      Understanding the effect of apixaban on endogenous fibrinolysis raises the possibility that
      apixaban, rather than other blood thinners, may be of particular use in patients with
      impaired fibrinolysis who are at particularly high risk of clots due to inefficient
      endogenous fibrinolysis.
