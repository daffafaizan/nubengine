      gait training to improve mobility in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study will
      investigate the utility of the Keeogo速 exoskeleton (a robotic-assist gait training device)
      for people with PD. The Keeogo速 offers advantages of being lightweight and portable (for
      eventual home use) and is relatively quick to attach and remove. The aims here are to
      establish the safety of the Keeogo速 for gait training in persons with PD and to preliminarily
      assess the potential efficacy of the Keeogo速 for better balance control, gait mobility and
      fall reduction in persons with PD.
