    
      The Danish Hernia Database covers about 80% of all ventral hernia repairs performed in
      Denmark. Data on size of hernia, type of surgery, type of mesh and fixation method is
      available from the Danish Hernia Database. All healthcare services in Denmark are registered
      in the Danish National Patients Registry and data on 30-day readmission rate, readmission
      diagnosis and reoperation is found here. Each Danish citizen has a unique personal
      identification number and by merging data from the Danish Hernia Database and National
      Patients Registry, nationwide data on parastomal hernia repairs is available. The aim of the
      current study is to evaluate the overall outcomes after parastomal hernia repairs in Denmark
      from 2007-2017 focusing on readmission and reoperation rates.
