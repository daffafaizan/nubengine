    
      This is a double-blind randomized trial of intravaginal estrogen (conjugated estrogens,
      0.625mg/1g cream) vs. placebo in postmenopausal women (n=222 total) with symptomatic prolapse
      beyond the hymen planning transvaginal native tissue repairs. Medication will be started >5
      weeks before surgery and continued for 1 year postoperatively, i.e. until scar remodeling is
      complete. The investigators aim to determine if pre- and postoperative intravaginal estrogen
      therapy (i) results in anatomic and patient-reported subjective improvement in pelvic organ
      support, and (ii) impacts other pelvic floor disorders (overactive bladder and incontinence,
      sexual function and pain, postoperative cystitis), satisfaction, quality of life, and vaginal
      wound healing. Finally, (iii) the investigators will determine the potential mechanisms by
      which local estrogen treatment alters pelvic organ support by examining full-thickness
      vaginal wall biopsies taken at the time of surgery for histologic, connective tissue, and
      smooth muscle synthesis and degradative changes. The investigators expect this will highlight
      other novel targets for future therapies in prolapse repair and prevention.
