      Evaluation score II and III (APACHE) were recorded for all patients. All data were collected
      by a single physician. The APACHE II and III scores were gathered using the method presented
      by Knaus. The dominant hand APM thickness (as reported by the patient, or the relative) was
      assessed by Caliper (Vogel, Germany) in the emergency room or at the time of the ICU
      admission. To estimate weight for the APM thickness, multivariate logistic regression
      analysis was used to determine the relation between mortality and the APM thickness while
      controlling for other physiologic variables (12 physiologic variables for APACHE II and 18
      physiologic variables for APACHE III).The area under the receiver-operating curves (ROC
      curve) to predict mortality was used to compare APACHE II, APACHE III, APACHE II- APM and
      APACHE III- APM systems.
