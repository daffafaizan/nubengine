      simplified unanchored mesh repair, making surgery much simpler to perform and reduces the
      risk of the specific complications that may occur when tunneling devices beyond the pelvic
      cavity.

      In clinical practice, many women have symptomatic prolapse, which requires surgical
      correction. They are relatively young, and therefore care more about the long-term outcomes
      and quality of life after procedure. The purpose of this multicenter and prospective study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the GYNECARE PROSIMA* system in the treatment of
      symptomatic POP-Q Stage II-III pelvic organ prolapse.
