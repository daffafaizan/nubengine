      diabetes outcomes and reduce the need for anti-diabetic medical. The overall goal of this
      study is to explore the human engineering issues of a home (non-clinical) telehealth system,
      Healthium, utilizing an interactive television system over a broadband connection.

      The study seeks to demonstrate a convenient, intuitive and inexpensive way to conduct
      large-scale interventions related to obesity and nutrition. This could lead to a viable
      public health care initiative for prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The
      specific aims to be addressed are Aim #1: To transfer a successful internet-based weight loss
      program onto the Healthium interactive platform and further develop the intervention for use
      in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Aim #2: To conduct focus groups to determine consumer
      acceptability of the convenience and intuitiveness of the Healthium interface. Aim #3: To
      perform a pilot study in patients with Type 2 diabetes to determine whether the Healthium
      interface improves weight loss and diabetes outcomes relative to standard clinic-based
      treatment over a period of 8 weeks.
