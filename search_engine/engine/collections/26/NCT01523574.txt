      before the start of Ox to receive either vitamin E at 400 mg daily or placebo, until after
      the end of the Ox-based chemotherapy regimen. The investigators evaluated PN intensity using
      the CTCAE version 3 and specific Ox PN gradation scales. The investigators included patients
      with colorectal and gastric cancers scheduled to receive Ox-based chemotherapy. Both groups
      received calcium and magnesium supplements before and after oxaliplatin infusions.
