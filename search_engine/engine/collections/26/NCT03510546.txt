      strength in newly-diagnosed patients and patients on stable medication.

      Pyridostigmine treatment is initiated in the vast majority of MG patients. No studies have
      quantified the effect in a randomized trial, and no studies have examined the potential
      difference in effect in newly diagnosed patients as compared to patients on stable,
      antimyasthenic medications.

      The study will investigate the effect in two groups

        1. Newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients.

        2. MG patients on stable antimyasthenic medication.
