      predominate. GB226 had the different new amino acid sequence and molecular structure compared
      with two marketed PD-1 monoclonal antibody injection and got the approval of China Food and
      Drug Administration (CFDA) for clinical trial.Pharmaceutical research indicated GB226 cell
      strain had security source, production process is stable, quality can control, preparation
      stability, has good compatibility with packaging materials, it has the condition of
      industrialization, can prepare investigational medicinal product with safety, effective, and
      controlled quality for clinical research.Pharmacodynamics study show the targets and
      mechanisms of GB226 is clear, tumor suppression effect is obvious.Toxicology studies show
      this product in high doses with low toxic, and the toxic is reversible, the most common
