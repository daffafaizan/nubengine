      often caused by minor trauma to the bridging veins eventually leading to a collection of old
      blood in the subdural space over time. Besides age of the patients a number of further risk
      factors are assumed to favor pathogenesis. Depending on size and location of blood
      collections diverse neurological symptoms can be seen. Therapy approaches are heterogeneous
      ranging from conservative treatment with or without medication to surgical treatment. There
      also is lacking knowledge regarding neurocognitive impairment and effects on quality of life
      in patients under different therapy regimes.

      The prospective patient registry will enclose all patients admitted to the investigator's
      department diagnosed with cSDH either by MRI or CT scan after informed consent. Medical
      history, regular medication, social status, radiological findings and neurological
      examination using NIHSS will be performed at time of inclusion, discharge and follow-up.
      Additionally, neurocognitive testing and documentation of Quality of Life using MOCA Test and
      SF-12 will be conducted at different timepoints. Moreover a detailed documentation of therapy
      strategies is implemented in the study protocol.

      With this registry the study group expects to obtain significant data leading to a more
      standardized and optimized therapy regime and furthermore widening understanding on so far
      rarely known impact of cSDH on neurocognition and quality of life.
