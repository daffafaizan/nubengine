      only marginally improved in the last 20 years. It is the most commonly fatal cancer in both
      men and women with overall 5 year survivals of 15%. Lung cancer kills more Americans than the
      next three most common malignancies combined.

      Most non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents at advanced stages. Only approximately 25%
      present with stage I/II disease, 40% with stage III and 35% patients present with stage IV.
      (1) The optimal treatment of stage II/III NSCLC is complex. For those patients who are
      surgical candidates and a complete resection is technically feasible, radical surgery remains
      the standard of care. Traditionally, those patients with multiple N2 nodal levels or T4
      disease are considered inoperable. Given that the average age of patients diagnosed with
      NSCLC is in their mid-60's and usually have long smoking histories, many patients are
      medically inoperable.
