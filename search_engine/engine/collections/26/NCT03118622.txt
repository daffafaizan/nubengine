      laryngoscopes which is recently developed. Several studies have shown that the Pentax-AWSÂ®
      provides full views of the glottis in the majority of patients. It makes successful tracheal
      intubation in patients after failed intubation using a Macintosh laryngoscope.

      In pediatric patients who is expected to be difficult to intubate, Pentax makes successful
      intubation.
