    
      A non-confirmatory, randomized, subject and investigator blinded, placebo controlled,
      parallel-arm study, investigating a 48-week treatment period with i.v. bimagrumab 10 mg/kg in
      overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Participants were randomized and assigned to one of the following 2 treatment arms in a ratio
      of 1:1:

      Arm 1: Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg up to maximum 1200 mg, every 4 weeks (12 doses) until week 44.

      Arm 2: Placebo, every 4 weeks (12 doses) until week 44.

      The study consisted of a screening baseline period of 3 weeks, treatment period of 48 weeks
      and then a follow-up period of 8 weeks.

      Treatment period visits were scheduled every 4 weeks until week 44. Administration of
      bimagrumab or placebo was done via an i.v. infusion over 30 minutes followed by flushing for
      15 minutes. Subjects were asked to return to the Investigator site for dosing approximately
      every 4 weeks during the treatment period. During those visits, subjects were evaluated for
      safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy. The treatment period ended approximately 4 weeks after
      the last dose administration.
