        -  Determine whether the body distribution and plasma clearance of paclitaxel is affected
           by protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir mesylate, or nelfinavir
           mesylate).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to protease inhibitor treatment (yes vs no), prior
      paclitaxel (yes vs no), and prior doxorubicin or daunorubicin (yes vs no).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for
      at least 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who previously received paclitaxel receive no more than 1 course during this study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
