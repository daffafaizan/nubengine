      tumor-related mortality. In China, more than 80% of HCC patients are accompanied by liver
      cirrhosis. Varied degrees of cirrhosis not only play an important role in selecting
      appropriate operative interventions for HCC patients, but are closely associated with tumor
      recurrence and long-term survival as well. Therefore, evaluating cirrhotic severity is
      essential for individualizing surgical modalities and predicting outcomes for patients with
      HCC. In recent years, investigators' group has proposed to stage the severity of liver
      cirrhosis through intraoperative liver morphological changes and preoperative cirrhotic
      severity scoring (TJ-CSS) model. Although the morphological classification of liver cirrhosis
      is of guiding significance for surgeons to determine the extent of hepatectomy, this method
      has some defects, such as subjectivity, lack of specific quantitative indicators and so on.
      Based on this, investigators propose to evaluate the severity of liver cirrhosis by measuring
      liver stiffness directly by Shaw hardmeter. Therefore, this prospective, multicenter clinical
      study intends to modify and perfect the preoperative cirrhotic severity scoring (TJ-CSS) and
      direct measurement of liver stiffness (DMS) grade established in the early period, so as to
      build a set of clinical standards for surgical liver cirrhosis classification, which can be
      used to guide the surgical treatment of HCC.
