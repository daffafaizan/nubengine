        -  To estimate the incidence of three transplant-related adverse outcomes (i.e.,
           regimen-related mortality, engraftment failure, and fatal acute GVHD) in the first 100
           days after transplantation.

        -  To estimate the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

        -  To evaluate those factors that affect one-year survival.

        -  To assess the kinetics of lymphohematopoietic reconstitution.

        -  To assess the frequency and clinical relevance of minimal residual disease (MRD) before
           and after transplantation.

        -  To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for long-term neurocognitive deficit and
           organ dysfunction.
