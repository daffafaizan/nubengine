      implantation, clinical pregnancy, abortion and delivery rate. Until now, the evidences are
      mixed and inconclusive.

      The aim of the present study is determining if the probabilities of embryo implantation and
      pregnancy are associated to the operator performing the embryo transfer.

      The database includes all the fresh embryo transfers, performed between January 1997 and
      December 2016 at Humanitas Fertility Center after IVF-ICSI cycles. Only embryo transfers
      performed by the surgeon on duty for that day ("Gynecologist of the Day") will be included.

      Secondary end point is to evaluate if it is possible to draw a learning curve for transfer in
      terms of pregnancies for the different surgeons.

      The strength of this study relies on the completeness of the preoperative factors and follow
      up and on the vastest dataset in literature that can permit to correct for multiple
      confounders and analyze a wide group of outcomes.
