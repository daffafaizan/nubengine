      strategy in early sepsis or septic shock patients. In recent years, several randomized
      control studies showed the EGDT therapy cannot make a better outcome in sepsis patients
      compared to the standard therapy. A strategy of controlled fluid resuscitation had showed
      good outcome in critical illness such as severe acute pancreatitis, major trauma. But many
      aspects of the so-called controlled fluid resuscitation remained controversial. In a previous
      study on severe acute pancreatitis, we described a bundle of controlled fluid resuscitation
      which had showed an ideal result with higher survival rate. So, we are going to use the
      bundle on sepsis patients, and to see if it can bring a better out come in sepsis patients
      compared to the EGDT strategy. This study aims to determine a better strategy of fluid
      resuscitation in sepsis patients
