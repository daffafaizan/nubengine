      carcinoma. However, esophagectomy is associated with high mortality and morbidity and
      decreased quality of life. Endoscopic resection followed with chemoradiation had showed
      uncompromised oncological outcomes with esophagectomy. But there is no well-designed, phase
      III trial to compare the two treatment for patients with pT1b squamous cell carcinoma.

      The ad-ESD trial is a multi-center prospective superiority trial, combied of a randomized
      clinical trial and a prospective registry.

      The experimental design produces two randomized arms; (1) esophagectomy and (2)
      chemoradiation. An additional registry arm will be based on surgeons/patients that do not
      want to be randomised because of their own experience on adjuvant therapy, including
      esophagectomy; chemoradiation and active surveillance.

      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the difference of 5-year overall survival rate between
      definitive chemoradiation and esophagectomy, in patients with cN0-pT1b esophageal squamous
      cell cancer (ESCC) after endoscopic resection.

      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the difference of quality of life and oncological
      outcomes including 3-year overall survival (OS) and 3, 5-year relapse free survival (RFS)
      between the two treatments.
