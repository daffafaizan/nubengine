    
      This is a longitudinal study of 100 individuals diagnosed with any one of the nine
      glycoproteinoses. Because of the small number of individuals diagnosed with these diseases,
      participants will be strongly encouraged to be evaluated in person at a study site, but
      inability to travel to a study site will not exclude a person from participating. This
      non-interventional study will also collect medical information about participants through
      questionnaire, phone interviews, and review of medical records regarding the person's usual
      medical care, including lab testing and x-rays or other imaging studies.

      Participants who are evaluated at the study center will have a physical examination performed
      by a clinical geneticist and neuropsychological studies administered by the study
      psychologist. Neuropsychological studies assess intelligence, learning abilities, language
      skills, and ability to participate in day to day activities of life. Participants seen at the
      study center will have skeletal x-rays performed to evaluate the impact of the disease on the
      participant's bones.

      Every participant will complete (or have a care provider complete for them)

        -  A questionnaire about their birth, development, and medical history

        -  An interview with study personnel (in person or via telephone)

        -  Follow up interviews on at least an annual basis to update the medical history

      Each participant will be asked to

        -  Give a blood sample

        -  Give a urine sample

        -  Some participants may be asked to give a skin biopsy.
