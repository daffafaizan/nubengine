      psychiatric treatment for major depressive illness. The most commonly utilized of these
      include methohexital, thiopental, etomidate, and propofol. Recently, there has been interest
      in the use of ketamine in sub-anesthetic doses to treat major depressive illness.

      In this randomized, blinded trial, depressed subjects scheduled to be treated with ECT were
      anesthetized with either ketamine or methohexital at doses of approximately 1.0 mg/kg for
      each drug. Patients received the same drug for up to six of their ECT treatments. Outcome
      measures included assessments of depressive severity, cognition, post-anesthesia side
      effects, and hemodynamics.

      Subjects were to be followed with as long as they were receiving inpatient ECT treatments.
      The number of treatments was determined entirely by their primary psychiatric team, also
      blind to anesthetic, as per usual care. In other words, this study did not determine when to
      terminate the ECT course.
