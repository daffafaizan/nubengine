      French Alcohology Society, 10% of the adult population is alcohol abstinent and after 65
      years old, they are 40% to abstain from alcohol.

      On the other hand, the French Alcohology Society also reports that a regular or daily alcohol
      consumption for older people increases the risk of dependence on alcohol.

      For the elderly, biological disorders can be related to polymedication or other conditions
      related to the aging process, making it difficult to diagnose alcoholism for aged people.

      For the study, the three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) will be
      submitted to :

        -  every patient admitted in the Hospital of Mulhouse (France) for at least a day in the
           Geriatrics Department

        -  every patient entering the General Practitioner Support Association of Alsace, France
           (translated in French as the "RAG").

      When the score of the AUDIT-C reaches at least 1 point, the study will collect results of the
      GGT and MCV performed as routine practice and add the CDT in the blood tests.
