      progression and prognosis. As components of systemic inflammatory response, lymphocytes,
      neutrophils, and platelets are being recognised to have an important role in carcinogenesis
      and tumor progression. To date, a number of peripheral blood-derived inflammation-based
      scores such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet- lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and so
      on have been proposed as prognostic markers in numerous types of cancers. But, very little is
      known of their impact in subpopulation of lymphocytes. The investigators try to evaluate the
      activity of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and find out the relationship among clinical
      prognosis.
