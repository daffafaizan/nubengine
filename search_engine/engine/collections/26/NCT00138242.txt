      Primary

        -  Determine whether weekly administration of docetaxel and carboplatin is safer than
           conventional three-week chemotherapy courses, in terms of reducing the rate of
           myelosuppression, in patients with stage IC-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
           peritoneal cavity cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of clinical response rate, time to
           disease progression, and findings at second-look surgery, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may then undergo optional second-look surgery. After completion of 6
      courses of chemotherapy (and second-look surgery, if applicable), patients may receive
      consolidation and/or salvage therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each treatment course, at the completion of
      study treatment, and then annually for 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
