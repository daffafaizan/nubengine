    
      Civacir® 10%, Hepatitis C Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) is a high-titer human
      polyclonal immune globulin (IgG) containing a diversity of antibodies that target and bind
      the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to prevent infection. Subjects who reduce their viral load to
      less than 100 IU/ml HCV RNA through up to 24 weeks of antiviral therapy prior to liver
      transplant are enrolled in the study. There is no requirement to reach undetectable virus
      prior to transplant as the function of Civacir® is to neutralize any remaining virus in
      circulation.

      Subjects randomized to Civacir® treatment arms receive study drug infusions starting on the
      day of liver transplant followed by 15 doses over a 10 week period to prevent the recurrence
      of quantifiable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) after liver transplant. The study will evaluate
      dosing arms ranging from 200 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg compared to a control arm. For the primary
      endpoint, efficacy is defined as persistent viral load suppression maintaining HCV RNA levels
      below the lower limit of quantitation as determined by central laboratory Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR) at 22 weeks post-liver transplant and then at 34 weeks post-liver transplant
      to demonstrate durability of effect.
