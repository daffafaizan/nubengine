      in-depht-neuropsychologocal-battery scores, obtained from the evaluation of 500 patients with
      parkinsonisms. Data were analyzed to compare the classification of patient cognition profile,
      obtained with MMSE, MoC, FAB, with that one obtained from in-depht neuropsychological
      evaluation. A very high percentage of false negative emerged, for each screening test (MMSE,
      MoCA and FAB).

      A further analyisis permitted to appreciate how, summarizing the scores, obtained in each
      abovementioned test, it was possible significantly reduce the rate of false negative.

      A new tool, namely "CoMDA" (Cognition in Movement Disorders Assessment), was composed, by
      merging each item of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment
      (MoCA) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Moreover, we created a machine learning, namely
      "Neural Net 91classification" able to classify the cognitive profile and predict patients' at
      risk of dementia, providing a prediction of the findings resulting from a in-depht
      neuropsychological evaluation.

      CoMDA and the related Neural Net 91classification represent a reliable, time-sparing
      screening instrument, which is much more powerful of other common, widely-adopted tools.
