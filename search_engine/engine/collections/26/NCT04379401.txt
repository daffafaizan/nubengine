      blood supply. Congestive heart failure can be considered a syndrome but the final common path
      of many cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the investigators of this study confirmed an
      increased impairment in retinal microvascular function in patients with ischemic heart
      failure compared to patients with stable coronary disease.

      If medication fails to improve ejection fraction, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is
      the guideline-recommended treatment for patients with advanced heart failure and bundle
      branch block.

      The question remains if CRT changes purely hemodynamics by synchronizing the heart or has
      potential impact on the microvasculature to cause reverse remodeling of the failing heart.
      Measuring retinal vascular function might increase knowledge on the effects of cardiac
      resynchronization therapy.
