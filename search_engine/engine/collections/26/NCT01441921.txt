    
      In free-living overweight or obese adult with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose
      tolerance we will compare the effects of a pistachio-rich diet or a Mediterranean Diet on:

        -  Fasting glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, C peptide, HOMA IR, advanced glycation
           end products and soluble receptor of advanced glycation-end products.

        -  Peripheral haemostatic parameters.

        -  Plasma inflammatory markers.

        -  Lymphocyte expression of toll-like receptors, C peptide, resistin and interleukin-6 in
           peripheral leukocytes.

        -  Lymphocyte glucose transport and expression of glucose transporter 4 in peripheral blood
           leukocytes.

        -  Platelet function including platelet number, mean platelet volume, platelet factor 4
           levels and urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2.
