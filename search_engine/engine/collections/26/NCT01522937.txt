      biomarkers will also be collected to explore their use as tools for treatment
      individualization in future trials. During the current trial, an indicator of liver function,
      indocyanine green (ICG), will be used to identify during treatment patients who are at excess
      risk for radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) so that their radiation dose may be reduced.
      The model used for individualization will be updated as trial data accrue, so this is an
      adaptive trial of an individualized therapy. The planned accrual is seventy (70) evaluable
      patients over three years.
