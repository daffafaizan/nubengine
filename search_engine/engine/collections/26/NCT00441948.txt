      lasers are based on a wavelength that is specifically absorbed by the pigment melanin found
      in the hair follicle, where the energy is converted to heat resulting in a thermal injury.

      However, lasers for hair removal are not without limitations. A laser based long-term hair
      removal treatment is based on thermal destruction of the hair shaft and follicle using
      wavelengths that are specifically absorbed by the pigment melanin found in the hair follicle.
      The heating of hair follicle is done through heat dissipation from the hair shaft. One of the
      significant limitations of this approach is the fact that the epidermis through which the
      light energy must penetrate is rich in melanin and therefore absorbs a major portion of the
      energy, resulting in inadequate heating of the hair follicles. The purpose of the study is an
      evaluation safety and efficacy of a new laser based device.
