      low-grade gliomas, cortical dysplasias or even hamartomas.

      However, in order to avoid an invasive surgical procedure to remove the lesion, a certain
      diagnosis of its benignity is essential. The contribution of advanced techniques in MRI, such
      as spectroscopy in the characterization of these lesions, has not yet been studied today
