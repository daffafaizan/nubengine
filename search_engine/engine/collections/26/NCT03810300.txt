      in April 2014, the sustainability of the intervention's impacts on households, children, and
      women. The intervention, called the Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI), was
      assigned following a cluster-randomized controlled trial design in two zones of Bangladesh
      (north and south). WFP-Bangladesh implemented the intervention, and the International Food
      Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) conducted the impact evaluation research. Intervention arms
      were assigned at the village level, where arms were as follows: (1) cash transfers [north and
      south]; (2) cash transfers + nutrition behavior communication change (BCC) [north only]; (3)
      food transfers [north and south]; (4) food transfers + nutrition BCC [south only]; (5)
      food-cash split [north and south]; and (5) control [north and south]. Within treatment
      villages, women living in very poor households were targeted to receive benefits for two
      years, from May 2012-April 2014. For the original impact evaluation, longitudinal data on
      5000 households were collected from 2012-2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02237144).

      For the sustainability study in 2018, given available funding, the sampling frame will
      include 4000 households. This will include all households that were originally in the
      following arms: (1) cash transfers [north and south]; (2) cash transfers + nutrition BCC
      [north only]; (3) food transfers [north and south]; (4) food transfers + nutrition BCC [south
      only]; (5) control [north and south].
