    
      A two stage randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, kinetics and efficacy of twice-daily repeat intake of formulated Hoodia
      gordonii purified extract (H.g.PE) (PYM50717) administered twice daily for 2 or 15 days to
      healthy, overweight females aged 18 to 50 years with a body fat of 25-45%.

      Stage 1 (pilot): Placebo controlled, double blind comparison to assess the effect of timing
      of product administration (i.e. breakfast and lunch vs breakfast and dinner).

      Stage 2 (main study): Placebo controlled double blind comparison with product administered
      with breakfast and dinner.

      A total of 64 subjects were included in this study; stage 1: n=15, stage 2: n=49. Treatment
      groups in stage 2 were matched for percentage body fat.

      Stage 1:

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before
           breakfast and lunch (n = 4).

        -  Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and lunch (n =
           3).

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before
           breakfast and dinner (n = 5).

        -  Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and dinner (n =
           3).

      Stage 2:

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice daily (n=25)for 15 days

        -  Placebo product , twice daily (n=24),for 15 days
