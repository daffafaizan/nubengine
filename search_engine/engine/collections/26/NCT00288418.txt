      fluids, drugs, and nutrition. The most frequent life-threatening complication of central
      venous catheter use is septicemia. Normal cutaneous flora may invade the intracutaneous tract
      during or after catheter insertion. The colonizing bacteria subsequently disseminate along
      the catheter surface and ultimately seed into the blood stream.

      In the United States, a total of 250,000 cases of central venous catheter-related infections
      are estimated annually. Costs per infection are estimated as high as US$56,000. It is
      clinically imperative that effective measures be found to decrease catheter infection rates
      while minimizing the risk of the development of microbial resistance.

      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the non-inferiority of
      the Angiotech Central Venous Catheter (CVC) when compared to the ARROWgard Blue® CVC to
      prevent bacterial catheter colonization.

      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the
      non-inferiority of the Angiotech CVC when compared to the ARROWgard Blue® CVC to prevent:

        1. catheter-related local infection; and

        2. catheter-related bloodstream infection.

      Safety Objectives: This study will assess the safety of the Angiotech CVC.
