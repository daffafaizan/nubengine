      posterior tooth with pits and fissure discoloration and maximum 4 teeth. The teeth will be
      evaluated by two diagnostic methods (D), where D1 represents visual-tactile assessment method
      (ICDAS-II) and D2 represents light induced fluorescence intraoral camera.Three operators, the
      researcher and the 2 supervisors, from the Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Cairo University, will be the examiners in this study. Each examiner will record
      the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment method and the
      fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the
      use of mirror, probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided
      identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence intraoral camera.
