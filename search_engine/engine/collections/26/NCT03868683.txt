      session, volunteers will be served with 7 test meals and blood will be collected. After an
      overnight fast, subjects will visit the research center. Two fasting capillary blood samples
      will be collected via fingerpick. Following the fasting samples, volunteers will consume the
      test meals. Further blood samples will be collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180
      minutes after the ingestion of test meal. These samples will be used to analyses for whole
      capillary blood glucose. At every 30 minute interval, samples will be collected for analysis
      of capillary plasma insulin.
