      followed by oral 100 mg aspirin and 75mg clopidogrel daily for at least 12 months. STEMI
      patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), Î²-blockers, and angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) according to the STEMI
      guideline, unless there were contraindications to these drugs. Peripheral blood samples were
      collected from patients within 2 hours of admission for blood routines and blood biochemistry
      examinations. White blood cell counts and level of hemoglobin were assessed with automated
      cell counters via standard techniques. The investigators followed up patients in validation
      group for three month to observe the cardiac rupture events and other adverse cardiac events
      .
