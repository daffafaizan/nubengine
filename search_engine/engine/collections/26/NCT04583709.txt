      and ECG characteristics of LBBP and HOT-CRT and compare with preexisting data in traditional
      CRT and RVP.

      Specific Objective:

        -  To demonstrate and establish electrical resynchronization using ECG Belt Research System
           in Left Bundle Branch Pacing (LBBP) and HOT-CRT.

        -  To assess ECG Belt derived native conduction parameters and compare them to LBBP and
           HOT-CRT.

        -  To compare with historic ECG belt parameters obtained for right ventricular pacing/
           Biventricular pacing in prior studies.

      The ECG Belt study is a prospective, single-center, investigational, pre-market research
      study. The study team will identify all patients who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The study team will evaluate the ECG Belt Research System to assess the electrical
      characteristics of conduction system pacing in patients with preexisting LBBP or HOT-CRT.

      Eligible patients would have successfully undergone LBBP using Medtronic 3830 lead. LBBP will
      be confirmed at implant using left bundle potentials recorded from the lead, ECG morphology
      during unipolar and bipolar pacing, peak LV activation time and lead depth in the LV septum
      by contrast at implant and 2D echo post-implant.

      ECG belt would be used to record ECG during baseline rhythm, LBBP in unipolar and bipolar
      configurations and / or during HOT-CRT using His-Bundle Pacing (HBP) or LBBP. These ECG belt
      characteristics would then be compared with baseline and existing data on Right Ventricular
      RV pacing and traditional Biventricular pacing.
