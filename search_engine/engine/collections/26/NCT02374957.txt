      patients to reduce claudication symptoms. Contemporary data has demonstrated that Cilostazol
      improves patency after endovascular interventions in multiple randomized trials and
      retrospective studies done in Japan in both critical limb ischemia and claudication patients.
      However, Cilostazol use after peripheral revascularization has been sporadic and there has
      been no research to estimate patient quality of life with use of Cilostazol after open or
      endovascular lower extremity revascularization.

      This is a prospective investigator initiated single-center open-label, non-placebo controlled
      pilot study. Eligible patients would be randomized to either the Cilostazol treatment or the
      non-Cilostazol treatment groups using a closed envelope randomization technique. Twenty
      patients will be recruited and randomized; Ten to the treatment group and tento the control
      group.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to collect quality of life data on patients
      undergoing peripheral revascularization in order to determine the sample size required for
      adequate powered trial of Cilostazol versus usual care without Cilostazol and its effect on
      Quality of Life.
