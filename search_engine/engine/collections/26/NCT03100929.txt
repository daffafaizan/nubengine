      during which fetal heart rate, fetal presentation and nuchal cord presence will be
      documented. During surgery, after the fetus is delivered, presence or lack of nuchal cord
      will be documented.

      The aim of the study is to show that minimal sonographic training may assist even an
      unexperienced sonographist in detection of such a subtle yet important phenomenon.

      The study will be performed utilizing the newest resident in the OBGYN department.
