      is that treatment of RSV-infected infants/children with lumicitabine (also known as
      JNJ-64041575 or ALS-008176) will decrease subsequent wheezing/asthma compared to placebo
      (looks like lumicitabine). The participants who have completed treatment course
      (lumicitabine/placebo) and last study visit in a previous study, 64041575RSV2004, for the
      treatment of RSV infection will be enrolled in this LTFU study. The main purpose of this
      study is to understand the impact of lumicitabine on the occurrence of asthma/wheezing in
      infants/children with a history of RSV infection. The participants will be assessed via
      monthly calls with the parents/caregivers and also at site visits at 3, 6,12 and 24 months.
