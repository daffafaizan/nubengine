    
      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an ultra-rare, severe inherited
      blistering skin disease caused by the absence of a protein known as type 7 collagen (C7).
      There is no approved treatment for RDEB. Only supportive care is currently possible.

      This open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of EB-101 for the
      treatment of large, chronic, RDEB wounds. The study intervention consists of one-time
      surgical application of gene-corrected keratinocyte sheets (EB-101) for the treatment of RDEB
      wound sites in up to approximately 10-15 participants. A single EB-101 sheet is able to
      provide healing to a wound area up to approximately 40cm2. Up to 6 (six) EB-101 sheets may be
      applied to each patient, depending on the area of existing wounds. The co-primary endpoints
      of the study are: 1) the proportion of RDEB wound sites with greater than or equal to 50%
      healing from baseline, comparing treated with untreated wound sites at Week 24 (Month 6) as
      determined by direct investigator assessment; and 2) pain reduction associated with wound
      dressing change assessed by the mean differences in scores of the Wong-Baker FACES scale
      between treated and untreated wounds at Week 24 (Month 6). Patient-reported outcomes and
      safety will also be collected throughout the study.

      The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach Week 24. Safety
      and efficacy assessments will be conducted at regular intervals and completed when last
      patient reaches Week 26 post-treatment.

      Upon completion of the study period, patients will be monitored annually as per standard of
      care for up to 15 years.
