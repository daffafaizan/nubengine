      stimulation (tDCS) in modulating aberrant neurocognitive processes implicated in pediatric
      patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The investigators propose two arms of the
      study that will investigate fear extinction learning and inhibitory control in one arm (A),
      and goal orientated versus habit-based behavior and inhibitory control in the other (B). All
      subjects will undergo three study conditions: two with active tDCS to each of two different
      brain targets and one under sham tDCS. The order of stimulation (sham or active tDCS) will be
      randomized.
