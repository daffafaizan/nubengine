      bronchitis, during the first three years of life. The condition is usually induced by viral
      respiratory infections, and short-acting beta-agonists are recommended as a monotherapy for
      symptoms unless there are at least four physician-confirmed episodes of wheeze or shortness
      of breath, or three episodes plus asthma risk factors. There is a current need for new
      therapeutic agents to treat asthmatic bronchitis in young children.

      In viral-induced wheeze, increased parasympathetic nerve activity results in increased
      acethylcholine release from nerve endings. Tiotropium bromide, an inhaled anticholinergic
      agent, prevents the acetylcholine function and achieves mild bronchodilatation and decrease
      in mucus secretion from the submucosal glands.

      The aim of the study is to find out the effect of intermittent tiotropium bromide and
      salbutamol as needed versus intermittent fluticasone propionate and salbutamol as needed, or
      solely, salbutamol as needed on episode-free days in infants and toddlers with recurrent
      episodes of wheeze and/or shortness of breath. Episode-free days are defined as those days
      during which there are no symptoms of wheeze and/or shortness of breath, no unscheduled
      medical visits for wheeze and/or shortness of breath, and no use of rescue or supplementary
      controller medications.
