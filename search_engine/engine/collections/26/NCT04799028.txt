      toddler milk containing L. reuteri and GOS (4g/L) and a low sn-1, -3 fat blend. A randomized
      controlled clinical trial minimizes the potential for bias, including confounding, to
      influence the study results. The inclusion of a control milk (CTRL) of
      pediatrician-recommended cow's milk (fortified with key nutrients to mimic other fortified
      cow's milks in the Filipino market, i.e. vitamins A, D, E, and C) enables comparisons vs. the
      Experimental milk (EXPL) group to study the effects of pre- and probiotics and new fat blend
      on bone mass index, gut comfort, blood vitamin D level, fecal fatty acid soaps and other
      parameters of bone health. An unblinded habitual intake reference group (REF) will be
      included for "real-world" comparison (including 58% non-dairy drinkers according to
      observational data).
