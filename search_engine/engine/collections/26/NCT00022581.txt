      I. To estimate the response rate and time-to-progression (TTP) in previously treated patients
      with low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with thalidomide.

      II. To evaluate the effect of thalidomide on microvascular density in the bone marrow of
      patients with low grade cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      III. To evaluate the effects of thalidomide on bFGF levels in serum and urine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
