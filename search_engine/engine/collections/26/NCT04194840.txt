    
      This is a supportive interventional study to assess frailty in at risk geriatric cancer
      patients undergoing stem cell transplant and to determine if specific interventions are
      feasible and will improve overall outcomes.

      A total of 20 participants will be enrolled in this study with the first 10 participants
      limited to myeloma or lymphoma patients who meet eligibility criteria and are candidates for
      autologous transplantation. The second 10 participants enrolled will be either allogeneic or
      autologous stem cell transplant candidates who meet eligibility criteria.

      The objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To pilot a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric assessment clinic.

        -  To determine whether a comprehensive geriatric assessment (outside of physical therapy
           assessment) can be performed in a time efficient manner. The goal is to complete all
           questionnaires and the multidisciplinary assessments in <90 minutes.

        -  To assess participant and physician satisfaction

        -  To determine if interventions recommended in the clinic are achievable for each
           participant

        -  Examples of interventions could include, medication changes, management of depression,
           dietary modifications, physical therapy three times a week, etc.

        -  To determine if participation in the transplant wellness clinic reduces length of stay
           and readmission rate compared to historical controls at our institution
