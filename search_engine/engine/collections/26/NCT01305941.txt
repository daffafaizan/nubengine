    
      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective -To determine the intracranial objective response rate of
      mTOR inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the treatment
      of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined via modified RECIST
      criteria.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the intracranial objective response rate of mechanistic target of rapamycin
           (mTOR) inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the
           treatment of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined by
           MacDonald criteria.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab
           and vinorelbine as assessed via the NCI CTCAE version 4.0

        -  To evaluate time to intracranial progression after administration of everolimus in
           combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine as defined via modified RECIST criteria

        -  To evaluate the extracranial objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1
           criteria after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and
           vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate the extracranial time to progression as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria
           after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after
           administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate the impact of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine on
           quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast
           (FACT-B) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Brain (FACT-Br) questionnaires.

      Exploratory Objective

      -To evaluate biomarkers in archival tumor tissue samples and correlate with therapeutic
      response to everolimus in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab.

      Following Hepatitis B antiviral prophylaxis if required, or following screening and informed
      consent if antiviral therapy is not needed, treatment will be initiated with everolimus PO
      daily in combination with weekly intravenous (IV) vinorelbine and trastuzumab (Days 1, 8, and
      15)

      A cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21 days). Cycles of therapy will be repeated until documented
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal from study for other
      reasons, including death.
