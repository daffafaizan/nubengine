           our hospital since January 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. The enrolled subjects
           were divided into two groups (AMI patients with HFpEF and AMI patients without HF).

        2. The investigator collected the clinical data of participants' demographics (age, sex),
           previous history,risk factors for AMI (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus,
           smoking and stroke), laboratory biomarkers, echocardiographic measurements, clinical
           characteristics,medical procedures and treatments, as well as in-hospital complications.

        3. Two sub-investigators independently analyzed these data by using SPSS software.
