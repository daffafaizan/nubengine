      Unit of Aretaieion University Hospital and Tzaneio General Hospital, Athens, Greece.
      Pethidine, midazolam or propofol will be used for patient sedation. ERCP will be conducted
      with the use of a side viewing endoscope. After catheterization of the common bile duct
      through the previous sphincterotomy, cellular material will be obtained with the use of an
      endoscopic brush from the bile ducts. With the same way, brush cytology will be performed in
      the control group after performing ES.

      Material obtained from each patient will be smeared on five glass slides. Four slides will be
      fixed with ethanol solution 95% and the fifth will be air dried. The brush will be fixed in
      suitable liquid for performing liquid phase cytology. Immunocytology with immunofluorescence
      p-53 antibody will be performed in samples with hyperplasia, dysplasia or atypia. The
      cytology department of Tzaneio Hospital will conduct examination and evaluation of all
      samples.

      Samples based on their morphological characteristics will be classified in five categories:
      a. inadequate sample (very small cell number, presence of blood, inadequate fixation) b.
      negative for malignancy (adequate cell number with benign morphologic characteristics) c.
      reactive with or without atypia (cells with reactive/proliferative or inflammatory
      characteristics. Malignancy is rare but cannot be excluded) d. suspicious for malignancy e.
      positive for malignancy [21,22].

      Examination and evaluation of the specimens will be done by two specialized cytologists,
      separately, in order to achieve more objective results.
