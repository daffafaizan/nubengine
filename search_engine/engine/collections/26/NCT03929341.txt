      likely to present with atypical chest pain that may be difficult to diagnose using
      traditional testing methods, resulting in over-investigation.

      Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has high negative predictive value for
      exclusion of CAD in low to intermediate risk populations. We plan to investigate CCTA as a
      first line test to exclude coronary artery disease as a cause of stable chest pain and
      whether it is a cost effective strategy that reduces time to diagnosis, wait times to see
      cardiologists, emergency department visits, downstream and repeat testing and radiation
      exposure as compared to usual care with comparable patient safety and satisfaction level.

      Another intervention being tested in this trial is the Cardiac Link pathway. This is a new
      clinical program at Women's College Hospital that aims to expedite cardiology referral for
      patients exhibiting clinically significant findings while undergoing CCTAs.

      We hope that with use of CCTA as the first test, the number of women who require only one
      test (i.e. CCTA) to sort out whether or not CAD is responsible for their chest pain will
      increase, thereby decreasing over-investigation of low risk women.
