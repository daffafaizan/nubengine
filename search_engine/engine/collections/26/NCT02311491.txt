      archwires using ion beam assisted deposition to reduce sliding resistance. Excessive sliding
      resistance works against tooth motion as the bracket slides along the wire into a new
      position. These ceramic coatings will produce more predictable outcomes, requiring less force
      and shorter treatment time. A limited clinical trial will be conducted to demonstrate these
      effects.

      The aim of this project is to assess the clinical efficacy of the new archwires in Stage 1
      (leveling and aligning) and Stage 2 (space closure) of orthodontic treatment using a twin
      bracket. The working hypothesis is that reduction of sliding resistance in bracket-wire
      interfaces will allow effective tooth movement in leveling, aligning, and sliding, while
      minimizing unwanted tooth movement such as lateral (mesio-distal direction) movement due to
      friction. This will be tested in a total of 80 patients who are undergoing active treatment
      in the University of North Carolina (UNC) orthodontic graduate clinic. These patients will be
      comprised of a treatment group (coated) and a control group (uncoated) of 20 each in Stage 1
      and Stage 2 treatment.

      A successful program will demonstrate a clinically significant increase in the amount and
      rate-of-change of tooth movement in leveling, aligning, and sliding teeth.
