    
      As soon as admission to the intensive care unit, eligible patients who gave consent will be
      randomized to either HFNO or Noninvasive ventilation therapy for at least the first 24 hours.

      In the usual care group , Noninvasive ventilation will be applied in alternance with standard
      nasal oxygen therapy.

      In the intervention group, HFNO with be applied continuously over the first 24 hours.

      In both groups, an oxygen saturation, as assessed by finger pulse oximetry, of 88-92% will be
      targeted.

      The primary objective will be two-fold: to compare between groups 1) Efficacy, assessed by
      the arterial pH at 24 hours, and 2) Safety, assessed by the ratio of the arterial partial
      pressure in oxygen (PaO2) over the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) at 24 hours.
