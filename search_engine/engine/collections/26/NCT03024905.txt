      pregnancy, this trial is designed to assess if several interventions combined can increase
      the number of women delivering in health care facilities. The design of the study is
      "Multiple Baseline Design". Community health workers are trained to collect baseline data on
      women using mobile phones in one rural district in Tanzania. The district has four distinct
      divisions. After 6 months of baseline data in the district, one division will experience the
      interventions. The interventions are education about the importance of attending antenatal
      care visits with nurses and facility deliveries, a voucher for transport to access the health
      facility at the time of delivery, and birthing supplies to be used either at the health
      facility, or on route if the women does not make it to the health facility. The intervention
      will be begun in each of the other divisions in 3 month intervals (i.e. the second division
      starts to experience the interventions 3 months after the first, the third, 3 months after
      the second and the fourth 3 months after the third). The trial will continue for a total of
      27 months including the baseline period.
