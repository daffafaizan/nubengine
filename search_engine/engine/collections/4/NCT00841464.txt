      Parkinson's disease through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the form of picoTesla
      magnetic therapy (pTMT). This therapy consists of an electronic device that emits magnetic
      flux densities that are more than ten million times lower than the magnetic flux density of
      the earth's magnetic field. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy aims
      to manipulate overall quality of life by improving motor function, as well as cognitive and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression.
