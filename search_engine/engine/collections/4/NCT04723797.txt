      are needed. Physical activity may play a big role in preventing and/or reducing burnout.
      Therefore the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of physical activity on
      the risk of burnout in secondary school teachers. The participants in the intervention group
      will be asked to perform a specific physical activity program (including running and/or
      cycling at a moderate or vigorous intensity) for 6 weeks. The control group will be asked to
      keep their lifestyle as it was prior to the study. To assess the effect of this activity
      program, the participants will have to fill in a questionnaire at three time points. Lastly,
      the participants have to fill in an activity diary every day, enabling to assess intervention
      adherence.
