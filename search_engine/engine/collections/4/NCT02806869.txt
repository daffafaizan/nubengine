      healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions which are necessary for mechanistic
      absorption model development. Each subject will be asked to complete two GI tube insertion
      procedures. Subjects will complete this study twice under the same conditions of the GI
      tract, either fasting state or fed state, in order to provide intra-subject variability. A
      minimum of 7 days will separate each GI tube insertion procedure. The objectives of this
      study are, as follows: Objective #1: To acquire human GI physiology data including GI
      motility, pH of GI fluids, and GI fluid volume under fasting and fed conditions; Objective
      #2: To measure drug concentration and calculate drug dissolution in the GI tract in vivo
      under fasting and fed conditions; Objective #3: To monitor plasma drug concentration and
      evaluate pharmacokinetics of administered drug during GI tube insertion studies under fasting
      and fed conditions. These in vivo results will be used to validate in vitro dissolution
      methods and to support computational and mathematical modeling efforts, in order to develop
      an oral drug product optimization process that may be applied to future drugs to maximize
      oral drug safety and efficacy.
