      tobacco) from the Iowa City VA Health Care System will be proactively recruited using
      information obtained from the electronic medical record. All participants will receive the
      investigators' tailored, six session smoking cessation intervention developed over a series
      of projects funded by ORH. This includes a counseling protocol tailored to tobacco users'
      individual needs and associated risk factors as well as pharmacotherapy selected using shared
      decision making. Participants who are unable to quit initially will be provided with enhanced
      counseling based on self-monitoring and scheduled reduced smoking. Those who are able to quit
      using tobacco during the initial treatment phase will be given an extended, four-session
      counseling protocol that incorporates new content based on established interventions from
      positive psychology in an effort to reduce relapse.
