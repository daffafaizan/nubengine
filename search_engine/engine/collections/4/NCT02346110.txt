      bupivacaine-adrenalin and 1 mL of sodium chloride solution, while the other half will receive
      10 mL of bupivacaine-adrenalin and 1 mL of dexamethasone.

      The block is strictly a sensory block because it is a selective, sub-sartorial saphenous
      block at mid-thigh level without any anesthetic effect on the femoral nerve.

      The adjuvant dexamethasone has increasingly become a subject of interest regarding a
      protracted effect, which has been shown in several studies. However, the precise mechanism of
      action remains speculative, and the results are contradictory regarding the discussion
      whether the effect is systemic or local. The effect may stem from decreased nociceptive
      C-fibre activity via a direct action on glucocorticoid receptors and inhibitory potassium
      channels. Another suggestion is a vasoconstrictive effect, which reduces the systemic uptake
      of local anaesthetics or a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.

      Prolonging the effect of the single shot saphenous block by adding dexamethasone will reduce
      the need for opioids, which will reduce the risk of adverse effects like nausea, vomiting and
      respiratory depression. Furthermore, newer studies show that inadequate pain alleviation in
      the early postoperative period is a risk factor in developing chronic persistent pain.
