      intensity exercise on the hormone ghrelin and its two forms, acyl (AG) and des-acyl (DAG),
      which are suggested to influence appetite, glucose metabolism and vascular function. We will
      determine whether differential changes in total ghrelin, AG and DAG are associated with
      changes in appetite, insulin sensitivity and vascular function. Subjects will be categorized
      as; either lean or obese (BMI), and either normal fasting glucose or impaired glucose
      tolerant (oral glucose tolerance test). Each participant will undergo body composition
      analysis, and a maximal treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine lactate
      threshold and maximal oxygen uptake. Subjects will then complete three randomly assigned
      exercise sessions: a) control (rest), (b) moderate intensity exercise and, (c) high intensity
      exercise. Blood sampling and measures of vascular function will occur before, during and
      after each study. An ANOVA with repeated measures and logistic regression analyses will
      examine the differential impact of exercise intensity on the outcome measures. Data collected
      will be used to develop a precision exercise approach to treat obesity and abnormal glucose
      metabolism for a NIH grant submission. This project is related to the UVa emphasis in
      precision medicine.
