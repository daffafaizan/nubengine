    
      Design The study design is a randomized, controlled trial involving evaluation of a study and
      a conventionally trained group at pretest and posttest.

      Participants The study and control groups will consist of senior surgical residents (PGY 3-5)
      and surgical fellows involved in minimally invasive surgery (MIS).

      Inclusion: Since concurrent operative training in the operating room (OR) in the technique of
      MIS is a prerequisite for this study, only residents and fellows on rotations with a practice
      focus on MIS during the time period of the study will be eligible for participation.

      Exclusion: Individuals with severe illnesses precluding performance in the OR will not be
      included.

      Outcome measures: Surgical performance will be assessed using a global rating scale as well
      as through tabulation of observed intraoperative technical errors. Primary outcome measure is
      surgical skill level before and after targeted training.
