    
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the attributes associated with treatment that are most important to
      men with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). To determine men's preferences
      for, and trade-offs between, the attributes (survival and side-effects) of different
      treatment options in metastatic prostate cancer including systemic therapy, local and
      metastases-directed physical therapies.

      PHASE: Prospective multi-centre observational cohort

      DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment, single-visit, electronic questionnaire design

      SAMPLE SIZE: Multi-centre Stage (Stage 3) n = 300 patients

      POPULATION: Men with newly-diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer who have not consented to a
      form of local cytoreductive or metastasis directed therapy.
