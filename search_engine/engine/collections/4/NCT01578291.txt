      participation in this study. Children would be randomized to having play therapy or a
      parental education brochure. The study would have no impact on the child recieving the state
      of the art medical care.

      Play therapy involves having the child play through the process of the study with a child
      life therapist, in an effort to prepare the child for the procedure. Parents/patients will be
      given a pre and post procedure evaluation form to objectively categorize the parental/patient
      perception of the experience with the study.
