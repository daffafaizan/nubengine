    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of a new intensification regimen comprising cisplatin and
           paclitaxel in combination with radiotherapy and surgery in patients with resectable
           advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the disease-free interval and failure sites in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate molecular markers with treatment outcome in these patients.

        -  Correlate quality of life with treatment outcome in these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate treatment completion in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preoperative therapy (weeks 1 and 2): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days
           1-3. Patients also undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy once daily on
           days 1-5 and 8-12.

        -  Surgery (week 3): Patients undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor (with or
           without neck dissection) and intraoperative boost radiotherapy.

        -  Postoperative therapy (weeks 7-10): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days
           1-3 and 22-24 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also
           undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and
           22-26.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection at baseline, in weeks 3, 7-10, and 14,
      and then periodically thereafter for biomarker correlative studies.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of
      treatment, and then annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then
      periodically thereafter.
