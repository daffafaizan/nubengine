      coagulation factors, temperature and contact activation inhibitors. Results produced by
      different monitors are also prone to vary influenced by the specific method employed to
      perform the test.

      The present clinical study aims to compare two types of ACT monitors: the Hemostatic
      Management System Plus (Medtronic) and i-STAT (Abbott) in 20 cardiac surgical patients by
      performing five intraoperative consecutive measurements using anti factor Xa as a reference
      for the actual heparin concentration.

      Inclusion criteria comprised patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for coronary bypass
      surgery.

      Measurements: 1) before induction of anaesthesia 2 ) after heparin bolus 3) rewarming of the
      patient 4) weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass 5) after protamine administration.

      The Hemostatic System Plus ACT monitor served as reference for dosing of heparin in all
      patients. The study protocol did not intervene with the standard protocol used for
      anticoagulation. No patient interventions were made.

      It is hypothesised that the i-STAT ACT monitor has a better correlation with the actual
      heparin concentration than the Hemostatic Management System Plus
