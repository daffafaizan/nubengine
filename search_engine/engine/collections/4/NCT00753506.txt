        2. To evaluate the effect of artemisinin on cognitive impairments and associated functional
           skills.

           levels of antibodies to Toxoplasma.

        4. To examine whether changes in cognitive impairment or psychiatric symptoms are
           correlated with changes in antibodies to Toxoplasma before and during the treatment with
