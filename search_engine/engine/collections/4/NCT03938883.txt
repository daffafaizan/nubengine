    
      This is a prospective, randomized, masked (reading center), controlled pivotal study of
      Ocular Bandage Gel (OBG) vs. a Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) in subjects who have undergone
      bilateral photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

      Study subjects will be evaluated and, if eligible following PRK, will receive the study
      treatment in a 1:1 randomization with both eyes receiving the same treatment.

      Sites will capture the time that PRK surgery OU is completed. Sites will enroll eligible
      subjects and randomly assign a subject to Treatment Group (OBG) or Control Group (BCL). One
      eye will be randomized as the designated "study eye" for statistical purposes.

      The reading center will be masked as to the randomization assignments. Both eyes will receive
      the same randomized assignment and both eyes of each subject will be evaluated at all
      timepoints.

      The defect in both eyes of all subjects will be measured starting at Day 2 (48 hours after
      PRK). The slit lamp photos are to be collected at 48 hours (Â±1 hour) from PRK completion in
      both eyes.

      The BCL in the Control Group eyes will be removed daily starting at Day 2 for slit lamp
      photos. Slit lamp measurements, as well as photography of the epithelial defect (without and
      with fluorescein), will be taken of both eyes of all subjects. Photos will be evaluated by a
      masked reading center.
