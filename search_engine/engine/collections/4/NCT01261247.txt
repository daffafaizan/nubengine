      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the
      toxicities associated with LBH589 in patients with NHL. II. To evaluate overall survival,
      progression-free survival, and duration of response in patients treated with LBH589. TERTIARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LBH589. II. To assess the correlation
      between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) effects with the pharmacologic
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative laboratory)
      results. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 times weekly. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years.
