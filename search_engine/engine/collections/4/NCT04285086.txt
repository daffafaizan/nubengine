    
      PharmaEssentia Corporation is developing a pegylated (PEG) IFN-α product, P1101, for the
      treatment of ET.

      Available clinical data and experience with P1101 in PV shows that the compound, with proper
      dose modifications, is effective in controlling disease in a significant proportion of
      subjects with ET. Further, its increased serum half-life presents distinct advantages for ET
      treatment over that of standard IFN-α and other available PEG IFN-α therapy. This pivotal
      Phase 3 study will establish the efficacy and safety of P1101 in ET subjects.

      The enrolled subjects will be randomized into two arms, the test arm is P1101, the control
      arm is ANA. The overall duration for each eligible patient is 14 months, including screening
      (1 month), treatment (12 months) and follow-up (1 month) period. Efficacy evaluations, safety
      assessments, and PK and immunogenicity evaluations of P1101 will be performed.

      Evaluation of efficacy will include clinical laboratory assessments, allelic burden
      measurements of CALR, JAK-2, and MPL, spleen size measurements, bone marrow sampling,
      EQ-5D-3L, and MPN-SAF TSS completion.

      Evaluation of safety will include assessing vital signs, clinical safety laboratory tests,
      physical examinations, ECG evaluation, heart ECHO, lung X-ray, ECOG performance status,
      ocular examination, and AEs.
