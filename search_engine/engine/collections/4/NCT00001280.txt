      Itraconazole for preventing fungal infections in patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease
      (CGD). CGD is a genetic disorder in which phagocytes are unable to produce oxygen radicals.
      As a result, affected patients are prone to recurrent, severe infections with bacterial and
      fungal organisms. Patients with CGD of 5 or more years of age without evidence of infection
      at the time of study entry will be eligible for enrollment. Patients will be randomized to
      receive itraconazole or placebo tablets daily, in a double blinded fashion. In addition to
      itraconazole, all patients will receive antimicrobial prophylaxis against bacterial
      infection, and may in addition receive gamma-interferon as prophylaxis against infection.
      Randomization of patients will be stratified among patients receiving or not receiving gamma
      interferon. The primary endpoint of the study will be the development of culture or
      histologically proved invasive fungal disease. Patients will be monitored every three months
      for evidence of drug toxicity, and surveillance cultures of nasopharynx and stool will be
      obtained. The anticipated accrual period will be approximately 36-48 months.
