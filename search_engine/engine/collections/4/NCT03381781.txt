      applied for TP53 sequencing. The bone marrow samples will be collected and its p53 status
      will be Sanger sequenced in 3-5 days before drug administration. The 100 mp53-positive
      patients will be trialed, while the others (mp53-negative patients) will be subjected to
      standard treatment or other clinical trials.

      In this study,100 patients with p53 mutations will be enrolled,including newly diagnosed AML
      aged 60-75,AML transferred from Myelodysplastic Syndrome(MDS) and therapy related AML.
