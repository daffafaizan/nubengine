      convalescent plasma in severely ill, mechanically ventilated participants with pneumonia due
      to COVID-19. This study will enroll adults 18 years old and older, including pregnant women.
      A total of 50 eligible participants will receive 2 units of convalescent plasma collected
      from ABO-compatible donors who have recovered from COVID-19. Participants will receive
      convalescent plasma on Study Day 1 in addition to standard of care. Participants will be
      assessed daily while hospitalized and then on Study Days 15, 22, 29, and 60. All participants
      will undergo a series of safety, efficacy, and laboratory assessments. Blood samples will be
      collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 29, and 60.
      Oropharyngeal or endotracheal samples will be collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma
      administration), 3, 5, 8, 11, and 15.
