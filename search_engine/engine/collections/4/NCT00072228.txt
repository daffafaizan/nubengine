      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of soblidotin and gemcitabine in patients with
           locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and soblidotin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
      8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of soblidotin and gemcitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival every 3 months after completion of study therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
