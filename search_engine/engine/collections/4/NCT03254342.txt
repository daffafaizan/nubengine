      (Paxil) or citalopram (Celexa) or escitalopram (Lexapro) brain concentrations using MRS
      technology in depressed patients.

      The longer-term goal is to determine the relationship between clinically administered doses
      of paroxetine (Paxil) or citalopram (Celexa) or escitalopram (Lexapro) (antidepressants), the
      amount of drug in the body via blood level, the concentrations of the drug achieved in brain
      measured via MRS, and genetics.

      It has been previously reported that individuals taking 20mg of paroxetine daily had brain
      paroxetine [(Paxil) levels via MRS ranging from 2-13 micromolar. Similar or slightly higher
      ranges of brain drug concentrations have been reported for fluoxetine and fluvoxamine.

      Since not all depressed patients respond to medications, one reason may be the amount of
      medication that crosses the blood-brain barrier. This may be influenced by genetic
      information. We want to examine these issues on a larger scale, but first we need to
      demonstrate that we can indeed determine paroxetine [(Paxil) or citalopram (Celexa) or
      escitalopram (Lexapro)] levels via MRS.
