      long-term course of fatigue. In addition, information shall be gained on the current state of
      fatigue treatment and care in Germany and on the needs of affected patients.

      Data will be collected by mailed or online questionnaires at 6, 9, and 12 months as well as
      2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-diagnosis from 2000 cancer patients. Besides questionnaires on
      socio-demographic, clinical and patient reported outcomes, saliva samples will be collected
      in order to gain new insights into biological mechanisms. Moreover, detailed data on
      screening, diagnosis and counseling as well as therapies offered and administered to reduce
      fatigue will be surveyed, as well as the patients' state of knowledge, perception and
      prevailing needs regarding fatigue. Tumor and cancer therapy data will be extracted from the
      Epidemiological Cancer Registry.

      The results of the LIFT study aim to contribute to an improved, evidence-based and
      individualized treatment to avoid and ease cancer-related fatigue and will further promote
      patient-oriented offers and treatments.
