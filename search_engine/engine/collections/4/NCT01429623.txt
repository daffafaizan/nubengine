      and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines in pre-clinical models. Study assessed its safety
      and potential efficacy in a 3-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2
      clinical trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients from 16 centers in
      Austria, Germany and Israel with MCI (Albert et al 2011), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) =
      0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) > 24, Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised Verbal Paired
      Associates â‰¤ 18, and medial temporal lobe atrophy were stratified by APOE4 genotype and
      randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) using blocks of 4, to receive either ladostigil, 10 mg per
      day, or placebo as identically-appearing capsules. The primary endpoint was onset of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Secondary endpoints were the NTB, DAD, and GDS. Exploratory
      outcomes were MRI-derived whole brain, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex volumes; the
      NeuroTrax Mindstreams computerized cognitive battery; and the CDR. Between February 17, 2012
      and August 1, 2013, we randomly allocated 210 patients to placebo (107 patients) or
      ladostigil (103 patients); 4 patients in each group lacked post baseline assessments. After
      36 months 20.4% (21 of 103 patients) of the placebo group and 14.1% (14 of 99 patients) of
      the ladostigil group progressed to AD (log-rank test p=.16). There were no significant
      effects on NTB, DAD, or GDS outcomes. There was less decline in whole brain volume in the
      ladostigil group as compared to placebo (p<.02), but not hippocampus and entorhinal cortex
      volumes, and CDR and a trend for less decline on the RAVLT total delayed score component of
      the NTB (p=.09). Fourteen patients taking placebo and 21 taking ladostigil discontinued
      treatment because of adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported by 26 (25.2%)
      patients in the ladostigil group and 28 (26.2%) patients in the placebo group. Ladostigil
      appeared safe, well-tolerated, and may have potential for improving memory and delaying
      progression to dementia.
