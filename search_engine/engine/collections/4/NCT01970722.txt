      I. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) followed by postoperative normothermic intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is feasible
      and safe to administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine quality of life (QoL) and compare the outcomes to a historical control of IP
      chemotherapy (no HIPEC) for women with ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC alone is feasible and safe to
      administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      III. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To collect biospecimens and perform
      correlative translational studies focused on understanding the mechanisms of action of HIPEC
      on ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo surgery and receive hyperthermic cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 60
      minutes.

      Beginning at least 3 weeks after surgery, patients may receive carboplatin, paclitaxel,
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IP or
      intravenously (IV) at the discretion of the medical and gynecologic oncologists.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and 12-15
      months; every 3 months for 1 year; and then every 4 months for 1 year.
