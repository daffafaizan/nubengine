      prior to surgery for patients undergoing radical cystectomy for treatment of bladder cancer.
      As many as 50% of patients who undergo radical cystectomy experience a postoperative
      complication, and poor preoperative nutritional status is known to increase the risk of
      complications. Preoperative use of a high-arginine protein shake has been shown to reduce the
      risk of postoperative complications for patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer, and
      this study seeks to determine whether this is also true for patients undergoing radical
      cystectomy for bladder cancer.

      Subjects will drink four protein shakes (Nestle Impact AR) per day for 5-7 days prior to
      radical cystectomy. Shakes will be provided to patients free of charge. On the date of
      surgery, subjects will turn in a log of shake consumption. Surgery will then proceed in
      typical fashion, and no changes will be made to surgery or postoperative care. Clinical
      outcomes for the first 90 postoperative days will be collected. Patient outcomes will be
      compared to those of contemporary controls who do not undergo supervised nutritional
      supplementation. Primary study outcome is to assess safety, tolerability and adherence to
      supplementation regimen. Secondary outcomes include differences in complication rates and
      length of postoperative hospital stay between groups.
