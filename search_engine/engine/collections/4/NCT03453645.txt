      assessment criterion have been described targeting the substratum, the cardiac nervous tone
      or the trigger of arrhythmias. Development of ventricular tachycardia ablation in the past
      few years show interesting results preventing the recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.

      Rhythmic risk assessment criterions have never been studied in relation with ventricular
      tachycardia ablation. The purpose of this study is to explore the modifications of these
      criterions after ventricular tachycardia ablation.
