      Acupuncture may effectively relieve the pain of discogenic sciatica, but the evidence is
      limited.

      Methods/Design: Sixty patients with discogenic sciatica will be recruited and randomized to
      receive acupuncture or sham-acupuncture at a 1:1 ratio. Patients in both groups will receive
      treatment 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The following acupoints will be used: Dachang shu (BL
      25), Shenshu (BL 23), Weizhong (BL 40), and Chengshan (BL 57).
