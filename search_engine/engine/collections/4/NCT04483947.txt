    
      This study is a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study in
      participants with NASH and fibrosis stage between F0 (no fibrosis) and F3 (bridging
      fibrosis), and who are homozygous for the PNPLA3 148M risk allele.

      The study will comprise of:

        1. A Screening Period with a maximum of 60 days.

        2. An 8-week dosing period during which participants will be resident of the study site for
           Dose 1 and Dose 3. Dose 1 will have participants reside at the study site from the day
           prior to study intervention administration (Day -1) until at least 2 days after study
           intervention administration with discharge on Day 3. Dose 2 will be administered at the
           study site on Day 29 with no overnight stay. Dose 3 will have participants reside at the
           study site from the day prior to study intervention administration (Day 56) until at
           least 2 days after study intervention administration with discharge on Day 59. All study
           interventions and PD assessments will be administered after a 10 hour fast.

        3. Each participant will be followed for 15 weeks post last dose (approximately 5× t½; t½
           is estimated to approximately 22 days); however, the length of follow-up may be
           shortened or extended if the actual t½ is considerably shorter or longer than predicted.

      The study will be performed at approximately 15 to 20 study sites in the United States (US).
      Up to 60 male and female participants of non-childbearing potential will be randomised into
      the first 3 cohorts of this study in order to achieve 48 evaluable participants.
