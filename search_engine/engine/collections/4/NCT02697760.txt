      diagnostic and prognostic information over relative perfusion alone. Recent development of
      dedicated cardiac SPECT cameras with better sensitivity and temporal resolution make dynamic
      SPECT imaging more practical. The potential roles of myocardial perfusion in subjects with
      cardiovascular risks and heart failure warrant further investigations.

      The present project aims to develop and validate the noninvasive measurement of MBF and MFR
      by using dynamic imaging with a CZT camera, and evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic
      implications.
