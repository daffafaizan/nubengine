      undergone treatment with weekly paclitaxel for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer
      and have either responded or have not progressed after a minimum of 4 cycles of treatment.

      In this study patients will receive 3 weekly pembrolizumab until progression and the
      investigators will monitor the immune microenvironment by tumour biopsy and blood sampling
      before starting pembrolizumab and again before cycle 4 of treatment. The clinical endpoint
      will be to demonstrate a worthwhile improvement in the 6 month median PFS and to study
      possible predictive markers or response to pembrolizumab. This is a non-randomised phase II
      study, and the population may be different from those who received paclitaxel and
      bevacizumab.
