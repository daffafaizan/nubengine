      Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method. Patients will receive single-agent abiraterone 500 mg
      orally, once daily (continuous dosing) along with prednisolone at 5 mg BD for up to 4 weeks.
      Upon confirmation of PSA progression, tildrakizumab IV will be started and given once every
      4-weeks in combination with the fixed dose abiraterone (and prednisolone). The starting dose
      of tildrakizumab will be 100mg with single dose escalations to 300mg and 600mg to determine
      the RP2D to take forward to the Phase II study. Depending on the number of responses
      observed, dose levels that are deemed tolerable may be expanded to up to a total of 10
      patients who are evaluable for response

      The Phase II study will employ a two-stage Minimax design, recruiting up to 25 patients.
      During the first stage 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2
      cycles each. If there are one or more responses confirmed at least 4-weeks later an
      additional 10 evaluable patients will be recruited. If 4 or more responses are seen in the 25
      patients evaluable for response, the combination will be deemed successful, warranting
      further evaluation in subsequent phases of testing. In the phase II study patients will start
      taking 500mg abiraterone as an oral tablet once daily along with 5mg of prednisolone twice
      daily on Day -28 for the first 4 weeks. Upon confirmation of PSA progression, the
      tildrakizumab will be given as an intravenous infusion at the dose established in the Phase I
      safety run in part of the study in combination with the abiraterone (and prednisolone)from
      Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards.
