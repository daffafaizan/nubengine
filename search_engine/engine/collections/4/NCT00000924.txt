      supported by recent studies in both children and adults. However, as of yet, few combinations
      of antiretrovirals have been studied in large cohorts of stable HIV-1 infected,
      antiretroviral-experienced children. Evidence suggests that viral suppression may be more
      difficult to achieve in children. Therefore, it is important to develop new drug combinations
      which can maximally suppress plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations in children.

      Patients are stratified by prior antiretroviral treatment (zidovudine [ZDV]/lamivudine [3TC]
      versus d4T/other treatment) and by age (under 24 months versus 24 months and older). Patients
      are then randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups.

      Arm A1: ddI/NFV/RTV (for prior ZDV/3TC-treated patients). Arm A2: ddI/NFV/RTV (for prior
      d4T/other-treated patients). Arm B1: d4T/NFV/NVP (for prior ZDV/3TC-treated patients). Arm
      B2: d4T/NFV/NVP (for prior d4T/other-treated patients). Treatment is administered for 48
      weeks. At Weeks 2, 4, and then every 4 weeks thereafter, patients undergo physical
      examinations, and blood samples are drawn to measure viral load. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/27/00:
      Patients in Arms A1 and A2 may continue to receive medication for an additional 24 weeks.
      While on the treatment extension, patients must continue their current schedule for study
      drug administration and completion of study visits. Patients in Arms A1 and A2 who have
      reached Week 44 participate in an enteric-coated ddI pharmacokinetic study as part of this
      24-week extension. Patients who were enrolled in Arms A1 or A2 and who were taken off study
      after reaching Week 48 may be re-entered onto the study at Week 52 regardless of the number
      of weeks they have been off study.]
