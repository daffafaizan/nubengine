      fibrillation. electric isolation of the pulmonary veins, from which atrial fibrillation is
      originating in most patients, is cornerstone of all atrial fibrillation patients.

      The most common cause for AF recurrence is still incomplete isolation of the pulmonary veins,
      on the other hand, only 80% of paroxysmal and 60 % of persistent patients can successfully be
      cured from atrial fibrillation (despite of isolated pulmonary veins after multiple ablation
      procedures).

      By now, non-procedure related predictive risk factors, resulting in recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation after catheter ablation, are only partially identified, such as obesity,
      hypertension and sleep apnea.

      In the past year several genetic risk alleles were identified, which are associated with
      atrial fibrillation. By now the relation between genetic risk, which is determined for every
      patient by its specific genotype and the outcome of catheter ablation in paroxysmal and
      persistent atrial fibrillation has not yet been investigated.

      The aim is to investigate the influence of genetic risk for the recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation after catheter ablation.
