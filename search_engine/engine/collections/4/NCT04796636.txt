      randomised, open-label, trial in 30 ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the
      intravenous administration of two stepped doses of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for 48
      hours leads to a reduction in duration of vasopressor requirement and an improvement in organ
      failure scores and blood biomarkers of sepsis compared to standard care.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 30 g of vitamin C twice daily for 48
      hours (+ 30 g load) (n=10), 60 g of vitamin C twice daily for 48 hours (+ 30 g load) (n=10)
      or usual care (no vitamin C) (n=10).

      Vitamin C is provided by the manufacturer (Orthomolecular Medisearch Laboratory P/L,
      Braeside, Victoria, Australia) as 30 grams in 100 ml. At study commencement (T = 0) patients
      randomized to either vitamin C arm will receive a loading dose of 30 grams of vitamin C
      infused through central venous access via a dedicated line over 2 hours (50 ml/hr =15 g/hr).
      In patients randomized to 60 g/day, this will be immediately followed by an infusion of 30
      grams of vitamin C (100 ml) over 6 hours which will then be repeated at 14, 26 and 38 hours
      (i.e., 2 days of treatment). In patients randomized to the higher dose, two vials (200 ml =
      60 grams) will be infused through a central venous catheter over 6 hours immediately
      following the 30 gram loading dose. This dose will be repeated at 14, 26 and 38 hours (i.e.,
      2 days of treatment). Patients in the control arm will receive usual care.

      The investigators also plan to describe the pharmacokinetic parameters of high-dose
      intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients with septic shock. These results will inform
      a subsequent multi-centre, blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial to determine
      the efficacy of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for the reversal of septic shock and
      potentially improved survival.
