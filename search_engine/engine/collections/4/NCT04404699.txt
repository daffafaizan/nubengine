    
      Patients with diabetic foot and mild to moderate PAD (WIfI - Ischemia 1 or 2) with baseline
      TcPO2 values 30-50 mmHg will be included into the study. TcPO2 will be measured on the feet
      in different angiosomes. During this measurement a stimulation test consisting of a modified
      Ratschow test involving 2 minutes of exercise will be conducted. Specific TcPO2 parameters
      will be assessed during the whole procedure (resting TcPO2 before stimulation test, minimal
      TcPO2, delta TcPO2 (minimum TcPo2 minus resting TcPO2) percentage decrease of TcPO2 during
      the stimulation test and TcPO2 recovery time (time to the adjustment of TcPO2 to the resting
      values).

      All TcPO2 parameters detected during TcPO2 stimulation test will be correlated with
      parameters of macrocirculation (systolic blood pressures (SBP) on tibial arteries and their
      Ankle-Brachial Indexes (ABI), toe pressures (TP) and toe-brachial indexesTBI) and DUS
      findings (monophasic/triphasic flow in relevant artery supplying measured angiosome)
