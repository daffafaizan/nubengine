      The research will be conducted in the gastroenterology section of the department of Medicine

      these hospitals are tertiary care centers with adequate facilities for the safe and
      appropriate conduct of this research. Participants must meet all eligibility criteria and

      (patients with IBS and participants without IBS). Patients will be enrolled into one of these
      two categories based on their medical history, signs and symptoms and questionnaire. There
      are no controlled compounds used in this study. There is no treatment involved in this study.
      There are 2 study related visits per subject.

      Based on questionnaire we plan to recruit 25 participants who meet the criteria of IBS and 25
      participants who do not meet the criteria of IBS (Total of 50 participants in the study).
      Patients with IBS are those who meet the criteria of IBS based on their symptoms and the
      responses to a validated ROME III - questionnaire. All other participants who do not meet the
      criteria for IBS are classified as non-IBS participants. All the participants should be
      having a clinically indicated colonoscopy.
