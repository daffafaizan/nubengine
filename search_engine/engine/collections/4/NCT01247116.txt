      objective parameters such as 6 minute walk distance to determine when to add a second oral
      agent (1). This often entails observing deterioration in the patient on a single agent before
      instituting the second one. This strategy could be problematic, as patients may never recover
      the function lost due to progressive PAH (2). In addition, given the malignant nature of the
      clinical course of PAH in many cases and the nature of the underlying proliferative
      vasculopathy, some have argued that altering this paradigm to resemble that used in cancer
      chemotherapy may be more appropriate (3). That is, "induction" therapy at diagnosis with
      multiple agents followed by a maintenance phase of treatment might offer significant benefits
      to the patient.

      This open-label pilot study is the first to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of
      a first-line combination strategy in consecutive patients with PAH in contrast to the
      "add-on" strategy for combination therapy. It will serve as the basis on which to consider
      larger, multicenter investigations of this strategy.
