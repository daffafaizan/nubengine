      used for the first time in pregnant women, the following three step application procedure has
      been determined:

        -  First five pregnant women use the device for 10 minutes. Each of them in a position and
           module proposed by the midwife with the agreement of the woman.

        -  Next 10 pregnant women use the device for 20 minutes. Again, position and module
           according to the decision of the midwife with the agreement of the woman.

        -  All the remaining pregnant women (35) use the device for 30 minutes. Position and module
           according to the decision of the midwife with the agreement of the woman.

      During the intervention period, position and module might be changed once if required.

      After the inclusion of all the 50 participants, each position and module has to be tested.

      There will be a safety review board consisting of one physician, one midwife and a clinical
      expert midwife meeting after each group of pregnant women having used the device, evaluating
      the safety criteria according to predefined Adverse Device Effects and Adverse Events.
