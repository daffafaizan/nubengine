      surface of brown seaweed has unique ingredients and different kind of brown seaweed has
      slightly different effectiveness. The strongest fucoidan among all seaweed for inhibiting
      cancer cells is in Okinawa Japanese waters. For chemically speaking, the major components for
      fucoidan consisted of mainly fucose which is a kind of polysaccharide with strong biological
      activity. However, patients need to take actual fucoidan in order to reach the best
      effectiveness for inhibiting cancer cell.

      Studies reveal special function of fucoidan so far include anti-virus, anti-tumor,
      immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, blood fat, anti-oxidation and liver and kidney
      dysfunction and improve fibrosis. The subject of this study focus on assessing the impact on
      the metabolism of fatty liver and liver fibrosis after taking oral FucoHiQ capsules.
