    
      Growing Together is a two-armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a trauma and
      evidence-informed therapeutic parenting intervention, BRIGHT. This trial lasts approximately
      9 months.

      BRIGHT has been offered to young children ages birth through 6 years and their parents
      affected by substance use disorders (SUDs) to mitigate the effects of trauma, promote
      resilience, and enhance the quality of parent-child relationships and parenting skills.
      BRIGHT has been successfully piloted and evaluated within residential treatment and
      outpatient opioid treatment programs for pregnant women/mothers with SUDs and OUDs with young
      children .

      For this study, BRIGHT has been adapted for home-based delivery for pregnant women receiving
      treatment for OUDs and is offered from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy until the infant is
      about 6 months old. Participants in both arms will be recruited from a high-risk
      maternal-fetal medicine clinic and followed for approximately 15 months. The two arms of the
      trial are 1) the BRIGHT (Building Resilience through Intervention, Growing Healthier
      Together) intervention, and 2) STAR. Both arms of the study will receive the typical standard
      of care of at a high-risk maternal-fetal medical clinic and 7 monthly psycho-educational
      handouts on child development specifically for mothers in recovery.

      The investigators are testing the effectiveness of the adapted version of BRIGHT by utilizing
      measures to examine if participation in BRIGHT decreases the likelihood of child
      maltreatment, improves parent-child relationships, parenting capacities, the mother's overall
      mental health, participation in OUD treatment, and infant social-emotional development.
