      consenting patients after coronary angiography. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves
      were used to identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl. The
      predictive value of V/CrCl for the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy was assessed using
      multivariate logistic regression.Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with creatinine
      clearance < 60 ml/min,diabetes,emergent angiography.
