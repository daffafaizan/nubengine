      reflects the activity of spinal motoneurons. These neurons are the last order neurons in all
      neural pathways involved in motor control. Modification of the afferent neural activity,
      whatever its level (spinal or supraspinal), will affect the excitability of spinal
      motoneurons and thus EMG activity. Combined with electrical and/or magnetic stimulation of
      peripheral nerve and/or cortical structures, it is possible to test indirectly the
      excitability of corticospinal and spinal reflex pathways involved in human motor control. One
      of the novelties is that we will investigate the interneurons that are activated by motor
      axons or afferents inputs from affected muscles (distal musculature: hand/wrist or foot/ankle
      muscles), which control clinically unaffected muscles (proximal musculature: elbow or knee
      muscles). This has a threefold interest i) functional exploration of clinically unaffected
      muscles that are never evaluated in ALS patients, ii) to better interpret the EMG signal and
      to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the change in EMG activity,
      and iii) to determine if interneuron pathology manifests before detectable change in the
      motoneuron. The conditioned EMG and threshold tracking methods will be used to evaluate the
      excitability of spinal interneurons in ALS patients, as compared to sex and age-matched
      healthy subjects.
