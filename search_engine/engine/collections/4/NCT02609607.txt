      dysfunction, and these difficulties with bowel function are often ranked as negatively
      impactful on quality of life as impaired mobility. Despite the significant clinical burden of
      these symptoms, there remains a paucity of published literature supporting specific
      therapeutic options to manage anorectal dysfunction in this clinical population. Most bowel
      regimens rely on either oral laxatives (i.e. PEG-3350) or anti-diarrheal agents (i.e.
      loperamide). In their study, the investigators propose to establish the efficacy of a bowel
      regimen that combines both oral agents (as needed; standard care) with scheduled, every other
      day dosing of a placebo or stimulant laxative rectal suppository -- bisacodyl 10 mg.

      Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative medication that is available over-the-counter. It works by
      activating nerves in the rectum to elicit rectal contractions which ultimately leading to
      defecation.
