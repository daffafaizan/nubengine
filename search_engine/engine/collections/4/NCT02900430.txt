      during neutropenia induced by chemotherapy. Their incidence ranged between 5 to 25% according
      to the literature. Mortality may reach 30%. Our study described IA incidence in AML patients
      treated by intensive chemotherapy depending on antifungal prophylaxis by posaconazole. From
      2009 to 2011, any patients received antifungal prophylaxis. From 2012 to 2015, patients
      received posaconazole during induction and salvage chemotherapy. During the all study period,
      efficacy of posaconazole is evaluated according to construction/demolition periods in
      hospital. All patients are hospitalized in High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration
      system.
