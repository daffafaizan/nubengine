      pIL-12 followed immediately by electroporation (IT-pIL12-EP). A minimum of ten patients with
      biopsy-accessible triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be treated in this study.
      Additional patients, up to a maximum of 25 patients, may be enrolled based upon
      pharmacodynamic observations and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, in
      consultation with the Sponsor. All patients will receive a single 28-day treatment cycle. One
      lesion will remain untreated (the control lesion). Treatment will be administered on Days
      1,5, and 8 of the single 28-day cycle. Treatments will consist of direct injection of pIL-12
      into tumor lesions, followed immediately by electroporation of the lesions. At the end of the
      treatment cycle, patients will return to clinic for a final safety evaluation and tumor
      biopsy. This end of study (EOS) visit will occur prior to initiating any new anti-cancer
      therapy/regimen.

      All patients will undergo tumor biopsies at two separate timepoints for molecular and
      histological analyses associated with the primary endpoint. At least one lesion will be
      biopsied at Screening (pre-treatment sample). Biopsies of the untreated control lesion and at
      least one treated lesion will be obtained at the EOS visit (post-treatment samples).
      Additional tumor biopsy samples may be requested if there is either tumor regression or
      progression prior to EOS.

      Duration of participation will be approximately 4 weeks for each patient. A patient is
      considered to have completed the study if all three IT-pIL12-EP treatments (Days 1, 5, & 8)
      and all required pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies have been obtained and EOS safety
      follow-up evaluations have been performed.
