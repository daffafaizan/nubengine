      for subcutaneous administration (SCIG). It is supplied as a liquid formulation ready to use.
      One important therapeutic use of immunoglobulins is to provide antibodies to prevent viral
      and bacterial diseases (replacement therapy). Children and adults with a Primary
      Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) have an increased risk of recurrent bacterial and viral
      infections. These diseases can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity. Responses to
      antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most primary immune deficiencies are not
      curable, but SCIGs have been shown to decrease the total number of severe infections and the
      duration of hospitalization. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      octanorm in adult PID patients in an open-label, multi center, phase 3 study with an 8-week
      wash-in/wash-out period followed by a 6-month efficacy period
