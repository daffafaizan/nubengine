      promote mental well-being in adolescents who are already displaying some depressive symptoms.

      A further objective is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel self-motivated physical
      activity intervention, which has been designed for this project.

      The final objective of this project is to investigate alternative intervention delivery
      modes, for an adolescent sample with subclinical depressive symptomatology, i.e., presenting
      with some depression symptoms but not at a level where major depressive disorder would be
      diagnosed. We aim to compare the effect of a completely mediated delivery approach for
      physical activity (i.e., no researcher contact) and a mediated intervention with face-to-face
      contact and fortnightly check-in telephone calls.
