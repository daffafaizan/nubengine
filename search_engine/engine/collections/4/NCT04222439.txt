      potential in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal
      lesions. However, there is still a blank in recognition of all gastrointestinal diseases.
      This study aim to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm for the diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal diseases. Then, evaluate the accuracy this new artificial intelligence(AI)
      assisted recognition system in clinic practice.
