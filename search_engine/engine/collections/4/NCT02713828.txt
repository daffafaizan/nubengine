      estimated at one million and increasing to 10 million by the year 2025. In the United States,
      despite the declining incidence in white males in recent years, lung cancer is still the
      second most frequent cancer in both men (next to prostate) and women (next to breast cancer).

      This is an open-label, single arm study of glembatumumab vedotin, a fully-human IgG2
      monoclonal antibody. The activity of glembatumumab vedotin may be greatest in patients who
      overexpress the target, gpNMB.

      This study will include a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximum safe and tolerated
      dose. This will be followed by a 2-stage Phase II expansion. During Phase II Stage 1,
      approximately 20 eligible, treated patients will be enrolled. If ≥ 2 patients achieve a tumor
      response [Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)]; an additional 15 eligible,
      treated patients will be enrolled in Stage 2, for a maximum total of 35 eligible, treated
      patients.

      Glembatumumab vedotin will be administered once every 3 weeks, as a 90-minute intravenous
      (IV) infusion.

      Patients will continue treatment until disease progression or intolerance. Tumor assessments
      will be performed every six (±1) weeks for six months, and every nine (±2) weeks thereafter,
      until progression.

      A tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or biopsy) will be sent to
      a central laboratory and tested for gpNMB. Research blood samples will also be required.
