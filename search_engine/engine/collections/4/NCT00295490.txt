    
      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging two-centre study PREPARATIONS FOR
      INVESTIGATION: Devil's Claw (AllyaÂ®)/placebo as tablets

      STATISTICAL METHODS:

      Analysis on an intention to treat basis.

      The following tests will be performed and all statistical significance will be set at p <
      0.05:

      Primary efficacy analysis: The primary outcome will be the reduction in WOMAC total score
      from baseline to week 16. The week 16 means for the four treatment groups will be compared
      using an analysis of covariance taking account of baseline assessments and any demographic
      differences, age, gender, etc, which are found to be significant. Multiple comparison tests
      will be used to examine specific differences of initially specified interest, such as the two
      highest doses of Devil's Claw versus placebo.

      Secondary Efficacy Analysis: Similar analyses of covariance will be used to examine treatment
      group differences at week 16 compared with baseline for WOMAC subscales (pain, stiffness and
      physical function), and Quality of Life assessments (SF-36). Changes in the subject's
      well-being and overall global assessment will be compared using appropriate non-parametric
      tests, e.g. Mann-Whitney test or MacNemar's test. Changes in attitudes and health beliefs to
      CAM will be assessed using Chi-Squared tests.

      Safety Evaluation: Group differences between adverse event reporting will be assessed by
      descriptive methods.
