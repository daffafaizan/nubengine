      developed in ovulation induction, oocyte retrieval, fertilization capability and embryonic
      development. However, the end point which is to improve implantation and pregnancy rates
      after transferring embryos, remains below physiological expectations. It has been estimated
      that clinical implantation in the human is efficient in no more than 30% of cases considering
      that only one embryo is present in natural cycles, which gives us a 30% implantation rate.

      A frequent pitfall found in the literature is the consideration that implantation is the
      result of good embryonic quality. Although this is completely true, it is not the only truth
      because the maternal endometrium is at least of equal relevance. In ovum donation, the
      endometrial factor could also be improved by individualizing the implantation window in each
      patient. In this proposed research we will analyze suggested markers of endometrial
      receptivity in order to optimize human implantation in patients undergoing assisted
      reproductive technologies focusing on improving endometrial receptivity in IVF and ovum
      donation patients.
