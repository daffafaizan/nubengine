    
      This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which
      approximately 270 participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who
      had failed or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy were to be randomized (1:1) to one
      of the following treatment groups:

        -  Treatment A (N = 135): Capecitabine + ruxolitinib

        -  Treatment B (N = 135): Capecitabine + placebo

      Treatment consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was self-administered for the
      first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered during the entire
      cycle. Treatment for all participants was to continue as long as the regimen was tolerated,
      and the participant did not meet discontinuation criteria. Participants who discontinued
      treatment continued to be followed for subsequent anticancer treatments and survival.
