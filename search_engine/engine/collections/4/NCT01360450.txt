      Specific Aim 1

      To determine the efficacy and short-term safety of clonidine in reducing the severity of
      iatrogenic neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) by decreasing the time required for complete
      sedative and analgesic drug detoxification. The investigators will enroll 88 neonates at risk
      for having moderate to severe NAS in a randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial
      comparing opioid/benzodiazepine administration combined with a placebo (control) vs.
      opioid/benzodiazepine combined with clonidine. Principal outcome measure will be the
      difference in length of treatment for complete detoxification. Early safety of clonidine will
      be determined by monitoring for cardiorespiratory side effects that might be associated with
      clonidine use in this high risk population.

      Specific Aim 2

      To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clonidine in this critically ill
      infant population. The investigators will estimate the dose-exposure-response relationship of
      clonidine in neonates at risk for developing iatrogenic by using nonlinear mixed-effects
      population pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis.
