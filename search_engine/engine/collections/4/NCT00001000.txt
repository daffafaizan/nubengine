      the subsequent immune deficiency, which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro
      studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the
      toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the
      brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course
      and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential for
      proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical problems.

      Ten healthy volunteers and 10 HIV-infected patients are randomized between ampligen or
      placebo group. Five volunteers in each group receive a single dose of ampligen on day 1 and a
      single dose of placebo on day 8. The other 5 volunteers receive the drug and placebo on day 8
      and 1, respectively. Seven days of observation and testing follow each administration of drug
      or placebo and also allow the body to eliminate the drug.
