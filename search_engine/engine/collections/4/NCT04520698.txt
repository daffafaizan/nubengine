      Palliative Leaders In Facilities to Transform care for Alzheimer's Disease) intervention and
      to assess the implementation context of the intervention using a hybrid 1 trial design. The
      UPLIFT-AD intervention includes 1) in-house PC champions trained to facilitate goals of care
      conversations with residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and their
      surrogate decision-makers, screen residents for symptoms and other PC needs, provide symptom
      management and serve as a liaison to external PC consultants; 2) specialty PC consultants who
      provide consults for complex residents and families; and 3) primary PC education for nursing
      home (NH) staff. The study will use a randomized, stepped wedge design involving 16 diverse
      NHs in Indiana and Maryland and 640 residents, 640 family members and/or surrogate
      decision-makers, and 320 nursing facility staff.
