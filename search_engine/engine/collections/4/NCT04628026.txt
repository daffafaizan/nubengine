    
      Prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical
      study. The randomized phase of the study will be preceded by a feasibility run-in
      dose-escalation phase in patients with AML in which the venetoclax dose for the phase 3 part
      will be established.

      After the feasibility run-in phase, eligible patients will be randomized to intensive
      chemotherapy with venetoclax or placebo. Patients will receive two cycles of induction
      chemotherapy; patients achieving CR or CRi after two cycles will continue with consolidation
      treatment according to initial randomization, and according to Cooperative Group-specific
      consolidation regimens or investigator choice. Patients achieving morphologic leukemia-free
      state (MLFS) only, may also continue consolidation treatment on protocol. Assignment to
      either allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), conventional chemotherapy or
      autologous HCT will be done according to institutional standards, and based on (prognostic)
      disease characteristics, individual patient assessment, and established comorbidity risk
      scores (e.g., HCT-CI score).
