    
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-centre, phase I/IIa study to characterize the
      safety and clinical activity autologous clonal neoantigen reactive T cells (cNeT)
      administered intravenously in adults with metastatic or recurrent melanoma.

      Patients will initially enter the study for procurement of tumour materials required to
      manufacture ATL001.

      Following manufacture of ATL001, the product will be given back to eligible patients
      following lymphodepletion. Patients will be followed up for a period of 24 months post ATL001
      infusion in the study. Patients will then be requested to enter a separate long term follow
      up protocol for a further 5 years (total 84 months)
