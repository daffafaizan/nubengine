      diameter of both nasal cavity in radiological images of nose (CT scan/MRI) at the level below
      the inferior turbinate and floor of nose at different levels in coronal planes. Smallest
      diameter will be considered to calculate the outer diameter of NTT, hence the size. The side
      of nasotracheal intubation will be decided after view the radiological images and the
      estimated size of NTT will be used. Finally the ease of intubation and complications will be
      recorded.
