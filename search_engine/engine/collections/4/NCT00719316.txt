      kidney disease (CKD) patients. Apart from the so called traditional risk factors, also risk
      factors more or less specific to CKD contribute in the pathogenesis of these problems. There
      is strong evidence that the sympathetic hyperactivity, which often characterizes CKD, is one
      such factor. Previously, we have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)
      and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) reduce but not normalize this sympathetic
      hyperactivity. We re-analysed the cohort of patients who were investigated in the past and
      subsequently treated according to present guidelines. The results show that, despite of
      treatment, the unfavourable relation between sympathetic hyperactivity and clinical outcome
      still exits. This might mean that treatment is insufficient. In present study, we want to
      study the effect of Aliskiren 300mg on sympathetic nerve activity.
