      causing up to 20% of hospitalizations in this patient group (1). To improve prescribing and
      thus reduce undesired drug effects is a great challenge for doctors and nurses in primary
      health care.

      Performance of drug utilization reviews is recommended in order to reduce the negative impact
      of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly. However, scientific evidence on their efficacy
      is lacking, especially regarding patient-related health outcomes (2,3). Most studies are
      carried out in inpatient care, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding primary
      health care (2). Moreover, studies in this scientific field diverge regarding the content and
      structure of drug utilization reviews, which implies that comparison between studies becomes
      challenging, if not impossible.

      This trial aims at educating health care providers in how to perform drug utilization
      reviews, and to help them implement theory into practice.
