      in the lungs. This feasibility study is being conducted to assess the ability of the
      investigator to access and sample tissue using this system in patients undergoing lobectomy
      or pneumonectomy. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor is conducted
      immediately prior to the scheduled lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

      Note: This study was conducted as a single-center feasibility clinical trial to determine the
      feasibility of this device. The primary outcome measures related only to feasibility and not
      to health outcomes. Therefore it was not registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to the start
      of enrollment. Subsequently, it was determined that the results were compelling and therefore
      it was registered to facilitate publication.
