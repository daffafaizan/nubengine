      I. To estimate whether CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin) therapy either increases the disease
      control rate at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma as compared to an
      historical Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience or produces an objective response rate
      in patients without previous eribulin (eribulin mesylate) treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and toxicity profile of CDX-011 in patients with recurrent
      osteosarcoma.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of CDX-011 in adolescents and young adults with
      recurrent osteosarcoma enrolled at COG sites and COG phase I consortium sites only.

      III. To determine if there is a relationship between tumor GPNMB expression by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and response to CDX-011 therapy.

      IV. To estimate, in the cohort of patients previously treated with eribulin, the proportion
      who will experience disease progression during the first 4 months of CDX-011 therapy and the
      proportion of patients who experience a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST)-defined complete or partial response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
