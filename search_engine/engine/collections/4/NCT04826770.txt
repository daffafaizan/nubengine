      study aiming at elucidating the kinetics of vaccine-specific antibody production after
      COVID-19 vaccination in health care workers at the Greifswald University hospital.
      Participants regularly received two i.m. doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, BioNTech/Pfizer) with
      a time distance of 21 days, or two i.m. doses of ChadOx1 nCov-19 (AZD 1222®, Oxford
      University/Astra-Zeneca) with a time distance of 12 weeks. Within the study, volunteers
      donate peripheral blood on each day of vaccination as well as 7 and 14 days after each
      vaccination, and EDTA plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared and stored
      at -20 °C. The vaccinees are also asked to complete a questionnaire (asking for previous
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, side effects of the vaccination, and atopies) on each day of blood
      sampling.
