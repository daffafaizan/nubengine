      antigen lot of V212, or placebo. To comply with regulatory requests, results for all lots of
      V212 were combined for the primary and secondary efficacy and safety evaluations (Protocol
      Amendment 2); all planned comparisons between the V212 lots were exploratory and are not
      included in this disclosure. Further, by regulatory request, the V212 High Antigen Lot was
      not included in the efficacy analyses for concerns that its inclusion would inflate the
      efficacy estimates (Protocol Amendment 4).
