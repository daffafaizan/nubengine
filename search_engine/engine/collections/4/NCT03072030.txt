    
      This clinical trial is designed as a double blind randomized placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate immunogenicity of medicinal product GamEvac-Combi - Combined Vector-Based Vaccine
      against Ebola Virus Disease, 0.5 ml+0.5 ml/dose.

      The study includes three periods: screening, administration of the investigated product and
      follow-up. Vaccine will be administered to groups of volunteers (each group will include not
      more than 40 volunteers at a time; a new group of volunteers cannot be hospitalized before
      the earlier vaccinated volunteers are discharged from the hospital. In total, 8 visits will
      be held, including a screening visit; two of the visits will take place during the inpatient
      stage and six - during the outpatient observation.

      Study design in the both facilities will be the same for all volunteers, except that the
      biomaterial collected for immunogenicity evaluation from volunteers included in the study in
      the Russian Federation will be delivered directly to the testing laboratory; biomaterial from
      volunteers included in the study in the Republic of Guinea will undergo primary specimen
      processing, be frozen and stored under the assigned temperature conditions in the research
      center and, as biomaterial is accumulated, it will be transported in a fridge to the study
      site.

      In addition, laboratory tests for such concomitant infectious diseases, as yellow fever,
      Denge fever, Ebola and Marburg virus diseases will be carried out for epidemiological
      indications (i.e. in the endemic regions if disease cases are reported).
