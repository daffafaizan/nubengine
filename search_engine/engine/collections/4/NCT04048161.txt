      majority of children relapse, and about half of them have frequent relapse or steroids
      dependence after treatment with steroids alone. Some children experienced steroids-resistance
      after multiple relapses, and eventually developed into chronic kidney dysfunction. Long-term
      or repeated application of large doses of steroids will lead to side effects such as obesity,
      growth retardation, and hypertension. Although the treatment of steroids with
      immunosuppressive agents is a new choice for the treatment of such patients, traditional
      immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine A will bring some serious
      irreversible side effects, while immunosuppressive agents tacrolimus has the dual effects of
      immunosuppression and podocyte protection, and is more widely used in the department of
      nephrology, what's more, the other immunosuppressive agents mycophenolate mofetil has
      advantage of no kidney toxic, less adverse reactions and higher safety, which gradually being
      valued by nephrologists in recent years. This study mainly compares the efficacy and safety
      of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of children with frequently
      relapsing or steroids-dependent nephrotic syndrome, in order to provide a more effective and
      safer treatment for children with nephrotic syndrome as well as the therapeutic medication
      options.
