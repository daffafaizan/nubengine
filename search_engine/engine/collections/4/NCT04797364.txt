    
      Children with moderate to severe mental health conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety, OCD) or
      neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, ADHD) are frequently
      prescribed medications as either the sole form of treatment or in combination with
      psychotherapy. However, up to 50% of these children will not respond or experience burdensome
      adverse drug reactions to these medications. Current use of mental health-related medications
      (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) in children can be best described as a
      trial-and-error process that can impact the well-being of those taking the medications and
      their families at a considerable economic cost. However, this trial-and-error process could,
      in part, be avoided through the application of pharmacogenetic testing, a specific type of
      genetic testing that has the potential to improve drug efficacy and reduce the morbidity,
      mortality and cost associated with adverse drug reactions. The aim of this project is to
      implement and evaluate an evidence-based pharmacogenetic testing service to improve drug
      treatment outcomes in children receiving mental health care.

      Our objectives are to:

        1. Implement Canada's first pharmacogenetics testing service to improve drug treatment
           outcomes in children receiving mental health care.

        2. Collect performance, outcome, and economic indicators related to the pharmacogenetics
           testing service.

        3. Establish a research platform for the discovery of new genetic and non-genetic markers
           of drug treatment outcomes relevant to mental health care in children.
