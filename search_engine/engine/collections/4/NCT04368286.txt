      humidification therapy apparatus can improve the postoperative recovery and functional status
      of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU after the withdrawal of the
      catheter.Inclusion criteria: age 18-95;The hemodynamics were stable, that is, 50 < heart rate
      less than 120 beats/min, 90 < systolic blood pressure < 200mmHg, 55 < mean arterial pressure
      < 120mmHg.Do not increase the dose of vasopressor for at least 2 hours;Intracranial pressure
      was stable and there was no seizure within 24 hours.The breathing condition was stable, that
      is, the oxygen satiety of the patient's finger vein was â‰¥88%, and the breathing frequency was
      >10 and< 35 times/min.Exclusion criteria: pregnancy;Acute myocardial infarction.A total of 50
      patients who are sequentially treated with high-flow humidification therapy apparatus after
      extubation in ICU are randomly assigned. The experimental group receive respiratory
      rehabilitation therapy, while the control group only receive routine medical treatment. All
      the enrolled patients underwent rehabilitation evaluation and bedside diaphragmatic
      ultrasound measurement.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the CPLA General
      Hospital (project No.2018-212-01). The following clinical datas were recorded for all
      patients through the unified database software: The rehabilitation program was formulated
      according to the cluster management strategy of ABCDEF and the six-step method of early
      activities.All of the patients in monitoring vital signs, every day at hospital group and all
      peripheral muscle MRC assessment, 30 s sit stand trial, modified Barthel index, Borg dyspnea
      score, arterial blood gas analysis, diaphragm ultrasonic monitoring by the bed, finally the
      experimental process on the patients whether using noninvasive ventilator, whether for
      endotracheal intubation again, whether to have new complications (pressure sores, aspiration,
      thrombosis, etc.) and the patients bed time statistics for the first time. Statistical
      analyses were conducted by SPSS 21.0 and a two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered significant.
