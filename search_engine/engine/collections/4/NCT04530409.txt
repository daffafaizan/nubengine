      features in common with a rare haematological condition called haemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis. Immune suppression should help such patients. By contrast, immune
      suppression during the early phase of the viral infection might allow increased viral
      replication and aggravate the disease.

      The 3C-like proteinase on SARS-CoV-2 (nsp5) inhibits HDAC2 transport into the nucleus, and so
      impairs the way in which it mediates inflammation and cytokine responses, so activation of
      histone deacetylase by dexamethasone may directly oppose the action of SARS-CoV-2.

      Timing of of corticosteroids administration is very important in COVID19 cases for the
      recovery and decrease the mortality.
