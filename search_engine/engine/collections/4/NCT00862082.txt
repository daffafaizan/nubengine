    
      A randomized phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, study with a single arm phase I portion to
      determine the appropriate dose of PR104 combined with sorafenib, followed by a phase II
      portion with randomization between sorafenib and sorafenib/PR104.

      Following informed consent, subjects will undergo baseline evaluation with history, physical
      exams, blood work and disease assessment. Selected subjects will undergo PK assessment of
      sorafenib, PR104 and PR104 metabolites.

      In the phase I portion of the study, the starting dose of PR104 will be 770 mg/mg2 in
      combination with standard dose sorafenib. PR104 will be administered on an every 4 week
      schedule with the dose of PR104 escalated in a standard phase I fashion (3 subjects per
      cohort, dose escalation between cohorts) in order to determine the MTD of PR104. Cohorts may
      be expanded up to 12 subjects to better define toxicity at a particular dose level. Following
      determination of the MTD of PR104, new subjects will be entered into the phase II portion of
      the study. [Note: the Phase II portion was never initiated]

      In the phase II portion of the study, subjects will be randomized between sorafenib, 400 mg,
      by mouth (PO), twice a day (the approved dose and schedule) versus sorafenib with PR104 at
      the dose determined in the phase I portion of the study. PR104 will be administered every 4
      weeks (one cycle). Subjects will be evaluated each week during cycle 1 and every two weeks
      thereafter. A disease assessment will be performed after every two cycles. Subjects with
      progression will be removed from study. Subjects with a response or stable disease may
      continue on study if this is considered beneficial by their physician.
