      assessment of diabetic patients before the occurence of diabetic retinopathy. Since OCT is
      capable of imaging retina with such a high precision, retinal changes occuring before any
      clinical signs of retinopathy, such as microaneurysm or haemorrhages, can now be assessed. In
      the present study the investigators are analyzing the connection between retinal arteries and
      veins regarding lumen diameter, vessel wall thickness and their correlation with retinal
      nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer thickness. Moreover, using binarization of the
      choroid the investigators will assess its relationship with outer retina layers, such as
      retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors.
