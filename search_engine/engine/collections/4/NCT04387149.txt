      operations, has been shown to cause injury to other organs, particularly to the kidneys and
      brain. Matrix Metalloproteins (MMPs) are ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes that degrade
      extracellular matrix and have been shown to be involved in injury to transplant kidneys. To
      date, no interventions are available to decrease the risk of cardiac surgery associated-acute
      kidney injury (CSA-AKI).

      NGAL is a known indicator of injury to kidney, thus making it a promising biomarker for
      CSA-AKI. It may be that a single biomarker will not be sensitive and specific across the
      spectrum of CSA-AKI. This research investigates MMP-2, -9 and Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and their association with and earlier detection of
      CSA-AKI compared to levels of SCr.

      We hypothesize that increased activity of MMPs are associated with CSA-AKI. Furthermore,
      MMP-2 and/ or -9 may be predictors and/ or biomarkers for the early detection of CSA-AKI
      compared to serum levels of creatinine.
