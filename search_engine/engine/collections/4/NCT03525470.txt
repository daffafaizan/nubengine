      hours and either drink or not drink two 150ml glasses of water during that time. The subjects
      the participate in an fMRI protocol during which they complete a modified version of the
      Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT): a challenging arithmetic task designed to elicit
      autonomic arousal.

      Throughout the morning subjects will their heart rate variability (HRV) monitored. At
      periodic intervals subjects will rate their thirst and mood by visual analogue scales and at
      the end of the PASAT task they rate its difficulty. Changes in body temperature and fluid
      loss (perspiration and urine) and urine osmolality will be monitored.
