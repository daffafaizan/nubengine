      hypertension, dyslipidaemia, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance as well as of more
      distal risk factors of diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, and the
      association between cardiovascular health and its risk factors with general measures of
      well-being and mental health. The new cohort includes collection of qualitative and
      quantitative data in an effort not only to describe the current health status of the cohort
      and assess individual level determinants but also to provide the appropriate context to
      interpret the role of behavioural factors and social circumstances on health.

      Recruitment was completed on a new cohort of 2047 men and women aged 50-69 years from
      patients attending a single large primary care centre, the Living Health Clinic in
      Mitchelstown, a town with a population of 43000 in county Cork. The Living Health clinic
      includes eight GPs, and the practice serves a catchment area of 20 000, with a mix of urban
      and rural residents. Participants were randomly selected from all registered attending
      patients in the 50-69-year age group.
