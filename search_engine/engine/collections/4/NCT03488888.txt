    
      Patients undergoing Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty were submitted to laryngeal mask
      placement after anesthetic induction with Fentanyl 3ucg/kg , Propofol 2mg/kg and Atracurium
      0,5mg/kg and surgery was performed under standard surgical practices.

      Before the surgical incision patients were randomized either to receive a Bilateral
      Pectoralis Major Block(PEC I and II) with Bupivacaine 0,25% with Epinephrine or to receive a
      placebo block with Normal Saline 0,9%.

      After the procedure all patients received a intravenous patient-controlled-analgesia pump
      device with morphine.

      Pain and opioid consumption were assessed with a pain score assessment tool and assessment of
      the pump administration dosage history.

      No NSAIDs or alpha 2 agonist drugs were administered during or after the procedure.

      The maintenance of anesthesia was performed with Propofol and Remifentanil Total intravenous
      anesthesia(TIVA) models in a standardized fashion. Micromanagement of anesthetic drugs was
      performed by the assistant anesthesiologist physician.
