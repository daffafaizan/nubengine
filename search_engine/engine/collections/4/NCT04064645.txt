    
      For phase 1, there will be 5 to 6 volunteer test subjects. For the final validation phase,
      there will be a minimum of 20 volunteer test subjects. All subjects will be 18 or older and
      selected to represent a range of body types including small, average, muscular, and large
      with a range of BMI's.

      Each subject will be connected to a commonly used, FDA cleared ECG Impedance monitor (to be
      used for informational purposes) and an End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor (GE Datex-Ohmeda)
      and BiOSENCY BORA BAND™ wristband monitoring system. The end tidal CO2 monitor will be
      attached to the patient to determine performance of respiratory rate metrics (Reference).
      Each subject will be instrumented with a mouthpiece that allows for measurement of the end
      tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate (Reference) and tidal volume.

      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject. The
      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 breaths per minute; with
      some natural variation from these exact numbers. Paced breathing app will be used. Not all
      subjects will be able to breathe at a constant level for every rate.

      The respiratory rate will be measured simultaneously with EtCO2 (Reference) and the Devices
      Under Test.

      For the data analysis, the EtCO2 monitor will be used to assess the stability of the data. If
      the respiratory rate varies by more than +3 bpm during a one-minute period of the target
      respiration rates, then the data for that period will be considered unstable and removed from
      analysis.

      To 'Pass' this test the BiOSENCY BORA BAND™ wristband (Device Under Test) must demonstrate a
      Respiratory Rate of ≤3 when compared to the Reference End tidal carbon dioxide monitor.
