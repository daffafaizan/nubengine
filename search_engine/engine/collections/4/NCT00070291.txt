      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with recurrent or
           refractory angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma treated with cyclosporine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival of patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily for up to 36 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression during weeks 1-6. Patients experiencing disease
      progression during weeks 7-36, receive an additional 36 weeks of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
