      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Patients treated with Milnacipran will show
      normalization of ventricular lactate levels compared to those treated with placebo, and will
      also show normalization of the increased latency to respond to complex reaction time probes
      compared to those treated with placebo.
