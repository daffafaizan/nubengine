      our normal day-night rhythm negatively influences our metabolic and cardiovascular health,
      possibly leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An important hallmark of
      obesity and T2DM is a decreased skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent
      research indicates that also skeletal muscle mitochondrial function under the influence of a
      day-night rhythm. The main objective of this study is to investigate the presence of a
      day-night rhythm in skeletal muscle energy metabolism (in particular mitochondrial function)
      of healthy young participants. Therefore, subjects will stay at the research unit for 44
      hours, with standardized meals and sleeping time. During this period we will take five muscle
      biopsies, perform indirect calorimetry measurements and blood draws.
