      rates of ACP from the time that the intervention is implemented compared to two time periods
      prior to the intervention. The Comprehensive ACP Program combines two widely disseminated
      interventions to assess impact when used concurrently.

        -  One is VitalTalk clinician communication skills training (www.vitaltalk.org) during
           which the primary care clinicians will practice ACP with simulated patient actors under
           the guidance of a trained VitalTalk facilitator.

        -  The second is the ACP Decisions video decision aids (www.acpdecisions.org) which are
           directed to patients and provide education about ACP. This inclusive ACP approach treats
           patients and clinicians as equal stakeholders providing both with the communication
           skills and tools needed to make decisions about COVID-19 medical care before the
           toughest choices arise.

        -  The training is four cumulative hours, most of which is spent in communication skills
           work, and the remainder learning how to introduce the videos into one's practice. No
           patients participate in the training. The ambulatory practices included in this
           intervention gain access to the ACP Decisions videos, which can be introduced to
           patients. Videos may be seen in clinic or sent to patients' homes via an electronic or
           paper code.
