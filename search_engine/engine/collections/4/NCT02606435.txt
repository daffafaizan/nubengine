      manual thrombus aspiration with no aspiration in patients with acute ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients
      who are diagnosed as STEMI and referred for PCI will be enrolled. They will be randomized 1:1
      to either manual thrombus aspiration with PCI group or PCI alone group.The primary outcome is
      the composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic
      shock, stroke, new or worsening NYHA class IV heart failure during 1 year follow-up. The
      secondary efficacy outcome are stent thrombosis, target vessel revascularization, left
      ventricular function and quality of life during 1 year follow-up.
