      multi-vitamin/mineral therapy on somatic, cognitive, and emotional post-concussion symptoms
      as determined by the Rivermeade Post-concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) within 24 hours of
      admission, post injury day 7, and post injury day 30. The RPQ questionnaires will be given to
      patients older than 60 years, who have been evaluated by the HonorHealth John C. Lincoln
      Medical Center or Deer Valley Medical Center trauma service within 3 hours of sustaining a
      traumatic brain injury (TBI).
