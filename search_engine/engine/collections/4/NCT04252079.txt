      Aneurysmal disease can affect any segment of the aorta, from the aortic root to the aortic
      bifurcation. Juxtarenal Aortic Aneurysms (JAA) (where a specialty designed custom -made
      device (endograft)which has holes, or fenestrations ,on the graft body to maintain the
      patency of the visceral arteries) account for approximately 15% of abdominal aortic
      aneurysms.2

      Successful aortic aneurysm treatment depends on either open replacement or endovascular
      exclusion of the aneurysmal segment with healthy artery proximal and distal to the repair.

      The decision to treat an AAA is based on the associated risk of treatment, the risk of
      aneurysm rupture, the patient's life expectancy, and patient preference.

      The primary determinant of rupture risk is maximum aneurysm diameter, with negligible rupture
      risk in aneurysms <4cm in diameter compared with aneurysms >8 cm . 3, 4.

      The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends repair for all patients of acceptable
      perioperative risk with an AAA â‰¥5.5 cm in diameter as well as all patients with saccular and
      symptomatic aneurysms.5 ,6

      These guidelines also suggest repair for women at a diameter of 5.0 cm.

      Fenestrated Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (FEVAR) and Chimney Endovascular Aneurysm Repair
      (CHEVAR)are both effective methods to treat JAAs
