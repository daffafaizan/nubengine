        -  To implement CyberKnife速 technology for improving palliation in patients with spinal
           metastases.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife速 hypofractionated stereotactic
           radiosurgery in these patients.

        -  To evaluate functional and diffusion MRI parameters in the spinal cord and tumor after
           treatment with Cyberknife速 radiosurgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of gold fiducial markers at the time of open surgical
      resection or percutaneous needle biopsy. Patients then undergo CyberKnife速 hypofractionated
      stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-90 minutes daily for 2-3 days.

      Patients undergo functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging at baseline and then at 6 weeks
      and 6 months after completion of treatment. Patients also complete a pain questionnaire at
      baseline and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
