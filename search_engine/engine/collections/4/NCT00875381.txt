      location, recent sun exposure (during the two weeks prior to the surgery), whether or not a
      follicle was present on the slide, and if so the follicular extension (mm) from the granular
      layer, presence of atypia, nesting, pagetoid spread. Two slides were obtained; one stained
      with Mart-1; the other with H&E. For both, melanocyte counts per high power field (400 X HPF
      magnification) were obtained in three locations of the slide. The mean of the 3 counts was
      used for analysis, though the individual counts were considered in some data summaries (see
      below). Classification of photo-aging according to the Glogau scale was noted by the surgeon
      as type1: "no wrinkles"; type II "wrinkles in motion"; type III "wrinkles at rest" and type
      IV "only wrinkles." Confluence was categorized by the number of adjacent melanocytes as none,
      mild (2 side-by-side), moderate (3-6), or severe (7 or more).
