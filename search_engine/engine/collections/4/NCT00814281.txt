      and fine particulate matter (PM1) in indoor ice rinks. PM1 exposure may disrupt the normal
      nitric oxide (NO)/endothelin (ET)-1 vasodilation system and promote atherosclerosis, and/or
      increase the risk of an acute cardiac event. Our specific aims are 1) to determine whether
      impaired endothelial-mediated vasodilation and forearm muscle tissue reoxygenation rate and
      blood volume change (to reactive hyperemia following artery occlusion) is associated with
      combustion-derived PM1 exposure, and 2) To characterize a PM1 induced mechanism of
      endothelial dysfunction which occurs via a leukotriene (LT)-associated, airway generated
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) mediated pathway. Healthy low PM1 exposed males will be
      evaluated for endothelial dysfunction before and after artery occlusion using high resolution
      ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), before and after moderate exercise in
      blinded high and low [PM1]. Endothelial dysfunction among chronically PMÂ¬1 exposed ice rink
      athletes will be determined to evaluate the feasibility of using this population as a model
      in future studies. TNF-a, IL-8, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, ET-1, NO, and differential cell
      counts will be measured in sputum and serum. [PM1] will be monitored and exposure levels will
      be typical of indoor ice rinks. LT involvement will be assessed in vivo by double-blind
      pharmacological manipulation during PM1 exposure during light exercise. Results will
      demonstrate whether endothelial-mediated vasodilation and muscle hemodynamics are influenced
      by PM1 exposure, and will elucidate an LT initiated TNF-a mediated pathway in ET-1
      upregulation. Our results should provide information for understanding the effects of PM1
      exposure on the atherosclerotic process and cardiovascular risk, and give insight to novel
      treatment and diagnostic modalities.
