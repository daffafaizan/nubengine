      Follow-up Phase. The Screening Phase will occur within 28 days of randomization and will
      include informed consent, a physical examination, and complete medical history to include
      determination of sickle cell genotype and current medications. Clinical laboratory tests to
      be performed include: a Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential and reticulocyte count;
      Prothrombin time(PT) / activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); and serum chemistries
      (BUN, creatinine, total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH). A chest x-ray and MRI/MRA of the
      brain will also be done at Screening to rule out underlying disease.

      If the patient is found through the screening process to be eligible, the 1st Treatment Phase
      begins. Baseline safety assessments and measurement of biomarkers are completed, then the
      subject is randomized to receive rivaroxaban or placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, there is
      a 2-Week Wash-Out Phase. After the Wash-Out Phase, another set of baseline studies are
      performed and the 2nd Treatment Phase begins. For this Phase of the study, the subject
      "crosses over" to receive whatever treatment - rivaroxaban or placebo - that they did not
      receive in the 1st Treatment Phase. After taking the assigned study drug for 4 weeks, the 2nd
      Treatment Phase ends. The subject returns 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment for
      the Follow-Up Phase, consisting of a single end-of-study visit during which safety
      assessments are repeated.
