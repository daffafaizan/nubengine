      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of docetaxel when administered with
           radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
           (Phase I)

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen at the RPTD in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, nonrandomized, prospective, dose-escalation study of docetaxel
      followed by an open-label phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
           weekly for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once
           daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks after completion of EBRT, patients
           receive one or two applications of intracavitary low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR BT)
           comprising cesium-137.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is the
      dose below the MTD.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive docetaxel at the RPTD, EBRT, and LDR BT as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
