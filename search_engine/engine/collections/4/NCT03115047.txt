    
      It is a double blinded randomized control trial.

      Study population: parturients undergoing a cesarean delivery for labor dystocia under
      epidural anesthesia experiencing shivering grade III or IV on the standardized shivering
      scale of Crossley and Mahajan

      Experimental group: dexmedetomidine 0.35 mcg/kg IV in 2 minutes

      Control group: meperidine 0.35 mg/kg IV in 2 minutes

      Primary outcome : Time to stop level III and IV shivering on the Crossley and Mahajan
      standardized shivering scale after the administration of the study drug

      Secondary outcome: Response rate, incidence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia,
      maternal satisfaction and a cost-benefit analysis.

      The hypothesis is that dexmedetomidine will act faster, will have a superior response rate
      with less adverse effects.
