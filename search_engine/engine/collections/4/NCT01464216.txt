    
      A prospective study including 180 consecutive patients with PCa referred to Oslo University
      Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, for surgical treatment. In vivo functional MRI examination will
      be performed within a few days prior to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP). For a
      subgroup of patients FACBC PET will also be acquired prior to prostatectomy. A subgroup of
      intermediate and high-risk patients (D'Amico risk classification) will prior to surgery
      receive an intravenous infusion of the hypoxia-marker pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobeâ„¢-1)*. During
      surgery, bone marrow aspiration and blood collection will be performed for assessment of
      disseminated and circulating tumor cells. High-risk patients will undergo intraoperative
      lymph node dissection. Tumor tissue for molecular analyses will be sampled from prostate
      specimen prior to fixation. Prostate specimen and regional lymph nodes will be
      histopathologically examined for T- and N-classification, Gleason grade, presence of
      micrometastasis and areas of hypoxia. Histological and molecular findings will be correlated
      to MRI and PET findings and clinical data. Patients will be longitudinally followed to assess
      long-time clinical outcome (recurrence, metastatic disease, death).
