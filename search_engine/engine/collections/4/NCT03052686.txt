      d'Oise in France, during 13 years (between 01/01/2000 an 31/12/2013).

      The incidence of uterine rupture increases with increasing cesarean rates. It occurs at a
      rate of 0.08% across all childbirths in France, and 0.5 to 1% of the childbirths on
      cicatricial uterus in France.

      Although the risk factors are known, it is usually unexpected. This is a serious complication
      for the mother (mortality <1%, severe morbidity at 15% ) and for the child (mortality for 3
      to 6 % for childbirth at term, neonatal asphyxia for 6 to 15%) that can occur during
      pregnancy or during labor.
