      Measurements will be made on breastmilk samples collected in Milk Bank but not suitable for
      infants due to bacteriological reasons. 6 Milk Banks well distributed on the French territory
      will be contacted to participate. 180 women will be included. Women who gave their milk and
      correspond to the inclusion criteria (in particular breastfeeding a child under 6 months at
      the time of the donation) will be contacted by the investigator by phone. They will be asked
      to fill in a written consent as well as a questionnaire on socio-demographic data, pregnancy
      related information and potential environmental exposures.

      2 breastmilk samples of 50 mL will be sendsending to the lab for analysis and 2 samples of 50
      mL will be collected.
