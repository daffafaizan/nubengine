      each at least a day apart, the study product (dissolving film) containing approximately 60
      mcg of the major peanut allergen (Ara h 2), equivalent to approximately 1000 mcg of peanut
      protein, will be placed in one of three areas: the sublingual space, affixed to the buccal
      mucosa, and in the vestibular space. Concentrations of Ara h2 in saliva collected at several
      locations over several time points in the mouth will be analyzed by ELISA.
