      implement the BEFORE decision aid in clinical settings that are currently recruiting young
      breast cancer patients for the Reducing the bUrden of Breast cancer in Young women (RUBY)
      Study (www.womensresearch.ca/ruby-study/).

      For this trial 24 participating RUBY sites were grouped into 14 clusters (1 to 3 sites per
      cluster). The decision aid intervention will be sequentially rolled out over the course of 48
      weeks to all clusters. None of the clusters will be switched from control to intervention
      during the first 6 weeks of the study to establish a baseline. Then two clusters will move
      from the control to the intervention every 6 weeks (called a 'step'). There will be 7 steps
      total during the study period. At the end of the 7th step all clusters (i.e., participating
      RUBY sites) will have received the decision aid intervention. The time-point of when the
      clusters will be switched from control to intervention will be randomized.

      The data collection includes obtaining secondary data collected as part of the RUBY study
      from all patient participants who were enrolled in RUBY during the study period. The primary
      outcome is the number of patients reporting that fertility tools were recommended to them,
      based on RUBY participant responses to a 3-month fertility questionnaire. The investigators
      hypothesizes that following the implementation of the decision aid intervention a 20%
      difference will be observed, from 10% in the control to 30% in the intervention, in the
      number of patients who report that someone in their care team recommended a fertility tool.
