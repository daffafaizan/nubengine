      shoulder surgery will be randomized to receive desflurane or total intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol. Regional cerebral oxygenation will be measured using the INVOS 5100C monitor
      (Covidien, Boulder, CO). Depth of anesthesia will be maintained within a Bispectral Index
      range of 40-60. Following positioning, inspired oxygen fraction and minute ventilation will
      be sequentially adjusted. At each set point, regional cerebral oxygenation will be recorded
      and venous blood gas analysis performed. Statistical analysis will be repeated measures
      analysis of variance in which ventilation strategy is the within-subjects factor and
      anesthetic technique is the between-subjects factor; post hoc Tukey's correction will be used
      for multiple comparisons. If simple maneuvers of ventilation and anesthetic technique can
      prevent low brain oxygen levels, patient outcome may be improved.
