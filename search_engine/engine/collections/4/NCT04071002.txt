      of Function (ICF) based approach is appropriate in the management of DRF. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate functional status and activity participation levels of DRF patients.

      The patients were divided into conservative and surgical groups and were admitted to 12-weeks
      rehabilitation period. The evaluation of the body function and structure were done with
      Visual Analogue Scale, algometer, range of motion (ROM) and grip strength. Also, radiographic
      evaluations were done. Activity participation assessments were done with Push-Off Test (POT),
      Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ), Short Form of Disabilities of Arm-Shoulder and
      Hand Questionnaire (Q-DASH) and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT). Mann-Whitney U and
      Wilcoxon Tests were used respectively for intergroup and intra-group comparisons. Statistical
      significance level was p<0,05.
