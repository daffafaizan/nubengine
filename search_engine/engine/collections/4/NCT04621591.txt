    
      This study is a prospective, multicenter case series per standard of care EGD procedures
      using a nonsignificant risk Saneso 360Â° gastroscope. 20 cases will be included at up to five
      (5) clinical sites. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be included and will have
      a clinically indicated EGD procedure performed using the study device. Immediately
      thereafter, patients will have an EGD procedure using a standard Gastroscope (Olympus GIF180)
      by a second endoscopist. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 7 days after their procedure.
      If the procedure is not successful with the study device, the endoscopist will complete the
      procedure with a traditional gastroscope used at each facility.
