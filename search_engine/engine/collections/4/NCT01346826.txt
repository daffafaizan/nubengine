      to the discomfort of patients and limitation of medical resources, the accelerated infusion
      is more desirable if accelerated infusion does not increase the frequency of infusion
      reaction. Recent observational studies showed that the accelerated infusion of infliximab for
      1 hour or 30 minutes did not increase the frequency of infusion reaction if patients had not
      shown infusion reactions during previous 4 infusions for 2 hours. However, there are no
      randomized trials comparing the safety of accelerated infusion protocol and standard infusion
      protocol yet.
