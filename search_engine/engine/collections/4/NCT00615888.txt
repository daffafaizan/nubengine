    
      Prospective randomization of patients admitted with infrarenal aortic aneurysm who undergo
      elective open repair in a "traditional" and "fast track" treatment arm. Main differences
      consist in preoperative bowel washout (none vs. 3L cleaning solution) and analgesia (patient
      controlled analgesia vs. patient controlled epidural analgesia: PCA vs. PCEA). Study
      endpoints are morbidity and mortality, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and
      length of stay (LOS) on intensive care unit (ICU).
