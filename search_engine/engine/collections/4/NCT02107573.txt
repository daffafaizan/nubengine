      rotator cuff musculature. Retracted rotator cuff tears have recently been shown to effect
      both the physical path in which the suprascapular nerve travels, as well as its physiologic
      function.

      This study will be a randomized control trial with long term follow up that will add to and
      elaborate on the positive outcomes reported in other trials. Patients that have a rotator
      cuff tears with greater than or equal to 1 cm of retraction that have failed conservative
      treatment and require operative repair will qualify for the study. They will be randomized
      into two arms: In one arm, patients will undergo suprascapular nerve release immediately
      after their rotator cuff repair; they will be compared to patients that have rotator cuff
      repair with no release of the nerve. Post operatively, at different time intervals, patients
      will be expected to fill out multiple standardized, well established surveys that assess the
      patients pain level and shoulder function.
