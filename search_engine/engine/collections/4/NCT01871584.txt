      indispensable place in the diagnosis and treatment of colon diseases. Diagnostic accuracy and
      therapeutic safety of colonoscopy depends on the quality of the colonic cleansing or
      preparation. Good preparation of the bowel is necessary prior to colonoscopy, to allow clear
      visualization of the bowel wall and any pathology within. The proposed study is a
      post-marketing study in which the study device, the Angel of Water system will be used for
      hydrotherapy of the colon in adult subjects scheduled for elective colonoscopy, instead of
      standard preparation solution. The effectiveness of the hydrotherapy in comparison to the
      standard preparation will be defined by evaluating colon cleanliness, subject's attitude and
      the duration of colonoscopy procedure.
