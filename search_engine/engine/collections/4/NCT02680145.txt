      pessary placement, and by shaping patient expectations and increasing preparedness for
      surgery, we anticipate improving satisfaction and quality of life.

      At the initial office visit baseline symptoms are evaluation with validated questionnaire.

      The patients' will undergo pessary fitting at least 7 days (but no more than 28 days) prior
      to scheduled surgical prolapse repair.

      Symptomatic change from baseline will be assessed with validated questionnaire
      preoperatively.

      The pessary will be removed at the time of surgery, and the patient will undergo surgical
      correction of their pelvic organ prolapse (including all restorative surgical procedures,
      abdominal and transvaginal). A concomitant anti-incontinence procedure will be performed at
      the discretion of the treating physician in consultation with the patient.

      The patients' symptomatic outcome from surgery will then be reassessed by validated
      questionnaire at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively.
