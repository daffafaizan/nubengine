      improving balance and gait as well as reducing the risk of falls in institutionalized elderly
      in a healthcare center. To evaluate this effect, a total of 45 subjects will participate in a
      longitudinal and controlled trial. Inclusion criteria will be over 65 years olds, be
      institutionalized in the center and have ability to read and write.

      Thereafter, participants will be separated into two different groups (experimental and
      control). Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes with different numbers of
      intervention inside. Both groups will be evaluated both at the start of the first session and
      in the last working session.

      The control group performed a geriatric revitalization program as the experimental group.
      Besides this one, experimental group performed a program of proprioceptive exercises. The
      intervention rate will 2 weekly sessions for 12 weeks for both groups (24 sessions), lasting
      55 minutes. The variables analyzed were: the questionnaire risk of falls in hospital (MORSE),
      Tinetti scale, the test Timed Up and Go (TUG), the time of one leg and the Cooper test
      running 12 minutes.

      The data analysis will perform using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS
      statistical software), version 19.0 for Windows, Chicago.

      To determine the normal distribution of the data the Shapiro-Wilks test and comparison by
      ANOVA was performed. The values obtained in the pretest and posttest assessment for each
      variable will be compared by Student t test for related samples or by the Wilcoxon rank test.
