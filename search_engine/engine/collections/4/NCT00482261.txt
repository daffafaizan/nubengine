      monotherapy, responses were observed at doses of 5mg, 10mg and 25mg. The dose limiting
      toxicity of lenalidomide monotherapy was myelosuppression·

      In the International MM-010 and MM-009 studies, lenalidomide was administered at 25mg d1-d21
      (with pulse dexamethasone) of a 28 day cycle. Although the overall response rate and time to
      progression were impressive, a significant toxicity was myelosuppression. The average age in
      these 2 studies was approximately 63 years, some 7 years lower than the median age for
      myeloma. The median number of prior therapies was 2. Thus, if lenalidomide therapy is to be
      optimally applied in an older and/or more heavily pre-treated population, a simpler, less
      toxic regimen would be valuable. Low dose (15mg) lenalidomide (Rev-Lite) with dexamethasone
      may achieve this goal·

      Based on analysis of the MM009 and MM010 data the patients at highest risk for
      myelosuppression and subsequent dose reduction were those over the age of 60 years (approx
      30% risk which increased to approx 50% by 70 years).It is hypothesized that patients with
      lower base-line platelets may also be at higher risk of lenalidomide-induced
      myelosuppression. Little is known about lenalidomide tolerance in patients with impaired
      renal function, consequently patients with relatively poorer renal function will also be
      enrolled into this study.
