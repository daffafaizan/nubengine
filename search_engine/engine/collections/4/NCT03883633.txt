      the typical progression of neurocognitive decline observed in patients with Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) and patients who are exhibiting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is often a
      precursor to an AD diagnosis. For this study, there will be no distinction made between
      participants who have been diagnosed with AD and those who show signs of MCI.
