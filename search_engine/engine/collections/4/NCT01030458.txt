    
      Primary objective:

      Sitting systolic blood pressure (average of three readings) will be the primary outcome
      variable.

      Secondary

        1. To compare the time interval between the two treatment groups, which after randomisation
           will be required, to reach and maintain the target defined as a blood pressure below 140
           mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic;

        2. To compare the duration of follow-up, during which a steady blood pressure control will
           be achieved;

        3. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events, symptoms, biochemical abnormalities and ECG
           changes in the two treatment groups;

        4. To assess the adherence to antihypertensive treatment as well as the rate of drop-outs
           in both treatment arms during a six-month period.
