      increase of bone mineral density and reducing the risk of fractures. These studies are mainly
      performed in adolescents and there are few results obtained from European adults subjects.
      Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of football practice on the regulation
      of bone turnover in Spanish adult football players. Secondary objectives include: describing
      bone mineral density values, evaluating percentage of total lean mass and body fat,
      describing dietary and physical habits and analyzing blood tests of professional football
      players. As well as, they include updating the current state of knowledge of the influence of
      sports on bone. Thanks to the collaboration agreement "Aula Endavant" the Villarreal CF
      participates as a collaborator in this Project. This agreement allows us to use their
      facilities and to analyze several football players' data. In addition, different members of
      the club will directly participate as researchers during the development of this study.

      One of the strengths of this study is that the data were obtained from two consecutive
      seasons of an elite soccer team.

      One of the potential limitations that we have faced in this study is that in order to obtain
      a large sample, it is necessary to analyse the soccers from two consecutive seasons, which
      makes the study temporarily longer than desired.
