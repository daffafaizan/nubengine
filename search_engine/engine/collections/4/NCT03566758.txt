      and the recently developed COAST (Comprehensive Older Adult Screening Tool) has not been
      studied. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to test the correlations between
      muscle mass, measured by BIA, and COAST. The population to be studied will be older adults
      (n=150). Participants will be included if they are 60 years or older, willing to have weight,
      height, handgrip and body composition measured, willing to provided demographic information
      and answer questions related to their nutritional and health status. Individuals will be
      excluded if they have had recent surgery to the hands, severe rheumatoid arthritis in both
      hands or have a pacemaker or other implanted device. Participants will be recruited from
      community groups in Florida. Participants muscle mass will be measured using BIA. Also, their
      handgrip strength will be tested using a dynamometer. Weight and height will be measured and
      demographic information will be collected. In addition, the participants will be given COAST
      (5 questions related to their nutritional and health status). The associations among BIA,
      handgrip strength and the COAST will be analyzed.
