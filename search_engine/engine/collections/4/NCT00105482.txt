    
      This is a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 25 mg naltrexone for
      smoking cessation in a sample of 270 male and female weight-concerned smokers. Participants
      also receive transdermal nicotine replacement therapy during the first 8 weeks of the study,
      which they begin on their quit date. Naltrexone study medication will be started a week
      before their quit date and continued through the six-month period. Brief behavioral
      counseling and research assessments are provided for two sessions prior to the quit date and
      then weekly for two weeks, bi-weekly for a month and every four weeks thereafter. A follow-up
      appointment is completed at 12 months after participants' quit date.

      The primary outcomes are six-month point prevalence abstinence and post-cessation weight gain
      for those who are continuously abstinent (not even a puff).

      Secondary outcomes include an examination of alcohol consumption, evaluation of urges, other
      measures of smoking cessation success, point prevalence abstinence at 12 months, and food
      preferences. A number of tertiary measures will be obtained for examining predictors of
      smoking cessation, weight gain, and naltrexone response.
