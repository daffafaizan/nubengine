      for 13% of deaths globally. Approximately 30% of the adult population suffer from
      hypertension and of those diagnosed and treated, only 30-50% have adequately controlled blood
      pressure. At present, the importance of hypertension as fundamental risk factors is
      inadequately addressed among many patients and physicians.

      Design The aim of this prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre clinical trial is to
      enhance blood pressure control in primary care by introducing a standardised and simplified
      titration regime with single pill combinations (SPC), comprising an angiotensin receptor
      blocker, calcium channel blocker and hydrochlorothiazide.

      The trial will randomise 42 family doctors or resident specialists for internal medicine
      (enrolling 840 patients with treated or untreated hypertension) to either experimental care
      or standard care for hypertension, latter according to the 2013 European Society of
      Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension.

      Practitioners randomised to experimental care will up-titrate antihypertensive therapy with
      SPCs in 4-week intervals if the target blood pressure of < 140/90 mmHg is not reached at the
      respective follow-up (Figure 1).

      Study Outcomes The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients achieving the
      target office blood pressure after 6 months of follow-up. The main secondary endpoint will be
      the improvement of 24h ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) profile, measured at inclusion and
      after 6 months of follow-up.

      Safety assessments include the evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events, particularly
      hospitalisation, worsening of renal function, peripheral oedema and hypotension.
