    
      In this prospective, randomized, matched design pilot study, we aim to compare the current
      standard of care FHCA to PermeaDerm速.

      30 patients for each study arm (n total = 60) meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled
      to randomly receive FHCA and PermeaDerm速 on two adjacent or symmetric body areas.

      Prior to randomization of study areas and application of study dressings, baseline
      assessments of wound size and burn depth will be performed by the experienced physician and
      documented using photography and when indicated laser Doppler (Moor Laser Speckle速, Moor
      Instruments, Devon, UK) measurements. Percentage of graft take and wound healing after
      removal of the temporary wound dressings and secondary autografting (study arm 1) or after
      excision and direct autografting with wiedely-meshed autograft and temporary wound dressings
      as overlay (study arm 2) will be assessed.

      Secondary outcomes will include complications such as infections, signs of
      rejection/non-adherence, fluid accumulation/hematoma beneath dressings and mid- and long-term
      clinical scar maturation, as assessed by the POSAS and objectively with the DermaLab Combo速
      device (Cortex Technology ApS, Hadsund, Denmark).
