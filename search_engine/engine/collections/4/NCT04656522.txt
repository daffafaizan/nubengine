      Bidi Bidi is the largest refugee settlement in Uganda and the second largest globally. In
      humanitarian settings, sexual and gender-based violence disproportionately impacts women and
      children. However, there continues to be a lack of evidence regarding both sexual violence
      prevention and post-rape care interventions in low- and middle-income humanitarian contexts,
      with even less evidence supporting adolescents and youth in these settings. Stigma directed
      toward adolescent sexual practices and engagement in sexual and reproductive health services,
      such as contraception, HIV testing, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), is also associated
      with social isolation, violence and mental health challenges. Participatory comics offer a
      youth-friendly, low-cost, scalable approach for preventing sexual violence and training
      clinicians in post-rape care in humanitarian settings. This study aims to develop, implement,
      and evaluate the effectiveness of a comic intervention on preventing sexual violence and
      improving post-rape care with youth aged 16-24 and health care providers in the Bidi Bidi
      refugee settlement. Participating youth and health care providers will take part in 4-hour
      peer-facilitated workshops exploring topics of social, sexual, and psychological needs and
      pro-social interventions (youth) and post-rape care responses and attending to the needs of
      youth refugees who have experienced sexual violence (health care providers) using comics
      developed with qualitative data collected from an earlier study phase. Using a
      pre-test/post-test design, this study will assess changes in participants' PEP knowledge and
      acceptance, bystander behaviour, and sexual violence stigma.
