      an active control condition (computerized cognitive training) (n=20) in improving social
      attention (social engagement latency: SEL) and social brain network in a pilot RCT.

      Participants with schizophrenia will undergo a baseline assessment of cognition, social
      functioning, symptoms and social brain network functioning. These behavioral, clinical and
      neuroimaging (fMRI of social imitation task, and resting state connectivity analyses of the
      social brain network) methods will be used to assess changes.

      Individuals with schizophrenia will be randomized to either the social skills training or the
      computerized cognitive training at baseline. They will then participate in 10 sessions of
      social skills VR training or computerized cognitive training (1 hour per session, twice a
      week for 5 weeks).

      In addition, long-term social outcome will be assessed approxinately 2 months after the end
      of training with the Social Functional Scale (Birchwood, 1991) and the SANS and SAPS for
      clinical symptoms. For the long-term outcome assessment, no imaging or behavioral assessments
      will be conducted because the primary goal of the follow-up is to assess broad levels of
      social functioning in the real world and because there is not sufficient time within the R33
      mechanism.

      16 matched control participants will be recruited to obtain behavioral and neuroiaging
      comparison data for optimal performance levels but these healthy control participants will
      not undergo social skills training.

      Lastly, at the end of the R33 project, if this adaptive VR technology shows that it can
      improve social attention, which in turn improves social outcome in schizophrenia, it will be
      possible to refine the protocol to make the method more accessible, less burdensome and
      widely available in the future by moving towards a mobile application.
