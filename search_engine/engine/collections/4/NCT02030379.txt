      utilizing QPLs and will use the QPL-CT as an example. The investigators will leverage
      e-technologies to provide an online version of the QPL-CT, that patients access via available
      iPads, enabling both the real-time prioritizing of patient questions as well as the seamless
      delivery of these questions to their treating physician (and other members of their clinical
      team) via the VCU Health System (VCUHS) patient portal, and the EMR prior to a consultation
      to discuss a clinical trial. The investigators will use a pilot randomized clinical trial
      design to demonstrate the efficacy of the online QPL-CT versus a paper and pencil QPL-CT to
      increase question asking, patient understanding of trial information and reduce patients
      conflict over their upcoming decision to join a trial
