      method to treat kidney stone disease. The unmodified Dornier HM3 has over 90% stone free rate
      in most studies. The MH3 requires immersion in a full bath, necessitating dedicated operative
      space. The new generation model F2 uses water cushion as a coupling medium and is easily
      transported. The generators used in both machines are also different. The newer model has the
      advantage of being more convenient due to portability and ease of use of the coupling medium,
      but there have been no prospective studies to compare these 2 machines in terms of efficacy
      of stone fragmentation and clinical outcomes. We seek to compare the HM3 with the F2 models
      in terms of stone free rates, complications and clinical outcomes to determine which machine
      is the most effective and will limit the need for additional stone procedures.
