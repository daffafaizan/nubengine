    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxic effects, and the preliminary
      antitumor activity of indium In 111 pentetreotide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive indium In III pentetreotide
      (OctreoScan) IV on day 1. Imaging is conducted on days 3 and 6. Treatment continues weekly
      for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of OctreoScan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for
      the first year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
