      worldwide remain persistently infected with HBV. Persistent infection is associated with
      chronic liver disease that can lead to the developement of cirrhosis and hepatocellular
      carcinoma in two-third of persons. Treatment of chronic hepatitis B relies on the use of
      analogs such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir or immunostimulators such as interferons.
      Although analogs are efficient, genotypic resistance occurs after one year of treatment and
      the rate of virologic relapse is high after treatment discontinuation.

      HBV is a non cytopathic virus and liver damage is caused by immune response against infected
      hepatocytes and to a non specific inflammatory response. Immune response contributes to the
      virus clearance. In acute hepatitis B infection, T cell response is polyclonal, specific and
      vigorous, whereas in patients with chronic infection, responses remain weak, less specific
      and hardly detectable in peripheral blood.

      T cell responses could be induced or restored by antigenic stimulation such as vaccination.
      In a previous phase I clinical trial, we showed that DNA vaccination with plasmid pCMVS2.S is
      safe and can specifically, but transiently activate T-cell responses in chronic HBV-carriers
      not responding to current antiviral therapies.

      Analogs such as lamivudine and adefovir were shown to enhance T cell responses concomitantly
      with viral load decrease. In this phase I/II clinical trial, we would like to determine if
      DNA vaccination of chronic HBV patients under treatment with NRTI can restore T-cell
      responsiveness and delay virologic reactivation after treatment discontinuation.
