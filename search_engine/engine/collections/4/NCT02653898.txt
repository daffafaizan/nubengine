      achieving significant reduction in malaria cases in military encampments on the
      Thai-Cambodian border. The study will compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of
      monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) to monthly focused screening and treatment (FSAT). This
      study will thus investigate the effectiveness of two potential interventions for malaria
      elimination. Subjects in the monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) arm will receive a standard
      3-day treatment course of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on months 1, 2 and 3 and weekly
      low-dose primaquine (22.5mg for 12 weeks). Volunteers in the focused screening and treatment
      (FSAT) arm will be screened monthly and then treated for malaria following national treatment
      guidelines. For G6PD-deficient volunteers in the FSAT arm, primaquine will be administered
      weekly (45mg for 8 weeks) as radical curative and/or presumptive anti-relapse therapy. For
      G6PD normal volunteers with vivax infection, primaquine will be administered daily (15mg for
      14 days). All FSAT volunteers with confirmed P. falciparum infection will receive a single,
      low dose (15mg) Primaquine as a P. falciparum transmission-blocking agent. The incremental
      benefit of an insecticide treated uniform (ITU) will also be assessed as a single-blind
      sham-controlled intervention in addition to personal protective measures currently employed
      by the RCAF. Volunteers will be followed monthly for a total of 6 months, to determine the
      proportion remaining malaria-free on day 180 following enrollment.
