      epidural anesthesia will be performed in the standard fashion employed in the investigators'
      institution by a fellow or staff. Spinal ultrasound will be used prior to performing the
      epidural catheter insertion. The trans-catheter electric stimulation test (TCEST) will be
      performed at both a 0.1ms pulse width and a 1ms pulse width. The order in which the two pulse
      widths are applied will be randomly decided by computer. The test dose of local anesthetic
      will then be administered, and the TCEST will be repeated 5 minutes later. Again, both pulse
      widths (0.1ms, 1ms) will be used, and the order in which they are applied will be decided
      randomly.

      Following the second testing, a loading dose of the standard anesthetic solution will be
      administered. The sensory level to ice will be tested at 20 minutes following injection of
      the loading dose of bupivacaine and fentanyl. The sensory level will be assessed from the
      sacral to the thoracic levels, bilaterally. The motor response pattern will be recorded for
      all TCESTs performed, and any relationship between pulse width and response pattern will be
      determined.
