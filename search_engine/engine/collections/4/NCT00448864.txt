    
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study designed
      to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels of ecallantide compared to placebo in
      reducing chest tube drainage in participants requiring CPB for primary CABG, single valve
      repair, or single valve replacement. Participants were randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to
      ecallantide high-dose regimen (maximum 91 mg), ecallantide low-dose regimen (maximum 15 mg),
      or placebo. Randomization was stratified by surgical procedure so that participants
      undergoing valve replacement would be evenly distributed across treatment arms. Each
      participant received active drug or placebo administered in stages on the day of the surgical
      procedure after induction of anesthesia (Day 1).

      Participants were screened up to 14 days prior to surgery. Additional study procedures were
      conducted on Day -1 or 1, peri-operatively, during the immediate postoperative period, and on
      Days 2, 4, and 7 (or at the time of discharge from the hospital), and between Days 28 and 43
      (follow-up).
