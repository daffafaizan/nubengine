      outcome of ARDS, and with respiratory complications post cardiopulmonary bypass have already
      been demonstrated. Based on physiological effects of angiotensin II, we hypothesized that the
      I allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme Insertion/Deletion polymorphism may be
      associated with a higher risk of acute renal failure in critically ill patients.
