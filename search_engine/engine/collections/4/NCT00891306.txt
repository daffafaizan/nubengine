      chylomicronemia and hence hypertriglyceridemia. Clinically the most severe manifestation of
      chylomicronemia, is acute pancreatitis, which can be lethal. There is no effective therapy
      available to modulate the course of the illness and prevent complications for these patients.
      The current clinical management consists of severe reduction of dietary fat that is hard if
      not almost impossible to comply with. LPLD subjects continue to experience pancreatitis
      attacks, and are admitted to intensive care units on several occasions.

      Alipogene tiparvovec corrects or restores lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function long term, and
      hence reverses some symptoms, halts the disease progression and prevents further
      complications. Alipogene tiparvovec gene therapy ensures that a catabolically beneficial
      variant of the human LPL gene, LPL[S447X] is expressed and active in the relevant tissues in
      humans. Delivery of the gene is realized via intramuscular injection of an adeno-associated
      viral vector, pseudotyped with AAV1 capsids.
