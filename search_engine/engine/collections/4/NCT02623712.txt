      comparative effectiveness trial of more intensive versus less intensive CT surveillance of
      patients found to have small pulmonary nodules in diverse health care settings. The goal of
      this pragmatic clinical trial is to identify the surveillance strategy that will maximize
      early diagnosis for individuals with cancerous nodules, while minimizing unnecessary
      surveillance of patients without cancer that can result in emotional stress, exposure to
      harmful ionizing radiation, and the discovery of incidental findings that may lead to
      unnecessary treatment.
