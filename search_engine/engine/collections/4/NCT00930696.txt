    
      In a consecutive series 20 women with full thickness resection for deep endometriosis
      received randomly, at the end of the procedure, a standard abdominal rinsing (n=10) or
      extensive abdominal lavage with 8 Liters of saline (n=10). C-reactive protein and white blood
      cell count values were collected daily for 7 days. Women were observed for complications
      during the first post-operative week and during the follow up at 1 and 6 months.

      The primary end point was to evaluate the effects of extensive abdominal lavage on
      post-operative inflammation. Secondary end-point was to explore the potential protective rule
      against post-operative bowel complications.
