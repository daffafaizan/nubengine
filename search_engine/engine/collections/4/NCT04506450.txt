    
      All patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Enrolled
      patients will be informed of the study modality. In case of a favorable opinion, the patient
      will be made to sign the informed consent. Subsequently a code will be assigned to the
      patient for randomization.

      There are two randomization groups: in the PNB group the patient will undergo lumbar plexus
      block, sciatic nerve block, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block and lateral branch of
      iliohypogastric nerve block, while in the SA group, the patient will undergo subarachnoid
      anesthesia and lumbar plexus block.

      In the preoperative room, ECG, pulseoximetry will be estabilished and an arterial radial
      cannula will be inserted under local anesthesia to monitor blood pressure. A premedication
      with midazolam (0.05-0.1 mg / kg) will be administered before anesthesia is performed.

      At this point, the type of anesthesia will be followed on the basis of the randomization
      group.

      The following variables will be evaluated:

        -  hemodynamic parameters in the perioperative period

        -  onset time of the sensory and motor block

        -  fluids and vasoactive drugs administered

        -  anesthesiological complications

        -  degree of patient satisfaction

        -  duration of surgery

        -  degree of postoperative pain and analgesic therapy administered

        -  mini mental state evaluation (in the preoperative and postoperative period)

        -  start physical rehabilitation

        -  clinical complications during hospitalization

        -  duration of hospitalization
