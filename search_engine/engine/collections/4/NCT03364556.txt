      dietary habits of adults with untreated, undiagnosed celiac disease has not yet been
      observed, but presents a critical piece in understanding the effects of the disease on bone
      health. Objective was to evaluate differences in nutritional intake of calcium, vitamin D,
      and phosphorus; serologic indices of these nutrients; and bone health among adults with and
      without celiac disease.

      Cross-sectional data from What We Eat in America (WWEIA) and the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-14 was analyzed, including self-reported dietary
      and supplement intake from one day of 24-hour recalls, serologic indicators, and dual x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scans were analyzed in adults (n=49) testing positive for celiac disease
      to the tissue transglutaminase endomysial antibody assay (tTG-EMA). Statistical analysis
      included multiple linear regression modelling controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, energy
      intake, and poverty income ratio.
