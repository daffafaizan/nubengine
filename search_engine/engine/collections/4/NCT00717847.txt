    
      Background:

      Although some success has been achieved in identifying Epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) mutations as a molecular predictive marker of response in patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), this strategy is likely only to be limited as not all responding
      patients have a mutation in their tumor and conversely, not all patients with a mutation were
      responders. Furthermore, as the development of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      (TKI) such as gefitinib, erlotinib is inevitable and poses a major clinical problem due to
      limited therapeutic options, the identification of a molecular profile that could predict
      sensitivity to erlotinib or gefitinib is warranted.

      Hypothesis:

      Using serum as an easily accessible biological fluid, we hypothesize that EGFR TKIs modulate
      tumor changes that may be reflected in the alteration of serum proteins.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish the serum proteomic changes in NSCLC patients receiving erlotinib or
           gefitinib.

        -  To identify a serum protein profile that predicts erlotinib or gefitinib sensitivity or
           resistance in NSCLC patients with and without EGFR mutations.

        -  To study the toxicity of erlotinib or gefitinib by correlating clinical toxicity with
           serum protein profile.

      Significance:

      An extensive profiling of the molecular circuitry affected by EGFR TKIs would be helpful in
      understanding the response and side effects of patients with NSCLC treated with erlotinib or
      gefitinib and could guide therapy and thus improve patient outcome.
