        -  Evaluate the value of the pre-operative Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level,
           and clinical stage in predicting the risk of failure and death in patients who have
           undergone radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patient medical records are reviewed to collect data about pre-treatment prostate biopsy,
      assigned Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and radionucleotide bone scan.

      Patients complete a Bowel Toxicity questionnaire to assess quality of life related to acute
      and long-term bowel toxicity after radiotherapy.
