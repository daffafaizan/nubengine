      set of these data to report on pilot data on preliminary outcomes, acceptability and
      feasibility of the implementation of the COMPASS: Acting Mindfully for a Valued Life, based
      upon Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, an evidence-based behavioral intervention and
      facilitated by a licensed clinical psychologist in our department. This intervention was
      implemented as a series of clinical offerings for seven 7-session groups between September
      2015 and October 2018 for 113 individual cancer patients and survivors. Outcomes measured
      include anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, psychological flexibility, mindfulness;
      values based living, and quality of life. Participants completed surveys at 4 time points,
      pre and post, and two followup time points. Measures of demographics, satisfaction and
      feasibility/acceptability were also collected. Insights gathered from this study will be used
      to inform articles, grant applications and conference presentations on the implementation of
      behavioral interventions for cancer patients and survivors.
