      drug to improve the cognitive impairment in patients with depression, and the social function
      and quality of life of patients are affected in varying degrees. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (n-3pufas) are food products with high safety and few adverse reactions. Previous
      clinical trials have also suggested that n-3pufas may help to improve cognitive impairment in
      patients with depression, but the reported results are different. We have developed a new
      generation of n-3pufas optimal proportion combination products and found good cognitive
      improvement effect in animal models of depression. Therefore, this clinical research project
      will screen out the depressive patients with cognitive impairment through the cognitive
      function battery test (MCCB) tool for schizophrenia. On the basis of routine treatment of
      depression, these patients will be added with the cognitive improvement formula n-3pufas
      capsule developed by us to explore the effect of n-3pufas formula on cognitive impairment of
      depression.
