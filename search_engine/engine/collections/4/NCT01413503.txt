           without PD for 3 years after the initial administration on 131I-MIBG therapy.

        2. To describe the response rate of malignant pheochromocytoma patients treated with
           high-dose 131I-MIBG.

        3. To describe the toxicity of high-dose 131I-MIBG in patients with malignant
           pheochromocytoma.

        4. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival of malignant pheochromocytoma
           patients treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG.

        5. To determine the utility of using the serum level of Chromogranin A as a tumor marker
           for patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.
