      care systems. Increases in life expectancy and ageing populations are expected to make MSK
      disorders one of the leading causes of disability by the year 2020.

      When faced with a potentially life changing diagnosis of a chronic disease, people (in
      general) develop an organized pattern of perceptions about their condition, and how it
      impacts their lives and often, the essentially same stressful event may cause significant
      variations in perceptions. These different perceptions and coping strategies might affect the
      way the individual chooses to handle the disease and seek health care assistance, which
      altogether eventually may affect the course of the illness.

      Study participation besides reassurance, could be hypothesized to induce beneficial outcomes
      for the patients, but is it reasonable to expect an effect of study participation regardless
      of study intervention, design and group allocation? And is an eventual effect mainly derived
      from the intervention or from the participants being a selected group?

      It remains to be clarified, whether and how study participation affects the individual's
      treatment effect and perceptions of the illness.
