      old) with brachial plexus avulsion injury who are candidates for high frequency (HF10) spinal
      cord stimulation (SCS). We plan to prospectively observe patients who undergo implantation of
      HF10 SCS for the indication of chronic neuropathic pain of the upper limb following brachial
      plexus avulsion injury.
