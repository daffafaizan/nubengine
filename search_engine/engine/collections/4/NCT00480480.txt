      Setting and Participants: Students attending 10 Bosnian secondary schools exposed to severe
      trauma, traumatic loss, and severe adversity, reporting severe persisting symptoms of PTSD,
      depression, or traumatic grief, and functional impairment.

      Therapy (n=71), or a school milieu intervention (n=73), both conducted by trained school
      counselors.
