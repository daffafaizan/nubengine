      brain functions. As a result, patients who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer may
      experience problems with their attention, learning, and memory that they did not have before
      receiving chemotherapy. The investigators have found that nicotine treatment can help other
      types of patients with similar difficulties with attention, learning, and memory. Nicotine is
      a naturally occurring substance found in tobacco and is known to interact with nerve cells in
      the brain that are important for functions like learning and memory, and has been studied in
      a number of disorders. This study is designed to test whether nicotine treatment is helpful
      for learning and memory problems after chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the effect of
      transdermal nicotine to 1) reduce subjective complaints and 2) enhance cognitive performance
      on laboratory measures of cognitive performance in breast cancer patients with persistent
      chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), a condition also known as "chemo brain."
      Participants will be randomized to either placebo or active compound (50/50) for the 6-week
      treatment portion of the study. Participants will be assessed before, during, and at the end
      of treatment. At the end of the 8-week study, participants will have the option to take part
      in the open-label portion of the study for an additional 6 weeks.
