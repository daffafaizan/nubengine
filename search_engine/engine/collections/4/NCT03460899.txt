      macrovascular diabetic complications. Previously performed studies suggested platelet
      activation in both, hyper- and hypoglycaemic states, leading to a potentially increased risk
      for thromboembolic complications. Hypoglycaemia, in particular severe hypoglycaemic episodes,
      has been associated with increased cardiovascular or overall mortality in previous studies.
      Potential mechanisms include arrhythmias or increased risk for thromboembolism, based on
      platelet activation and/or hypercoagulability.

      The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the impact of hypoglycaemia on platelet
      activation parameters (PAP) during a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp study. We
      hypothesize that Hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM leads to increased platelet activation.

      The primary objective is to investigate platelet activation during different levels of
      hypoglycaemia induced by a stepwise hyperinsulinaemic, hypoglycemic clamp experiment in
      patients with T2DM.

      Active study duration will be 5 days for each study participant. 14 subjects with T2DM
      without history of cardiovascular events or manifest atherosclerosis will be enrolled. During
      this monocentric, single arm, open, mechanistic trial platelet activation and recovery at one
      week after the clamp experiment, changes of pro-atherothrombotic markers during the
      hypoglycaemic clamp as well as counter regulatory hormone response during the clamp will be
      investigated.
