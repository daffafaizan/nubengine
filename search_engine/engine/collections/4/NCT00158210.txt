      methamphetamine use often leads to psychotic behavior. Rivastigmine is an
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is currently approved to treat Alzheimer's-related
      dementia. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of rivastigmine in treating
      methamphetamine dependent individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of two dose levels of rivastigmine or
      placebo for 12 weeks. Participants will be assessed for cardiovascular, subjective, and
      reinforcing effects that are produced by methamphetamine. All participants will partake in
      contingency management sessions through Week 4.
