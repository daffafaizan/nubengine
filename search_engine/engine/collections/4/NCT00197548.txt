      particularly in developing countries. Birth outcomes are also major predictors of child
      health and survival in infancy and beyond. The purpose of this study is to examine the
      efficacy of multivitamin supplementation on fetal loss, low birth weight and severe preterm
      birth in healthy (HIV negative) women. We also aim to determine whether the potentially
      protective effect of multivitamin supplements on the risks of low birth weight and preterm
      birth translate into a sustained reduction in infant mortality.
