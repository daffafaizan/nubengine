      growth with premature epiphyseal fusion, adult short stature, and unknown metabolic and
      psychological perturbations. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and familial male-limited
      precocious puberty (FMPP) are two genetic diseases that result in early childhood androgen
      excess, and CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism
      in childhood. This protocol will elucidate a comprehensive phenotypic profile for patients
      with CAH and FMPP. Data will be collected in a large cohort of patients regarding growth and
      development, hormonal and metabolic factors and psychological characteristics. This protocol
      will allow investigators to compare patients with androgen excess of different etiologies,
      elucidate androgen-mediated and disease-specific phenotypic characterizations, and allow the
      investigators to acquire further knowledge for use in the design of future therapeutic
      interventions.
