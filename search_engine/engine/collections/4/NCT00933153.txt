      intervention, such as oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) is beneficial in this
      population, there is limited research on the effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in
      the Meals on Wheels population. This prospective randomized controlled trial will determine
      the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in addition to daily meals from Meals
      on Wheels on weight status, hand grip strength, quality of life, and malnutrition screening
      scores in MOW clients with or at-risk of malnutrition over a 3-month study period.
