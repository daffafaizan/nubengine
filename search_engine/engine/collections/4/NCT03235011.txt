    
      Sickle cell teenagers receive regular hospital medical care.

      Adolescence is the time when the pathophysiology of the disease is re-explained and when
      questions around puberty (possibly delayed), sexuality and contraception are discussed.

      Sickle cell disease, like any chronic disease, can have repercussion on the development and
      behavior of young patients.

      Knowledge and understanding of young patients with sickle cell disease around these issues
      may be insufficient.
