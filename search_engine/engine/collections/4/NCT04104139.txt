    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride
      (TAS-102) per the proportion of grade 3 or higher adverse events during chemo-radiation
      therapy (CRT) with concurrent TAS-102 at the maximum tolerated dose by allowing no more than
      30% grade 3 or higher adverse events.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety of participants treated with TAS-102 during radiation therapy (RT).

      II. Evaluate treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) attributable to TAS-102 with RT during
      fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminary assess the rates of complete clinical response (cCR) by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and by endoscopy after TAS-102 with concurrent CRT.

      II. To preliminary assess the rates of cCR by MRI and by endoscopy after treatment with
      FOLFOX.

      III. To preliminary assess the rates of pCR after standard total mesorectal excision (TME).

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of TAS-102.

      Patients receive TAS-102 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) Monday-Friday on weeks 1, 3, and 5.
      Patients also undergo intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3-dimensional conformal
      radiotherapy (3D-CRT) 5 days per week on weeks 1-5. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care FOLFOX.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to a total of 16 weeks (3
      months) from end of FOLFOX treatment until rectal cancer surgery or death, whichever occurs
      first.
