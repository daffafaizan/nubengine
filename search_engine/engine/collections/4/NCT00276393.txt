      glycemic variation and hypoglycemia. In order to determine whether use of insulin glargine as
      a basal insulin would result in comparable HbA1c with less glycemic variation and
      hypoglycemia than ultralente insulin, 22 individuals with type 1 diabetes, experienced with
      MDI, and a HbA1c of <7.8 % were randomized, to receive either glargine or ultralente as the
      basal insulin for 4-months. Aspart insulin was used as the prandial. Physicians providing
      insulin dose adjustment advice were masked to the type of basal insulin. Treatment with
      glargine resulted in lower mean HbA1c, less nocturnal variability , and less hypoglycemia
      primarily due to less daytime hypoglycemia (p=0.002). On the other hand, serious hypoglycemia
      and average glucose concentration measured with continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)
      did not differ. We conclude that, while use of either ultralente or glargine as a basal
      insulin can result in excellent glycemic control, treatment with glargine is associated with
      slightly but significantly lower HbA1C, with less nocturnal glycemic variability and less
      hypoglycemia.
