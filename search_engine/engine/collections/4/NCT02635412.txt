    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the optimal timing of delivery in
      clinically stable women with a suspected morbidly adherent placenta dispositioned for a
      scheduled delivery. The primary outcome will be assessed by comparing the composite neonatal
      morbidity and composite maternal morbidity between the two groups (delivery at 34 versus 36
      weeks gestational age).
