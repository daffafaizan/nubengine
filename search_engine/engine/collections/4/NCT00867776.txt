      However, these studies have used supervised exercise in medical school or university
      environments and have included mostly middle-class White populations. Little is known
      regarding how to translate these findings to real world settings or to minority populations.
      Exercise may be a particularly beneficial option for African-Americans suffering from
      depression. African-Americans face significant disparities in depression care. At least a
      part of these disparities are due to lack of trust in the healthcare system and negative
      attitudes toward antidepressants. Our goal is to pilot-test a culturally-tailored,
      community-based exercise support program for depressed African-Americans. We will recruit
      participants who screened positive for moderate depressive symptoms when they enrolled in the
      African-American Health Coalition's Free Exercise Card Program, but who are exercising less
      than 3 times per week. They will participate in a 6-week educational self-care group focusing
      on how to use exercise and other self-help tools to reduce depressive symptoms. Participants
      will be encouraged to create action plans regarding exercise and other healthy lifestyle
      changes. Groups will also provide culturally-tailored information about depression therapies,
      such as antidepressants and psychotherapy, and discuss strategies for obtaining quality
      health care.
