      female subjects, age 18 to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of
      moderate to severe acne scars. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6 weeks
      (± 2 weeks) apart with the Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece
      attachment. Subjects may undergo a 2mm punch biopsy before, immediately after and up to 72
      hours after treatment. Subjects will be contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their
      first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will return to the site after all study treatments
      have been delivered for two follow-up visits: 6 and 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) following their
      final study treatment and may receive a biopsy per Investigator discretion either at one of
      these visits or 3 months post initial treatment.
