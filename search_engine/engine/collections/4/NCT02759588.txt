      intrinsic and acquired chemo-resistance and remarkable heterogeneity. There is an unmet
      medical need to develop new therapy modalities. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, has shown
      the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30
      different human tumors, including ovarian cancer. GL-ONC1 has been investigated in early
      stage clinical trials in the United States and Europe via systemic delivery as monotherapy
      and in combination with other therapies, and via regional delivery as monotherapy. GL-ONC1
      treatment was well tolerated across different malignancies, routes of administration, and
      monotherapy as well as combination therapy protocols. The ability of GL-ONC1 to infect tumor
      tissue and kill tumor cells was demonstrated. In addition, virus-induced immune activation
      and favorable anti-tumor immune response have been observed. Evidences of anti-tumor efficacy
      and clinical benefits have also been documented.
