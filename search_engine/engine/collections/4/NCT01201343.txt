      subjects. This is an open-label, prospective, interventional, multicentric study with no
      change of therapeutic behavior but with standardized neuropsychologic follow-up. Subjects
      will undergo 13 evaluations (categorical and dimensional evaluations), 3 evaluations will be
      performed before the treatment (Baseline, Day 7 and 15) and 10 evaluations after the
      treatment (Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24).
