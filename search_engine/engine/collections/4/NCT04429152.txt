    
      This is a single-arm, phase 3 pilot study investigating the efficacy of Doravirine (DOR) in
      combination with Lamivudine (3TC) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) administered over
      48 weeks in adults living with HIV-1 experiencing virological failure on first-line
      Efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      resistance.

      Approximately 25 male and female participants 18 years and older infected with HIV-1 and
      experiencing virological failure on efavirenz-based ART will be administered a once-daily,
      fixed-dose combination of doravirine 100 mg, lamivudine 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate 300 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF). The study includes screening and baseline visits, 4 study
      visits from Week 4 to Week 36, and an end of study visit at Week 48.
