      eradication, achieving excellent eradication rates of 99% and 97% according to per-protocol
      and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that
      the eradication rate of reverse hybrid therapy was higher than that of standard triple
      therapy. However, whether reverse hybrid therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than
      concomitant therapy remains unanswered.
