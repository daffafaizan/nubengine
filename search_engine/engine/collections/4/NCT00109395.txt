    
      Lorazepam is used clinically for sedation of mechanically ventilated children, but has not
      been approved by the FDA for this indication in children. The purpose of this study, in
      response to the Written Request by FDA, is to determine the safety, efficacy, and dosage
      required for lorazepam compared with midazolam, which is approved by FDA for children for
      this indication.

      Study participants must be children who are critically ill and receiving mechanical
      ventilation who require sedation. Participants will be randomized to lorazepam (intermittent
      bolus or continuous infusion) or midazolam (continuous infusion). Sedation will be monitored
      using the COMFORT score. Blood will be drawn to measure lorazepam/midazolam plasma
      concentrations, and to measure the plasma concentrations of excipients (benzyl alcohol and
      glycols) in patients receiving lorazepam.
