      standard therapy-controlled, variable dose study of HBOC 201 administered to trauma subjects
      with bleeding or potential for bleeding who require standard fluid therapy for treatment of
      hypoperfusion. The type and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events attributed
      to the study drug will be analyzed.

      Secondary variables in this safety and tolerability study, will be summarized with
      descriptive statistics and frequency tables. The purpose of this data collection is to assess
      efficacy variables and the feasibility of utilizing these parameters in future trauma studies
      that will assess parameters of morbidity and mortality and include, but are not limited to:

        -  Time to improvement of serum (or plasma) lactate

        -  Time to improvement in the Base Deficit

        -  Time to maintained stability (BD<5) over 24 hours

        -  Overall improvement in Base Deficit over 24 Hours

        -  Stability of subjects at 24 hours

        -  Time to meet treatment-stopping criteria

        -  Volume to meet treatment-stopping criteria

        -  Incidence of infectious complications (e.g., incidence of ventilator-associated
           pneumonia)

        -  Length of time on ventilator

        -  Incidence of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)

      Hemorrhage with subsequent hypoperfusion is a major cause of both immediate and delayed death
      in subjects who have sustained traumatic injuries. Effective therapies for hemorrhage to
      treat hypoperfusion that can be given immediately following injury are lacking. The following
      issues confound this problem further:

        -  Hemorrhaging trauma victims often have an immediate need for therapy to ensure adequate
           delivery of oxygen to vital tissues;

        -  Standard of care fluids such as Lactated Ringers Solution do not provide oxygen and
           blood can not be readily stored, transported or easily used in pre-hospital settings

        -  In the absence of oxygen-carrying fluid, traditional approaches to sustain vital organ
           perfusion, such as administration of intravenous fluid therapy, may have detrimental
           effects if given prior to hemostasis in certain subjects, particularly those with
           penetrating truncal injuries.
