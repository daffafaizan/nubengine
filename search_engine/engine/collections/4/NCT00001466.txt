      six broad categories will be evaluated over time to characterize the natural and clinical
      history of various specific disorders. Medical and laboratory evaluations will be completed
      to identify areas of management concern that have not been previously described. Further
      protocols will be developed addressing specific disorders once a number of affected
      individuals have been investigated and is sufficient to query various aspects of those
      disorders. Issues for both diagnosis and medical management of those affected with certain
      genetic disorders will be collated and addressed within a national consensus conference
      format. In addition, phenotype to genotype correlation will be established to further
      understanding of specific molecular alterations on phenotypic expression. This broad-based
      protocol will also facilitate the training of fellows in medical genetics, graduate and post
      graduate training in genetics and genetic counseling.
