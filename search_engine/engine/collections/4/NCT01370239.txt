      seven centers in Brazil. The study will be coordinated by the INSTITUTO DO CÂNCER DO ESTADO
      DE SÃO PAULO in collaboration with RECEPTA Biopharma. The study is funded by the CONSELHO
      NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO (CNPq). Before any procedure relating to
      the study, patients must read and sign the informed consent (IC). The inclusion of patients
      begin immediately after regulatory approval and is expected to end after reaching the number
      of patients. The follow-up term will last at least 24 months for each patient included,
      unless limited by death, loss to follow up or withdrawal of informed consent. A total of 60
      patients will be recruited in this study. The eligible patients must be 18 or older,
      confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with locally advanced or metastatic progression after
      one or two lines of previous hormone treatment, confirmation of Lewis antigen expression -as
      assessed by central laboratory, measurable or evaluable disease and adequate organ function.
      Patients will receive weekly intravenous doses of the antibody Hu3S193 until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or the investigator's decision,
      whichever occurs first. The study's primary endpoint is the clinical benefit rate.
