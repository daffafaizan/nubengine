      determine its bioavailability, safety, and tolerability in the body with three varying doses
      of vedolizumab SC compared to people who are administered vedolizumab IV.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 non-Japanese patients and 24 Japanese patients.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab Intravenous 300 mg

        -  Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 54 mg

        -  Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 108 mg

        -  Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 160 mg

      All participants will receive the treatment they are assigned on Day 1 of the study.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 10 visits to the clinic,
      including one 8 day period of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone
      at Study Day 168 (+/-3), approximately 6 months after dose for a follow-up questionnaire.
