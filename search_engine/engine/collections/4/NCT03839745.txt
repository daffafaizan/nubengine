    
      This is a single-site, randomized, crossover study of experienced adult e-cigarette users to
      assess nicotine exposure, toxicant exposure, and the short-term CV effects of e-cigarette
      power. Three power levels will be assessed on all participants: 10, 35, and 70 watts.

      Hypothesis 1a: Systemic nicotine exposure and subjective measures of sensation in the throat,
      reward, and satisfaction will increase with increasing power in the e-cigarette device.

      Hypothesis 1b: Mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
      particularly acrolein, will increase with e-cigarette power.

      Hypothesis 1c: CV effects increase with higher power, and are manifested as changes in
      hemodynamic parameters, hormonal release, and biomarkers of endothelial function, platelet
      activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress.
