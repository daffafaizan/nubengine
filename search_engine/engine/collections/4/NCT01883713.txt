      clinical settings, including cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. 1-6 However, as recently stated
      by one of the pioneers of anemia research; Dr. R.B. Weiskopf: "We have no clinical measures
      that let us know of impending insufficient oxygenation as anemia progresses".7 Toward
      achieving this goal, we have developed experimental models to define the adaptive mechanisms
      which maintain oxygen homeostasis during acute anemia. Our research has identified that
      increased nitric oxide (NO) production by nitric oxide syntheses (NOSs) may be an important
      survival mechanism in acute anemia.3;8;9 Experimental data suggests that nNOS may promote
      survival by maintaining oxygen (O2) homeostasis during acute anemia.10 Resultant increases in
      nitric oxide (NO) contributes to adaptive cell signaling mechanisms and also increase
      oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) to methemoglobin (MetHb).3 In addition, oxygen extraction
      results in increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin which has been proposed to act as a nitrite
      (NO2-) reductase to generate additional bioactive NO, thereby promoting vasodilation in
      hypoxic vascular beds.11-15 Thus, by more than one mechanism, increased MetHb may be
      indicative of hemoglobin desaturation, tissue hypoxia and activation of adaptive tissue
      responses to anemia. These responses may identify the threshold for local tissue hypoxia or
      "anemic stress". In attempt to determine if such mechanisms are active in humans we performed
      a retrospective study in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during heart
      surgery to determine if plasma MetHb increased as Hb decreased during CPB. We observed an
      inverse relationship between Hb and MetHb that was independent of red blood cell transfusion
      and exogenous nitrate use
