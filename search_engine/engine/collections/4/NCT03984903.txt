      with chronic non-specific low back pain, the complex nature of the core-stabilization
      exercises decrease the exercise adherence. Some novel studies show that multimedia learning
      can increase efficiancy of complex skill learning and can be better from classic face to face
      learning.

      So this study evaluates the effects of self-learning exercise from multimedia content on pain
      and disability in patients with low back pain.
