      immediately improved by refractive correction or accounted for by clinically determined
      anatomic defects of the eye or visual pathway. Evidence for direct retinal changes in eyes
      with amblyopia has been controversial. It has been hypothesized that amblyopia may affect the
      postnatal maturation of the retina including the postnatal reduction of retinal ganglion
      cells. However, although some studies have found incrased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness
      in amblyopic eyes, others have found no significant differences. This sutdy will examine the
      retinal layer thickness in amblyopia and compare the retinal layer thickness between
      amblyopic eyes and nonamblyopic fellow eyes.
