      mortality, and is commonly measured as peak oxygen consumption. Peak oxygen consumption is
      very low in individuals with Down syndrome, the most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual
      disability. Previous research suggests individuals with Down syndrome may experience a double
      disadvantage when they are exercising: they may not be able to increase cardiac output
      sufficiently and they may not be able to allocate adequate blood flow to the working muscles.

      The aim of this research study is therefore to determine the impact of limitations in central
      and peripheral regulation of blood flow on work capacity in individuals with DS. The results
      of this project will aid our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and determine the
      potential to improve health across the lifespan of individuals with Down syndrome by
      tailoring exercise interventions.
