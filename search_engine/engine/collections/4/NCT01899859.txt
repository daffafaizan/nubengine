      and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of GR-MD-02, in subjects with biopsy-proven NASH with
      advanced fibrosis. This is a dose escalation design comprised of 3 sequential cohorts to
      evaluate the safety of GR MD 02 when administered as a single IV infusion followed by 3
      additional weekly infusions starting 28 days after the first dose. Each cohort will consist
      of 8 subjects, 6 randomized to receive active drug and 2 randomized to receive placebo.Based
      on data safety monitoring board (DSMB) and FDA review, 2 additional cohorts may be
      implemented, consisting of 8 subjects.
