      characterized by demineralization of the inorganic portion and destruction of the organic
      substance of the tooth, which often leads to cavitation. It is a complex and dynamic process
      where a multitude of factors influence and initiate the progression of disease. There are
      practically no geographic areas in the world whose inhabitants do not exhibit some evidence
      of dental caries. It affects persons of both genders in all races, all socioeconomic strata
      and every age group. Likewise, there is strong evidence that tobacco use has numerous
      negative effects on oral health, for example staining of teeth, dental restoration,
      development of oral diseases. A biologically reasonable explanation for an association
      between chewing tobacco use and dental caries may be the presence of higher levels of
      fermentable sugars in chewing tobacco products which can stimulate the growth of carcinogenic
      bacteria. The decreased buffering effect possible lower pH of smokers saliva and higher
      number of lactobacilli and streptococcus mutans group may indicate an increased
      susceptibility to caries in smokers. On the other hand, there are researches which conclude
      that presence of extrinsic tobacco stains appear to provide a protective effect from caries.
