      ratio of levetiracetam or placebo. They will complete weekly study visits for the first 4
      weeks (Baseline, Weeks 2-4) and then additional visits at Week 6, 8, and 12. Participants
      will be studied both by assessing change in symptom severity and cognitive performance over
      the 12 weeks as well as using a measure of Hippocampal Volume Integrity at baseline and week
      12. After completing Week 12 or decision to withdraw prematurely from the study, participants
      will complete a 9 day medication tapering regimen.
