    
      Patients with previous oropharyngeal cancer and radiation-induced hyposalivation and
      xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome) will receive intraglandular injections of allogeneic
      adipose-derived MSCs into the submandibular and parotid glands. The trial will be Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) Monitored. From healthy donors, MSCs will be produced at a Good
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Facility.

      The patients will be followed for four months for safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      registration. Changes in quality of life, unstimulated, and stimulated whole saliva flow
      rate, salivary gland function will be assessed. Immune response towards receiving allogeneic
      MSCs will be evaluated in plasma and saliva. Changes in the composition and quality of the
      whole saliva will be investigated.

      Saliva from the participants will alts√• be compared to saliva from ten healthy controls.
