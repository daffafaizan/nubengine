      tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine). Mifamurtide is being used to treat people with
      osteosarcoma, a form of cancer.

      This was a patient-access study that looked at adverse events, disease progression, and
      overall survival in study participants.

      The study enrolled 205 patients, of whom 204 were treated with mifamurtide intravenously at a
      dose of 2 mg/m2 twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) for 12 weeks, and then weekly for an
      additional 24 weeks, for a total of 48 doses in 36 weeks (following surgery for primary or
      metastatic disease).

      This study was conducted in the United States. Participants could receive treatment for up to
      9 months. This study was previously mis-categorized as an interventional study.
