      will be performed. Patients will be carefully checked so that immediate intervention can be
      initiated should an adverse event (i.e. hypersensitivity) occur.

      The last treatment cycle according to the study will be cycle #6, or any earlier cycle.
      Certain tests will be done within 28 days after the last drug infusion. These include
      physical exam, vital signs, temperature, weight, adverse event evaluation, imaging studies,
      and blood work.

      The study doctor will see the participants every 6 to 8 weeks for at least 12 months after
      they start treatment. After that, the participants will be followed every 3 months for an
      additional 24 months.
