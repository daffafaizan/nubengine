      Primary

        -  To escalate the dose of accelerated hypofractionated image-guided conformal radiotherapy
           to a potent tumoricidal dose without exceeding the maximum-tolerated dose in patients
           with recurrent or stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer and poor performance status.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate local regional tumor control and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo accelerated hypofractionated image-guided conformal radiotherapy
      once daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks (15 fractions). Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
