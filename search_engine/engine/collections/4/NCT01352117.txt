      randomized (1:1) to receive ART alone (Arm A) or ART with immediate ET (Arm B). Study
      participants in Arm A who experienced KS progression that was confirmed by the Independent
      Endpoint Review Committee (IERC) could receive etoposide (ET) in addition to ART by entering
      Step 2 between study weeks 8 and 80. The target sample size was 468, 234 per arm.
      Randomization was stratified by:

        1. Screening CD4 cell count (<200 or ≥200 cells/mm^3) and

        2. ART history (naïve or experienced).

      The duration of Step 1 or Step 1 and 2 combined was 96 weeks. After 96 weeks on study,
      participants who received ET (Arm B participants and Arm A participants who entered Step 2)
      entered Step 3 for a total of 144 weeks of safety follow-up.

      Step 1 visits occurred at screening, entry and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32,
      40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 from study entry. Step 2 visits were scheduled at entry and weeks
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 from Step 2 entry until up to 96
      weeks on study. The key evaluations included physical examination, clinical assessments, KS
      exam, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, hematology, chemistry and pregnancy testing (for women
      of reproductive potential). Plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), KS
      tumor punch biopsy were be stored for use in future analyses. Participants also completed ET
      and ART adherence evaluations and quality of life questionnaires. Step 3 visits were
      scheduled every 24 weeks and were limited to safety evaluations including targeted physical
      exam, clinical assessments and hematology.

      Study accrual terminated early, based on the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      recommendation in March 2016. The participants in Steps 1 and 2 at that time were arranged to
      enter either Step 3 for safety follow-up after ET or, if they did not receive ET, to be taken
      off study.
