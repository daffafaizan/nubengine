      clinicians and patients for surveillance mammography and follow-up care for breast cancer

      attitudes towards these recommendations, and testing a strategy for communication of expert
      recommendations on mammography cessation through direct engagement of specialists, primary
      care clinicians (PCs), and patients.

      This is a multi-step study, the investigators will build on prior steps to develop consensus
      on surveillance mammography and follow-ups for breast cancer survivors who are age >= 75.

      This study includes a physician focus group.
