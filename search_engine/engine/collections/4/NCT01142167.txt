      gastrointestinal tract diseases manifesting as altered bowel habit, per rectal bleeding and
      abdominal pain. It is used to diagnose colonic polyps, colorectal cancer and inflammatory
      bowel disease to name a few examples.

      Colorectal cancer screening has been shown to decrease colorectal cancer. Despite this the
      uptake by the general population is suboptimal.

      A new prototype colonoscope from Olympus with an additional distal bending section was
      designed. The investigators hypothesize that its performance characteristics will be similar
      to a standard colonoscope with patient tolerability.

      This randomised control trial aims to invite patients attending their first outpatient
      colonoscopy and who are able to provide informed consent.(so they have had no prior
      experience) to assess the completion rate, patient and endoscopist satisfaction.

      Patients with prior colorectal surgery or previous colonoscopy were excluded.
