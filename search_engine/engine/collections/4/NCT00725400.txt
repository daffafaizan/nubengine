      Primary:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with Colorectal Cancer treated with Cetuximab
           and Radiation Therapy Vs Surgery before or after Radiation Therapy.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the treatment compliance of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an Open-label, Controlled, Multicenter study. Patients will be assigned into
      two different Arms.

      Arm I: Patients will receive Cetuximab and Radiation Therapy. Patients will receive a dose of
      Cetuximab through Intravenous (IV). The initial dose is 400 mg/m2 administered as a
      120-minute intravenous infusion (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min) and weekly dose is 250
      mg/m2 infused over 60 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min) until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Radiation treatment for Colorectal Cancer are Intensity Modulated
      Radiation Therapy (IMRT). IMRT delivers radiation directly to the tumor and modulates the
      intensity of the radiation with laser accuracy.

      Arm II: Patients will undergo surgery before or after Radiation Therapy. Colorectal Cancer
      Surgery are Colon resection (Colectomy), Rectum resection (Proctectomy), Colostomy, and
      Radiofrequency ablation. Radiation treatment for Colorectal Cancer are Intensity Modulated
      Radiation Therapy (IMRT). IMRT delivers radiation directly to the tumor and modulates the
      intensity of the radiation with laser accuracy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 450 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 to 24
      months.
