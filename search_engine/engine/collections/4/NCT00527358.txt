      to improve school bonding, family cohesion and awareness and utilization of existing
      services; and a youth drop-in center will provide youth with an adult supervised place to
      "hang out", do homework, or participate in sports and job training.

      Following implementation of the intervention, we will collect detailed process data
      (regarding implementation), and evaluate impact/outcome using a quasi-experimental design
      with baseline (prior to intervention) and two followup data collections in both the
      intervention and a control community (Culmore, Virginia), measuring change in a selected set
      of aggregate community variables that represent mediating factors and outcomes for youth
      violence in Langley Park. Data will be collected via a survey and focus groups.
