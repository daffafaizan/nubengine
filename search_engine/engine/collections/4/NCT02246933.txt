      and increase chronic disease risk by increasing inflammation, coagulation (blood clotting)
      potential, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Conversely, eating more poly-unsaturated fats has
      been linked to decreased risk of chronic diseases. The goal of this study is to determine
      whether or not eating a diet containing a lot of poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the
      damaging effects of eating occasional high-fat meals that are high in saturated fats. Those
      damaging effects we are interested in studying include how much fat and calories a person's
      body burns, and measuring some markers of chronic disease risk in the blood (inflammation
      markers and blood clotting markers).
