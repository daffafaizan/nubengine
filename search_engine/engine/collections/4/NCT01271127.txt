    
      Objectives:

        1. to determine whether MSCT as a screening method of HL survivors treated with mediastinal
           irradiation accurately identifies asymptomatic significant coronary artery disease.

        2. to establish the prevelance of coronary abnormalities in HL survivors treated with
           mediastinal irradiation

        3. to determine the frequency and type of intervention

        4. to evaluate the acceptance of screening and asses quality of life among Hl survivors.

      Study polulation:

      50 long term survivors of HL, previously treatef with mediastinal irradiation without present
      evidence of cardiovascular disease

      Intervention:

      CT-coronary angiography and calcium score, to be performed as a screening method (to indicate
      further diagnostic treatent procedures)
