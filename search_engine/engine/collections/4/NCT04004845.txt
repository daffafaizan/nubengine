    
      This is quasi-experimental prospective cohort study with historical control to examine the
      efficacy of a new labor induction bundle. The prospective cohort will consist of all eligible
      nulliparous and multiparous patients admitted for induction; the historical control group
      will consist of all eligible nulliparous and multiparous patients admitted for induction
      between August 2019 and February 2020. Patients who are part of the prospective cohort who do
      not consent to the labor bundle due to personal or physician preferences will be included in
      secondary analyses as a contemporary control group, however the sample size of this group
      will not be determined in advance.

      Objective: To assess if implementation of an evidence-based labor induction bundle will
      increase the rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours.

      Hypothesis: Implementation of a labor induction bundle would result in a 30% increase in the
      rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours.
