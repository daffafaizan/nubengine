    
      This is a phase IV, open-label safety study, designed to determine baseline levels of bone
      marrow fibers in previously treated adults with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic
      purpura (ITP)and to evaluate the long-term effect of eltrombopag on bone marrow reticulin
      and/or collagen fibers.

      The duration of the screening period is up to 8 weeks. Eltrombopag will be administered for
      at least 2-years followed by a 4-week follow-up period. Bone marrow biopsies will be
      performed at screening, after 1-year and 2-years of eltrombopag treatment, and at early
      withdrawal of treatment. The screening bone marrow biopsy should be performed within 8 weeks
      of planned start of study medication and the bone marrow biopsy block must be available for
      central laboratory processing.
