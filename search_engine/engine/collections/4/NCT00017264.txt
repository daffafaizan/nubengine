        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of atrasentan in patients with progressive or
           recurrent malignant glioma.

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-10 patients receive escalating doses of atrasentan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1
      patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
