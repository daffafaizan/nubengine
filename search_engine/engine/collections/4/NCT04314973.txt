      wearable. Thanks to the wearable robotic pelvis orthosis we will use, the rehabilitation
      sessions can take place in an ecological environment.

      The other advantage of the proposed assistance protocol is its adaptability: patients will
      feel their hips pattern to be "smoothed" by the robot, but they will keep the freedom of
      continuously steering their main movement variables (like stride frequency, duration, and
      length). A key measured metric will precisely rely on this variability between stride
      durations. Indeed, the degree of stride-to-stride variability was shown to reflect the
      patient's physiological state, and to be correlated with the stage of the disease.

      Experimental trials will be conducted to assess both the assistive (i.e. the therapy effect
      during the therapy itself) and rehabilitative (i.e. effect after the therapy) natures of our
      protocol. The second main objective of this project will be the analysis of the effects of
      our protocol regarding the stride-to-stride variability of patients with Parkinson's disease.
