      one method of sperm selection based on the characteristics of spermatozoa recently
      introduced: Sperm Selection Assay, which used a gradient of concentration of progesterone to
      act as chemoatractant of spermatozoa of better quality. We will assess in vitro fertilization
      with two techniques (SSSA versus traditional technique of swin up) as well as embryo
      development.
