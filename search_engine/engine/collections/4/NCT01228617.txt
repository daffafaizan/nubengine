      sequences. In four of the sequences, the three prototypes with the shorter dissolution time
      and the reference were used; in the remaining four sequences, the three prototypes with the
      longer dissolution time and the reference were used. Hence, half of the subjects received the
      Short prototypes and half received the Long prototypes. Subjects in both treatment groups
      (short and long) attended four treatment visits, each of 11 hours' duration, and periods of
      at least 36 hours' duration between treatment visits.
