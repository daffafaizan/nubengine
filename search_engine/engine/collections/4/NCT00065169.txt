      anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate or prevent AD symptoms, but efficacy trials are needed.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either celecoxib or placebo
      for 18 months. Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Routine laboratory blood tests, cognitive tests,
      and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. Participants will also be screened for
      Parkinson disease. Follow-up testing will be conducted at specific intervals following the
      study.
