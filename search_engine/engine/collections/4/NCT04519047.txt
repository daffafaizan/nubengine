    
      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, feasibility study to evaluate the safety and
      potential for effectiveness of an intraarticular Injection of Rejoint Gel after platelet-rich
      plasma administration in patient with single knee OA, parallel-design study will enroll
      approximately eligible 30 subjects with single knee OA.

      The subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive 1 of 2 treatments below:

        1. Treatment Group: Rejoint Gel, intra-articular injection, with platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
           in 2:1 volume ratio or

        2. Control Group: Normal saline, intra-articular injection with PRP in 2:1 volume ratio
           Beginning on treatment period, subjects will receive a single treatment cycle of either
           150 mg/ml Rejoint Gel or normal saline with PRP intra-articular injection twice for one
           month (Visit 3 and 4). Subjects will be followed to Visit 5, 6 and 7 for safety and
           potential for effectiveness assessments.
