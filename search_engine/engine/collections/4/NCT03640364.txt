    
      A multicenter multinational Trial is performed in 250 female patients with pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP) and symptoms of urinary urge incontinence.

      Dependent on the presence or abscence of the uterus patients are treated with bilateral
      sacrospinous uterine or vaginal vault suspension (BSC) by means of a tape specifically
      designed for this purpose.
