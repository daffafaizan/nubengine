      caused by the excessive growth of bacteria in the small bowel, results in a spectrum of
      symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating abdominal discomfort and weight loss. Multiple factors
      both internal and external to the individual prevent excessive small bowel bacterial
      colonization and determine the types of bacteria present. The most important factors within
      the individual are normal small bowel motility, which prevents attachment of ingested
      organisms, and gastric acid, which destroys many organisms before they reach the small
      intestine. The determination of small bowel motility is problematic due to limitations of the
      tests available (e.g., hydrogen breath test, scintigraphy and manometry).

      The SmartPill capsule is a recently developed novel device that, following its ingestion, can
      measure pH, pressure and temperature as it moves through the gastrointestinal tract. These
      recordings can be used to measure gastrointestinal transit and, potentially, other aspects of
      gastrointestinal motility/function. Previous studies using this device have demonstrated the
      ability of the SmartPill to measure the gastric residence time using the duration of acidic
      pH recording with good correlation between the gastric residence time of the SmartPill
      capsule and conventional gastric emptying scintigraphy.
