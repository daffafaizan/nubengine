autoradiographic study on the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells inthe dog bone marrow.. effect of femoral artery clamping during in vivoavailability of h3-thymidine .the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in the dog bone marrowwere studied autoradiographically by observing the effect of clamping ofthe femoral artery during in vivo availability of h3-thymidine . heavilylabeled small lymphoid cells appeared in the bone marrow of the clampedleg 3 hours after injection of the tracer and increased in number up to6 days . the labeling indices of these cells, however, weresignificantly lower than those of control marrow . a possibleinterpretation is that dog bone marrow contains two populations of smalllympho id cells, one migrating into the marrow via the blood stream, theother originating from local precursor cells within the marrow . therewas no evidence for a transformation of migrated small lymphoid cellsinto erythroblasts during the first 48 hours after injection ofh3-thymidine .
