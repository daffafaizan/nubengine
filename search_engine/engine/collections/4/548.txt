the study of osteoporosisand osteomalaciaradiological evidence strongly suggests thatosteoporosis (with the possible exception of acuteimmobilization osteoporosis) may be an irrever-sible condition.  the changes therefore to beexpected in calcium balance when an osteoporoticis treated are small compared with those oftenseen in osteomalacia.  methods of obtaining moreaccurate calcium balances are needed to showthese small changes, especially when a highcalcium intake is used.  the method of continuousmarking of stools with chromium sesquioxideseems to provide just such a method.  using thismethod, it has so far proved impossible to obtainprolonged large positive calcium balances inosteoporosis on either high calcium intake,anabolic hormones, or sodium fluoride.two alternative therapies to vitamin d havebeen explored for use in vitamin d-resistantosteomalacia.  atp has been found to be inneffective.intravenous phosphate alone has been ineffectivein producing positive calcium balances, but iseffective as a complement to vitamin d undercertain conditions.
