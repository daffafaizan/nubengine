      treatment of various types of cancer. This study aimed to investigate benefits from adding
      L-carnitine and Silymarin compared to anthracycline chemotherapy alone in patients with
      cancer.

      Methods: 83 patients were recruited from Clinical Oncology Department, Tanta University,
      Egypt, then prospectively randomized to receive their anthracycline containing therapeutic
      regimen, control group (n=33) or anthracycline plus L-carnitine, L-carnitine group (n=25), or
      anthracycline plus Silymarin, Silymarin group (n= 25). Blood samples were collected at
      begging and after 6 months to measure LDH, CK-MB, cTn I, Anticardiolipin IgG, Fe, ferritin
      and TIBC and % of saturation. % EF was documented. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA
      and paired t test. P <0.05 was statistically significant.
