      BOLD response in areas associated with homeostatic and hedonic eating than will both LAGB/LSG
      and control patients. We also expect that LAGB/LSG patients (as a result of hormonal changes
      occurring with weight loss) will display greater increases in BOLD response to images of
      highly palatable foods than will extremely obese controls.

      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will show larger increases (relative to baseline) in
      postprandial GLP-1 and PYY3-36 than the LAGB/LSG and obese control groups. We will also
      compare changes in ghrelin in the three groups. We predict that patients who undergo RYGB
      will have greater reductions in ghrelin than will control subjects.

      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will demonstrate greater postprandial changes (relative
      to baseline) in brain activity in the homeostatic and hedonic feeding areas (suggesting
      normalization of satiety and of neural processing of food reward) than will patients who
      undergo LAGB/LSG or who do not seek weight loss.
