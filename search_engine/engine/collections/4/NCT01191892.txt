      Primary

        -  To determine the antitumor activity (as measured by progression-free survival) of
           carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride with versus without vandetanib as first-line
           treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cell cancer who are
           not suitable to receive cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of these regimens in these
           patients.

        -  To determine the objective response rate.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens

        -  To assess the change of size of measurable lesions at 9 weeks of study therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to relevant factors.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and an oral placebo once daily on days
           1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patient receive carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm I. Patients
           also receive oral vandetanib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
           for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples may be collected for laboratory analysis at baseline and after
      completion of study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 18, 26, 39, and 52.
