      type gastric cancer. Currently, the histological assessment of gastric intestinal metaplasia
      still relies on the biopsies took from five sites that the updated Sydney System recommended.

      This study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of gastric intestinal metaplasia from two
      different fluorescein sodium dosage and assess whether lower fluorescein sodium dosage can
      perceive the same detection rate per patient and per lesion for the detection of gastric
      intestinal metaplasia.
