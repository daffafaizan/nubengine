      sabdariffa, most focus on hypertensive patients, diabetic patients and obese patient and some
      studies investigated the hypolipidemic a effect of the water beverage of Hibiscus sabdariffa
      as well as its effect on haematological parameters but mice were used for these studies.
      Little or no investigation has been done to assess the safety of daily consumption of this
      water beverage of hibiscus sabdariffa on humans.

      Hence, this study aims at investigating the safety in the daily consumption of Zobo in
      humans, monitoring lipid profile, blood pressure, blood glucose, body mass index and
      haematological parameters such as haematocrit, haemoglobin, total white blood cells and also
