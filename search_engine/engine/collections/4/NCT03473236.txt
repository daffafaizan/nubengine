      two-part study in healthy adult males and females of non-childbearing potential.
      "Double-Blind" means neither the study subject nor the investigator knows if PK10571 or
      placebo is being given. "Placebo" means a capsule filled with a powder that does not contain
      the active drug, PK10571. Because the safety profile of PK10571 in humans is unknown and this
      is the first clinical study to assess PK10571 in humans, a single-ascending dose design will
      be used in Part A of the study going from a low dose to higher doses based on safety. Part B
      will be a multiple-ascending dose design to be run only after review of safety and
      measurement of drug levels in the blood from Part A.

      In the single ascending dose study (Part A) up to five doses may be given to different groups
      of study subjects based on safety and measurement of drug levels in the blood. Subjects will
      be randomized into one dose cohort to receive either PK10571 or placebo. Within each cohort,
      6 subjects will receive active drug and 2 subjects will receive placebo.

      In the multiple ascending dose study (Part B), up to three doses of PK10571 will be tested.
      The daily dose will be administered daily for 7 days with close clinical monitoring. The dose
      for the first cohort of Part B will be determined by review of the safety and drug levels
      from Part A by the Safety Review Committee. The dose interval for the first cohort of Part B
      (i.e., once daily, twice daily, or up to three times daily) will be determined by review of
      the safety and drug levels in the blood from Part A by the Safety Review committee.
      Subsequent doses and dosing intervals will be determined by review of the safety and drug
      levels from the prior cohort.
