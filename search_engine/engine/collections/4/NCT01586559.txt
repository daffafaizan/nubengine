      diastasis of the recti muscles. Previous studies assessing the efficacy and endurance of the
      correction of recti diastasis have mostly been performed with small groups of patients, short
      follow-up periods and/or with questionable methodology

      Methods: A comparative prospective study assessing the outcomes of recti muscle diastasis
      correction with absorbable suture. The investigators assess the outcomes by physical and
      ultrasonographic examinations and a patient questionnaire, which asks about the number of
      pregnancies and the types of deliveries, other abdominal surgeries before or after the
      abdominoplasty, the interval of time required to return to full activity, postoperative pain,
      and the overall satisfaction with the final result. During the examination, the inter-recti
      distances are measured at 3 levels: halfway between the xyphoid and umbilicus, just above the
      umbilicus and halfway between the umbilicus and pubis. The same examination is done on a
      control group of nulliparous women.
