      problem affecting as many as 25% of patients. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is an accepted
      second line treatment option, achieving ovulation in 75-90% and pregnancy in 50-69% of the CC
      resistant patients.

      Adjuvants to laparoscopic drilling have been explored by researchers some studies have shown
      evidence of improved outcome with the use of N-Acetyl cystiene (NAC), a long used mucolytic
      drug which has been used for various other indications including detoxification and cancer
      chemoprotection. Several studies have addressed the possibility of using NAC as adjuvant
      therapy to Clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation in resistant patients with some
      showing encouraging results. The use of NAC as adjuvant to laparoscopic ovarian drilling was
      addressed in a single pilot study showing good results with improved ovulation and pregnancy
      rates compared to the non users.
