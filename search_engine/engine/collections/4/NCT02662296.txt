      I. To improve the outcomes of patients who have progressed or relapsed lymphoma or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL)
      within 180 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) compared to
      historical data: 12-month overall survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety profile observed in these populations.

      II. Estimate the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by
      standard morphologic, flow cytometric, imaging, and molecular techniques.

      III. Assess progression free-survival.

      IV. Define incidences of grade III-IV toxicities and infections.

      V. Estimate incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality.

      VI. Estimate incidences of grade II-III and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 or idelalisib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
