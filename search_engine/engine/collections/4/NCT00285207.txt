      1:1 ratio to topical cervical treatment with A-007, or placebo gel. Following biopsy
      confirmation of High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL), women will treat
      themselves with gel applied to the cervix via an intravaginal applicator. Patients will apply
      gel once daily for 5 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle for 2 cycles. Women will return to
      clinic for safety assessments, colposcopy, cytology, and virologic and immunologic testing.
