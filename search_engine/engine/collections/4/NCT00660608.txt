      to undergo elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for CABG or primary valve
      repair or replacement will be eligible. Patients with any history of abnormal bleeding
      disorders, urgent or emergent need for surgery, and combination surgeries will be excluded.
      Blood volume analysis will be performed with the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer BVA-100 System
      and the Volumex HSA I-131 radiopharmaceutical for use for determining circulating volume.
      Multiple timed sample points will be obtained. The DAXOR blood volume analyzer will batch
      samples and with input of patients height, weight, gender, time of draw, and corresponding
      Hct, calculate circulating total blood volume. We hypothesize that Total red cell mass is
      relatively well conserved( <20% decrease) during and immediately after surgery as long as
      major bleeding does not occur. We hypothesize that decrease in Hct during surgery are related
      to changes in circulating plasma volume. Total red cell O2 carrying capacity and O2 economics
      will be measured and it is also hypothesized that lowered Hct values, even as low as 15%, do
      not independently signal a tissue or whole body O2 deficit.
