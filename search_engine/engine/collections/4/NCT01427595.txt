      the adverse neuroendocrine effects of elevated androgens will hopefully lead to improved
      prevention and treatment strategies for PCOS. In this study, we propose to explore the role
      of hyperinsulinemia on neuroendocrine function in hyperandrogenic adolescent girls by
      assessing the effect of the insulin sensitizer Metformin on hypothalamic progesterone
      sensitivity. Other differences between the progesterone sensitive and progesterone
      insensitive subgroups, including racial and ethnic differences between the two populations
      and a trend towards older gynecologic age in the progesterone insensitive population, are
      being pursued through other ongoing studies (IRB-HSR# 8588 and 12160).
