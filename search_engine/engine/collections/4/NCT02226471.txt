      diagnosed obesity and essential hypertensive patients not taking anti-obese and
      antihypertensive medications and 66 normal weight (NW) and normotensive subjects. All
      subjects were divided into two groups depending on body mass index (BMI), including NW group
      and obesity group, and then four subgroups were divided according to obesity and
      hypertension, including NW-normal blood pressure subgroup (NW-NBP), NW-hypertension subgroup
      (NW-HTN), obese-normal blood pressure subgroup (OB-NBP), obese-hypertension subgroup
      (OB-HTN).
