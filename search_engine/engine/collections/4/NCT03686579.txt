      assessment of potential treatment. Despite its well-known limitations, the posteroanterior
      chest radiograph remains the starting point of the imaging work-up. Adjunctive imaging with
      computed tomography, that recently is increasingly often performed on multidetector computed
      tomography units, adds essential information not readily available on the conventional
      radiograph. This allows better definition of trauma-associated thoracic injuries not only in
      acute traumatic aortic injury, but also in pulmonary, tracheobronchial, cardiac, diaphragmal,
      and thoracic skeletal injuries. This article reviews common radiographic findings in patients
      after chest trauma, shows typical imaging features resulting from thoracic injury, presents
      imaging algorithms, and recalls to the reader less common but clinically relevant entities
      encountered in patients after thoracic trauma.
