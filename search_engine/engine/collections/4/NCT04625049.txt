      follow-up after initial positron emission tomography (PET) -imaging with PK11195 or TMSX
      radioligands.

      Background: Focal inflammatory lesions in the white and grey matter of the central nervous
      system represent the best characterized pathological phenomena of MS disease. Some MS lesions
      slowly expand over time. Neuropathological studies have detected inflammatory rim formed by
      activated microglia cells around some MS lesions and it has been suggested that the presence
      of the inflammatory rim could predict lesion expansion. Our hypothesis is that the lesions
      with higher TSPO or TMSX radioligand binding at the initial PET scan will expand more during
      the total of 10-year follow up compared to those lesions with lower radioligand binding. This
      longitudinal follow-up study will provide a more complete picture of the association of the
      innate immune cell activation, lesion growth and disease progression.

      Study population: The research will recruit approximately 100 MS-patients who have taken part
      to our previous PET-imaging MS studies in Turku PET centre. The research interventions will
      consist of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, blood sampling, clinical neurological
      evaluation and patient-reported outcome measures (filling forms).
