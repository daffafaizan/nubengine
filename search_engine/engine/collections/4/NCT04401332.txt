        1. Adapt our existing health IT-enabled practice model for asthma symptom monitoring using
           PROs to a primary care population. The health IT-enabled practice model is comprised of
           the following: an mHealth app that can be installed on patients' smartphones that
           integrates into clinical workflow; and an asthma PRO dashboard in the electronic health
           record (EHR) for clinicians.

        2. Implement the adapted health IT-enabled practice model in 4 primary care community
           clinics, identify a cohort of eligible asthma patients to participate, and train
           clinicians and clinical staff.

        3. Rigorously evaluate the impact of this new health IT-enabled practice model using a
           randomized controlled trial study in which we enroll 500 asthma patients (250
           intervention, 250 usual care) by primary care clinician. We will measure
           patient-reported asthma quality of life and asthma-related healthcare utilization
           (defined as urgent care and emergency room visits and hospitalizations) as our primary
           and secondary outcomes, respectively. We will use mixed methods to identify barriers and
           facilitators to implementation and factors that affect sustainable spread and scale as
           per the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS)
           framework.
