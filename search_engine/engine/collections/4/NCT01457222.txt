      growing in highschool students in Sweden. Mindfulness is a well researched therapeutical
      method for treating stress-related disorders. This study will first collect data on
      stress-related psychological symptoms by several well-validated surveys. The surveys will be
      made twice with 8 weeks in between to examine variability. After the second survey the
      population of highschool students will be randomly assigned to web-based mindfulness
      intervention, music relaxation intervention or control group. A third survey will be
      conducted after eight weeks of intervention and before and after an external stressor.
