      significantly lower incidence of androgenic alopecia than matched controls.

      Study Population: 120 patients aged 20-64 with Fabry disease that have GLA mutations or
      alpha-galactosidase A activity associated with no residual enzyme activity and non-Fabry male
      controls of the same age range and the same number of non-Fabry controls.

      Design: This is a cross-sectional study comparing the prevalence of androgenic alopecia in
      two groups of subjects.

      Outcome Measures: The levels of the outcome will be no androgenic alopecia and frontal only
      androgenetic alopecia opposed to vertex only and frontal and vertex androgenetic alopecia.
