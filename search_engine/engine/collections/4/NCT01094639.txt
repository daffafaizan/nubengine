      systemic inflammation in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). To achieve this goal, the project had
      two specific objectives:

        1. a) To compare the prevalence of periodontal infection between CKD and non-CKD
           populations and b) to explore the association between the presence of periodontal
           infection and the uremic status of CKD patients.

        2. a) To assess the levels of systemic inflammatory markers, IL-6 and CRP in the presence
           or absence of periodontal infection in CKD and b) to compare the serum IL-6 and CRP
           levels in response to periodontal intervention.
