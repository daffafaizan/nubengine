      continuous control via an automated electronic device as compared with intermittent pressure
      control for the prevention of ventilator associated respiratory infection in ICU.

      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in Vietnam. Recruitment will be for 18 months
      at all centers. Patients experiencing any hospital acquired infection whilst at risk of
      Ventilator Associated Respiratory Infections will be evaluated in using a standardised
      investigation protocol to identify cases of VARI and other hospital acquired infections
      (HAI)s. Assessment of VARI will be based on published criteria and carried out by an endpoint
      review committee independent of patient care and blinded to the allocation of the patient.
      Antibiotic use data and duration of stay will be important secondary outcome measures.
