      particular medical conditions (such as interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive lung
      disease (COPD), and post-lung transplant rejection) is important for the prevention and early
      detection of the disease, as well as to advance our understanding of targeted therapies.
      Availability of biomarkers for diagnosis and for the prediction of patient prognosis and
      therapy promises personalized medicine. Patients may be selected based on the presence of
      particular gene mutations or circulating protein levels to receive personalized treatment.
      Furthermore, knowledge regarding genetic risk and susceptibility to infectious diseases as
      well as structural lung disease is rapidly growing-as whole genome sequencing and genome-wide
      association studies have become easier to do, genetic risk has emerged as increasingly
      important in understanding why and how some patients develop chronic lung disease. This is
      true for the spectrum of lung diseases treated in the ALD program, from those with airways
      diseases such as COPD to diffuse parenchymal lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF). The availability of human biological specimens for research purposes is
      crucial for the advancement of medical knowledge of understanding, diagnosing, and treating
      chronic lung diseases and optimizing post-lung transplant care.
