      response to therapy in RA but the heterogeneity of the methodology and the semi-quantitative
      nature of the image analysis limits its applicability. To evaluate the ability of DCE-MRI to
      serve as a biomarker for treatment-induced changes in RA associated synovial inflammation,
      the reproducibility of the measurement and an effect size are required. Additional endpoints
      such as synovial volume, bone erosion progression and bone marrow edema-like changes may also
      prove useful for short-term assessment of a therapeutic intervention, but have not been
      explored in the context of a pharmacodynamic biomarker. It is therefore critical to conduct a
      carefully designed longitudinal study, focused on identifying the key parameters related to
      the instrumentation and data analysis, to fully evaluate the potential utility of MRI in an
      early clinical development setting. Importantly, this study will also demonstrate the
      feasibility of using DCE-MRI at multiple centers to acquire useful information that will
      drive program decisions.
