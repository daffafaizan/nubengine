        -  To assess the effect of atorvastatin on pancreatic beta-cell function as measured by
           C-peptide after a liquid mixed meal stimulation in patients with newly diagnosed type 1
           diabetes,

        -  To assess the effect on metabolic control as measured by HbA1c and insulin requirements,

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of atorvastatin in subjects with newly diagnosed type
           1 diabetes,

        -  To assess the effect on risk factors of diabetic complications as indicated by changes
           in lipids and CRP, and

        -  To assess the effect on systemic immune abnormalities as measured by effects on
           beta-cell autoantibodies, blood cytokines and chemokines on protein and transcriptional
           level.

      Study duration: 18 months
