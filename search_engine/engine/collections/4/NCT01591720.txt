      self-help modules in which 4 modules are fixed (the first three and the last) and the rest
      are "prescribed" following the diagnostic interview. These modules contain material on panic
      disorder, social phobia, stress management, assertiveness training, concentration, relaxation
      among other things.

      The intervention is tested within a primary care clinic. Weekly measures of symptoms of
      depression and anxiety are obtained.
