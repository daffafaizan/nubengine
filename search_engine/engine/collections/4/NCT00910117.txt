      unresectable HNSCC. However, the role of induction chemotherapy remains uncertain for
      resectable disease. Therefore, we plan to perform a phase II study to evaluate it, focusing
      on radiographic and pathologic response after induction chemotherapy. Moreover, a new EGFR
      monoclonal antibody (nimotuzumab) is incorporated with PF regimen. The hypothesis is the
      addition of nimotuzumab would improve the response without remarkably increase the toxicity.
