      mapping approach - that is, mapping of the left ventricle during sinus or paced rhythm to
      identify diseased myocardium. Using three dimensional electroanatomical mapping, it is
      possible to reconstruct an anatomical rendering of the left ventricle based on voltage. For
      hemodynamically stable or unstable VTs, various electrophysiologic maneuvers can then be used
      to identify the critical portions of the VT circuit within the scar (entrainment mapping,
      identification of diastolic potentials, identification of electrically-unexcitable scar,
      fractionated potentials and pace mapping).

      These methods are limited by the resolution of the substrate map, accuracy of catheter
      manipulation, and operator skill. To this end, a magnetic navigation system has been
      developed that allows for remote cardiac mapping. When used in concert with a compatible
      electroanatomical mapping system, it is possible to create a high-density ventricular
      substrate map of healed myocardial infarction. By removing the necessity for technical skill
      with catheter manipulation, this system has the potential for both improving the efficacy of
      VT ablation and expanding the clinical use of this substrate mapping approach.

      Recently, a higher-powered, irrigated tip catheter has become available in certain markets
      for use in cardiac arrhythmia ablations. This study will evaluate the outcomes of using this
      magnetic irrigation ablation catheter during mapping and ablation of VT while also using
      remote magnetic navigation.
