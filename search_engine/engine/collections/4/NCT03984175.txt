    
      A multidisciplinary team of implementation researchers and clinical effectiveness researchers
      has been assembled to adapt the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) for
      this planning study. The team identified the baseline clinical care delivery for LTVV in
      patients with ARDS across Intermountain hospitals and identified the barriers and
      facilitators to this standard of care. This pilot implementation study will focus on a Pilot
      Solution aimed at achieving ideal clinical care delivery of LTVV for patients with ARDS.

      Abbreviations for Mechanical Ventilation:

      PEEP: positive end expiratory pressure FIO2: fraction of inspired oxygen CPAP: continuous
      positive airway pressure PS: pressure support VC: volume control VC+: hybrid mode for volume
      targeted ventilation on Puritan Bennett ventilators PRVC: pressure regulated volume control,
      hybrid mode for volume targeted ventilation on Draeger ventilators PF ratio: ratio of partial
      pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2 mmHg) divided by the FIO2 expressed in liters
