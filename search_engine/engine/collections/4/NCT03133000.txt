    
      Prospective non-randomized observational register study of all elective symptomatic
      incisional hernias operated on in the Reference Hernia Center of Gross Sand Hospital between
      1 January 2010 and 30 September 2015 using the novel endoscopic assisted Mini- or Less-Open
      Sublay technique. The novel MILOS-technique allows the minimal invasive implantation of large
      extraperitoneal meshes for the treatment of primary and secondary incisional hernias.The data
      of all patients were prospectively documented in the German Hernia Registry "Herniamed". Data
      privacy protection was strictly implemented according to German federal law. All patients
      were informed in detail about the new surgical technique, other treatment options,
      prospective register study with one year questionnaire follow-up, data documentation. All
      patients gave written consent.

      A propensity score matching of all patients of the MILOS-cohort of Gross Sand Hospital with
      patients with comparable incisional hernias who were operated on using the laparoscopic
      intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) technique or open sublay technique in other institutions
      participating in the German Hernia Database "Herniated" was performed.
