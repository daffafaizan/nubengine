      a 3 hour therapy session of Rapid Resolution Therapy (RRT), and then re-test one week post
      treatment and 6 months follow up.

      If participants do not report a "good result" following the 3 hour session, the investigators
      will offer a 1.5 hour follow up session Participants will receive free therapy for their
      participation, but will not be paid.

      Participants will be men and women over the age of 18 who do not have a diagnosis of
      psychosis and are not actively suicidal and have experienced a single rape at least 3 months
      before enrolling in the study.

      Sessions will be audio recorded and transcribed for construct validity (of RRT). Identifying
      in formation will be removed by the study coordinator before transcripts are coded for
      validity.

      This study proposes to use the same methods as Rothbaum et al (2005) published in Journal of
      Traumatic Stress that compares Prolonged Exposure to Eye Movement and Desensitization and
      Reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD Rape Victims. The investigators will compare our results to
      theirs. Both of their treatments were 8 sessions, and this study's treatment is one. They
      also include data for a control group.
