      care in non-ischemic systolic heart failure (LVEFâ‰¤35%) and 60-70% percent of SCD cases even
      occur in individuals with LEVF>35%. A growing evidence, that emphasizes the urgent need to
      improve the prediction of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

      CMR provides unique information on myocardial mechanics, fibrotic burden, inflammation and
      microvascular dysfunction, thereby allowing to quantify key substrates for myocardial
      arrhythmogenic potential.

      PREDICT-DCM Trial is a multi-centre, prospective observational trial including patients with
      DCM undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) prior to ICD or event recorder
      implantation.

      Acquired candidate predictors are among others:

        -  Global and regional T1/T2

        -  T1/T2 inhomogeneity

        -  Extracellular volume fraction

        -  Microvascular dysfunction

        -  LA function and filling fraction

        -  Global and regional circumferential, radial or longitudinal myocardial strain

        -  Biomarkers
