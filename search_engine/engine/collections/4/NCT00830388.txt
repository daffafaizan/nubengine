        1. To assess the efficacy of ketoconazole 2% foam for the treatment of tinea versicolor

        2. To assess the safety of ketoconazole 2% foam for the treatment of tinea versicolor based
           on the occurrence of adverse events.

        3. To assess treatment satisfaction as rated by patients

      Study Design:

      This will be a mono-centered, single arm, open-label pilot study. Ten adult patients age 19
      and older with a clinical diagnosis of tinea versicolor, as well as a positive KOH using
      calcofluor, will be enrolled at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. There will be 4
      scheduled visits (baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 4). A target area will be identified and
      mycological and clinical assessments will be performed at this site as well as a global
      assessment of each subject. Ketoconazole 2% foam will be applied to all affected areas for 2
      weeks with a follow-up visit at week 4. Skin scraping using a disposable #15 blade for
      calcofluor/potassium hydroxide (KOH) assessment and photographs of target lesions will be
      performed at baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 4. Photographs will be taken at baseline and
      at week 4 (only if KOH is positive). Body surface area estimation of disease will also be
      performed at each visit. Evaluation of scale, hyperpigmentation/erythema, and
      hypopigmentation using a 4 point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) of the
      target area will be performed at baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 4. A global assessment
      will be conducted at each visit using the same 4 point scale. Patient questionnaires will be
      administered at baseline and week 2 to assess symptoms and satisfaction with study
      medication.
