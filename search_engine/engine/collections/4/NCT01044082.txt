    
      In this randomized controlled trial, conducted in 6 maternity units, information will be
      provided to eligible women during a prenatal visit in late pregnancy. Once in labour ward,
      during labour and before delivery, and if eligible and willing to participate, the woman will
      be randomly allocated to the intervention or reference group.

      In all women, immediately after the birth of the baby, 5 IU prophylactic oxytocin will be
      intravenously administered, the umbilical cord will be early clamped and cut, and a collector
      bag placed under the woman's buttocks.

      In the intervention group, controlled cord traction will be applied as soon as a firm uterine
      contraction is obtained, and until placental delivery occurs.

      In the reference group, clinical signs of placental separation will be awaited for, and then
      placental expulsion may be helped through maternal pushing and/or hypogastric pressure.

      All other aspects of the management of the third stage will be standardized and common to all
      women.

      On day 2 postpartum, a venous blood sample will be collected to measure plasma haemoglobin
      and haematocrit. On the same day, a questionnaire will be filled in by the woman to assess
      her satisfaction.
