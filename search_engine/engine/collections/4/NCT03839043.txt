      interventions in healthcare settings. The main objective of this project is to determine
      whether an innovative tobacco use intervention targeting abstinence from the morning of
      surgery until one week after surgery ("quit for a bit") can increase sustained engagement of
      surgical patients in treatment compared with a standard tobacco use intervention that
      specifically targets long-term abstinence ("quit for good").
