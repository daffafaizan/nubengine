    
      This is a prospective cohort trial in which a total of 80 female subjects with infertility
      between the ages of 21 and 42 years of age undergoing ovarian stimulation will be recruited.
      After giving informed written consent the subject to undergo standard ovarian ultrasound
      monitoring with transvaginal ultrasounds during the ovarian stimulation. Monitoring will be
      performed with two-dimensional measurements of each follicle greater than 10 mm in size by
      the ultrasonographer. SonoAVC will then be applied to both ovaries for automated counting and
      measurement of the follicles within the ovaries. The patient will then undergo two 6-second
      ultrasounds of the right and left ovaries which will then be transmitted in a DICOM format to
      mask regional based recurrent neural network which is been trained and validated for follicle
      detection and quantification using curated transvaginal ultrasound images.
