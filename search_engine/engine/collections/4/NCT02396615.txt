      condition and a control condition at least one week apart. After having successfully
      completed screening procedures eligible participants will be invited for two separate test
      days, at least 7 days apart. On the two test days, the products will be provided in a
      randomized order as part of a fixed breakfast meal, and subjective appetite ratings will be
      measured every 30 min for the following 8 hours. Satiety and satiation will be measured
      through administration of test meals in the laboratory supplied with controlled food intake
      under free-living conditions
