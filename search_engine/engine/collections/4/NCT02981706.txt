      access is required to perform dialysis and current guidelines support arteriovenous fistulas
      (AVFs) over arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) as the preferred vascular access for dialysis.
      However, the preferred choice of vascular access in the elderly is unclear. Older adults have
      higher rates of complications from AVF placement compared to AVG placement. Placement of a
      dialysis access and the procedures subsequently required to achieve and maintain access
      functionality could result in further declines of function in this already frail population
      and potentially reduce quality of life. High burdens of cardiovascular disease, heterogeneous
      life expectancy and variable health goals may make the ideal choice of vascular access
      different in the elderly population than the general dialysis population.
