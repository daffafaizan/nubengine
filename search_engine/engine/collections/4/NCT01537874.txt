      threat that disproportionately burdens young children in communities of low socioeconomic
      position. Breathe Free For Kids is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Ml compared with usual best practices (UBP) by having
      parents voluntarily adopt smoke-free home policies to protect children from SHS. The
      Motivational Interviewing intervention protocol was developed in conjunction with community
      partners, integrated into a health department-sponsored home visiting program for high-risk
      children and other community-based agencies serving children, and delivered by trained
      community health workers.
