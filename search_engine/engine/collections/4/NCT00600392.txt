        1. To identify the molecular pathways that may be altered in the blood and skeletal muscles
           of the patients undergoing CRT by using transcriptional analysis of the blood and
           skeletal muscle in these patients

        2. To identify objective measurable molecular signals, using gene expression profiling,
           that correlate with clinical improvement in patients undergoing CRT.

        3. To identify the molecular profile of patients who are most likely to benefit from CRT
           with improvement of exercise capacity and reversal of cardiac cachexia.

        4. To identify biochemical pathways involved in cardiac cachexia.

        5. To identify genes involved in positive remodeling and reversal of apoptotic cascade in
           the skeletal muscle.
