      I. To estimate complete response at 25 weeks after registration for those with a carcinoma in
      situ (CIS) component and to evaluate event-free survival at 18 months in patients with
      BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta/T1/CIS) treated with
      atezolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate event-free survival at 18 months for the subset of patients with papillary
      cancer (Ta/T1).

      II. To estimate progression-free survival, cystectomy-free survival, bladder cancer-specific
      survival, overall survival in all patients.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the level of agreement between local and central pathology review in terms of
      recurrence (for all patients) and complete response (for the CIS subset).

      II. To identify markers that predict response to atezolizumab in the CIS population and that
      are associated with event-free survival (EFS) in patients with Ta/T1/CIS BCG-unresponsive
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The following markers will be tested:

      IIIa. Expression of PD-L1 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IIIb. Expression of immune
      signatures by ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (RNA-seq).

      IIIc. Peripheral immune response by mass cytometry (CyTOF) and TruCulture.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 17 cycles (51 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years and
      then every 24 weeks for 3 years.
