      with approximately 15 patients being enrolled at Austin Health. All participants will receive
      the same treatment (RAD001 10mg/d given orally).

      After screening for eligibility, participants will receive RAD001 10mg/d until tumour
      progression.

      Participants will undergo regular CT scans (every 6 weeks during treatment) to evaluate the
      effectiveness of treatment. Providing they are tolerating treatment satisfactorily, they may
      receive study treatment until progression of disease.

      Blood samples will be taken during the screening phase and every 3 weeks during the treatment
      phase of the trial. Participants will be followed-up every 3 months to find out about
      survival status, new chemotherapy or biological treatment and the outcome of any ongoing
      adverse events.
