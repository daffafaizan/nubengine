the periodicity of microfilariaeix. transfusion of microfilariae (edesonfilaria) intomonkeys at a different phase of the circadian rhythmthis paper reports experiments in which microfilariae at one phase of theircircadian rhythm were transfused into a host at another phase of the circadianrhythm, in an attempt to analyse the relative importance of the rhythmsinherent in the microfilariae and of those in the host for the production ofthe well known periodic migrations.  the experiments were performed withedesonfilaria malayensis (yeh, 1960) present in a macaca monkey from thailand.
