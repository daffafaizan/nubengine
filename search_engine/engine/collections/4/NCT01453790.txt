      practices with negative effects on the behavior, development, and physical health of
      children. The value of identifying and treating maternal depression for child development and
      well-being is well documented. Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers to the recognition
      and treatment of maternal depression. This is particularly problematic in younger women, as
      they are less often seen for health care. The overall objective of this project is to test
      whether the uptake of follow-up recommendations for potential depression by mothers
      identified by screening in clinical settings is improved by parent-specific targetting of
      depression education and motivational advice.
