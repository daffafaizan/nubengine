      RiverDiagnostics gen2-SCA Skin Composition Analyzer (RiverDiagnostics, Rotterdam,
      Netherlands). All experiments will be carried out on the volar forearm. Semi-quantitative
      concentration profiles for several skin parameters will be determined, for example natural
      moisturizing factor (NMF) and cholesterol.

      Additionally the total cholesterol level will be detected by venous blood sample analysis.
      The blood samples will be taken weekly within two weeks, similar to the Raman measurements.
