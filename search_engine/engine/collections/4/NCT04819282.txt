      Fitness Test (SFT). Participants were informed about the procedure of the test. All
      participants performed two evaluation sessions by the SFT with and without using a surgical
      mask. The participants were randomly selected to perform the test whether with or without the
      surgical mask at first. The sessions were held at least 24 hours apart to prevent fatigue.
