      organ access. Great efforts have been made to minimize access trauma. The further development
      of laparoscopy led to the miniaturization of surgical instruments and otherwise the use of
      natural orifices, like the stomach, rectum or vagina. The cholecystectomy is currently
      performed needlescopicly with 2-3 mm trocars and in transumbilically assisted transvaginal
      technique. The aim of this randomized study is to compare these two techniques in female
      patients that are in need of an elective cholecystectomy. The patients will be randomized on
      a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups. In the needlescopic group the investigators will use
      two 2-3 mm working trocars and one 10 mm optic trocar, also to extract the gallbladder. In
      the transvaginal/transumbilical group the investigators will perform the Zornig technique
      using a 5 mm trocar in the umbilicus and a 10 mm trocar together with a 5 mm seizing forceps
      through the posterior vaginal vault. The primary endpoint of this trial is to measure the
      intensity of pain in motion measured from the day of the operation until postoperative day 2.
      Four different measurements of pain will be used. Furthermore the investigators examine
      perioperative complications as security parameters. The trial is supported in part by the
      German Ministry of Research and Education (CHIR-Net grant, BMBF No. 01-GH-0605).
