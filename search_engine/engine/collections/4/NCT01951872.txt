      desire or unsuccessful efforts to stop or reduce caffeine consumption. The aim of Study 1 is
      to recruit and identify individuals who are interested in receiving treatment to reduce or
      quit caffeine consumption. Individuals will be recruited from Baltimore, MD and surrounding
      communities via flyers and newspaper and radio advertisements. Those who are eligible will be
      invited to come to the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit located on the Johns Hopkins
      Bayview Medical Center campus in Baltimore, MD. After consent is obtained at intake (consent
      form A), a series of questionnaires will be completed (e.g., demographics, caffeine history,
      medical and psychiatric history, mood), followed by a structured clinical interview that will
      assess caffeine use and dependence. Individuals who meet eligibility criteria will be offered
      the opportunity to receive assistance to reduce or quit caffeine. Those who consent (consent
      form B) to enroll in the second phase of the project will be randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions: 1) immediate treatment or 2) delayed treatment. The conditions will be identical
      with the exception of a 6 week delay for the delayed treatment group. Participants will
      receive a caffeine reduction and cessation treatment manual during a brief treatment session
      at week 1. Treatment progress will be assessed during a study session approximately 7 weeks
      post-treatment, during a telephone interview approximately 8 weeks post-treatment, and during
      a follow-up telephone call approximately 27 weeks after the treatment session. Progress will
      be assessed via questionnaires, food diaries, and salivary caffeine measures.
