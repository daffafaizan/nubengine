        -  remaining herpes infection recurrence free 6 and 12 months after the treatment
           initiation,

        -  time to first episode during the treatment,

        -  duration of episodes,

        -  symptomatology during the entire relapse time,

        -  use of Rescue Medication (RM),

        -  evaluation of impact on the quality of life,

        -  safety issues.

      Treatment phase:

      Group n°1 = 2LHERP® (6 months of treatment) Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)
      Post-treatment follow-up phase: 6 months. Treatment will be considered successful if the
