      measuring blood pressure and heart rate as compared to standard post-operative blood pressure
      and heart rate monitoring with an arterial line and heart monitor.

      Hypertension affects about 75 million Americans and is the leading cause of cardiovascular
      disease (heart attacks and strokes), resulting in about 1,000 deaths per day. Only 50% of
      patients have their blood pressure adequately managed thus necessitating a better solution.
      Current limitations to hypertension management in non-ICU or non-surgical settings include:
      1) infrequent measurements, 2) inherent data variability, 3) white coat hypertension, 4)
      non-compliance, or 5) poor patient-provider follow-up. A majority of patients have their
      blood pressure measured only during clinic visits. A wearable blood pressure sensor that
      takes multiple measurements per day will allow for a new level of granularity among
      measurements. With more continuous measurements, patients and physicians can work together to
      identify the onset and progression of hypertension before it causes irreversible damage to
      the heart, kidneys, and brain.

      During testing, each subject will wear the Omron HeartGuide™ Smartwatch. Both right and left
      wrist circumferences will be measured prior to placing the device. All patients will be on
      continuous telemetry according to standard clinical practice on the ICU. Each patient will be
      outfitted with the Omron HeartGuide™ Smartwatch (opposite extremity of the arterial line). An
      Omron BP reading will be obtained at the same time as the arterial line reading. Four
      readings in total will be obtained for each patient. All four readings may occur on the same
      day or may be occur over several days.
