      and sodium nitroprusside will be obtained in healthy volunteers during preconstriction with
      phenylephrine and after pretreatment with a single dose of 500 mg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid.

      Study II: Using venous occlusion plethysmography dose-response curves to acetylcholine,
      sodium nitroprusside and L-NG-monomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA) will be obtained in healthy
      volunteers pretreated with a single dose of 500mg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid.
