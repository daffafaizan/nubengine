      Centers and Wound Care Clinics.

      The study will use random assignment of patients who meet inclusion criteria to:
      postoperative shoe with or without collagen; removable Air-boot with or without collagen; or
      monitored Air-boot with or without collagen. All treatment is standard of care.

      Enrollment will occur at a clinic appointment. During the consent appointment, follow-up will
      be scheduled. Patients whose wound meets study criteria will be approached by a Podiatrist or
      therapist during a wound care visit. An A1c will be obtained, if not done within the past 3
      months. A convenience sample will be drawn from people with diabetes, aged 18 or more, who
      meet inclusion criteria.

      Frequency of visits will be:

        -  patients with monitored Air-boot: weekly

        -  all others: every 2 weeks At each visit there will be a dressing change, wound
           assessment and review of how many times shoe/boot was removed or not used during the
           preceding 1 or 2 weeks.

      Should healing not occur within 6 months or the wound progress, the patient will be referred
      for evaluation of possible vascular involvement.
