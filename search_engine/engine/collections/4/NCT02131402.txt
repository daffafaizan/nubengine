      comparing different lens materials (hydrogel vs silicone hydrogel). It is anticipated that
      this study will involve 2 visits, for each lens pair, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens
      dispensing), V2 (1 hour post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear the test
      and control lenses in a series of three short fitting comparisons.
