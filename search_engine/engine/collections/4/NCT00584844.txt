      who were at risk of occupational exposure to F tularensis virus. Based on screening
      examinations; if a subject had a positive baseline titer (<1:20) and gave no history of
      significant exposure to F tularensis or history of tularemia disease, had never received
      tularemia vaccination, and was at risk of exposure to F tularensis they could be enrolled in
      this protocol to receive vaccination. Subjects returned for follow-up exams on Days 1, 2, and
      7; once between Days 12 and 16; and once between Days 28 and 35 post-vaccination. If titers;
      after blood samples on Days 28, 35 and 12 months showed <1:20 the vaccination could be
      repeated at Days 56-84. If the repeat titer remained <1:20, a booster vaccination could be
      administered. Subjects could be boosted 2 times with 1 year. If the titer measured 12 months
      after vaccination (+30 days) was >1:20 and the subject had no lingering AEs, the subjects
      participation was considered complete.
