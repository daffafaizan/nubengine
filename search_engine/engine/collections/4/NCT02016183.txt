      hydrochlorothiazide combination tablets (ECARD combination tablets) to evaluate in
      hypertensive patients in the routine clinical setting. Because the drug contains a diuretic
      (hydrochlorothiazide) , it is necessary to assess the safety, especially on serum uric acid.
      (the planned sample size is 3000).

      The usual adult dosage is 1 tablet (4 mg/6.25 mg or 8 mg/6.25 mg as a candesartan
      cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide) administered orally once daily. This drug should not be used
      as a first-line drug for hypertension treatment.
