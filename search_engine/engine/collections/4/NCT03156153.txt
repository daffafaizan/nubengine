      in China, it is an urgent to find some effective medicine. Some studies have reported
      bumetanide, a classic diuretic, could improve autistic behaviors in both animal model and
      humans; while the efficiency of bumetanide on Chinese autistic chilren is unkonwn and the
      underlying mechanisms remain unfolding. The investigators aim at investigating whether
      bumetanide would improve the clinical symptoms in Chinese children with autism within a safe
      dosage and further study the physiological mechanism beneath.The investigators will regularly
      assess the participants' autism-related symptoms during medication, as well as the adverse
      effects of each patient. The investigators will carry out genome-wide association analysis
      (GWAS) from blood sample, related metabolites in nervous system and compare the concentration
      of the neurotransmitter in autistic brain before and after 3 months' treatmeat,and also will
      collect the EEG signal in autistic chilldren when the participants performing certain tasks
      before and after 3 months' treatment.
