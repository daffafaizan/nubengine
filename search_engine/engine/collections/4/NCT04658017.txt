      sessions of hemodialysis with the GARNET each of 3-4 hour duration at a blood flow rate of
      250 to 400 mL/min. Any necessary dialysis treatment dosing prescription changes will be made
      by the treating physician, based on results of small molecule clearance (i.e., urea reduction
      ratio (URR)). After the second treatment session with the GARNET device, the subjects will
      resume their hemodialysis regimen using a standard hemodialyzer. Subjects will be followed
      for 30 days after the final treatment session to evaluate safety.
