      over chemotherapy alone. 4 Phase II- III studies patients without disease progression after 3
      months of systemic chemotherapy and CRT had a longer survival than those continuing on
      chemotherapy. Therefore chemotherapy followed by CRT may be a better approach. Also the
      effect of blocking EGFR will be evaluated in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine
      and capecitabine combination will be used as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
