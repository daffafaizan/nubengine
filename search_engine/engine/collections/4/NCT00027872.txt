    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate of R115777 (tipifarnib) in previously untreated
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in (a) elderly patients (age >= 75) and (b) patients (age >= 65)
      with AML preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), using a chronic dosing schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free and overall survival in patients with previously untreated
      AML treated with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.

      II. To determine the duration of response in patients with previously untreated AML treated
      with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.

      III. To determine the effect of R115777 on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PI3K) in leukemic cells.

      IV. To determine the effect of R115777 on processing of the farnesylated protein HDJ-2.

      V. To determine the toxicities of R115777 when given in a chronic dosing schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Patients with a complete or
      partial response, hematologic improvement, or stable disease continue treatment every 29-63
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete
      response after the second course of therapy receive 2 additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-17
      months.
