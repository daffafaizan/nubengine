      dietary salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension estimated to be responsible for
      one in ten deaths from CVD events. Salt consumption worldwide and in the UK exceeds the
      recommendations. One of the main determinants of food intake, and potentially salt, is taste
      which may be genetically determined. Research exploring the associations between genetics,
      salt taste and salt intake is scarce. Better understanding of these associations would be of
      specific interest in younger populations as it has been shown that it is the young adults
      that have higher preference for salty taste and consequently salt intake. Therefore, the aim
      of this study is to explore the associations between genetics, salt taste perception and salt
      intake in young UK adults.

      One hundred participants (18-35 years) will be recruited. Salt taste thresholds will be
      identified using the British Standards Institution sensory analysis method (BS ISO 3972:2011)
      and preference for salty taste by rating the pleasantness and bitterness of six tomato soups
      with differing salt concentrations. Salt intake will be measured using five step multiple
      pass 24-hour recall completed via online platform (Online surveys) for one day of the week
      and one weekend day. Participants will be genotyped for genetic variants in the SCNN1B and
      TRPV1 genes coding for ion channels expressed in taste cells.
