      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral clofarabine when given with LDAC
      (cytarabine) in patients age >= 60 with previously treated AML or high risk MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)
      after therapy with oral clofarabine and LDAC for previously treated AML or high-risk MDS.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of clofarabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive clofarabine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and low-dose cytarabine
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 or SC QD on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
      every 21-28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
