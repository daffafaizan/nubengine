      positive breast cancer. In at least three large randomized clinical trials the addition or
      sequential administration of a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an antracycline-based
      regimen resulted in superior clinical outcome for women with node positive early breast
      cancer. In two large randomized studies the dose dense administration with G-CSF support of
      anthracycline-based and paclitaxel combination was superior to the same regimen administered
      every three weeks without growth factors as adjuvant therapy in women with axillary node
      positive breast cancer. In one randomized trial, docetaxel was proved superior to paclitaxel
      in women with metastatic breast cancer. Trastuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) in
      combination with paclitaxel was superior to paclitaxel alone in women with metastatic breast
      cancer overexpressing HER2
