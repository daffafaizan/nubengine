      aqueous extracts that have been depleted of components with a molecular mass of less than
      5000 Daltons by diafiltration. Clinical studies have shown a good tolerance of aqueous grass,
      ragweed and tree pollen allergoids in comparison with allergen preparations. Adsorption of
      pollen allergoids onto aluminium hydroxide suspensions results in depot preparations which
      have been investigated in a series of clinical studies and shown to be well tolerated with
      good clinical efficacy. Depot pollen-allergoids were introduced into the German market in
      1987 under the trade name Allergovit® and are now firmly established and recommended
      primarily for shortcourse preseasonal immunotherapy in pollinosis. Allergovit® is currently
      available in many European and non-European countries. A placebo-controlled study design was
      chosen as improvements in the symptoms of pollen allergies can not be shown over time, as
      pollen seasons of different years are not comparable. Due to the different mechanisms of
      action, specific immunotherapy can not be compared with anti-allergic drugs. Thus the only
      chance to prove efficacy for specific immunotherapy (SIT) is to test versus a parallel
      placebo group.
