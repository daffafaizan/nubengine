      little is known about the effectiveness of medications to treat these disturbances.
      Preliminary data suggests that the dopaminergic agent amantadine may reduce these
      disturbances. This 6-week, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will compare
      amantadine to placebo to assess its effectiveness in reducing behavioral symptoms.
