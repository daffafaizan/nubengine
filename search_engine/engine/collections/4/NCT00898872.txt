        -  Acquire fresh snap-frozen lymphoma tissue from patients with relapsed or recurrent
           non-Hodgkin lymphoma after treatment on a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical
           trial.

        -  Establish a standard set of procedures for routine acquisition, banking, and study of
           lymphoma tissues within the SWOG.

        -  Use repository tissue to establish clinical correlations via presently activated
           phenotyping studies and future projected molecular studies assessing specimen DNA and
           RNA status.

        -  Examine the biology of therapy failure in relationship to changes in pretreatment and
           post-treatment immunophenotypic data.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissues collected at biopsy are snap-frozen and archived for future molecular and genetic
      studies.
