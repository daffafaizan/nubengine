      hemodialysis patients. Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology of stenosis and
      thrombosis of the vascular access, unfortunately translating these advances into either
      improved therapies or a superior process of care has not been very successful. As a result,
      there continues to be an epidemic of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure, a
      proliferation of relatively ineffective interventions such as angioplasty and stent
      placement, an extremely high incidence of catheter use (1).

      A major problem is the timely diagnosis of AVF access dysfunction, which - undiagnosed and
      untreated - will eventually result in its loss. Current methods of diagnosing impending AVF
      deterioration utilize measurement of access flow, access flow recirculation, ultrasound
      imaging and angiography. None of these methods are applicable on a per-treatment basis and
      require some sort of intervention.

      Recent advances in video-imaging open the opportunity to non-invasively track AVF movements,
      possibly on a routine basis. These AVF movements are created by the arterial pulse and
      routinely checked manually prior to each AVF cannulation. In this research the investigators
      plan to film the actual AVF movements with the goal to explore the technical feasibility of
      video-imaging based access surveillance.
