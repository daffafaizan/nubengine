      I. To evaluate the safety of high dose radiotherapy in patients who have liver tumors
      (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]/cholangiocarcinoma/liver metastases from any primary) and who
      have impaired liver function or low functional liver volume or who have received prior liver
      radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 2 year local control with radiotherapy in these patients. II. To evaluate
      tumor response, patterns of failure, and survival in these patients.

      III. To evaluate imaging- and serum-based biomarkers in these patients, as correlates of
      hepatic toxicity and tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 15 or 25 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks and then every 3-4
      months for 2 years. Patients who progress during the two year follow-up period are followed
      up every 6 months.
