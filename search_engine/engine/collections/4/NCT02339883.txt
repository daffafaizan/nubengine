      The goals of this pilot study are to establish a normative database of vital signs, cognitive
      function and unusual subjective sensations in a 0T scanner. This data will be used as a
      reference for a future study of the effects of exposure to a 11.7T static magnetic field.

      Study Population

      26 healthy volunteers, aged 22-65.

      Accrual ceiling =50

      Accrual Target =26

      Drop outs will be replaced

      Design

      The study consists of one outpatient screening session and one experimental session. Informed
      consent and a history and neurological examination will be carried out at the screening
      visit. Vital signs (pulse oximeter, heart rate, respiratory rate and skin temperature) will
      be measured immediately before and after the experimental scan session, and pulse oximeter,
      heart rate and respiration will be monitored when the subject is in the scanner. Subjects
      will remain in the scanner for approximately 1 hour. During the experimental session, while
      the subject is in the scanner, they will be asked to carry out a brief test of attention at
      10-15 minute intervals, up to 3 times during the session. At the end of the experimental
      session, subjects will fill out the MRI exit questionnaire to rate subjective sensations such
      as nausea, vertigo, and lightheadedness, on a Likert scale and complete a computerized
      neuro-cognitive test battery.

      Outcome Measures

      The objective of the study is to obtain a normative dataset of neuropsychological test
      measures, physiological parameters, and subjective experiences measures in subjects
      undergoing 0T exposure.
