      infection and who have had no previous eradication treatment.The diagnosis of Hp infection
      was made through an anatomopathological study. Gastric biopsies were taken according to the
      Sydney protocol: two fundics in one pot, two antrals and one at the angle of the lesser curve
      in a second pot. The biopsies were studied by an experienced anatomopathologist.

      The included patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups according to a 1: 1
      ratio: the first group received concomitant quadruple therapy (QC) combining a double dose
      PPI (esomeprazole: 40 mg x 2 per day) with the amoxicillin (1 g x 2 per day), metronidazole
      (500 mg x 2 per day) and clarithromycin (500 mg x 2 per day) for 14 days. The second group
      received triple therapy (TT) combining a double dose PPI (esomeprazole: 40 mg x 2 per day)
      with amoxicillin (1 g x 2 per day) and clarithromycin (500 mg x 2 per day) for 14 days.

      H. pylori eradication was assessed by the 13C-urea breath test 8 weeks after treatment.
