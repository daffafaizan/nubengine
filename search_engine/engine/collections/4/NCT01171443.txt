      combination with other novel agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).

      Peripheral neuropathy is a significant dose limiting toxicity of bortezomib, which typically
      occurs within the first treatment cycles with bortezomib, reaching plateau around cycle 5,
      and does not appear to increase thereafter.

      Although bortezomib is known to be selective proteasome inhibitor, the mechanisms of
      cytotoxicity are poorly understood.

      It has been theoretically hypothesized that bortezomib abrogates the degradation of I-kB,
      which blocks the transcriptional activity of NF-kB, however, recent studies demonstrated that
      bortezomib elicits activation of multiple pathways in cancer cells, such as reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) pathway.

      The involvement of oxidative stress is supported by emerging studies showing that ROS
      generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib induced apoptotic
      cascade.

      Oxidative stress is a complex and dynamic situation characterized by an imbalance between the
      productions of ROS and the availability and action of antioxidants.
