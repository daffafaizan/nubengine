      therapy with DOX+TRZ in the breast cancer setting. Although FLX is commonly consumed in up to
      30% of women with breast cancer to improve overall disease burden and survival, it is
      important to study whether this natural dietary agent can also reduce the cardiotoxic side
      effects of DOX+TRZ in the clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that the
      prophylactic consumption of FLX "milk" will prevent adverse cardiovascular remodeling and
      improve overall functional capacity in women with breast cancer receiving DOX+TRZ therapy.
      The two specific aims of the CANFLAX study include: Aim 1: FLX "milk" will prevent the
      development of heart failure in women with early stage breast cancer (EBC) who are treated
      with DOX+TRZ based chemotherapy; and Aim 2: FLX "milk" will improve cardiac functional
      capacity in this patient population.
