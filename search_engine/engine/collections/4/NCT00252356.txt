      patients with MajorDepressive Disorder (MDD) using escitalopram (10 mgqd) as positive
      control. The present study is an 8-week, double-blind, placebo- and escitalopram-controlled,
      randomized, parallel-group study. A 1-week, placebo, single-blind period precedes the 8-week
      randomized treatment period and an optional 18-week, double-blind extension period follows
      the randomized treatment period. A Safety Follow up Visit is scheduled 1 week after the acute
      and extension period, or early termination. Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI), an approved treatment for MDD, is chosen as a positive control agent in
      this study. The dose of 10 mg is within the approved dose range with no need for dose
      adjustment in elderly patients. This trial is designed to formally compare the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of SR58611A to placebo. Escitalopram is used as a positive control.
