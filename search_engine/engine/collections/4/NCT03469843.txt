      transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and the long term reinnervation process has not
      been studied. We sought to describe the reinnervation status of adult patients long after the
      ASO, to identify areas of myocardial perfusion/innervation mismatch and to assess the
      relation of innervation status and exercise capacity.
