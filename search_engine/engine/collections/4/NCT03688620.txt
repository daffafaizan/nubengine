      increase in the frequency and/or severity of expected reactions (local, systemic or allergic
      reactions) that may indicate a potential risk.

      The study is a passive enhanced safety surveillance aiming to collect prospectively AEIs
      and/or other AEs experienced within 7 days post vaccination with GSK's quadrivalent seasonal
      influenza vaccine, using customized Adverse Drug Reaction cards. Data will be collected via
      the healthcare provide (HCP) or study medical staff who administer the seasonal influenza
      vaccination or who provide the inform consent form and the ADR cards.
