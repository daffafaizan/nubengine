      undergo a biopsy of the muscle from the inner thigh under anesthesia. During the same
      procedure, muscle fiber fragments will be obtained from the sample and then immediately
      delivered via target injected into the bladder neck sphincter region using an endoscopic
      needle via cystoscope or under ultrasound guidance. All subjects will be followed at 1 week,
      6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment injection.
