      women with vaginal pH≥5.5), aged 45 - 75, with at least 12 months of amenorrhea. Enough women
      will be screened to ensure five women for each pH range.

      Using a speculum, the mid lateral vaginal wall is made visible, samples will be collected by
      the physician or nurse using a flocked swab. After collection, vaginal swabs will be stored
      immediately in adequate liquid medium at 4ºC and will be transported to the lab within 7
      hours after sampling for further storage and culture of the material.

      The vaginal microbiota of post-menopausal women with a vaginal pH of ≤ 4.5 and ≥ 5.5 will be
      characterized and compared using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing. In
      additional, optimal conditions for cultivation and storage of the vaginal microbiota will be
      examined for use in assays mimicking the vaginal microbial community of postmenopausal women.
