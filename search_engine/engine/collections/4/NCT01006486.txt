    
      A Randomized, Crossover, Clinical Trial performed to compare the results of oral
      anticoagulation for Chagas and non-Chagas disease patients treated at an anticoagulation
      clinic and by the usual clinical practice. The primary endpoint was the time that the
      International Normalized Ratio (INR) was in the therapeutic range and the secondary endpoints
      were thromboembolic/haemorragic events.
