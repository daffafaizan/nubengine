      systemic antimicrobials may provide more effective treatment for chronic periodontitis by
      targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive
      effects of oral clarithromycin (CLM) to nonsurgical periodontal therapy for chronic
      periodontitis.

      Materials and Methods: 30 patients were categorized into two groups: test group - Base line
      scaling and root planing(SRP) was done. Clarithromycin tablet 500 mg( Clarino-500) was given
      for a period of 7 days orally two times per day. control group -only SRP done . Clinical
      parameters were recorded at baseline , 3 months, and six months interval .They included
      gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Also microbial
      analysis of subgingival plaque samples was done at baseline, 3months and six months interval
      to estimate the levels of Pg and Aa bacteria using culture methods. Immunological parameter
      like estimation of C-Reactive protein was done in both groups at baseline 3 months and 6
      months period. tests were used for statistical analysis.
