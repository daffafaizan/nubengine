      of the mouth, used to cover the exposed root of a tooth, affects the overall outcome of the
      root coverage, the health of the resulting tissue, as well as postoperative pain as reported
      by the patient. Connective tissue grafts will be harvested in different thicknesses, and
      results of the procedures will be compared. Qualified subjects will undergo a root coverage
      procedure, after random assignment to one of the groups. Regular recall visits to monitor
      healing at intervals of 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months will be scheduled. Subjects
      will be asked to fill out patient response forms regarding pain and other symptoms at these
      visits. Photographs will be taken.
