      HDL-C levels in HIV uninfected individuals and in some small, short duration studies in
      HIV-infected individuals, there are no data that extend these observations to determine
      whether intake of omega-three fats over a more prolonged time period will also have a
      beneficial impact on functional outcomes such as vascular endothelial function and anatomic
      surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV-infected patients.

      We propose a randomized, double blind trial of purified omega-three fatty acids in
      HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides. While the impact of
      omega-three fatty acids on lipid profiles should be evident early (within 12 weeks); we
      propose to conduct this trial for a full 24 months to test our overall hypothesis that this
      intervention will not only improve triglyceride and HDL-C levels, improve HDL-subpopulations,
      plasma and membrane phospholipids and decrease inflammation, but will also improve brachial
      artery reactivity testing (BART) as a measure of vascular endothelial function at 24 weeks
      and 24 months and arterial stiffness measured by a pulse wave velocity test as a surrogate
      marker of CVD risk at 24 months when compared to controls.

      The specific aims of this proposal include:

        1. To conduct a randomized, placebo controlled trial of omega-three fatty acids over 24
           months in HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides (> 150 mg/dl).

        2. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on TG levels and on HDL-C
           levels, HDL subpopulations, composition of plasma and membrane phospholipids, and
           chronic inflammation as measured by c-reactive protein (CRP), sPLA2 and by levels of
           arachidonic acid.

        3. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on BART at 24 weeks and 24
           months and on arterial stiffness at 24 months.
