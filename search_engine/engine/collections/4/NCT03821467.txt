      points to gain information of short- and long-term reproducibility. In addition, provocation
      with flickering light will be performed, which is known to lead to vasodilatation and an
      increase in retinal blood flow in healthy subjects. Vessel diameters will also be measured
      using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA).
