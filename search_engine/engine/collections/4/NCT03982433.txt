      pain and heavy alcohol use among patients living with HIV and determine its feasibility and
      acceptability. Through an open pilot trial, this phase of this project will deliver an
      integrated alcohol-pain behavioral intervention to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      through videoconferencing. Intervention evaluation outcomes for this initial phase will
      include reduction of standard number of drinks per week, reduction in heavy drinking days,
      reduction of chronic pain severity and interference, ratings of patient satisfaction with
      treatment, and rate of treatment adherence.
