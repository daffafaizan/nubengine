      bupropion in treating overweight women with binge eating disorder (BED). Bupropion is an
      antidepressant that has demonstrated efficacy in smoking cessation and some efficacy in
      obesity treatment. Since cravings and depressed mood are hypothesized to contribute to binge
      eating episodes, bupropion is a promising psychopharmacological agent in treating binge
      eating and reducing weight. It is hypothesized that compared to placebo, bupropion will
      produce significantly greater reductions in the frequency of binge eating. Secondary goals
      are to explore interrelationships between treatment and changes in cravings, frequency of
      binge episodes, emotional eating, and weight loss. Following the medication phase of the
      trial, all patients will be offered 8 weeks of behavioral weight loss treatment administered
      by doctoral-level psychologists specializing in eating disorders and weight management.
