      their routine preoperative evaluation. Patients were classified as presenting OSAS if
      apnea-hypopnea index obtained from preoperative full-night polysomnography was greater than
      5/hour. Cough threshold was measured with citric acid. Increasing concentrations of mouth-
      nebulized citric acid (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 mg/mL) were delivered during
      inspiration until a cough was elicited. The citric acid concentration eliciting one cough
      (C1) was defined as the cough reflex threshold.
