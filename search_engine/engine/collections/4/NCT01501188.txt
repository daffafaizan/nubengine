    
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a very common disease. Patients with this pathology
      present peripheral muscle pump impairment and restricted range of ankle motion. Few data are
      available on the use in chronic venous insufficiency patients of Kinesio Taping, a physical
      therapist's elastic dressing that permits action on muscle activity and joint range.
