      patients from three teaching hospital (Ruijin Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai
      Pulmonary Hospital) in Shanghai at the beginning. The network will be promoted to other
      cities and different places in China. Patients with bronchiectasis would be enrolled and
      detailed information would be recorded. Follow-up of patients would provide more information
      on the prognosis of disease. Optimal treatment studies for the patients will be initiated one
      by one based on the network. The investigators are committed to promoting clinical research
      and education in bronchiectasis, through sharing of protocols, research idea and expertise.
