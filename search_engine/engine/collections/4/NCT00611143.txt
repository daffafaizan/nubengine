      increase incidence of congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and stroke, which
      increase the length of hospital stay, the rates of re-hospitalization, and cost of care. Its
      pathogenesis is multifactorial, and its prevention and management remain suboptimal.
      Recently, observational evidence has suggested that patients who have undergone previous
      statin therapy have a lower incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pretreatment with atorvastatin protects
      against atrial fibrillation following off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
