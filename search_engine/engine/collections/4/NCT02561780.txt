      educational programs, and no standardization for mental health education being taught in
      schools. This study examines the effectiveness of a school-based mental health literacy
      intervention for adolescents, on knowledge and stigma. A secondary objective was to determine
      the generalizability and applicability of an educational resource for mental health in high
      schools.
