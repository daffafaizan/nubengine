    
      The proposed research will be a prospective registry study of patients treated for uterine
      fibroids at the Fibroid Center located at South Miami Hospitals Center for Women and Infants.

      Our objective is to establish the Fibroid Registry:

        -  To collect and review short, middle and long term clinical outcomes data that will help
           inform and facilitate the decision making process of clinicians and patients on the
           safest and most effective treatment for symptomatic uterine myomas, leiomyomas, or
           fibromas.

        -  To be able to critically evaluate the quality of procedures being performed and to
           ultimately establish a gold standard of care based upon patient and clinical outcomes
           and characteristics.
