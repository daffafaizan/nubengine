      and effective method in patients with malignant biliary obstructions and had a comparatively
      long patency duration. Nevertheless, the significant rate of distal stent migration cannot be
      ignored, suggesting the need for a newly designed metallic stent for endoscopic
      ultrasound-guided biliary drainage.
