    
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, pilot safety and efficacy
      study.

      40 healthy young male athetes were randomly assigned to the ReWin(d) or Placebo group. After
      4 weeks supplementation (either 2 g daily of ReWin(d) capsules or placebo capsules). the
      participants were subjected to a 1 hour plyometric exercise session to induce DOMS. At 0
      hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours post exercise, the volunteers have been assessed to
      determine: (i) pain perception, (ii) fatigue rate, (iii) sport performance (effectiveness of
      a jump) and (iv) muscle damage and inflammation by I-R thermography and biomarkers
