      the treatment of prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for
      metastatic prostate cancer. Degarelix is an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agent that
      decreases the amount of testosterone in the body, which helps to fight tumor growth. Usually,
      docetaxel is given after ADT. This study will look at how your cancer changes when docetaxel
      is started before ADT. You are being asked to participate in this study because you have
      metastatic prostate cancer that can be treated with docetaxel and ADT.
