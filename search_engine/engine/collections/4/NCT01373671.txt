      system. The FFDM mammograms are performed using standard care screening or diagnostic
      mammography from various commercially available FFDM systems. All DBT images are acquired on
      the Inspiration DBT system specifically for the study, in addition to the clinically
      indicated screening mammograms. DBT images are read at the clinical sites and any DBT
      findings were investigated according to standard care.
