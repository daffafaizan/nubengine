      optic nerve head, caused by occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery. Non arteritic anterior
      ischaemic optic neuropathy affects more frequently people between 50 and 70 years of age,
      with vasculopathic risk factors. Arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy is caused by
      the Horton disease, affects an older population and is an ophthalmologic emergency because of
      the bilateralisation's risk.

      The aim of this study is to compare the peripapillar vascular density of anterior ischaemic
      optic neuropathy eyes (arteritic and non arteritic) with normal eyes after the disappearance
      of the papillar edema, with oCT-angiography.

      The investigators will include patients with anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and normal
      patients. For each participant, the investigators will estimate the best visual acuity,
      intra-ocular pressure, make a fondus, measurement of retinal nervous layer thickness,
      ganglionar cells layer thickness, and a macular and papillar OCT angiography during a
      consultation (duration 30 min).

      The investigators will be able to know if

        -  there is a modification of the peripapillary vascularisation subsequent to the occlusion
           of the posterior ciliary artery

        -  there is a difference between arteritic and non arteritic anterior ischaemic optic
           neuropathy,

        -  there is a repercussion of the neuropathy on the retinal layers,

        -  there is a difference in peripapillar vascularisation by age.
