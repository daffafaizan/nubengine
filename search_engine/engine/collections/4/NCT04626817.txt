      This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral isotretinoin treatment on muscle strength.
      Our second aim was to evaluate whether there was a correlation between the serum creatine
      phosphokinase (CPK) level, a specific marker of muscle breakdown, and muscle strength.

      METHODS: This study included 30 patients who presented to our hospital and were started on
      oral isotretinoin treatment for acne vulgaris and 30 patients in the control group who were
      given local treatment. Age, gender, height and weight of the patients were recorded, and the
      body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The hamstring and quadriceps muscle strengths of the
      non-dominant side were evaluated in all patients using an isokinetic dynamometer, and the
      peak torque (PT) values were recorded. In the isotretinoin group, isokinetic measurements
      were performed again in those that completed six-month drug treatment and compared with the
      initial PT values.
