      Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital. Only newly diagnosed and drug na√Øve PD patients are
      eligible for inclusion. After initial assessment at baseline, the participants will be
      randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two study groups (n = 15 per group): Nicotamide Riboside
      (NR) 500 mg x 2/day, or placebo. Participants and investigators will be masked to treatment
      group. Participants and investigators will be blinded (double blinded). The study will have a
      4 week exposure period, during which patients will self-administer NR 500 mg x 2/day, or
      placebo per os. Patients will not be using any dopaminergic treatment during the study
      period. During baseline and 4 week follow-up, MDS-UPDRS will be performed as clinical
      measure. We will also collect blood, cerebral spinal fluid and muscle biopsy from all
      subjects at baseline and 4 week follow-up. Imaging will be performed using MRI, DAT Scan and
      FDG-PET at baseline and 4 week follow-up.
