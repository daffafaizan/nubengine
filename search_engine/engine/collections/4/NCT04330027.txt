      advanced and refined form of conventional platelet-rich plasma. Effectiveness of
      intra-articular lyophilized Growth Factors injection has been studied in thirty patients with
      symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis and has shown encouraging results regarding
      improvement of pain, stiffness and function in addition to decreasing knee effusion.

      The lack of good quality evidence to support the efficacy of injecting platelet-derived
      lyophilized growth factors in treatment of subacromial impingement highlights the need for
      thorough evaluation of the outcome of this novel therapeutic option in patients with
      subacromial impingement.
