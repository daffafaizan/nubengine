      I. To assess the safety and efficacy of the combined use of pentostatin and donor lymphocyte
      infusion (DLI) in patients with low or falling donor T-cell chimerism to prevent graft
      rejection after transplantation both from matched related donors (MRDs) or unrelated donors
      (URDs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) infections and disease
      response, if persistent disease is present.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of donor lymphocyte infusion.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pentostatin intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day -2 and DLI
      over 15-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may repeat once beginning with an escalated or same
      cluster of differentiation (CD)3-dose at least 4 weeks if persistent donor T-cells are
      documented, no GvHD has developed, and the chimerism status worsens or, if chimerism status
      is unchanged after at least 8 weeks with two subsequent tests of chimerism 4 weeks apart.

      GROUP II (initiated if patients in group I do not achieve sustained engraftment and improved
      chimerism): Patients receive treatment as in group I. Patients also receive cyclosporine
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 and mycophenolate mofetil PO once daily (QD)
      on days 0 to 27. Treatment continues in the absence of GvHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter.
