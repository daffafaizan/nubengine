      the respiratory modulation of the cardiac period, a witness of the level of the subject's
      sympathetic activity.

      To do this, a mathematical model of this oscillation is adjusted on the experimental data,
      and its characteristics (amplitude, phase, non-linearity...) are considered indexes of the
      interaction to be compared with the same characteristics in other conditions.

      The transition to clinical applications requires validation of the developed tools on
      physiological signals recorded on healthy volunteers in a non-clinical environment, avoiding
      extra psychological stress in the Protocol followed.

      Whether it is for the development of tools or their validation, it is essential that the
      sensors used are non-invasive.

      Recorded situations are those of everyday life, such as working (only sedentary work are
      envisaged), eat, talk, rest and move from one place of life to another one.
