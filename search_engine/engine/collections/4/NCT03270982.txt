      clinical outcomes of the Comprehensive Segmental revision System. The data gathered will be
      collated and used to provide feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts,
      answer potential questions from reimbursement agencies, and will serve as part of Zimmer
      Biomets Post Market Surveillance.

      The Comprehensive Segmental Revision System consists of a proximal humeral replacement system
      (shoulder prosthesis), a distal humeral replacement system (elbow prosthesis) and of a total
      humeral replacement system (shoulder and elbow prosthesis connected by a humeral coupler).

      Patient outcomes will be measured by using measurement tools that have been extensively used
      and referred to in the literature. Specifically, the quickDASH will be used for all cases
      enrolled in the study. In addition, the Constant and Murley Score may be used for shoulder
      applications, the Liverpool Elbow Score may be used for elbow applications and the MSTS Score
      may be used for tumor cases.

      The study population will be compromised of males and females that are eligible according to
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will last for at least five (5) years from the
      time of surgery.
