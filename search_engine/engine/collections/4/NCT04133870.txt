    
      To collect blood and tumour tissue for Part A: molecular profiling, including extraction of
      DNA for sequencing, RNA for expression levels and to identify expressed fusion genes, and
      proteins for proteomic studies and Part B: for establishment of cell lines and patient
      derived xenograft (PDX) models of thyroid cancer.

        1. To correlate BRAF V600E, RAS, RET/PTC, RET, PAX8/PPARϒ, βcatenin, p53, PTEN and PI3K
           mutations in ctDNA with Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded tumour tissue (FFPE) mutational
           analysis.

        2. To correlate the quantity of ctDNA fragments 3 monthly in patients with advanced disease
           on routine follow up with conventional tumour markers (Tg, calcitonin, CEA).

        3. To correlate the quantity of ctDNA fragments 3 monthly once relapse suspected by
           conventional methods (Tg, Calcitonin, CEA, radiological)

        4. To correlate the quantity of ctDNA fragments with response (RECIST, Tg, Calcitonin and
           CEA) to targeted therapies

        5. To assess prognostic significance of ctDNA levels in metastatic/advanced thyroid cancer

        6. To isolate live tumor cells for studies of novel treatment strategies (combinatorial
           treatments), therapy resistance and thyroid cancer biology

        7. Retrieval and analysis of archival primary tissue blocks for comparison with metastatic
           tumour sites

        8. To collect blood for analysis of noninvasive tests of tumour phenotype
