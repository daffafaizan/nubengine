      body weight and increased quality of life. Increased physical capacity and muscle mass lead
      to increased energy expenditure, thus explaining parts of the difference in weight loss
      achieved after lifestyle treatment. However, literature in this area is limited and need
      better documentation of how, and to what extent increased physical capacity can affect the
      effect of lifestyle treatment offered to patients in the health service.
