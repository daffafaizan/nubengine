      described incidences ranging from 60-87% of patients in a number of different countries.
      Delirium is a condition with fluctuating conscience, disorganized thinking and disturbance of
      the sleep/wake cycle. Many patients with delirium experience hallucinations and agitation
      which can be very unpleasant for both patients and their families.

      Some risk factors for the development of delirium well known, e.g. dementia, hypertension,
      illness severity (SAPS II score), delirium on the previous day, mechanical ventilation,
      emergency surgery and metabolic acidosis. The effect of sedative drug administration is not
      clear, as studies has been inconclusive.

      Even though studies regarding the impact of sleep deprivation on development of delirium have
      been inconclusive, there is no doubt that delirious patients have a disturbed sleep-wake
      cycle, sleep architecture and circadian rhythm.

      At the intensive care unit at the Department of Anesthesiology at Køge Hospital, three out of
      nine rooms have a simulated circadian light installed. The idea is that this light rhythm may
      help to keep a natural circadian rhythm, minimizing the risk of delirium.

      With this descriptive and retrospective cohort study, the investigators therefore want to
      describe the incidence and possible risk- and preventive factors of delirium for the
      participants (ICU patients at Køge Hospital), and with a special focus on the possible effect
      of imitated circadian light..
