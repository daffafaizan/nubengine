        1. Feasibility study: screening by auscultation and target echocardiography during flu
           vaccination in a single practice in Birmingham;

        2. Screening study: multi-centre screening by auscultation or target echocardiography in
           geographically diverse general practices across the United Kingdom.

      In each phase, the patient will be identified by auscultation and target echocardiography.
      Management and onward referral will be at the clinical discretion of the GP. Results of
      clinical review, investigation, follow-up and management will be recorded at 3 months from
      that date.
