      diabetic retinopathy. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and has
      been shown to decrease retinal and iris neovascularization in proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy. We believe that preoperative bevacizumab injection could reduce postoperative
      vitreous hemorrhage by decreasing the amount of abnormal vessels and intraoperative injection
      could also reduce postoperative vitreous hemorrhage by inhibiting the vessel formation after
      surgery
