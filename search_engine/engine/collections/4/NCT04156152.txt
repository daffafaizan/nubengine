      majority of patients. The loss of clinical insertion level could be an early indicator or a
      possible risk factor for dentine hypersensitivity (HSD) (15). Therefore, it is necessary to
      correctly diagnose this condition, to achieve a correct treatment of it, which can be
      performed both in the clinic and at home.

      HSD is a condition frequently present in individuals, leading them to seek help from a
      dentist. It has been described as an acute, provoked pain, which is not attributable to any
      other dental pathology. Its current prevalence is unknown, but it occurs in most patients
      after their periodontal treatment, and also in healthy patients. (12) To determine the
      diagnosis and treatment of HSD, it is necessary to deepen the history, the assessment of the
      patient's pain through a self-assessment system such as the visual analogue scale (VAS), the
      differentiation between other pathologies using different tools and clinical interpretation,
      since that the ongoing processes that determine and maintain the opening and permeability of
      dentinal tubules are still under discussion. Multiple therapeutic modalities are used to
      manage HSD according to the intensity of pain and patient education, such as the use of
      remineralizing, desensitizing, blocking, analgesic dentifrices to restorative dentistry
      therapies, mucogingival surgeries, among others (14).

      The research question of this study is: Is the application of a toothpaste based on
      hydroxyapatite / 5% potassium nitrate / sodium monofluorophosphate 1450ppm nano-crystals more
      effective compared to the application of a 5% potassium nitrate / fluoride toothpaste Sodium
      1426ppm in the treatment of HSD? The general objective is to compare the clinical efficacy in
      reducing HSD in patients treated with dentifrices based on nano crystals of hydroxyapatite /
      5% potassium nitrate / sodium monofluorophosphate 1450ppm and potassium nitrate 5% / sodium
      fluoride 1426ppm, during an evaluation period 8 weeks The importance of this study lies in
      the lack of information and quality studies that really assess the effectiveness of the
      various types of desensitizing toothpastes, so as to be clear about the most effective
      dentifrices and direct the dentist in the treatment of HSD
