some hemodynamic observations in congenital heart disease with specialreference to pressure curves in ductus arteriosus .hemodynamic observations in 100 congenital heart disease cases aremade based on data in the department of pediatrics, kyoto universitybetween may 1961 and december 1963 . we have classified these 100 casesaccording to the malformation from the hemodynamic view point . ourcases were classified into the following groups .(1) ventricular septal defect                             35 casessmall ventricular septal defect                       20moderate ventricular septal defect                     9marked ventricular septal defect                       4ventricular septal defect with pulmonary stenosis      2(2) patent ductus arteriosus                              21(3) atrial septal defect                                  19atrial septal defect                                  14atrial septal defect with pulmonary stenosis           5(4) pulmonary stenosis                                     5(5) tetralogy of fallot                                   14(6) aortic stenosis                                        3(7) aortic insufficiency                                   3aortic insufficiency with ventricular septal defect    2aortic insufficiency with pulmonary stenosis           1in sonre small ventricular septal defect, we tried the vasoactivedrugs . phenylephrine was injected slowly into the right ventricle viathe catheter, a rapid rise in femoral arterial pressure associated withbradycardia and intensiffication of the systolic murmur was observed .after the administration of amyl nitrite, a rapid fall in femoralarterial pressure associated with tachycardia and softening of the sys-tolic murmur was observed .in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawnslowly from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, the outstandingpressure curve is recorded in ductus arteriosus . the systolic pressurecurve in the ductus arteriosus is the same as the systolic pressure inthe aorta and the diastolic pressure curve in the ductus arteriosus hasa diastolic dip followed by a late diastolic pressure peak .in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawnfrom the left pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, the pressurecurve reveals a considerable characteristic rise in pulmonary arterialpressure which is regarded as an effect of the transmission of systemicpressure through the ductus arteriosus .
