      procedures of gastrointestinal endoscopy. It was previously reported that music listening may
      exert beneficial effects for patients who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, most
      of the studies did not analyze the effects of the specific music type and listening time in
      diagnostic and therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, respectively. This study
      will test whether the specific music type and listening time before gastrointestinal
      endoscopy could improve patients' experience of the procedure in a randomized controlled
      trial. The results may help to optimize the routine clinical practice at present.
