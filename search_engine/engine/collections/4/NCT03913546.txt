      acute effects of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) on different neuromuscular properties of
      recreational cyclists. Specifically, the investigators will measure the maximum force
      production capacity and muscle activation of the knee extensors concomitantly during a
      maximal voluntary contraction, as well as the maximum and mean power attained during a
      Wingate cycling test (i.e., 30 seconds 'all out'). Participants will undergo the tests on two
      different occasions separated by at least 48 hours and a maximum of 2 weeks. The same tests
      will be conducted in both testing sessions, but participants will be randomly assigned into
      two groups (sham or actual SMT) immediately before the second testing session.
