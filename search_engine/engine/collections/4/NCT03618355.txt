      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and immunologic impact in patients with low risk prostate
      cancer under active surveillance. This new formulation, encapsulated rapamycin (sirolimus),
      provides a more predictable bioavailability of this drug than [the other formulation]. The
      encapsulated and targeted rapamycin (eRapa) can be delivered at a consistent and lower
      dosage, not only improving the toxicity profile but also capitalizing on the newly
      appreciated mechanism of partial and/or intermittent mTOR inhibition, making eRapa an ideal
      immuno-oncologic and chemopreventative agent. Low dose rapamycin has been shown to prevent
      cancer formation, progression, and/or recurrence in the majority of cancer histologies
      including the most prevalent: lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancers.
