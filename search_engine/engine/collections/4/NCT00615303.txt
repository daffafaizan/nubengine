      hundred and twenty-four patients were allocated to receive 2 dosages of either 45 ml of
      sodium phosphate plus 240 mg of simethicone tablets or 45 ml of sodium phosphate plus placebo
      in the evening before and in the morning of the procedure day. The colonoscopic examination
      was recorded. Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and the degree of
      haziness by a single investigator. Five areas of the colon were graded for the amount of air
      bubbles, from 0 to 3; grade 0 and 1 were defined as the diminishing of air bubbles. The
      haziness was graded into 5 levels from excellent to unacceptable. Excellent, good and
      adequate were defined as the diminishing of haziness. The total duration of colonoscopy, the
      side effect of medication and the endoscopist and patient satisfaction were compared between
      2 groups. Endoscopist satisfaction was evaluated by questionnaires. Visual analog scale
      (0-10) was used for rating patient satisfaction and the side effect of medication.
