        -  Determine the feasibility of vaccination with autologous heat shock protein 70 in
           patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this vaccination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs). Heat
      shock protein 70 (HSP70) is derived from the autologous PMNCs. Patients receive HSP70
      intradermally once weekly for 8 weeks.

      Patients are followed for 2 weeks.
