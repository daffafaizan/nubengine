    
      This protocol was designed to assess if when subjects with CF are admitted to the hospital
      for a pulmonary exacerbation if a comprehensive exercise program (moderate to high intensity
      aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercises) was superior to our "usual care
      intervention (30 min/day of self selected mode and intensity of exercise) in improving
      aerobic capacity, muscle strength/power, flexibility and balance.

      The experimental group will participate in the following regime:

      Day 1 - Evaluation including standardized tests and measures: If Day 1 is a M,W, F, day 2
      will constitute: aerobic exercise between 20-30 minutes based on patient tolerance using the
      appropriate RPE scale (13-15 on Borg with patients ages 13-21, and 6-8 on pictoral CERT with
      patients ages 6-12)to ensure correct intensity. Choices will include treadmill, stationary
      bike, game bike, or ambulating at varying intensities throughout hospital; Balance
      Activities: Standing on bosu ball while performing UE activity (throwing, catching with
      another ball, Frisbee, etc.). Standing on one leg or B LE's will be determined by patients
      currently level.

      If Day 1 is a Tuesday or Thursday, day 2 will constitute: 5-10 minutes of aerobic activity at
      warm up level (11-13 on Borg, and 4-6 on PCERT)x resistance training for UE: biceps, triceps,
      lattisimus, rhomboids/mid-trap, thoracic expansion exercises, and other muscles based on
      patient needs; resistance training for LE: quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals (especially
      maximus and medius), and other muscles depending on patient need, core and abdominal
      strengthening, Stretches for flexibility depending on the patients individual needs: Thoracic
      expansion stretches will be done with every pt. supine and sidelying. Stretches are held for
      10 seconds and repeated 10 times, Hamstring stretches will be performed if pt unable to reach
      line with sit and reach test.
