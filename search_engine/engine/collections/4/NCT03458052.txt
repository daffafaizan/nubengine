      prolongs the time on the waiting list and, therefore, the mortality, which rise to 21.15% in
      Argentina compared to a world average of 16%. Many reasons can explain the low procurement
      rate. It has been stated that the conventional ventilatory management for potential lung
      donors is suboptimal for lung preservation before harvest.

      In Argentina there is limited research regarding the attitude toward organ donation among
      health care professionals, knowledge of the federal organ procurement program and
      professional experience in diagnosing brain death and lung donor management. Knowing the
      Argentinian current situation will make it possible to detect possible organ shortages
      causes, evaluate strategies to increase the national procurement rate and to instruct the
      health team that assists neurocritical patients who die of brain death. So we propose the
      following research.

      The aim of this study is to gather information about knowledge, professional experience and
      attitude among health care professionals involved in the care of potential donors toward
      organ donation, procurement process and potential lung donor management nationwide.

      A online questionnaire was designed and distributed among health care professionals register
      to different scientific societies related to the care of neurocritical patients between
      febrary 16th and september 1st. The questionnaire consisting of 37 ítems: 6 items measuring
      attitudes, 6 items measuring knowledge, 16 items investigating professional experience and 9
      ítems assessing demographics.
