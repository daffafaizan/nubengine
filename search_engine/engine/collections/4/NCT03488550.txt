      of ANX007 administered as single IVT injections. Approximately 9 to 15 eligible participants
      are enrolled into one cohort each. All participants receive ANX007 in an open-label manner.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal
      (IVT) injection of ANX007 in participants with primary open-angle glaucoma. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity. An exploratory
      objective will evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of ANX007 on serum C1q activity.
