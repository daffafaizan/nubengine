      that may affect energy expenditure, and thus may possibly modulate body weight. It is
      unknown, however, if deficient dissipation of heat can contribute to human obesity, or if
      obesity induces deficits in heat dissipation, and the relationship between obesity and heat
      in humans is largely unexplored.

      We propose to study obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)) and normal weight (BMI
      less than or equal to 25 kg/m(2)) adults to determine possible obesity-related differences
      in: 1) regional body temperature heterogeneity (i.e., presence of localized areas of heat
      retention), 2) the extent to which locally retained heat may be co-localized with deep fat
      depots, 3) the effectiveness of specific body loci (e.g., the distal extremities) as
      dissipaters of heat, and 4) the ability of approaches that alter heat dissipation to modify
      deep-body temperature heterogeneity.

      It is hoped that the results of this study will provide preliminary evidence for future
      studies that attempt to facilitate weight loss in obese subjects through effective, guided
      applications of heat management.
