      efficacy of a brief psychosocial/behavioral intervention (with adjunctive antidepressant)for
      the treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD) in survivors of ischemic stroke (registered as
      clinical trail NCT00194454). In the earlier trial we demonstrated that a pleasant
      event/problem-solving brief psychosocial-behavioral therapy delivered by psychosocial nurse
      practitioners was highly effective in treating major depression and promoting remission in
      ischemic stroke survivors for up to two years. In this phase, we refine the protocol, and
      potentially make it more cost effective, by conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness
      trial of in-person versus telephone delivery of the intervention, comparing with usual care
      control. We also seek to expand our sample to include hemorrhagic stroke survivors
      (intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) as well as those with ischemic
      stroke.
