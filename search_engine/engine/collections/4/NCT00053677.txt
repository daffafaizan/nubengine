      treatment for this disorder. Preliminary investigations demonstrate that naltrexone in doses
      up to 250 mg/day is well tolerated and safe during an 11-week period and may be a viable
      treatment option for PGD patients with severe urges. The implications of this study extend
      from PGD to other impulse control disorders, including compulsive shopping, kleptomania, and
      possibly alcoholism.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either naltrexone or placebo for 16 weeks. The
      responses of men and women are compared to determine whether efficacy is distributed in a
      male:female ratio analogous to that of the PGD population in the United States. A Clinical
      Global Impression and a Gambling Symptom Scale are used to assess participants.
