    
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of UB-312 in healthy participants and in participants with Parkinson's disease
      (PD). UB-312 is a UBIThÂ®-enhanced synthetic peptide-based vaccine and may provide an active
      immunotherapy option for treating synucleinopathies including the most prevalent form, PD.

      The study consists of two parts. Part A of the study with healthy participants will consist
      of dose escalation and cohort staggering for up to seven planned dose levels or placebo. The
      dose for Part B, a cohort with PD participants will be based on safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity. All eligible participants will be enrolled in a 44-week study consisting of
      20 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of follow-up.
