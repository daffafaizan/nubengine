      influenza-attributable outcomes of interest, which resulted in physician office visits for
      persons who were less than 65 years of age, in the United States in the relevant Marketscan
      Commercial database in the period from July 2000 through April 2009, and October 2010 to May
      2011. The corresponding physician office visits for persons 65 years of age and older, with a
      mild influenza-attributable outcome of interest, in the United States that were recorded in
      the relevant MarketScan Medicare Supplemental database in the period from July 2006 through
      April 2009, and October 2010 to May 2011 were also investigated. The period from April 2009
      through September 2010 is excluded to avoid the H1N1 pandemic wave.
