      immunosuppressive agent, daclizumab, in HIV-infected adults. HIV-infected individuals with
      levels of plasma viremia below 30,000 copies/mL will receive daclizumab for one month.
      Various immunologic and virologic laboratory studies addressing the state of cellular
      activation and toxicity data will be collected post-enrollment. The primary study risks
      include factors associated with immunosuppression and fluctuation on HIV viral levels.
      Subjects will be compensated for participation in this study. Total enrollment for the study
      will be a maximum of 10 subjects.
