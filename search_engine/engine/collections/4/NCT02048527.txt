      developing embryo in vitro. However, there has been renewed interest in the use of
      single-step media, which allow the embryo itself to choose the necessary nutrients while
      maintaining a more stable culture environment. Previous studies suggest that sequential media
      do not appear superior to single-step media.

      The current study will include 2 RCTs:

      RCT 1: Random allocation of sibling oocytes to compare embryo development and blastocyst
      formation rates in the two culture media compared.

      RCT2: Random allocation of patients in either Global or Origio media, to evaluate pregnancy
      rates.
