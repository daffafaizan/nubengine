      Patients who fit inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 parallel groups
      (one of the study surgical interventions combined with phacoemulsification) in the following
      order:

        1. 1st Generation iStent, Trabecular Micro-Bypass Device (Glaukos Inc, San Clemente, CA).

        2. 2nd Generation iStent, Trabecular Micro-Bypass Device (Glaukos Inc, San Clemente, CA).

        3. Hydrus Microstent (Ivantis Inc, Irvine, CA). Blocked randomization will be used in 1:1:1
           ratio to provide balanced study groups. Allocation will be performed using a random
           number table.

      Preoperative Evaluation of : Visual acuity, Slit lamp examination, IOP, Gonioscopy, Fundus
      Examination, Central corneal thickness (CCT), Endothelial Cell Count (ECC), Visual field,
      Retinal Nerve Fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Number
      and type of preoperative antiglaucoma medications.

      Patients will be followed postoperatively at Day 1, Week 1, Months 1, 3, 6 and 12.

      Medication Washout will be done at baseline, Months 6 and 12 to evaluate non-medicated IOP.

      The duration of washout will be:

      4 Weeks for Prostaglandin Analogues (PGA) and Beta Blockers (BB). 2 Weeks for Carbonic
      Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAI) and Alpha Agonists (AA).

      The IOP measurements in the wash out visits:

      will be performed according to 2-operator method to provide masking as described in Ocular
      Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and Glaucoma World Association Guidelines.
