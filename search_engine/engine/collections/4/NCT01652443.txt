      Iraqi Freedom deployments are presenting with "invisible wounds". These "invisible wounds"
      include mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain
      injury. Recent literature has begun to explore how PTSD affects the service member, as well
      as their significant others. Several studies have shown that Veteran endorsement of PTSD
      symptoms is associated with decreased relationship satisfaction. Prior literature has shown
      that spending time together and engaging in pleasurable activities as a couple are important
      strategies for enduring relationship quality and satisfaction. Literature has demonstrated
      moderate relationships between PTSD and suicidal ideation. A previous study conducted by two
      of the investigators in this population showed that perceived feelings of burdensomeness and
      belongingness and identification of suicide as a potential strategy for dealing with these
      feelings. Joiner has hypothesized that acquired capacity of painful experiences, perceived
      burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness are the three components of increased suicide risk.
      Yet few studies exist that examine these constructs in the military population, though
      research indicates the clinical utility for exploring these constructs and related
      consequences.
