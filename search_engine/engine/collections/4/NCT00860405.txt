      paediatric volume replacement therapy because of the physiological hypoproteinemia in
      newborns and infants. In adult patients, artificial colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch have
      replaced human albumin as first choice in many settings. This study will compare the clinical
      efficacy and safety of HES 130/0.4 (6%) in normal saline vs. HSA 50g/L in volume replacement
      therapy during elective open-heart surgery in paediatric patients. The hypothesis of this
      study is to demonstrate that HES 130/0.4 (6%) and HSA 50g/L are equivalent regarding efficacy
      and provide comparable safety during elective open-heart surgery in paediatric patients 2 to
      12 years of age.
