    
      Patients who previously have been penicillin allergy tested in 2017 to 2019 at the Allergy
      Clinic at Gentofte Hospital is included in the study. Patients are identified through a drug
      allergy database at the department.

      A letter describing the study and the data collection process will be sent to the patients'
      General Practice offices (GP).

      Data collection: The patients GP's are contacted by telephone where the information about the
      drug allergy labels in their electronical medical charts are shared. On the same day as the
      phone contact to the GP's office, the patient's electronical health record in the hospital
      system is accessed in order to gain information about the current drug allergy registrations.

      Predictors for the explanatory analysis is collected partly through the phone call to the GP
      (such as numbers of patients and physicians at each GP and the electronic health system
      used), from the hospital electronic health record (such as number of hospital admissions
      since drug allergy testing) and from the drug allergy database.
