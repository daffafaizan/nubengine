      exercise. In addition, magnesium supplementation has been shown to reduce circulating IL-6
      concentrations post exercise in humans. It is conceivable that such observations are linked
      through the role of IL-6 in glucose regulation, possibly in combination with sIL-6R.
      Together, magnesium intake may have the potential to effect exercise performance and recovery
      through glucose availability. This in turn may be connected to the production of IL-6 and
      sIL-6R which have been established to influence exercise fatigue and perception of pain
      (muscle soreness).
