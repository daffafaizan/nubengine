    
      A minor change of time of randomization after prolongation of bivalirudin infusion at PCI
      dose up to 4 hours on protocol at September 19,2018. Reasons: a minor change concerning the
      timing of randomization considering the current local practice in some centers that use the 4
      hour infusion of bivalirudin just after PCI. It remains in agreement with the current
      international guidelines and with the drug label in China. There is no change in drugs used
      and doses of these drugs once the randomization occurs.
