      relatively low cost and are designed to improve the efficiency of both routine and difficult
      intubation. Both systems use disposable blades, which eliminates the need for blade
      sterilization and may minimize the risk of infectious exposure to patients and improve cost
      and efficiency associated with the sterilization processing of non-disposable laryngoscopes.
      The Glidescope has been commercially available longer than the King Vision, and has been more
      frequently studied.

      Although similar in many respects, the King Vision and Glidescope systems have differing
      designs which may result in differences in speed and success in the management of routine
      and/or difficult airways.
