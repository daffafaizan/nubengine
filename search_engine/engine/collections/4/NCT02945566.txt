    
      STAR-TREC is a randomised, three arm (1:1:1) study using the following arms:

        1. Standard TME surgery (control)

        2. Organ saving using:

             1. long course concurrent chemoradiation

             2. short course radiotherapy For organ-preserving strategies clinical response to
                radiotherapy determines the next treatment step. Radiotherapy response is evaluated
                using endoscopy and the tumour regression grade, as assessed by MRI. The first
                assessment at 11-13 weeks (from radiotherapy start) using MRI and endoscopy will
                identify a minority of non-responders who should convert to TME surgery. Patients
                demonstrating a satisfactory radiotherapy response at 11-13 weeks will be
                reassessed by endoscopy at 16-20 weeks. Re-evaluation determines if the STAR-TREC
                criteria for complete clinical response (cCR) are met. Patients who achieve cCR may
                progress directly to active surveillance. Those who do not fulfil the criteria for
                cCR will progress to excision biopsy with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).

      Patients in the organ saving arm will be assigned to either;

      A. Long course concurrent chemoradiation:

      Capecitabine: 825 mg/mÂ² orally, b.i.d., on radiotherapy days Radiotherapy: A dose of 50 Gy,
      applied to the primary tumour and surrounding mesorectum, in 25 fractions of 2 Gy, 5 days a
      week.

      or B. Short course preoperative radiotherapy A dose of 25Gy, applied, to the primary tumour
      and surrounding mesorectum in 5 fractions of 5 Gy, 5 days a week.

      As a feasibility study, this trial will have recruitment rate as it's primary outcome.
