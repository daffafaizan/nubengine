      rates >100 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. Despite the prequalification of
      safe and effective typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV), the uptake of these vaccines in African
      countries has remained low. Real-life effectiveness data, which inform public health programs
      on the impact of TCVs in reducing typhoid-related mortality and morbidity, are critical to
      enhancing the introduction of TCVs in high-burden settings. Here we describe a
      cluster-randomized trial to investigate population-level protection of TCV against blood
      culture-confirmed typhoid fever. A total of 80 geographically distinct clusters have been
      delineated within the Agogo district of the Asante Akim region in Ghana. Clusters will be
      randomized to the intervention arm receiving TCV or a control arm receiving the meningococcal
      A conjugate vaccine. The primary study endpoint is the overall protection of TCV against
      blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Total, direct, and indirect protection will be
      measured as secondary outcomes. Blood culture-based enhanced surveillance will enable the
      estimation of incidence rates in the intervention and control clusters. Evaluation of the
      real-world impact of TCVs will improve uptake of prequalified/licensed safe and effective
      typhoid vaccines in public health programs of high burden settings.
