      practice. These frozen embryos are mostly replaced in an artificial cycle with exogenous
      estrogen and progesterone or in a natural cycle. Often, hCG is administered as an ovulation
      induction agent for scheduling purposes.

      Successful implantation requires a co-ordinated series of events allowing a timely dialogue
      between a receptive endometrium and the intrusive blastocyst . The period of receptivity is
      thought to be 3 days in human. It is suggested that blastocyst apposition begins about day
      LH+6 and is completed by day LH+10

      In general, the aim is to transfer the embryo during the 'window of implantation', what is
      defined as the period during which the uterus is receptive for implantation of the free-lying
      blastocyst. This has been a subject of debate since many years.

      A prospective study by Fatemi et al. (2010) revealed a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy
      rate after transferring frozen-thawed embryos in natural cycles with a spontaneous LH peak
      compared with natural cycles controlled by hCG for final oocyte maturation and ovulation
      (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively). In this trial, FrET (frozen embryo transfer) was planned 5
      days after the LH surge or 5 days after the administration of 5000IU of hCG.

      In order to optimize the synchronization in the hCG group, and therefore enhance the
      pregnancy rates, the aim is to plan a FrET 6 days after hCG administration instead of 5 days.
      The rationale behind is that day 3 frozen embryos are thawed the day before embryo transfer,
      which means they are already at day 4 of the embryonic development.
