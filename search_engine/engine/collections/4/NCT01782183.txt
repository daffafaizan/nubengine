    
      Patients aged between 5 years and 18 years, who attend the primary health clinic for medical
      treatment with a complaint of only sore throat and fever will be offered to participate in
      the study and have a thermal camera photo of the tonsils. The study group will consist of 100
      patients. Fifty patients will be enrolled who present with sore throat and another 50
      patients will be enrolled who present to the clinic for any febrile condition other than a
      sore throat. A parent will sign consent after the parent and child have received an
      explanation about the study. The patient will be photographed twice by directing the camera
      externally to each tonsil from below the mandibular angle. The photograph will be saved in
      the camera and the investigator will not be able to see the photo. The number of the
      photograph will be listed with the patient name. The investigator will keep the list and only
      he will have access to the clinical data. Thereafter a standard clinical examination will be
      performed and all the patients will receive standard medical treatment irrespective of their
      participation in the study. The description of the tonsils and the pharynx will be recorded
      in the patient's electronic medical file and will consist of the following information (one
      or more of the following options): normal tonsils and pharynx, redness of tonsils and/or
      pharynx, exudates on tonsils, petechiae of the palate. Patients who will not have the full
      description as described above will be excluded from analysis from the study. The data will
      be analyzed descriptively for a correlation between the clinical findings and the thermal
      photograph
