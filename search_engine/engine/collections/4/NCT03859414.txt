      placebo-controlled.

      The safety, tolerability, PD and PK of CHF 5993 will be assessed in Japanese and Caucasian
      healthy volunteers.

      A total of 32 healthy male and female volunteers are planned to be included where they will
      receive four different treatments (study drug or placebo) over four treatment periods.

      Standard safety assessments will be conducted during the study, including safety blood and
      urine laboratory tests, liver function tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs,
      24-hour Holter and observations of any adverse events. Blood samples will also be collected
      for PK analysis. Blood and urine samples will be collected for pharmacodynamics analysis.
