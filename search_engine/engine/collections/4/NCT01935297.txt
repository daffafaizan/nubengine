      or a usual care group. The training group will undergo 8 weeks of combined endurance and
      resistance training according to a standard protocol, but with individual adjustment if
      required. The usual care group will receive general advice but no structured exercise
      program. Exercise capacity is assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing and by the 6
      minute walk test prior to and after the intervention period. In addition, life quality will
      be assessed by validated questionnaires, while safety will be assessed by recording adverse
      events and by echocardiography.
