    
      After the run-in phase, there is a 21-night trial in which each night is randomly assigned
      2:1 to have either the predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) system active (intervention
      night) or inactive (control night).

      Three predictive algorithm versions were studied sequentially during the study.
