    
      Patients hospitalized at participating CHS sites with COPD acute exacerbation symptoms, will
      be treated per the CHS COPD clinical pathway. The COPD clinical pathway will include four
      components: (i) discrete, evidence-based care steps (ii) patient navigation, (iii) daily data
      driven care gap identification, (iv) monthly leadership huddles. These components are all
      part of usual care for patients in this population, but each component is not applied to
      patients consistently across the System. For this reason, the pathway will be applied
      consistently and completely in patients meeting COPD acute exacerbation criteria at
      participating sites. Patients will be followed for 60 days in total after discharge from
      their COPD acute exacerbation symptoms to determine the potential effectiveness of complete
      implementation of all 4 components in the care of COPD patients. Patients on the pathway will
      also have access to navigator services.
