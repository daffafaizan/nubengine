      the risk of deterministic and stochastic effects. Consequently all the operators should be
      aware of the possible risks and they should apply all efforts to reduce the radiation dose
      according to the "As Low As Reasonably Achievable" (ALARA) principle. Moreover interventional
      cardiologists have to utilise adequate protection devices (lead apron, protective thyroid
      collar, lead glasses).

      Operator performing transradial access procedures showed a significantly higher radiation
      exposure compared to those performing transfemoral interventions. So, transradial operators
      should use adjunctive protective shields (as leaded pelvic drapes placed on the patient
      abdomen) in order to reduce their radio-exposition.

      During transradial access a particularly high radiation exposure is observed at operator
      pelvic level and the use of the protective adjunctive drapes placed on the patient abdomen is
      only partially effective to control this exposition.

      Aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a protective extension of the leaded curtain
      placed under the angiographic table in term of operator radiation exposure at pelvic level
