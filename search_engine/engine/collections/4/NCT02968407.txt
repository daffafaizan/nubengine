      their own and their peers' performance in a basic open surgery skill course. At the end of
      the course in basic open surgery, participants will be examined at the post-test as described
      in the protocol "The effect of group dynamics in surgical skill training". After the
      participants complete the post-test, participants will be asked to participate in this
      additional study. The participants will receive no instructions on this additional study,
      before they complete the study "The effect of group dynamics in surgical skill training".
