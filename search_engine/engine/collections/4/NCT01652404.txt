      aforementioned flaws. The investigators will set stricter inclusion criteria, collect
      complete data on relapse or secondary infection, and include sufficient number of patients to
      show non-inferiority to conventional therapy by a delta margin of 10% [11]. The investigators
      aimed to give conclusive evidence on whether serial PCT measurements can facilitate
      individual decision-making and shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis
      in the pediatric ICU.
