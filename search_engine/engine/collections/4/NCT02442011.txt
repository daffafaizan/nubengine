      of this knowledge comes from examining blood specimens from patients and subjecting these
      samples to red cell, plasma, serum or DNA analyses. We propose to set up a Hematology
      biobank, which will include patient histories, their medical progress and a linked but
      de-identified bank of blood samples. This will enable us to have a large database, which can
      be used to learn more about these diseases.

      The Hematology biobank will use whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, serum and/or DNA.
