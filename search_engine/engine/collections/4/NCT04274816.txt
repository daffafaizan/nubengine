      for the assessment of melanoma relapse and mortality risk. Moreover, the SLN is of great
      value for the assessment of immunological interventions for melanoma. Since early melanoma
      development is accompanied by impaired immune effector functions primarily in the SLN, there
      is a strong rationale for therapeutic immune modulation of the SLN aimed at strengthening
      cellular immune functions.

      The investigator now propose a phase I dose escalation study to administer intradermally a
      single clinical dose of tremelimumab/anti-CTLA-4 locally at the primary tumor excision site
      of patients with clinical stage I/II melanoma. Such a single local administration aimed at
      conditioning of the SLN should allow for the use of relatively low anti-CTLA-4 dosages
      without excess risk of autoimmune effects.
