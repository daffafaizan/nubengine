    
      The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested to treat
      people who have Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors or other
      solid tumours.

      The study will enroll approximately 61 patients. Participants will be assigned to the
      following arm group to receive brigatinib:

        -  Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Brigatinib Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2 (based on safety and
           tolerability)

        -  Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Unresectable/ Recurrent ALK+ IMT

        -  Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Relapsed/ Refractory ALK+ ALCL

      All participants will be administered brigatinib orally once daily in 28-day Cycles.
      Participants will receive fixed doses of brigatinib based on weight ranges. The starting
      doses in Phase 1 (Dose Level 1) are expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in
      pediatric participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving the recommended
      clinical dose of 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily. One additional
      dose level (Dose Level 2) is planned in Phase 1 if the initial dose level is tolerated. This
      subsequent dose level is expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in pediatric
      participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving 90 mg once daily for 7 days
      followed by 240 mg once daily (the highest acceptably tolerated dose in adults). In Phase 2,
      brigatinib will be administered at the RP2D determined during Phase 1.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and
      will be contacted by telephone OR a final visit after receiving their last dose of brigatinib
      for a follow-up assessment.
