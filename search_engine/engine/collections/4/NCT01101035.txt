    
      The drug tested in this study was called Febuxostat (TMX-67). Febuxostat compared with
      allopurinol was evaluated for the cardiovascular (CV) safety in people with gout and
      significant CV comorbidities.

      The study enrolled 6198 patients. Participants with a diagnosis of gout were enrolled in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either:

        -  Febuxostat

        -  Allopurinol

      Participants received febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg for the study depending on their serum uric
      acid levels were either <6.0 mg/dL or â‰¥6.0 mg/dL during specified visits. Allopurinol 200 mg
      to 400 mg (for moderate renal impairment),or 300 mg to 600 mg (for normal and mild renal
      impairment), increased in 100 mg increments each month until serum uric acid was <6.0 mg/dL
      was received.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Canada, Mexico and United States. The overall time
      to participate in this study was approximately 7 years (84 months). Participants made
      multiple visits to the clinic and were also contacted through the telephone.
