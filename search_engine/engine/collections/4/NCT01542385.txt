      with adjunctive anticoagulation is superior to immediate stent implantation at improving
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients with mechanically reperfused ST-elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (STEMI). The investigators hypothesize that delayed stent implantation combined
      with systemic anticoagulation and maximal antiplatelet therapy will reduce the combined
      occurrence of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or
      unplanned target vessel revascularization over a 9-month period.
