      critically ill patients which exhibits sedative and analgesic effects. Recent studies suggest
      that dexmedetomidine to restore adrenergic vasoconstrictor responsiveness in septic shock,
      and prevents alterations of pain rat model intestinal microcirculation Induced by surgical
      stress，even it can reduce the mortality of endotoxemic rats and patients with severe sepsis.
      The investigators preliminary study showed that dexmedetomidine might improve
      microcirculation in septic shock patients. To test this effect, the investigators will
      conduct double-blinded study.
