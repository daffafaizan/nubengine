    
      Design: Pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial with 12 months follow-up.

      Unit of randomization: general practitioner.

      Unit of analysis: patient.

      Setting: Primary Health Care Centres in three different Spanish Autonomous Communities
      (Aragón, Madrid and Andalucía).

      Population: Patients 65-74 years of age with multimorbidity (3 or more chronic diseases) and
      polypharmacy (5 or more drugs taken for at least three months). N=400 patients (200 in each
      arm, 5 patients per physician) will be recruited by general practitioners before
      randomization.

      Intervention: complex intervention.

      Control group: usual care.

      Variables: MAI, health care utilization, quality of life (Euroqol 5 Dimensions (5D-5L), drug
      therapy and adherence (Morisky-Green, Haynes-Sackett), clinical and socio-demographic
      factors. Economic appraisal variables: time spent training FPs, cost of teaching staff, time
      spent on physician-patient interviews, utilities measured using the EuroQol 5D-5L.

      Analysis: All analyses will be carried out adhering to the intention-to-treat principle.
      Description of baseline characteristics. Basal comparison between groups. Analysis of main
      and secondary effectiveness (between-group difference in T1-T0 MAI score, with corresponding
      95% Confidence Interval); multilevel analysis will be used to adjust models. Estimated
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at the population level. Calculation of
      cost-utility ratio.
