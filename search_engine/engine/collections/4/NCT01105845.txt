      The objective of this study is to create a bio-repository of blood samples from patients and
      healthy subjects who are participating in NINDS motor learning studies. Blood will be
      analyzed for BDNF and samples stored for future genetic studies. . A variety of genes that
      may affect motor learning are being increasingly identified, and variations among these
      genes, referred to as polymorphisms, may help explain individual differences.

      STUDY POPULATION: <TAB>

      We will enroll up to five hundred healthy volunteers and five hundred volunteers with
      movement difficulties who are between the ages of 18 and 100 and who are already
      participating, or will be participating, in other protocols dealing with motor learning
      research studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      DESIGN:<TAB>

      This is an observational and repository protocol that involves a single blood sample for
      genetic analysis. This will allow the genetic characterization of subjects participating in
      motor learning protocols to be analyzed and tested for the role of genetics in motor learning
      results.

      OUTCOME MEASURE:

      We will compare genetic variations with the different behavioral, electrophysiologic,
      imaging, or other outcomes acquired in the associated motor learning studies. Thus, we will
      determine whether specific polymorphisms are associated with different measures of motor
      learning.
