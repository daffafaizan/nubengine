      to undergo several tests and procedures. Noninvasive and invasive approaches are employed.
      Within the invasive techniques, endoscopic ultrasonography with needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)
      and endobronchial ultrasonography with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are
      gaining importance in mediastinal staging. Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is a procedure
      that is performed via flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation for visualization of
      lymph nodes in the chest and biopsy under real-time guidance usually for the staging of lung
      cancer or evaluation of enlarged lymph nodes. In addition, lung lesions or masses can be
      visualized and biopsied in the same sitting. The use of EBUS has enhanced the safety and
      diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy. It provides ultrasonographic images and permits
      needle aspiration under direct vision for cytology specimen analysis. As more evidence is
      being accumulated on these staging approaches, the number of cervical mediastinoscopies,
      considered as the gold-standard for mediastinal staging, is diminishing.
