    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether increased quantitites of
      circulating microfibril fragments, measured with a simple blood test, are associated with
      aortic root size and increased growth of the aortic root in Marfan syndrome and related
      disorders. The secondary objectives of this study are to: (1) Determine a Marfan "signature"
      profile of circulating microfibril fragments. (2) Determine if high concentrations of
      fibrillin-1 fragments are associated with large aortic root diameters. (3) Determine which
      fibrillin-1 fragments are good biomarkers for aortic root growth and size in Marfan syndrome.
      (4) Determine the relation between fibrillin-1, aortic root diameter, and medical and
      lifestyle factors reported on questionnaires.
