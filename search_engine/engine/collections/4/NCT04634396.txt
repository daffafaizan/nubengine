      psychological flexibility in the face of challenges. The Investigators are trying to
      determine proof of concept that suggests that ACT is effective in reducing anxiety and
      associated psychological distress in dementia caregivers. This study will recruit N=20
      dementia caregivers to receive 6 weekly 1-hour telephone-based ACT sessions
