      feasibility trial of the multicomponent mobile website called SUMMIT. Eligible participants
      will be randomized to SUMMIT versus a pain monitoring app. Outcome measures will be collected
      over 9 months.

      To ensure rigor and successful future implementation, the investigators will: 1) develop an
      evidence based program with features proven to maximize engagement and retention; 2) ensure
      that the program includes mechanisms to address the diverse obstacles veterans report when
      consider opioid tapering (e.g. fear of pain flares and abandonment by the system); 3) employ
      a User Centered Design - with meaningful input from veterans and primary care providers
      throughout the development and testing phases; and 4) adhere to recently published guidelines
      for mobile health interventions.
