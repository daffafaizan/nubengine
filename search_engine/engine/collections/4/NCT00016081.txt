    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin vs standard supportive therapy, in terms
           of preventing progression of upper respiratory tract respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
           infection to pneumonia, in patients with RSV following stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the safety of aerosolized ribavirin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, investigator-blind, controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to engraftment status (pre vs post) and transplant type (HLA
      matched-related allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous vs HLA mismatched-related or unrelated
      allogeneic). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard supportive care for immunocompromised patients with
           upper respiratory tract infections. Patient also receive aerosolized ribavirin by face
           mask, mist, or oxygen tent over 2 hours 3 times daily on days 1-10.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care as in arm I. Treatment continues in
           the absence of progression to pneumonia or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at days 14 and 28.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
