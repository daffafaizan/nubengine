    
      Primary Hypothesis:

      To evaluate the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with an
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) vs. standard treatment with angiotensin receptor blocker
      on the progression of kidney disease in individuals with Type 2 diabetes and overt
      nephropathy.

      The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of reduction in estimated GFR of 30
      ml/min/1.73m*m in individuals with an estimated baseline GFR greater than or equal to 60
      ml/min/1.73m*m; reduction in estimated GFR of greater than 50% in individuals with an
      estimated baseline GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m*m; progression to end-stage renal disease
      (defined as need for dialysis, renal transplant or an eGFR less than 15 ml/min/1.73m*m) or
      death.

      Secondary outcome: a renal composite endpoint, defined as; reduction in estimated GFR of more
      than 50% (for individuals with a baseline estimated GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m*m);
      reduction in estimated GFR of more than 30 ml/min/1.73m*m (for individuals with a baseline
      estimated GFR greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m*m) or progression to end-stage renal
      disease (defined as need for dialysis, renal transplant or an eGFR of less than 15
      ml/min/1.73m*m).

      Tertiary outcomes are cardiovascular events (cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction,
      cerebrovascular accident, admission for heart failure), change in albuminuria at 12 months
      and decline in slope of kidney function.

      Study Abstract:

      The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, parallel group trial to test the
      efficacy of the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with an
      angiotension receptor blocker (ARB) vs. standard treatment with angiotension receptor blocker
      on the combined end-point. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of reduction in
      estimated GFR of 30 ml/min/1.73m*m in individuals with an estimated GFR greater than or equal
      to 60 ml/min/1.73m*m; reduction in estimated GFR of greater than 50% in individuals with an
      estimated GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m*m; progression to end-stage renal disease (defined as
      need for dialysis, renal transplant or en eGFR less than 15 ml/min/1.73m*m)or death. The
      study population is individuals with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy.

      Eligible subjects who consent to participate will be randomized into either the combination
      therapy arm or the mono therapy arm. The randomization will be stratified by site and within
      sites by baseline albuminuria (< 1 vs. greater than or equal to 1 gram/gram creatinine) and
      eGFR (< 60 vs. greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m*m). All participants will receive
      open label therapy with losartan, an ARB, as standard of care. Patients not treated with an
      ACEI or ARB will be initiated on losartan; patients treated with an ACEI or ARB other than
      losartan (the study ARB) will be converted to losartan (the study ARB) and the dose titrated
      to 100 mg/day. Individuals who tolerate ARB 100mg/day criteria will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to the addition of blinded lisinopril (the study ACEI) or placebo. The medication
      (lisinopril or placebo) will be titrated from an initial dose of 10 mg/day to a target dose
      of 40 mg/day. After each adjustment in dose, serum chemistries will be evaluated for kidney
      function and potassium levels. Subjects will be enrolled over a period of 4.25 years and the
      maximum length of follow-up is 6.25 years. The planned study duration is 6.25 years with 4.25
      years of accrual and 6.25 years of follow-up for all enrolled patients. The intervention was
      stopped on November 7, 2012 for safety concerns after an interim analysis. Patients are still
      under passively follow-up without intervention.
