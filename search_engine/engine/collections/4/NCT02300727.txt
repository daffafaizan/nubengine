      tolerated dose (MTD) of curcumin and an expansion at the MTD.

      Oral mucositis is a common and often debilitating complication associated with cancer
      treatment. Treatment of mucositis is mainly supportive - oral hygiene is the means of
      treatment. Curcumin (Turmeric), a frequently-used spice in India and Southeast Asia, can
      reduce bacterial load and prevent inflammation in cultured epithelial cells and prevent
      chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced mucositis in animal models.

      The primary objective of this Phase I/II study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of oral curcumin in patients who have chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to determine whether or not oral curcumin has an acceptable
      safety profile or impacts oral mucositis health outcomes.
