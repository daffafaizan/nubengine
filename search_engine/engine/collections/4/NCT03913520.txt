      are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality after non-cardiac interventions. This risk
      depends on the type of pathology, the age of the patient and the experience of the physicians
      in charge of these patients.

      We sought to determine the prevalence of children and adults with congenital heart disease
      presenting for non-cardiac interventions and to investigate their outcome.
