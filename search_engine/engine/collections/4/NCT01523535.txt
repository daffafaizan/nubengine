      sleep for several nights in a row before having an opportunity to catch up. When the
      opportunity does arise, it may only be for a single night, before the cycle of insufficient
      sleep repeats. This study investigated what happens to human biology when insufficient sleep
      becomes chronic and opportunities for recovery sleep are intermittent. It also investigated
      recovery sleep itself, and the biological processes involved in reversing the effects of an
      accumulated sleep deficit due to insufficient sleep duration.
