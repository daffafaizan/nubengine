      correlation between the quality of life and overall survival and sleep disturbance in them.
      So many factors interfering the sleep of these patients, however, there is no effective
      therapy for them except some drugs, such as hypnotics or anxiolytics. Cognitive-behavioral
      therapy is an effective behavioral therapy for insomnia clinically and it contains three
      therapeutic domains including stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, and relaxation
      training. It has been proven to be beneficial in improving sleep pattern in chronic insomnia
      and cancer patients and alcoholism. In previous studies, cognitive-behavioral therapy can
      redress anxiety in chronic hemodialysis patients, however, there is no clinical evidence
      revealing its effectiveness upon sleep disorders in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis
      patients. Our study tries to elucidate the therapeutic effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy
      on the sleep disturbance in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients.

      We will perform cognitive-behavioral therapy to eligible peritoneal dialysis patients and
      evaluate the sleep condition before and after the therapy. Moreover, clinical conditions,
      biochemical and hematological parameters, inflammatory mediators in blood will be measured at
      baseline, before and after therapy.
