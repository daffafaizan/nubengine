      I. To determine the safety profile of combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX-2 regimen combined with pembrolizumab using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune modified RECIST
      criteria.

      II. To evaluate initial median progression-free and overall survival in these patients
      treated with combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with
      combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      II. To evaluate the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression profiling
      using the Nanostring platform.

      III. To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic
      assay (MHC-PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing.

      IV. To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]
      and immune cell profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to
      treatment with combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Participants
      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and IRX-2 subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days starting
      on day 4 during cycles 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days and then up to
      1 year.
