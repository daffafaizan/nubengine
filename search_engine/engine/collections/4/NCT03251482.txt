    
      This study has 2 parts, dose escalation and dose-response evaluation, and will be conducted
      in participants undergoing primary unilateral elective Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery.
      Participants will participate in either Part 1 or Part 2 of study only. The study will be
      conducted in 3 phases: an up to 30-day screening phase before surgery, a 14-day double-blind
      dosing phase, and a 16-week follow-up phase. Safety evaluations will include monitoring of
      all nonserious and serious adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs
      measurements, and physical examinations. Pharmacokinetics (dense and sparse), pharmacodynamic
      (PD), health resource utilization, and immunogenicity samples will also be assessed. The
      total study duration of participant's participation in Part 1 or part 2 after randomization
      will be approximately 18 weeks.
