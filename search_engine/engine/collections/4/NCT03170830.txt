      failure worldwide. And about 10% of all emergency department consultations are with symptoms
      suggestive of AMI, however, only 10% to 20% of them are diagnosed as experiencing an AMI.
      Rapid and accurate identification of AMI is of paramount clinical importance for subsequent
      timely and effectively treatment and management.

      Recently, the investigators identified microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) from AMI animal models and small samples of AMI patients, a molecular
      signature of AMI involving 5 circRNAs (circRNA_006877, circRNA_015350, circRNA_002969,
      circRNA_013240, circRNA_004682) was found significantly change in AMI patients and likely
      serves as candidate serum biomarkers of AMI. Among the 5 circRNAs, circRNA_006877 name of
      circRNA-Uck2 (cUck2) has more close association with AMI.

      TYPE OF STUDY : multicenter diagnostic evaluation Study MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : To
      evaluate the diagnostic value of circRNAs in AMI in adults as compared to healthy and
      unstable angina controls

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :

      assess the ability of cUck2 to discriminate a AMI disease from unstable angina patients in
      adults.

      explore the relationship between cUck2 and heart function after myocardial infarction
