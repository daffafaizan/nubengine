      intratumoral injection of a Tc-99m phytate 1 mCi in 0.1-0.2 mL 0.9% NaCl under
      ultrasonographic guidance. Total thyroidectomy or lobectomy with central neck dissection
      preceded SLN detection to avoid interference by primary tumor radioactivity. After total
      thyroidectomy or lobectomy, the dissections were performed toward the internal jugular chain
      beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A handheld, collimated gamma probe and
      lymphoscintigraphy were used to scan the lateral compartments (through skin and under the
      SCM) for "radioactive" lymph nodes. Removed SLNs were submitted immediately for frozen
      biopsy. If any of the SLNs were positive for metastasis on the frozen sections, MRND was
      performed immediately. In cases for which the frozen section was negative but the final
      pathology report detailed microscopic positivity in the lateral sentinel nodes, RAI ablations
      were performed without additional MRND.
