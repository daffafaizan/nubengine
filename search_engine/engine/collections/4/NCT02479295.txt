      peritoneal dialysis catheters would improve the treatment outcomes of peritoneal dialysis.
      The early and late catheter complications, as well as catheter survival, will be compared
      between peritoneal dialysis patients who are randomized to straight and coiled Tenckhoff
      catheters.
