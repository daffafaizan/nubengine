      such as laboratory of cardiac biomarkers or ischemic diagnostic. To save time and money in
      this observational registry the probable distinction between cardiac and non- cardiac
      disorder in patients with vague thoracal disorder and the probability for coronary artery
      disease (determined via Grace Score) is examined via echographic myocardial strain analysis
      in 300 patients retrospectively to establish a cut off value corresponding to acute coronary
      disease also to prevent coronary angiography. Therefore patients undergo echography routinely
      with consecutive evaluation of systolic, diastolic and strain analysis to elevate exact
      statements with reference to deformation of the myocard and its velocity. Several study have
      shown that these strain parameters (circumferential and radial strain) enable vitality and
      ischemic diagnosis and therefore could be eligible for this purpose.
