      assessed by right heart catheterization, and exercise capacity, as assessed by the Six-Minute
      Walk Test. This is a 16-week study that will involve at least 10 clinical trial centers. The
      expected enrollment period is around 24 months and 52 subjects will be entered into the
      study.
