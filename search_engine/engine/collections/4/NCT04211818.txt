    
      This is an open-label, exploratory, proof-of-concept study.

      20 patients will be recruited from the day hospital of the Endocrinology and Nutrition
      Department of the University Hospital of Montpellier, Lapeyronie and from Emergencies and
      Post-psychiatric Emergencies Department.

      During the inclusion visit, the dietician will explain to the patient the use of the dietary
      book and the glycemic sensor which will be allocated to it. The patient will also answer to
      self-questionnaires about his eating behavior.

      No nutritional approach will be addressed so as not to alter the patient's eating behavior
      and not to influence the results.

      They will be followed-up during 14 days.
