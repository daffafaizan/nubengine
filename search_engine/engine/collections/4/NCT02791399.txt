      System to either ISOP or the control condition; patients will be nested by clinician status.
      All PCPs who enroll will participate in either a two-hour educational workshop or the
      two-hour educational workshop + nurse care manager (NCM). The NCM will maintain a registry of
      enrolled patients, track opioid medication-related events from the medical record, and
      provide decision support to PCPs for issues related to prescription opioid safety. The NCM
      will also meet individually with enrolled participants to discuss strategies for
      preventing/reducing opioid side effects, preventing diversion, and providing rationale for
      screening for prescription opioid misuse. The investigators will recruit patients who are
      already prescribed chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Participants will be
      enrolled for one year. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after
      enrollment.
