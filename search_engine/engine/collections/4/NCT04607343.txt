      repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, leading to several interruptions during sleep. It
      is currently one of the main public health problems worldwide and one of the main
      cardiovascular risk factors in developed and intermediate developing countries, whose
      populations are increasing in obesity and age.

      One of the common treatments for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices,
      which pumps air through a hose, reaches a mask that the patient has over his or her nose and
      travels the airway, keeping the upper airway open during sleep and avoiding episodes of
      airway collapse. The problem is that CPAP is not accepted by some patients due to a lack of
      adaptation, so alternative treatments may be needed. For some years, there have been
      explorations of treatments related to electrical stimulation of the muscles of the upper
      airway as therapy to reduce the number of episodes of apnoea (measured through the
      apnoea-hypopnoea index) during the night, strengthening these muscles through stimulation.

      This is the protocol of a clinical study of a rehabilitation device for home use that not
      only provides functional stimulation of the upper-airway dilator muscles but also provides
      sensory stimulation. This device works by strengthening the dilating muscles of the upper
      respiratory tract and improving the sensory capacity of the laryngo-pharyngeal tract and is
      based on existing publications on the effectiveness of functional and somatosensory
      neurostimulation through neuroplasticity in the recovery of neurological deficits.
