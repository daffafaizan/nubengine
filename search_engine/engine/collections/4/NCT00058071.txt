        -  Determine, preliminarily, whether amifostine is superior to no treatment, in terms of
           improving the symptoms and/or objective findings of platinum-induced peripheral
           neuropathy, in patients with cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV or subcutaneously over 3 minutes on days 1, 3, and
           5. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients
           are observed for 12 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients are observed for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks patients may cross over to
           treatment as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after study
      entry.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks after study treatment, every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients (25-50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
