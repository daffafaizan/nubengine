      adenovirus containing HSVtk (the thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus), in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma that were not amenable to curative therapy. The study was
      conducted in a single center in Spain. Five consecutive cohorts of two patients received
      increasing doses of the vector by intratumoral injection and equal doses of either
      intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. The dose received by each consecutive cohort
      of patients was progressively higher according to a prefixed scale.
