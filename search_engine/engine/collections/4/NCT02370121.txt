      with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in accordance with the modify International Diabetes
      Federation criteria. The patients received 300 mg capsules of Gymnema sylvestre or placebo,
      two times daily before breakfast and dinner for 90 days. Before and after intervention the
      investigators evaluated: The components of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference,
      triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, fasting glucose and blood pressure), body weight,
      body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein,
      creatinine, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase.

      Were calculated: Areas under the curve of glucose and insulin were calculated with de
      Trapezoidal formula. Total insulin secretion was evaluated with the Insulinogenic index and
      the insulin sensitivity was estimated using the Matsuda index.
