      associated with an improvement of quality of life on the QOLIE-31 and Short Form Health
      Survey "SF-36" at six months from the diagnostic.

      We hypothesized that the absence of PNES during the last three-months before the six months
      follow-up visit is the best prognostic factor for an improvement of quality of life All adult
      (>15 years and 3 months) patients diagnosed with PNES will be prospectively included.

      All patients will undergo standard of care and have consultation with neurologist and a
      psychiatrist trained for this type of disease, as it is usually made for these patients (no
      intervention allocated in the context of the research). . Announcement of diagnostic will be
      standardized and adapted to each patient. Clinical and demographic data will be collect as
      well as medical and psychiatric history. All patients will undergo prolonged
      electroencephalogram (EEG) under video monitoring allowing the diagnostic of PNES and ruling
      out epilepsy. Different neurologic and psychiatric scales will be collected (Quality of life
      in epilepsy - 31 quotes (QOLIE-31), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI2), Beck Anxiety index (BAI), Clinician
      administrated Post traumatic stress disorder scale (CAPS), Chilhood Trauma Questionnaire
      (CTQ), Epworth).

      All patients will be oriented to psychiatric or psychological follow-up. Patients will
      undergo a one, three and six months follow-up and will be evaluated the number of seizure,
      their severity, and psychiatric or psychological follow-up will be evaluated. Patients will
      undergo scales (QOLI-31, SF-36, BDI2, BAI).
