      in this study. The assessment will be held before surgery, two months, three months and six
      months after surgery. Visual pain scale and passive range of motion over lumbar, hip, knee,
      ankle joint of each subjects will be recorded. Then the maximum voluntary contraction at
      lower extremity will be measured by electromyography. Finally, the subjects will be asked to
      do forward reach by dominant upper limb/bilateral upper limbs/arm crossed in the front of
      chest for three times in standing and sitting position after five practices. The motion data
      will be collected by 3-dimension video and the muscle activity by electromyography.
