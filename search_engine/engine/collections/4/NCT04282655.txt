      body temperature breast milk feedings to very low birth weight infants through use of
      continuous milk warmer improves feeding tolerance and weight gain compared to a standard milk
      warming technique.

      Warming breast milk in a hot water bath just prior to feeding prior to feeding in the
      neonatal intensive care unit is a common practice. However, little evidence is available to
      support a standard warming method. This method allows inconsistent temperatures at time of
      feeding and progressive cooling of the milk during the feeding. No published study used a
      continuous warming device that delivered milk at a consistent physiological temperature
      throughout the feeding. The continuous warmer externally heats milk in the tubing just
      posterior to the feeding tube to provide body temperature milk to the infant.

      A convenience sample from the Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center of 50 very low birth
      weight infants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group for ten
      days. The experimental group will receive warmed feedings through the duration of the feeding
      through the use of the Guardian Warmerâ„¢, a continuous milk warming device. A control group
      will receive breast milk feedings warmed using the standard milk warming methods. Feeding
      tolerance and weight gain over the ten-day period will be used to evaluate the effectiveness
      of continuous milk warming.
