    
      This protocol is designed to gather a small amount of blood from patients seen in the New
      York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center Pulmonary, Critical Care unit, and 5
      West floor (Pulmonary Floor) for clinical care associated with chronic lung disease. This
      protocol will also survey medical records of patients with chronic lung disease, in order to
      study the clinical characteristics of these individuals. Investigators aim to understand the
      genetics of chronic lung diseases, and will use the serum and DNA from this blood to perform
      various genotyping studies such as such as genomic/gene expression studies of individuals
      with chronic lung diseases.

      General admission criteria for this project will require at least one of the following: (1)
      symptoms consistent with pulmonary disease; (2) chest X-ray consistent with lung disease; (3)
      pulmonary function tests consistent with lung disease; (4) lung biopsy consistent with lung
      disease; (5) family history of lung disease; and (6) patients with diseases of organs with
      known association with lung disease.

      The following studies will be conducted on blood specimens: genomic DNA will be extracted;
      promoter sequences for antioxidant-related genes will be obtained by PCR and sequenced. The
      goal is to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to see if they correlate with lung
      disease. DNA samples and blood specimens will be coded. Samples could potentially be traced
      back to the patient. However, every effort will be made to keep the patient's identity
      confidential per HIPAA regulations.

      The study does not aim to create a blood bank. Rather, the blood samples will be used for DNA
      extraction only. Serum will be stored for future studies, to look at levels of proteins.
