    
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited monogenic hemoglobin disorder caused by a mutation
      in the gene encoding the beta globin subunit of adult hemoglobin (HbA) resulting in a
      substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 and thus producing hemoglobin S (HbS).
      When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes, rendering the red cell rigid, viscous, and abnormally
      adherent to the capillary endothelium. This impedes blood flow in the microcirculation,
      causing ischemia and microinfarcts that lead to painful crises, cerebrovascular stroke, renal
      impairment, retinopathy and other end-organ damage. The current scientific literature
      currently recognizes the contribution of an acquired hypercoagulable state in SCD to vascular
      pathobiology, chronic organ dysfunction, and mortality.

      Similar to cancer, sickle cell disease is associated with an acquired hypercoagulable state
      and exhibits a high prevalence of incident and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      Elevated levels of the procoagulant protein tissue factor and its activator, protein
      disulfide isomerase in humans with SCD suggest a causal role for thrombogenesis. In cancer
      patients, pharmacological inhibition of plasma PDI with Isoquercetin (IQ) led to a reduction
      in VTE biomarkers and VTE recurrence. These findings provide support to test the hypothesis
      that Isoquercetin in sickle cell disease would diminish thrombo-inflammatory VTE biomarkers
      and attenuate the associated hypercoagulable state.
