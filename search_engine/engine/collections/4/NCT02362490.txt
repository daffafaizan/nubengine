      treatment and achieved HBsAg level â‰¤250 IU/ml with HBV DNA undetectable will be randomized
      enrolled into group A (Intervention group), in which patients switch to interferon therapy
      for 72 weeks, group B(control group), patients continue treated with NA for 72 weeks. Serum
      HBV DNA load, HBsAg/anti-HBs level, HBeAg/anti-HBe will be tested at enrollment and every 3
      months during the treatment course. Parameters of Liver and kidney function, and liver
      ultrasound examination will be tested with intervals 1-3 months. The efficacies of interferon
      treatment were devalued by the rate of HBsAg clearance and decline of HBsAg levels on the 72
      weeks of interferon treatment compared with control group.
