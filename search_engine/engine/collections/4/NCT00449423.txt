      mortality. Inotropic drugs improve patient status but yield a higher risk of death. Previous
      studies have shown that myocardial contractility improves when glucose fermentation is up
      regulated and decreases when Free Fatty Acids are high. In a placebo-controlled design we
      wish to shift myocardial substrate metabolism towards increased glucose uptake and
      utilization and measure hemodynamics and biochemical markers of metabolism and prognosis.
