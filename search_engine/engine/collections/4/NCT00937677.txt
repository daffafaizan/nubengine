      of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and normal appearing brain tissue (NABT). As remyelination
      and demyelination are heterogeneous in each lesion and NABT, techniques such as voxel-wise
      based MTR dynamic mapping may help predict an individual's clinical course, as well as the
      effect of treatment, by revealing evidence of myelin repair and neuroprotection.

      Natalizumab (Tysabri) showed a robust effect on the decrease of inflammation in phase II and
      III clinical trials, as evidenced by the decrease in Gd enhancing and T2 lesions and on the
      decrease of clinical activity as measured by reduction of clinical relapses and progression
      of disability. The effect of Tysabri on non-conventional measures is only partially known.
