      control subjects were included in the study. A total of 135 subjects were evaluated using the
      European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) diagnostic criteria of
      sarcopenia. The first group consists of (OA) patients with sarcopenia, the second group
      consist of OA patients without sarcopenia and the third group is controls subjects. The
      detailed musculoskeletal system examination of the patients included in the study was carried
      out by a single physician, and complete blood count, renal function tests, electrolytes,
      total protein, albumin, 25 (OH) vitamin D, serum leptin, serum adiponectin, PTH, TSH and
      vitamin B12 values were recorded using the venous blood samples taken from the study
      group.Dual-X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to measure Body composition parameters and
      muscle mass measurements, isometric muscle strength evaluations, handgrip strength and gait
      speeds for diagnosis of sarcopenia. Short-form -36 (SF-36) The Nutritional Assessment-short
      form (MNA), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the
      International Physical Assessment Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D scale) were administered to every patient as
      outcome measures.
