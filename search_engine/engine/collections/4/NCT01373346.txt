      II diabetes with morbid obesity that underwent bariatric surgery have resolution of impaired
      glucose metabolism.

      In Asia, most type II diabetes are not morbidly obese and still, it is controversy whether
      metabolic surgery is effective or not in non-morbid obese patients. As life expectancy is
      increased, the number of patients with gastric cancer and T2DM is increased as well.

      Recently, we studied the outcome of T2DM after gastrectomy and conventional reconstruction in
      non-obese gastric cancer patients.(Kim JW et al, World J Gastroenterol 2012;18:49) The study
      was a large-series retrospective study including about 400 patients and the result regarding
      DM improvement was not satisfactory. Based on our previous results, it is needed to find more
      effective way to resolve the type II diabetes in gastrectomized patients with gastric cancer.
