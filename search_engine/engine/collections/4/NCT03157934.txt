      evidence based highly efficient treatment. In contrast to thrombolysis, thrombectomy can only
      be delivered by qualified interventionalists at comprehensive stroke centers. Thus, the
      implementation of thrombectomy into clinical practice remains a challenge. The investigators
      aim to establish a population based approach within a patient registry in a federal state
      overarching regional stroke network covering over 4 million inhabitants and integrating
      approximately 30 hospitals with different levels of expertise. The registry will include data
      from all acute ischemic stroke patients - approx. 12.000 patients p.a - within the network.
      The investigators plan to establish a central multi-interface platform integrating clinical
      data from the prehospital, intrahospital and rehabilitation phase including mandatory quality
      assurance, neurological and neuroradiological treatment and outcome data. The registry will
      allow addressing important questions, such as how many patients are candidates for
      thrombectomy, how many resources are needed to meet that demand and how treatment procedures
      and times can be improved. The overarching aim is to deliver high quality stroke care to
      every patient in the region.
