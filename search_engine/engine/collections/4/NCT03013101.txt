      antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who
      have failed in previous routine systemic treatment. Patients are injected with JS001 with
      3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Response
      assessment is conducted by every 8 weeks.
