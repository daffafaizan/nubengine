      treated at our center. All patients with hip fracture meeting inclusion criteria will be
      recruited for enrollment into the study. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient
      prior to randomization.

      At that time, each patient will be randomized into one of two groups by a independent staff
      using computer generated randomization and allocation concealment. The two patient groups
      will include:

        1. Study group: 1g of intravenous tranexamic acid at the time of surgical incision.

        2. Control group: placebo injection (saline solution) at the time of surgical incision.

      Both patients and the treating surgeons will be blinded with regard to placebo vs. treatment
      until completion of the study.

      Patients will be treated surgically with a long trochanteric femoral nail (TFN) or
      hemiarthroplasty.

      Blood transfusion criteria will remain consistent with hospital standards (Hb<8 g/dL or >9
      g/dL if symptomatic anemia). Total number of blood transfusions received will be documented
      upon patient discharge.

      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis will remain consistent with hospital standards
      (subcutaneous heparin from admission until 12 hours prior to surgery and beginning 6 hours
      after surgery). After discharge, .....

      Patients will be followed at regular intervals (1mo, 3mo, and at least 6mo) and at each time
      point the patient will be asked to report any adverse events (DVT, PT, Stroke, myocardial
      infarction, infection, hospitalization). Diagnostic studies to assess for thromboembolic
      events (i.e. DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), and stroke) will be ordered only if the patient
      develops clinical signs or symptoms that justify their use.
