      biomarkers of functional iron deficiency and skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity
      with 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging in heart failure patients.

      Twenty (20) subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the NYU Advanced Cardiac
      Therapeutics group at NYU Langone Medical Center.

      Twenty (20) subjects will be recruited from the practice of the NYU Advanced Cardiac
      Therapeutics group at NYU Langone Medical Center. The study will require a maximum of four
      (4) visits over a period of five (5) weeks. Eligibility for Visits 2-4 will be determined by
      the screening criteria in Visit 1. It is anticipated that 50% of the screened subjects at
      Visit 1 will be eligible to participate in Visit 2. Eligibility for participation in Visits 3
      and 4 will be determined by the results of the iron biomarkers obtained at Visit 2. We
      anticipate that 50% of the subjects at Visit 2 will be eligible to participate in Visits 3
      and 4. Only subject with functional iron deficiency will participate in Visits 3 and 4. There
      is no clinical care component for this study.
