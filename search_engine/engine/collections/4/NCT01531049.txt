      smoking at young age is difficult although majority of young smokers want to quit. Young
      smokers experience many relapses partly due to the lack of appropriate and available
      cessation services. The discomfort experienced during cessation attempts is likely to be
      negatively associated with cessation success. Quitting of smoking is by the far most
      important procedure in preventing COPD progression. In Finland, 18-35% of young adults smoke,
      the variability being associated at least with socioeconomic background, education and
      geographical area. Our recent studies on male military draftees have shown that smoking is
      much more frequent in Northern than Southern Finland. However young men want to quit and
      accept new smoking restrictions. Very few studies are available on quitting attempts or
      counselling, pharmacotherapy and/or their combinations in young adults who want to quit.
