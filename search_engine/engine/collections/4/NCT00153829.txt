      care. However, primary care physicians face a host of challenges for providing the best
      possible care to their patients. One of these problems is the lack of proper administrative
      systems. There is evidence indicating that tailored out reach facilitation is an effective
      means to improve practice performance. Traditionally, the approach to care for chronically
      ill patients revolved mostly around the treatment of a specific chronic condition in an ad
      hoc basis. It is more common in family medicine for the patient to have several chronic
      conditions. There is also evidence showing that better health outcomes are obtained when the
      patients' life circumstances, desires and expectations are taken into consideration. Various
      models of chronic illness care have emerged that are patient center while attempting to be
      comprehensive. Our approach, following the Australian model, seeks to introduce
      systems/administrative innovations at the practice level, intended also to increase the
      involvement of patients with multiple chronic conditions on its own care, throw tailored out
      reach facilitation and care planning tools for physicians, in order to improve chronic
      illness management in primary care settings.
