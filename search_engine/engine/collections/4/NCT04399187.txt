      pockets > 5 mm in patients of test group were treated by MINSD and NaOCl gel application,
      meanwhile in patients of control group MINSD alone was performed. Full-mouth plaque score
      (FMPS) , Full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level
      (CAL) and gingival recession (GR) were assessed at baseline and after 6 months follow-up.
