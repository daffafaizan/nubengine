      in a change of the exhaled air. This change is measurable with a so called capnograph. The
      investigators want to measure the breath from patients with and without pulmonary
      hypertension to detect a cut-off value for the diagnosis pulmonary hypertension.

      Patients which have the probably diagnosis pulmonary hypertension and are older than 18 years
      are investigated. This patients will get an right heart catheterization and a measurement
      from their exhaled air.
