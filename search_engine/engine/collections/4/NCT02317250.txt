      by data on molecular cerebral changes can lead to improved health outcomes of an
      epidemiologically major segment of the geriatric patient population - people experiencing
      changes in their cognitive skills relative to their prior level of cerebral functioning. In
      the present proposal, we specifically aim to measure how knowledge of molecular cerebral
      information 1) influences the therapeutic management of patients being evaluated for symptoms
      of cognitive decline, and 2) impacts upon long-term health outcomes, particularly for
      patients having findings on positron emission tomography (PET) scans consistent with presence
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD)- like changes in their brains. Patients suffering from
      documentable decline of cognitive function will undergo baseline neuropsychologic testing,
      and neuroimaging with MRI and PET. Reports of PET scans will be sealed at the time of
      interpretation, and then randomized with respect to whether they are released to the
      patients' managing physicians at the time of interpretation, or two years after the time that
      scanning is performed. All treatment decisions will be made by the managing physicians and
      their patients. Cognitive abilities, functional status, and other clinical and social history
      parameters will be assessed every six months. Our central hypothesis is that among the group
      of patients whose PET scan results are conveyed to their physicians at the time of scanning,
      cognitive and functional abilities will be maintained at a higher level during the two years
      following PET. Beyond addressing the specific aims noted above and further described below, a
      valuable feature of this project will be the collection of a rich source of data that can be
      used to address many questions beyond its major focus (e.g., diagnostic value of volumetric
      MRI data used instead of, or in conjunction with, PET data in the Medicare beneficiary
      population; incremental value of applying statistically parameterizing and/or quantifying
      software tools to PET data). The protocol has been designed to conform to all standards
      specified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Coverage with Evidence
      Development (CED), generally, and with all requirements for a CED study responsive to CMS
      Decision Memo CAG-00431N, specifically.
