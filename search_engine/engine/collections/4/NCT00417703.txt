      of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) by taking serial intraocular pressure readings every five
      minutes for thirty minutes after injection. This study is a prospective descriptive data
      collection consisting of measuring intraocular pressure immediately following intraocular
      injection, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes following injection of ranibizumab 0.5
      mg.
