      peoples worldwide. The neuropathy is causing disabling burning pain and dysautonomia such as
      dizziness with standing, brain fog, fatigue, constipation, urinary problems and cold or hot
      intolerance. Early and accurate diagnosis of neuropathy is essential for correct treatment.
      Available diagnostic methods are either invasive such as skin biopsy or available only in few
      specialized centers. This project addresses the limited availability of small fiber
      neuropathy detection.

      The project utilizes utilize specialized image processing of skin pictures for the purpose to
      extract the statistical features that are related to loss of small fibers. The accuracy of
      the diagnosis verified using skin biopsies.

      This approach can improve the availability of diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy.
