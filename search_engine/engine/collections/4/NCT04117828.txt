      carbohydrates based on how they affect blood glucose levels after being consumed. Despite
      being a significant parameter of blood glucose, GI does not depict the effect of the food
      when taken in a controlled recommended amount, and so the Glycemic Loads (GL) must also be
      calculated, thereby measuring the impact on glycemic levels after consumption of standard
      food portion sizes. Dates are high energy foods consumed in various parts of the world, are
      known to be a source of several important nutrients and are also shown to have significant
      impacts in preventing illnesses due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial actions as
      well as preventative action against oxidative reactions The greatly frequent consumption of
      dates necessitates the identification of their GI and GL to ensure whether consumption is
      beneficial and safe for individuals. The objective of the study is to determine and compare
      the values of GI and GL of three varieties of dates in order to assess their safe consumption
      by individuals
