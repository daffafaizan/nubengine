      which tracks exercise compliance and enables remote health coaching for patients with low
      back pain. The system will consist of a series of small motion sensors built into a custom
      designed harness which connect wirelessly to the user's tablet or smartphone. A software
      application will guide the patient through the exercise routine while the sensor system
      monitors their motion, classifies exercise completion, and tracks their progress through the
      protocol. The results of the routine will be securely uploaded to caregivers where they can
      monitor progress, modify the patient's exercise prescription, and offer encouragement and
      coaching to continue the therapy. This research program aims to enable the long term
      treatment-tracking of patients with chronic low back pain.
