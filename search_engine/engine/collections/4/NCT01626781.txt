    
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a frequently occurring, often dose limiting, dermatologic
      reaction associated with cytotoxic agents, such as capecitabine, liposomal doxorubicin, and
      doxetacel.

      Adverse events affecting the integument have posed significant challenges to oncologists in
      recent years in terms of selecting appropriate supportive therapies. Not only medications
      that inhibit EGFR receptors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, panitumumab or cetuximab, but also
      multiple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib and other
      "older" medications such as capecitabine can often lead to skin-related adverse events that
      can be difficult to manage.

      These adverse events compromise skin-related quality of life and can lead to dose compromises
      or even the termination of treatment.

      To date, there are no side effects reported for the use of either MapisalÂ® or urea hand-foot
      cream, making both treatments safe. Given the potential benefits of the treatments in
      preventing HFS by reducing discomfort and impairment of quality of life, the conduct of the
      trial is regarded as justifiable and there is no indication that patients are exposed to an
      increased risk associated with study participation.
