    
      This is a randomised, open-label, multicenter, phase III study for adult de novo Ph+ ALL
      patients (≥18 years, no upper age-limit) based on the combination of the pan-TKI Ponatinib,
      with the bispecific monoclonal antibody Blinatumomab. The control arm will be represented by
      a chemotherapeutic scheme combined with Imatinib for patients aged 18-65 and by Imatinib plus
      age-adjusted chemotherapy for elderly patients (>65 years old).

      Patients (≥18 years, no upper age limit) will be randomized 2:1 to receive the experimental
      or control arm. If patients in the control arm do not achieve a CHR and/or MRD negativity,
      after the sixth consolidation cycle (week 20), a crossover to receive Blinatumomab is
      planned. Likewise, if patients in the control arm develop an ABL1 mutation at any time of
      treatment, they will switch to experimental arm. HLA typing will be performed immediately
      after diagnosis in both arms for patients aged up to 65 years.

      After the 2 cycles of Blinatumomab in the experimental arm and after consolidation in the
      control arm, patients aged 18-65 will be stratified for transplant allocation.
