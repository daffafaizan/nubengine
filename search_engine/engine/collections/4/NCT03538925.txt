      will create longer, more grammatically complete sentences compared with the Standard of Care
      condition. Specific Aim 1 compares these interventions for preschoolers with severe speech
      impairments and typical receptive language, and Specific Aim 2 does the same for children
      with Down syndrome. Specific Aim 3 tests for possible moderation of the intervention effect
      by age, dynamic assessment scores, sentence type, receptive language abilities, prior AAC
      use, sex, mental age, and disability. Aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished using randomized
      controlled trials.
