      sequentially into the following escalating dose cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1 (40 IU/m^2)

        -  Cohort 2 (80 IU/m^2)

        -  Cohort 3 (160 IU/m^2)

      Subjects were monitored for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 2 weeks of cycle 1,
      with DLT defined as any grade 3 or higher toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was
      defined as the cohort in which < 33% of subjects (ie, 0/3 or 1/6 subjects in a cohort)
      experienced DLT. In phase 2, the MTD cohort was expanded in up to 25 patients.

      Subjects who completed treatment in cycle 1 without DLT were eligible to initiate cycle 2 at
      week 10 provided that a computed tomography (CT) scan showed either enlargement of existing
      disease without accompanying symptoms OR stable disease or improvement with no unacceptable
      toxicity. The same radiologic criteria applied for initiation of subsequent cycles. Subjects
      could continue to receive study treatment until disease progression.
