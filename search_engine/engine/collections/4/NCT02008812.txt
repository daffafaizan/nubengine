           patients who have Adenovirus infection . We will take three throat swabs for each
           patient: one for viral isolation, one for RT-PCR and the last for the Ad sensor - based
           real-time diagnosis.

        2. Ad sensor diagnosis： Ad sensor (structural chip-based optosensing virus probing system),
           which is for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical samples, will
           be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between anti-Adenovirus and its
           Adenovirus antigen present in patients'and normal samples.

        3. Gold standard： viral isolation and RT-PCR
