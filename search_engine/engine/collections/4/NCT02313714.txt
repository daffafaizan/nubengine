    
      The neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been used as adjuvant treatment in
      patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. Those patients are limited to perform
      conventional physical activity and adherence to any every day protocols frequency. The aim of
      this study was evaluated the effect on functional status and quality of life after NMES
      treatment using Russian stimulation wave solely twice a week during five weeks period in
      patients waiting for a heart transplant.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Age between 30 to 80 years old Congestive heart failure in NYHA class III or IV Ejection
      fraction lower than 35% Stable clinical status Full pharmacologic treatment

      Exclusion criteria:

      Unstable angina Ventricular arrhythmia intermittent lameness Inferior limb amputation

      Protocol Design:

      Patients at waiting list for heart transplant will be invited to participate on protocol of
      NMES using Russian stimulation wave (2.5 kHz, burst at 50Hz, on/off: 3/9 sec), named NMES
      group or sham stimulation, named control group. The NMES will be applied for 50 minutes,
      twice a week on both quadriceps femoral muscles during 7 weeks. The patients will be
      evaluated every week for distance walked during six minutes walk test (6MWT), heart rate
      variability, and functional status according to New York Heart Association. All patients were
      evaluated at the beginning and after completion of the protocol for quality of life with
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (LHFQ).
