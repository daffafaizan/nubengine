      Questions," "Open Communication," a combination of both "Ask 3 Questions" and "Open
      Communication," to a usual care control condition. These data will inform a potential future
      large scale evaluation of the interventions in clinical practice. Consistent with a
      patient-centered approach, outcome measures are selected in collaboration with a group of
      patient stakeholders and will include measures of patient satisfaction. The study aims to
      collect 75 post-visit surveys and 10 appointment audio-recordings from patients at each of 4
      participating sites (a total of 300 post-visit surveys and 40 audio-recordings).
