    
      The Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System (Bedside PEWS) is a scientifically developed
      documentation-based system of care designed to identify children who are clinically
      deteriorating while admitted to hospital inpatient wards. It was developed and validated by
      the applicants. The investigators have preliminary data demonstrating that the Bedside PEWS
      addresses multiple factors (communication, hierarchy, secondary review) contributing to
      delayed treatment of children at risk. In our pilot study of implementation at a single site
      the investigators showed statistically significant reductions in late transfers, 'stat'
      calls, decreased apprehension when nurses called physicians to review patients, and improved
      communication. Our preliminary data show that the Bedside PEWS score is superior to other
      methods being used to identify children at risk for impending cardiopulmonary arrest. A
      2-year cluster-randomized trial will evaluate the impact of Bedside PEWS on clinical
      outcomes, processes of care and resource utilization in 22 paediatric hospitals.
