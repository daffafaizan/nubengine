    
      Specific aims of the current study are as follows:

      i) To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of multiparametric 3T MRI,
      (anatomical MRI, DCE-MRI, DWI and 1H MRS) combined with FACBC PET/CT and PET/MRI in
      correlation with systematic biopsy and whole mount prostatectomy specimens.

      ii) To asses the applicability of multiparametric 3T MRI combined with FACBC-PET/CT and
      PET/MRI for detection of cancer aggressiveness based on Gleason score and PSA.

      iii) To develop quantitative and qualitative methods for evaluation of FACBC PET/MRI

      iv) To develop and validate an imaging protocol which will become the standard protocol for
      prostate imaging both for surgical and radiotherapy patients at Turku PET Centre using hybrid
      PET/MRI
