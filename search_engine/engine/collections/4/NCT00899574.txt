      a synthetic TLR7 agonist has proven immunomodulatory activity when applied topically, leading
      to clearance of human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced genital warts and primary skin
      malignancies. Its effects will now be examined in breast cancer metastatic to the skin. If
      effective, it will add a relatively non-toxic approach to the treatment armamentarium for
      this patient population frequently resistant to conventional therapies.
