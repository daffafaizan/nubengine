      applications. Currently, manual coding is mainly adopted, which faces several limits like
      being time-consuming and prone to error, and this makes automated ICD coding via machine
      learning a hot research topic.

      As an inevitable phase during machine learning, feature engineering plays a crucially
      important role in leading to promising coding performance. Although have reached enlightening
      conclusions, existing studies lacked comparison of different feature engineering methods.
      Finding out what methods under what circumstances perform better can be quite helpful in
      promoting practical applications of automated coding.

      The investigators will implement this study based on inpatient' data collected from
      electronic medical records from Fuwai Hospital, the world's largest medical center for
      cardiovascular disease. Bag-of-words, word2cec and roberta will be respectively used to
      extracted features from training data. Then code-wise logistic regression classifiers and
      support vector machine classifiers will be trained to auto-assign codes. Afterwards,
      performances of the models on test data will be evaluated.
