      received PP at least 12 hours early (with the first 48 hours) with the oxygen support of the
      reservoir mask, and the second group (non-EPP ) patients who received oxygen with the
      reservoir mask but could not be applied early PP due to the patient's incompatibility or
      rejection.

      Conventional oxygen therapy applied to all patients was given with a reservoir mask, aiming
      at oxygen saturation 93% and above, at a flow rate of 6-15 L / min.

      Despite all the treatments, the patients who have a follow-up with a respiratory acidosis ,
      oxygen saturation value below 93%, applied non invasive mechanical ventilation, in case of
      insufficient patient intubated and have invasive mechanical ventilation. In patients who had
      regression of glasgow coma scale during follow-up, orotracheal intubation was performed and
      invasive mechanical ventilation was performed.
