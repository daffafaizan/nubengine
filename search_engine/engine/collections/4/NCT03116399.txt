      version of PRISM 1.0 for a broad array of seniors with different needs and circumstances. The
      aims of the study are to: 1) obtain information on perceptions of the usefulness and
      usability of PRISM 2.0 and interface design issues; 2) examine the impact of access to PRISM
      2.0 on social connectivity, engagement, social support, and perceived loneliness; 3) examine
      the impact of access to PRISM 2.0 on perceived isolation, wellbeing, and quality of life; 4)
      examine the impact of access PRISM 2.0 on computer attitudes, self-efficacy, technology
      proficiency and technology uptake; 5) gather data on usefulness of system features and if
      these vary by living condition; and 6) examine, in our statistical models, the influence of
      factors such as age, cognitive abilities, ethnicity, education on system use and outcomes.
      The design of the PRISM 2.0 is well grounded and the chosen features will be based on: 1) the
      findings from the PRISM 1.0 trial; 2) the cognitive, human factors and engineering; 3)
      emerging findings in aging (e.g., findings related to technology acceptance, social
      isolation, social networks, life engagement); 4) existing theories of aging (e.g.,
      Stress-Process Model; Active Theory; Social Isolation/Engagement; 5) findings regarding the
      benefits of technology for seniors; 6) findings from previous work from CREATE regarding
      interface design, training, provision of environmental support, and the needs of older
      adults; 7) recent findings regarding Internet use among older adults; 8) findings from our
      prior focus groups on barriers to access of technology and technology preferences; 9)
      findings from our technology-based community intervention programs with older adults; 10)
      existing models of technology adoption and diffusion; 11) the literature on implementation
      science our planned focus groups and pilot testing of PRISM 2.0.
