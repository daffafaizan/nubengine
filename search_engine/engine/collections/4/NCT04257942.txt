      Medical Center. Tissues will be taken from donors undergoing routine endarterectomy
      procedures.We chose carotid artery as the source for the atheromas, due to its high
      prevalence and its considerable size.All speciemnts will be studied in Cryo-Scanning Electron
      Microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Tissues will be observed in hydrated vitrified state, after High
      Pressure Freezing (HPF) and freeze fracture, as well established in the WIS group. Samples
      will be observed at -120Â°C. Cathode-Luminescence (CL) detects a luminescence signal induced
      by electrons in cholesterol crystals and CE condensed states. It will be implemented herein
      under cryogenic conditions. Sample preparation is as for cryo-SEM. Cryo-FIB-SEM block face
      serial imaging allows the acquisition of serial images over large volumes (tens of cubed
      micrometers), at a relatively high imaging resolution (up to 5nm3 voxel size). Volumes of up
      to 40x40x40 ml will be imaged with a resolution of up to 10nm. The data will be minimally
      processed and aligned using FIJI, reconstructed and manually segmented using Avizo Lite 9.2.0
      software.
