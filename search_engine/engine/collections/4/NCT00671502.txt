      This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      in subjects 18-70 years of age with acute, painful, muscle spasm of the lower back. The study
      consisted of a baseline screening (Study Day 1), during which subjects were evaluated for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a 7-day double-blind treatment period (Study Day 1 through
      Study Day 7). Subjects were randomly assigned to be dosed twice daily with one of the
      following double-blind treatments: sustained release(SR) carisoprodol 500-mg
      tablets,sustained release (SR) carisoprodol 700-mg tablets, or placebo.

      Subjects were evaluated in the clinic on Study Days 1, 3 and 7. Subjects who remained
      symptomatic on Study Day 7 were allowed to continue in the study for a 7-day, double-blind
      extension period at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects were contacted by telephone
      for a safety follow-up 7 days after the last dose of study medication.

      A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy was conducted at selected sites. These sites obtained blood
      samples for PK analysis at the end of the 7-day treatment period and the 14-day treatment
      period, if applicable.
