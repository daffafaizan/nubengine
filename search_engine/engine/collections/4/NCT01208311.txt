      cirrhosis due to variability in the abdominal wall thickness and composition. This
      variability can be eliminated by using endoscopic ultrasound.

      Aim: To determine the amount of fibrosis in the liver of hepatitis C patients with advanced
      fibrosis, using endoscopic ultrasound.
