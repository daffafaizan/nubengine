      support during a first psychotic episode. Recent research has shown that non-verbal
      communication and particularly interpersonal motor synchronization between the patient and
      his psychiatrist is a key factor in therapeutic alliance. However, such hypothesis have never
      been tested in terms of treatment adherence neither in a first psychotic episode, nor during
      a 6-month follow-up. By measuring the interpersonal motor synchronization between the patient
      and psychiatrist during a video recorded interview at inclusion, month-3 and month-6, the
      project aims to validate the hypothesis that a high level of interpersonal synchronization
      should be associated with a high level of therapeutic alliance. This therapeutic alliance
      being hypothesized as a mediator between synchronization and treatment adherence, the project
      should show for the first time in a first psychotic episode that the use of reliable and
      objective variables extracted from the analysis of the synchronization between psychiatrist
      and patient allows to predict the outcome of therapeutic and treatment alliance.
