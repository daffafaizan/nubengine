      intracoronary application of progenitor cells after acute myocardial infarction. Since
      capillary density cannot be assessed histological in patients, measurement of coronary flow
      reserve is an exact means for estimating capillary density and assessing coronary
      microvascular function. With the help of an intracoronary Doppler Wire, coronary hemodynamics
      can be assessed at baseline and, for example, adenosin-induced maximal vasodilation.
      Calculation of the minimal vascular resistance indices allows to estimate the cross-sectional
      area, reflecting capillary density, and, in comparison with the time of the acute myocardial
      infarction, estimation of improved neovascularization at a later timepoint.

      In order to improve neovascularization, which may then be associated with improved left
      ventricular contractility, we initiated the current trial.
