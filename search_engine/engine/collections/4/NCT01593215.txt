      increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We have also seen that blockers of that receptor improves
      impaired insulin secretion in animals. We will now test the blocker in patients with type 2
      diabetes with or without the risk variant in an effort to make diabetes treatment more
      individualized. Patients will receive two different doses of the blocker and the effect will
      be measured with oral glucose tolerance tests. The study is a randomized placebo-controlled
      study.
