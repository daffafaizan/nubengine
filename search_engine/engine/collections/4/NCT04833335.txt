      difficult to distinguish. 60 patients will be included in this prospective, monocentric
      study. 3 MRI (baseline, 1month and 6 month follow-ups) will be performed. Two
      neuroradiologists will blindly analyse the MRIs comparing ASL sensibility and specificity to
      the standard morphological evaluation and T2 perfusion.
