      influence on the decline of mortality of a realized systematic screening, by a simple visual
      inspection of the oral cavity in alcohol-smoker patients. The sensibility of the visual
      inspection to diagnose the oral cancers is estimated at 85 % and the specificity in 97 %.
      However some l√©sions are not diagnosed with common oral examination(Downer MC Oral Oncol.
      2004 ( 3 ) 264-73). The examination in autofluorescence coupled with the visual inspection
      could be a solution to improve early diagnosis of potentially malignant disorders . Indeed,
      dysplasia and cancerous lesions can be revealing by an autofluorescence examination (Lane PM
      J Biomed opt on 2006 ( 2 ): 024006). Other works demonstrated that infra-clinical lesions
      could be revealed by the autofluorescence (Poh CF Wink Cancer Res on 2006 ( 22 ): 6616-22;
      Poh CF Head Neck 2007 ( 1 ) 7 71-6). On the other hand the sensibility and the specificity of
      the autofluorescence in situation of screening were not estimated and studies carried out on
      sick subjects tend to overestimate the metrological performances of a technique. Besides the
      reliability of the technique (reproducibility) was not studied. For these reasons, it is
      recommended to realize in situation of screening in an alcohol-smoker population:

        -  a study of reliability to estimate the reproducibility inter-observer of the examination
           of the oral cavity in tissular autofluorescence and,

        -  a feasibility study to estimate the potential contribution of the autofluorescence with
           regard to a simple visual inspection in the screening of the potential malignant
           disorders.
