    
      Participants: 90 community-living elderly, with mild cognitive impairment.

      Interventions: Participants will be randomized into 3 arms: Art Therapy, Music Reminiscence
      Activity or a Control arm. Sessions will be conducted weekly for 3 months and fortnightly for
      6 months. Each intervention session will last for 40 minutes. The Control group will not
      receive any intervention and continue their life as usual.

      Assessments: Demographic data will be collected at baseline. Neuropsychological tests of
      cognitive functioning will be done at baseline, 3 months and 9 months. Anxiety and depressive
      symptoms will be assessed at the 3 time-points. Blood sampling will occur at all time points
      (except control group, only at baseline and 9 months). Participants will also undergo a
      task-free brain fMRI scan at baseline and at 3 months.
