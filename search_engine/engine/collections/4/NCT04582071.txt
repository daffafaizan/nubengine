      levels of state-based anxiety as the primary outcome. Our hypothesis is that patients in the
      experimental group, will show a decrease in anxiety levels over the course of the four
      sessions, while the same group in the control group will not change significantly in their
      anxiety levels. It is hypothesized that this would be due to the psychotherapeutic
      intervention mitigating the inherent emotional stress and negative behavioral changes
      associated with surgery. It will be important to differentiate between the inpatient and
      outpatient groups, as their anxiety levels may inherently be discrepant. For patients with a
      three-step ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), the three sessions subsequent to surgery will
      be conducted only after the first surgery. This is an exploratory study in which we are
      investigating the possibility of a range of potential outcomes to the intervention, including
      overall reduction of anxiety, depression, body image and improvement in quality of life.
