      pancreatic carcinoma will receive gemcitabine and CP-870,893 two weeks prior to surgical
      resection and subsequently during standard-of-care adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (at which
      time CP-870,893 will be given on day 3 of each of three 28-day cycles of gemcitabine).
      Previously established doses of each agent will be used and each given by IV infusion.
