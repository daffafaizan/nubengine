      synthetic bone graft (bioactive glass granules, S53P4, Vivoxid Ltd, Turku, Finland) is as
      good as traditional autogenous or allogeneic bone grating in filling of non-traumatic bone
      defects. A total of 48 patients (stratified into two groups) will be included. The underlying
      bone disease will include common bening and semi-malign bone tumors (such as enchondroma and
      giant cell tumors) as well as tumor-like conditions (such as fibrous dysplasia, fibrous
      cortical defect, solitary bone cysts, aneurysmatic bone cyst).

      Group I (n=24) will include patients with small benign bone lesions amenable to evacuation
      and autogenous bone grafting as standard of care. The patients will be randomized to
      autogenous bone grafting or bioactive glass granule filling. The follow-up examinations up to
      52 weeks will include plain X-rays at 4, 26, and 52 weeks as well as MRI ad 4 and 52 weeks.

      Group II (n=24) will include patients with a large bone defect. As the selection criteria,
      large defects have been defined to be defects which need allogeneic bone grafting. The
      patients will be randomized to allogeneic bone grafting or bioactive glass granule filling.
      The patients will be followed up to 52 weeks. The follow-up examinations will include X-rays
      at 4, 26 and 52 weeks as well as PET/CT imaging and MRI at 4 weeks and 52 weeks.
