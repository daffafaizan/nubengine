      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel psychosocial intervention, Fathers and Mothers
      with cancer Communication Tool (Fam-CT). The purpose of the intervention is to decrease
      parental anxiety by facilitating parental communication about cancer with their children. The
      primary hypothesis being tested is that an intervention that assists parents with their
      communication needs with their children can be feasible, acceptable, and reduce parental
      psychological distress. Findings from this study will inform a future grant application to
      further test this intervention in a randomized controlled trial.
