      exposure-based treatment for anxiety disorders. Additional research is needed to determine
      whether DCS facilitates other forms of cognitive processing (e.g., attention, memory,
      executive functioning) that are involved in cognitive behavioral therapies which do not rely
      on extinction as a mechanism of action. This question is particularly important among older
      adults who have experienced normal age-related declines in cognitive functioning, which may
      interfere with their ability to benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapies. The aim of the
      current study was to determine the cognitive enhancing effects of DCS on neuropsychological
      test performance among healthy older adults. It was hypothesized that participants who
      received d-cycloserine would demonstrate superior performance on neuropsychological tests
      than would participants who received placebo.
