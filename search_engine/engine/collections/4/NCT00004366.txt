    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: During the first 4 weeks of study, patients meet with a clinical nurse
      specialist once a week for approximately 1 hour. During this time, the nature of the anxiety
      disorder is explained and exposure to previously feared situations is encouraged.

      Only patients who remain symptomatic at a stable level following self-exposure will proceed
      with rehabilitation training.

      Patients meet with a physical therapist once a week for 4 weeks to further evaluate the
      extent of problems associated with balance. Then, patients undergo weekly 1 hour exercises
      for 8 weeks with the physical therapist, focusing on sensation, head and eye coordination,
      movement with eyes opened and closed, and gait.

      Concurrently, patients meet with the clinical nurse specialist every 4 weeks during and after
      physical therapy to evaluate the effects of vestibular treatment on anxiety symptoms.

      Training is continued if patient is symptomatic; otherwise, patient is discharged from study.
