    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a Southwest Oncology Group Phase II trial or oral
      STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel
      cell carcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the objective response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and
      partial responses) of oral STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with
      metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

      III. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral STI-581/imatinib (Gleevec)
      administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

      IV. To analyze tumor samples for activating mutations of STI-571/imatinib-sensitive kinases
      (KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) by denaturing HPLC and direct DNA sequencing.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or symptomatic deterioration.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
