      will be 7 mL/kg/day. The treatment dose is a standard dose previously worked out in other
      research and was used in a variety of other clinical research (27, 32). Study randomization
      will be performed in a double-blind fashion with study investigators and participants unaware
      of group assignment. Randomization order will be created using a randomized blocked design.
      After volunteer consent is provided, the clinical study coordinator will open a
      sequentially-numbered envelope containing the study group assignment and provide a 4 week
      supply of study beverage.

      Participants will be seen for follow-up study visits at approximately 4 week intervals after
      the baseline enrollment visit. Compliance with study treatment (PGJ or placebo) will be
      assessed by interview at visits 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of visits 2 and 3, a supply of
      study beverage will be provided to the participant for consumption during the ensuing 4
      weeks. Study beverage supplies remaining at the end of the 90-day study period will be
      donated to each participant.

      Platelet Aggregation testing will be performed by ThromboVision (Salt Lake City, UT) using
      multiple platelet agonists, including ADP, collagen/epinephrine, PMA, and TRAP. Each of these
      aggregation inducers target a separate platelet activation pathway.
