      This proposal has as a general objective to show the impact of the use of information and
      communication technologies (ICT) on the resolution of the pent-up demand for primary dental
      care to children in the SUS, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

      To this do so, the following specific objectives are defined:

        1. To identify the pent-up demand for the outage of dental care and the benefits and
           difficulties, as well as the perception of users, in the implementation of new
           strategies of non-face-to-face care based on technology (teleservice), using a primary
           care cell unit for children and prospecting, through models, this situation for the
           scenario of the Unified Health System (SUS).

        2. Perform different forms of economic evaluation to measure whether the gains achieved
           with the implementation of teleservice (telescreening, teleorientation and
           telemonitoring) compensate for the additional costs possibly associated with it, or
           whether teleservice modalities are associated with long-term resource savings, taking
           into account the implementation sized for the Brazilian public health system.

        3. Explore how the introduction of these technologies could benefit the SUS in the trans
           and post-pandemic period, contribute to the correction of possible inequities in health
           care and other social aspects, as well as result in possible differences when different
           Brazilian scenarios are explored.
