      of verbal instructions about the anatomy and function of PFMs associated with the use of body
      techniques awareness and vaginal palpation helps in learning the correct contraction and
      improves the function of the PFMs.

      Design: A single-centered, double-blind (investigator and outcome assessor) randomised
      controlled trial with two physiotherapy intervention groups.

      Measurements: The primary outcome measure will be the EMG activity of the PFMs, gluteus
      maximus, hip adductor, and the group formed by the abdominal transverse (TrA) and internal
      oblique (IO) muscles during rest and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). The secondary
      outcome measure will be the PFM function (vaginal palpation and visual observation), posture
      assessment (software SAPO), and self-efficacy scale for practising PFM exercises.
