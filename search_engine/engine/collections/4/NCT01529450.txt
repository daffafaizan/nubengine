    
      This is a prospective single-center, open label, pilot study to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of LDE225 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma.

      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To explore the effects of oral LDE225 on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of individuals
      with locally advanced or metastatic BCC who have been previously treated with a non-LDE225
      Smo inhibitor.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of oral LDE225 on tumor tissue biomarkers of BCC activation (e.g.
           Gli and Ki67) in individuals which are non-naive to Smo inhibitors other than LDE225, at
           baseline and at end-of-treatment

        -  To describe adverse effects of oral LDE225 in individuals with a history of non-LDE225
           Smo inhibitor usage
