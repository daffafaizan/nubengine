    
      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Study of Nitazoxanide in Adults and
      Adolescents with Acute Uncomplicated Influenza. The primary objectives of this study are to
      demonstrate the efficacy of nitazoxanide administered 300 mg two times per day for 5 days or
      600 mg two times per day for 5 days in reducing the time to resolution of all clinical
      symptoms of influenza.

      The study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics of nitazoxanide in a subset of 24 patients and
      the safety of the nitazoxanide regimen compared to a placebo via analysis of adverse events
      and laboratory safety tests.

      Blood samples will be collected for all patients at baseline, day 7 and day 28, and for a
      subset of 24 patients aged 18-65 years (pharmacokinetics subset) on day 2. Urine samples will
      be collected at baseline and day 7. Nasal swabs will be collected at baseline and day 7 for
      all patients and on days 2, 3, 4 and 5 for a subset of patients (approximately 20% of
      patients).
