      Depending on the severity of the condition and the age of the patient and the status of the
      binocular vision system, hyperopia can also cause fatigue, asthenopia, headaches, double
      vision, and amblyopia. Low to moderate amounts of hyperopia rarely cause much difficulty in
      the young person, but will eventually cause significant near vision problems as the patient
      ages. Hyperopia can be caused by the eye being too short (axial hyperopia) or by the cornea
      being too flat or the crystalline lens being to weak (refractive hyperopia). It has been
      established by the PI that axial growth can be dramatically lessened in children and
      adolescents with myopia through the use of bifocal contact lenses prescribed in a particular
      way (The CONTROL Study). Studies by Earl Smith, O.D., Ph.D. have suggested that multi-zonal
      contact lenses that provide proper axial focus while manipulating peripheral defocus can
      either discourage or encourage axial growth to treat myopia or hyperopia respectively. In the
      present study, simultaneous vision bifocal soft contact lenses will be used to encourage
      axial growth in hyperopic children and adolescents with axial hyperopia in an effort to
      reduce hyperopia. Subjects will be randomly assigned to wear either bifocal soft contact
      lenses or single vision soft lenses. The bifocal contact lenses will be prescribed to provide
      for clear central vision at both distance and near with the near zone of the contact, thus
      exposing the retina to hyperopic defocus from the distance zone.
