      Additional focus on motivation and rewards has fallen on the topic of stroke rehabilitation
      since it was shown in an animal model that the brain centers involved with motivation and
      rewards are crucial to motor learning [Hosp 2011].

      The investigators goal is to target the overall motivation for therapy. During the guided
      therapy sessions the therapists will be the main motivators and the investigators do not want
      to interfere with that. But the amount of guided therapy sessions is often limited due to
      economical reason rather than therapeutic ones. Therefore patients are encouraged to do
      training on their own if possible and to be active during the patients stay in the
      rehabilitation clinic. The investigators target the patients motivation to train by
      themselves and be active but also the patients attitude towards the guided therapies. It is
      known that performance feedback can improve motivation [Harackiewicz 1979]. Therefore the
      investigators want to use the data about therapy progress to produce feedback for patients
      visualizing the patients progress and efforts during the patients stay in the clinic.

      The investigators will compare patients who receive normal therapy to patients who receive
      normal therapy plus performance feedback regarding a variety of motivation measures.
