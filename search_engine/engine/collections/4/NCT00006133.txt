    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to age/menopausal status (35 and under/premenopausal vs 50
      and over/postmenopausal). Both strata are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Stratum 1 (Premenopausal/Oral contraceptives): Patients receive either oral ethinyl estradiol
      and norethindrone or placebo daily for 28 days beginning on the Sunday following the first
      day of the menstrual cycle.

      Stratum 2 (Postmenopausal/Hormone replacement therapy): Patients receive either oral
      estradiol and medroxyprogesterone or placebo on days 1-12 monthly.

      Treatment continues in both arms of both strata for a total of 13 courses in the absence of a
      severe disease flare-up or other complication that would preclude further study
      participation.

      All patients are followed at 1 year.
