        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of gefitinib, in terms of progression-free rate, in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma expressing HER1.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective response, in terms of time to onset and duration of response, in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
