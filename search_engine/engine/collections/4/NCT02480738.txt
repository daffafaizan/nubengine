      community-dwelling elderly. It can be much cheaper than traditional neuropsychological
      training methods, which require trained neuropsychologists. Furthermore, it may be more fun
      and easier to be optimized to an individual patients' cognitive status than other traditional
      methods.

      Clinical efficacy of these kinds of cognitive training applications has been validated
      through several studies. A recent systematic review reported that the domains of working
      memory, executive function, and processing speed benefited the most by classic computerized
      cognitive training tasks, and that these benefits were comparable with traditional cognitive
      training methods. Apart from neuropsychological data, neuroimaging studies focusing on the
      effectiveness of computerized cognitive training are scant.

      There have been no previous studies investigating the possible neural substrates of
      computerized cognitive training using multimodal neuroimaging modalities simultaneously.
      Thus, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training and
      corresponding neural substrates in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, subjective memory
      impairment, and normal controls through a multimodal approach.
