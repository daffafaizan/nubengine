      coronary interventions (PCI). Most of our current knowledge with clopidogrel originates from
      the clinical investigations that had used Plavix速/Iscover速 from Sanofi-Aventis as the
      original formulation of clopidogrel-bisulphate. However, as the patency of Plavix速 has
      expired in November 2009 in Hungary, several generic clopidogrel have been introduced to the
      market. Some of the generics are using the original bisulphate formulation, while others are
      with besylate salt of clopidogrel. Despite the differences in the clopidogrel-salts, the
      different carriers might also modulate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of each
      drug. As the consequences of the impaired antiplatelet potency might be devastating,
      including stent thrombosis, the investigators sought to compare generic clopidogrel to the
      original blister by different assays of platelet aggregation.

      In a prospective, cross-over, open-label, unblinded study the investigators aim to compare
      platelet activation and aggregation between Plavix速 and generic clopidogrel.
