    
      We will select all the patients referred to our Cardiac Rehabilitation center after an ACS.
      HbA1c will be measured in each patient included in the study. the OGTT will be prescribed in
      all the patients without known diabetes and with HbA1c < 6.5%. In order to perform a "real
      life" study, the OGTT will not performed in the CR center but will prescribed in each patient
      who will be asked to perform it in an external biological laboratory.

      The OGTT will be performed in the morning after a 12 hour fast, with 75g oral glucose load.
      Plasma glucose will be measured at baseline and 120 min after the oral glucose load. The
      results will be classified according to the WHO criteria: diabetes is defined as fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG) greater or equal to 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or glucose level 2h (2hPG)
      after the OGTT greater or equal to 11.1mmol/L (200mg/dL); impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is
      defined as FPG greater or equal to 6.1 mmol/L (110mg/dL) and less than 7.0 mmol/L and
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as a 2hPG greater or equal to 7.8 mmol/L (140
      mg/dL) and less than 11.1mmol/L.

      In parallel, screening for glucose metabolism disorders with the OGTT after an ACS will be
      evaluated in the whole French population from a representative sample of 1/97Ã¨me French
      population of the "National Health Insurance Inter-Regime Information System" (SNIIRAM) which
      collects individual hospital and non-hospital data for health care consumption.
