      giving birth, and is common across cultures. In postpartum Chinese women, the reported
      incidence ranged from 6.5% to 29.5%.

      The etiology of postpartum depression is not totally clear. Identified risk factors include
      previous maternal blues, unplanned pregnancy, lack of marital or social support, and previous
      psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, the severe pain experienced during childbirth was
      reported to be associated with the occurrence of postpartum depression.

      A recent study of the investigators found that use of epidural analgesia during labor was
      associated with decreased risk of postpartum depression. However, several limitations existed
      in that study and further evidence is needed to reconfirm the finding. The purpose of the
      present study is to reevaluate whether use of neuraxial labor analgesia can reduce the
      incidence of postpartum depression.
