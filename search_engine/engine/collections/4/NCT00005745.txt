      In the United States, approximately one third of adult women are trying to lose weight. Most
      weight losses are not sustained and in fact may be followed by gains of at least as much
      weight as was intentionally lost. It is unclear whether there are adverse outcomes associated
      with multiple intentional weight losses.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The prospective study addressed the impact of weight fluctuation on development of
      hypertension (HPT) and diabetes (DM) by following women who significantly fluctuated in
      weight compared to those who generally maintained a stable weight. The subject source was all
      participants between 1989 and 1993 in the Nurses Health Study II (NHS) who did not experience
      a full term pregnancy between 1989 and 1993 and who were free of HPT, DM and cancer in 1993.
      A random sample of each of two weight fluctuation classifications, >20 lbs. (3 or more times)
      and 10-19 lbs. (3 or more times) was identified. A control group of non-fluctuators was
      matched by age and body mass index strata. Baseline data consisted of information obtained
      from the 1993 NHS II follow-up along with supplemental questionnaires sent to study
      participants to elicit specific information on past and present weight gain/loss and
      intentionality of weight fluctuation. Prospective data came from follow-up questionnaires in
      1995, 1997, and 1999. Hypertension and DM ascertainment were obtained from self-report in the
      questionnaire. This ascertainment method appeared quite adequate based on validity studies
      carried out on subsamples of this cohort.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
