      placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) under general or spinal anesthesia. Note: Bupivacaine cannot be used as
      the spinal anesthetic.

      Part 1 During Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) will be
      randomized to receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block with either one of three
      doses of liposome bupivacaine (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in 20 mL under ultrasound
      guidance. Preservative-free normal saline will be added to the 67 mg and 133 mg doses of
      study drug to achieve a volume of 20 mL.

      Part 2 In Part 2 of the study, approximately 180 subjects (randomized 1:1, resulting in
      approximately 90 liposome bupivacaine subjects and 90 placebo subjects) will receive a single
      dose injection femoral nerve block with the selected dose level of liposome bupivacaine
      (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in 20 mL under ultrasound guidance.
