      patients) who has initiated 3TC (300 mg p.o. q 24 h) plus DTG (50 mg p.o. q 24 h), and who
      achieve viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) at weeks 48.

      Secondary objectives are: to analyze the proportion of individuals who achieve viral
      suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) at weeks 24 and 96, to describe absolute values and
      changes from ART initiation in CD4+ cells count and CD4:CD8 ratio at 24, 48 and 96 weeks,
      Changes from ART initiation in creatinine clearance anda fasting lipids at weeks 24, 48 and
      96, and the proportion of subjects who discontinue treatment and reasons for discontinuations
