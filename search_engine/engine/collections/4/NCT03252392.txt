    
      Full audiological evaluation is carried out to all participants including:

        -  pure tone and speech audiometry.

        -  Tympanometry and acoustic reflex threshold evaluation.

        -  Threshold auditory brain stem response for threshold determination in non co operative
           children not respond to pure tone,speech audiometry.

        -  Auditory brain stem response for neuro-otologic diagnosis.

        -  Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in children proved to have normal hearing to
           detect minimal cochlear affection .

        -  Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions with contralateral masking. Communication
           evaluation is carried out to all participants using arabic language test(kotby et
