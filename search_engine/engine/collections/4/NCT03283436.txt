      laparoscopic hysterectomy. The superior hypogastric plexus lies in the presacral space and
      supplies autonomic innervation to the central pelvis. This plexus is suspected to play a role
      in postoperative pain following a hysterectomy. The investigators hypothesize that a SHPB
      using the anesthetic bupivacaine will reduce patients' pain scores and opioid consumption
      following a laparoscopic hysterectomy. Intraoperative and immediate postoperative opioid
      consumption will be collected from the Medication Administration Record by the nursing staff.
      The nursing staff will also be asked to complete a recovery worksheet that details the Visual
      Analog Scale pain score and opioid administration on admission to the recovery unit and every
      postoperative hour until six hours or the patient is discharged. Patients will also be asked
      to complete a daily diary for one week following the procedure, which details their pain
      level and daily opioid consumption. Patients will be followed for thirty days after surgery
      to assess for the occurrence of any postoperative complications. Detailed patient and
      procedure characteristics including age, race, body mass index, parity, surgical history,
      surgery indication, procedure type, and surgical approach will also be collected.
