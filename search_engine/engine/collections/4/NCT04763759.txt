      biofilm-related. Prosthetic joint infections are a classical example of difficult to
      eradicate infections associated with biofilm. Most Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) cases are
      caused by staphylococcal species (~70%) with an increasing number being antibiotic-resistant
      (MRSA). In the US, two-stage revision is the standard of care for replacement of an infected
      prosthetic joint, and is associated with substantial costs and prolonged immobility. TRL1068
      is a fully human antibody that has been shown in pre-clinical studies to disrupt biofilm.
      TRL1068 targets a highly conserved epitope on the DNABII family of bacterial DNA binding
      proteins that includes histone-like (HU) and integration host factor (IHF) proteins of
      clinically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The DNABII epitope bound by
      TRL1068 has no homologs in the human proteome.
