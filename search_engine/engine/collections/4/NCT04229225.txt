    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted as two parallel
      cohorts to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of single dose (SD) and
      repeat dose (RD) intra-articular (IA) administration of UBX0101 in patients with symptomatic
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      Approximately 36 patients will be randomly assigned to either Cohort 1 (SD) or Cohort 2 (RD)
      (18 patients per treatment cohort) and further randomized in a 2:1 ratio to UBX0101 and
      placebo in each cohort.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SD and RD IA
      administration of UBX0101 over 24 weeks.
