      multidisciplinary and translational research program that includes 7 Veterans Administration
      Hospitals (VAH), the 4 designated Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and 4 academic
      hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories, along with
      Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores. The DECAMP Coordinating Center
      will facilitate rapid selection, design and execution of clinical studies within this
      multi-institutional consortium. The goal will be accomplished by recruiting 500 smokers with
      indeterminate pulmonary nodules (0.7cm - 3.0cm) on chest CT who will undergo fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy and will be followed for 2 years until a final diagnosis is made. The diagnostic
      performance of four previously established lung cancer biomarkers in this cohort will be
      validated; 1) a gene-expression biomarker measured in bronchial airway brushings; 2) a
      proteomic signatures measured in bronchial airway biopsies; 3) a proteomic signature measured
      in serum; and 4) a signature of serum cytokines. The added value of the molecular markers to
      clinical and imaging markers routinely used in the diagnostic work up of these patients and
      develop an integrated model (i.e. clinical, imaging & molecular markers) that results in the
      most robust diagnostic predictor will be evaluated.
