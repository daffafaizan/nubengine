    
      Study Design: Prospective Longitudinal Study.

      The investigators planned to assess at baseline and at scheduled follow up visits:

        -  Medical history collection with thrombosis risk factors evaluation;

        -  Clinical parameters collection;

        -  Upper abdomen ultrasound and portal district echo color doppler to evaluate the presence
           of PVT;

        -  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy;

        -  Routine blood samples collection with plasma and urine storage;

      At every follow up visit will be evaluated all relevant clinical events and will be recorded
      all treatments received during the follow-up period.

      Sample Size: The investigators plan to include in the study n = 1100 patients. The sample
      size was calculated assuming an expected prevalence of 18% at time zero, and in order to
      obtain a confidence interval 95% to prevail at time zero whose distance from the edge is less
      than or equal to 3%.
