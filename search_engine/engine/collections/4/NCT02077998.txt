      I. To detect the levels of oxaliplatin-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts induced by
      oxaliplatin microdosing in tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and
      correlate the results with patient response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of single agent oxaliplatin treatment (130mg/m^2, 2 hr intravenously
      [IV] day 1; every 3 weeks) in pre-treated, metastatic breast cancer patients.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity of oxaliplatin microdose and chemotherapy treatment in this patient
      population.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of oxaliplatin microdosing and correlate
      with the PK parameters of therapeutic oxaliplatin.

      IV. Determine whether the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin microdosing affects
      oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage and, therefore, patient response to chemotherapy.

      V. Detect repair of DNA adducts in PBMC and correlate with patient response to
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

      VI. Correlate the adduct and patient response data to DNA repair genes, such as excision
      repair cross-complementing (ERCC)1 levels as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR).

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE 0: Patients receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin IV over 2 minutes on day 1.

      PHASE II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.
