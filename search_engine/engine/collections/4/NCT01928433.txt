      and pyelonephritis, due to their activity against cUTI pathogens and high levels of excretion
      in the urine following oral and i.v. administration. However, many currently prescribed
      fluoroquinolones exhibit reduced antibacterial activity at low pH, which suggests reduced
      activity in infected urinary tracts.
