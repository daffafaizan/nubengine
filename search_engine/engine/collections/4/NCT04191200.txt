      World Health Organization. This pathology decreases the patient's quality of life and one
      patient out of two will try to commit suicide and 10% will die. Oral health is an important
      factor for general well being. The litterature shows that schizophrenic patients tend to
      visit less dental surgeries than the general population. Patients will often visit the
      surgery in emergency and dentist often choses to extract instead of a restorative solution.
      Thus, schizophrenic subjects are 3,4 more likely to become edentulous compared to the general
      population.

      This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study on patients suffering from schizophrenia and
      and schizoaffective disorders in a psychiatric institution. A dental assessment will be
      conducted to provide clinical data on oral health. (DMFT, hygiene, mouth dryness, prosthesis)
      and a survey of their diet, medication, oral quality of life, social security coverage and
      patients view regarding dental care (Anxiety and Healthcare renunciation).

      This is an observational study (oral examination and survey), so no treatment will be
      compared. The oral health status will be evaluated during one single oral examination and
      survey during the patient's stay at hospital.
