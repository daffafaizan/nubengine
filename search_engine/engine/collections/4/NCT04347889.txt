      see if they are already immune to Covid-19. HCW will get baseline assessment and if meeting
      inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria they will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      hydroxychloroquine or Vitamin C on a weekly basis for three months. Subjects will complete
      daily diary of symptoms and temperature, and will have repeat SARS-CoV-2 serology at 6 weeks
      and 3 months to determine seroconversion.
