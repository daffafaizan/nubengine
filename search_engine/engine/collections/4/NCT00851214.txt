      monitoring of acutely ill or injured patients secondary to the lack of non invasive
      technologies that could be reliably applied to this patient population.Thus all assessments
      of hemodynamics have been made by physicians on clinical information including intermittent
      pulse and blood pressure measurements. It is not known what the underlying continuous cardiac
      output, systemic vascular resistance, etc are in these patients and how these change with
      current Emergency Medicine therapeutic interventions. Currently there is available a finger
      cuff devise (NexfinHD Monitor, BMEYE, Amsterdam) that can measure these hemodynamics on a
      beat to beat basis and that can be easily applied to acutely ill individuals. This
      prospective pilot study of 48 patients (4 groups of 12 each) will document the hemodynamics
      of patients on arrival and continuously for 2 hours, blinded to the treating physician.
      Treating physicians will be asked to estimate these hemodynamic parameters at various time
      points. The study will characterize the hemodynamics of patients, compare them to the
      estimates of treating physicians and determine whether they predict the need for life saving
      interventions.
