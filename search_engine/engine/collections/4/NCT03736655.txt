      indicated for glaucoma surgery alone (not combined with cataract), and will undergo
      incisional glaucoma therapy, including a novel simplified surgical technique allowing
      placement of an interposition supraciliary permanent device.

      Several patient data like IOP, visual capacity or associated pharmacological treatments will
      be recorded pre and post-operatively all along the follow-up.

      Purpose is to ensure device safety, and verify IOP and associated pharmacological treatment
      reduction after surgery, and evolution along follow-up.
