      with heterogenous subgroups. The squamous cell carcinoma subgroup usually involves the upper
      part of esophagus and typically occurs in mid-age males. Standard treatment for esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) utilizes a trimodality approach comprising of surgery
      (including resection and reconstruction and/or feeding tube support), radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has not shown a benefit in advanced or
      metastatic ESCC. Immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1/PD-L1
      axis, have demonstrated clinical benefit in phase III trials for head neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC). This led to the anticipation that immunotherapy could also be useful ESCC
      due to similar histologic cell types, but before the results presented from KEYNOTE-181, no
      phase III trial have proven such benefit. It must be emphasized that KEYNOTE-180, KEYNOTE-181
      and ONO-4538-07 demonstrated efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in ESCC patients were
      only 14.3-17%; furthermore, USFDA approved pembrolizumab monotherapy for second line
      treatment in advanced esophageal cancer only with CPS scoreâ‰§10. Thus, the benefit of
      immunotherapy in patients with CPS score less than 10 remains uncertain. With effective
      target therapy and immunotherapy options lacking, there is a huge unmet need for chemotherapy
      resistant, advanced or metastatic ESCC. In light of a recent retrospective cohort study
      demonstrating clinical benefit of using pembrolizumab combined with afatinib for refractory
      HNSCC, the investigators decide to implement the similar regimen (afatinib plus BI704591) in
      ESCC patients who had failed multiple lines of chemotherapy
