    
      A nonrandomized, open-label, rising-dose, parallel-group, multi-center study of SCH 721015 in
      patients with papillary bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ that is refractory to Bacillus
      Calmette-Guerin. Subjects will receive a single intravesical administration of SCH 721015
      with SCH 209702 in a total volume of 75 mL with a 1-hour dwell time. Subjects who at 3 months
      post administration demonstrate a complete response (CR on cystoscopy/biopsy and cytology)
      and who did not experience dose-limiting toxicity will be allowed to receive a second
      intravesical administration at the same dose level.
