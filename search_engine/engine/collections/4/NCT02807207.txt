    
      This is a randomized, pacritinib- versus placebo-blind, placebo- and active-controlled,
      single-dose, single-center, 3-period crossover study to evaluate the cardiac safety of a
      single 400-mg dose of pacritinib compared to placebo, and to characterize the PK of
      pacritinib and major human metabolites of pacritinib. The study is blinded for pacritinib and
      placebo, and open-label for moxifloxacin.

      Subjects were to receive 3 treatments (400 mg pacritinib, placebo, and 400 mg moxifloxacin)
      in a crossover fashion. Each treatment is administered as monotherapy during 1 of 3 treatment
      periods with a 7-day washout period between administration of each study medication.
      Screening occurred up to 28 days before Check-in (Day -1) of Period 1. On Day -1 of Period 1,
      subjects checked into the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for baseline assessments and were
      confined to the CRU for the remainder of the study until Study Completion (Day 22)/Early
      Termination. Continuous 12-lead cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and recording was performed from
      predose (at least

      1 hour before administration of study medication) through 24 hours after the administration
      of study medication, then for 15 minutes every 12 hours (on Days 2 to 7 of each period).
      Blood samples for PK analysis were also collected predose (Hour 0) and at each cardiodynamic
      ECG timepoint postdose. Safety endpoints (eg, adverse events [AEs], clinical laboratory
      evaluations, vital signs) were monitored throughout each period. Subjects were discharged at
      Study Completion (Day 22). Subjects were scheduled to return for a Follow-up Visit 14 days
      (Â±3 days) later on Day 36.
