      sclerosis (MS). This limitation prevents the person from having an active and meaningful life
      at home and in the community. Also, more energy is needed to walk, which can cause fatigue
      and further leads to a non-active life style and poor quality of life. Unfortunately, walking
      training is often not available for this population because of the severity and progress of
      the disease; therefore, a new strategy is needed to help people with MS to walk again. A new
      technology, the wearable robotic exoskeleton, has been developed to help persons with spinal
      cord injuries stand up and walk. The robotic legs are powered by batteries and controlled by
      motors. This study will investigate the use of a wearable robotic exoskeleton to help persons
      with MS to walk. Participants will receive trainings (5 days per week for 3 weeks) to walk
      with the robotic exoskeleton (EKSO, EKSO Bionics, Richmond, CA). During the training, a
      physical therapist will teach the participant how to maintain balance, sit to stand, stand to
      sit, and walk with the wearable robotic exoskeleton. The hypothesis is that persons with MS
      will be able to use a robotic exoskeleton to walk better and with less energy costs.
