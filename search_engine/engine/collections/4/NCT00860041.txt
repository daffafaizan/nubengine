        -  To describe the incidence and characteristics of and change in pain related to
           paclitaxel infusions over several courses in patients receiving paclitaxel weekly or
           every 2-4 weeks with or without neurotoxic chemotherapy.

        -  To investigate the association between paclitaxel-induced acute pain syndrome symptoms
           and eventual chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

        -  To perform exome-sequencing analysis and identify genetic variants that predict
           paclitaxel- induced peripheral neuropathy.

        -  To identify clinical phenotypes associated with paclitaxel toxicity (i.e., acute pain
           syndrome and neuropathy).

        -  To explore whether there are any evident differences between results seen in the
           majority Caucasian population and the minority populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are grouped according to paclitaxel dosing
      schedule (weekly vs every 2-4 weeks) and concurrent use of neurotoxic agent (yes vs no).

      Blood samples are collected at baseline for correlative laboratory studies, including genetic
      biomarker and polymorphism studies.
