    
      ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
      (ERKs) 1/2. ASTX029 has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion
      of this study will assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally. The
      Phase 2 portion will assess preliminary clinical activity in tumors characterized by gene
      aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway that may confer
      sensitivity to ASTX029.
