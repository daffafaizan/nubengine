      radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy 4 weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy. Multiparametric MRI will be performed at baseline, after 3 cycles and after 6
      cycles. If there will be evidence of clinical progression after 3rd cycle, patients can be
      removed from the study and given local therapy, including radical prostatectomy or external
      beam radiotherapy, at the discretion of the patient's physicians. If patients have evidence
      of response, they continue on treatment for a total of 6 cycles. If multiparametric MRI
      demonstrates stable disease an individual risk-benefit analysis has to be performed with
      regard to continuing or to stopping the neoadjuvant treatment since the definition stable
      disease includes patients with â‰¤ 20% tumour shrinkage or tumour progression
