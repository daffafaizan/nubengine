      (omnivor/lacto-ovo-vegetarian/vegan) at baseline and will continue their prescribed
      oncological therapy at their attending physician/clinic.

      Participants provide data (cancer history, tumor behavior, food frequency questionnaires,
      questionnaires referring to quality-of-life) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months with optional
      data entry points at 12 and 124 months and a follow up questionnaire at 12 and 24 months.
      Data is entered online via the study platforms www.essenundkrebs.net and
      www.foodandcancer.net in German and English language (no additional clinical visits are
      required).
