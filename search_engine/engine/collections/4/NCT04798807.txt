      (LOS), and cause of hospitalization of hospitalized patients were recorded. For the
      nutritional assessment all patients were screened with NRS 2002 and SGA within the first days
      of admission to the patients. The primary predictors of interest in our study were the NRS
      2002 and SGA results of patients.
