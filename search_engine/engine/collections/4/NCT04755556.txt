      intensive Bimanual training has proven to be one of the most effective rehabilitation
      training for improving motor. The study determines the effectiveness of routine physical
      therapy with or without home-based intensive bimanual training on coordination of hands and
      daily activities of daily living. A nine months randomized control trial was comprised of
      thirty children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy aged between 4 to 7 years. One group
      received routine physical therapy and the other group received a goal specific bimanual
      training from their parents in their home setting for 3.5 hours per week for 6 weeks
      according to a modified set up. Follow up sessions were done at 6th week. Activities of daily
      living and coordination were measured using Pediatric motor log activity scale and ABILHAND
      respectively.
