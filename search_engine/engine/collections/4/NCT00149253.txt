      dose (orally) of etoricoxib 120 mg (n = 18), etoricoxib 180 mg (n = 17) or placebo (n = 15) 2
      hours before surgery under the same standardized general anesthesia. At the post-anesthetic
      care unit, intravenous morphine titration was given before starting self-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) device. Morphine consumption, pain relief score, sedative score, global evaluation
      score, and side-effects were recorded at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-operatively. The primary
      end points were morphine consumption within 24-hr post-operatively and total pain relief over
      8 h (TOPAR8). Patient global satisfaction was also assessed.
