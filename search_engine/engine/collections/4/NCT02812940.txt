      for Graft-versus-Host Disease following Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide after
      Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (OCTET-EVER)

      Indication: Patients with haematological malignancies after allogeneic haematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation with a matched related or unrelated donor following reduced intensity
      conditioning and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide

      Phase: Phase II clinical study

      Type of study, study design, methodology: Single centre single arm clinical trial, A'Hern's
      single stage phase II procedure

      Number of subjects: 20 (17 total evaluable)

      Primary study objective To assess the efficacy of short-term everolimus as GvHD prophylaxis
      in addition to post-transplantation cyclophosphamide after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in patients with haematological malignancies and to describe the influence of
      the modified immunosuppression concept on the incidence and severity of acute GvHD, relapse
      rates, minimal residual disease, immune reconstitution and chimerism.

      Medical condition or disease to be investigated:

      • Patients with haematological malignancies after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation with a matched related or unrelated donor following reduced intensity
      conditioning and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide

      Name of investigational medicinal product (IMP): Everolimus (Certican®) Investigational
      medicinal product - dosage and method of administration: 1,5mg per os twice a day (target
      blood level 5 to 10ng/ml) from day +5 to day +100 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation

      Duration of treatment: The treatment will be given from day +5 to day +100 after allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation. The observation time will last from day +5 to day +130. Incidence
      of chronic GvHD, overall survival and relapse incidence will be recorded on d+365 and d+720
      after transplant.
