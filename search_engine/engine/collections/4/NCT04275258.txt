    
      This study explores the feasibility, efficacy, and potential sustainability of a
      collaborative pain care/opioid taper strategy for patients discharged to a rural PCP practice
      on opioids after hospitalization for moderate to severe traumatic injury.

      The randomized control study design will provide important pilot data on the efficacy of
      opioid taper in the context of engaged pain management care at the PCP level when the PCP is
      supported by expert consultation and has broad implications for patient and clinician
      education.
