    
      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, controlled study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of TDF 300mg QD versus ADV 10mg QD in Chinese subjects with CHB. Four
      hundred and ninety-four subjects with CHB (200 HBeAg positive subjects and 294 HBeAg negative
      subjects) will be randomised (1:1ratio) to either TDF 300mg QD or ADV 10mg QD treatment arms.
      The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with blood hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) <400copies/mL (Roche COBAS Taqman HBV test) at Week 48 in HBeAg
      positive subjects with CHB and HBeAg negative subjects with CHB. This is a two-part study.
      The first treatment period (baseline to Week 48) will investigate the effects of TDF and ADV
      on safety and efficacy endpoints; dosing will be double-blind. This period will be followed
      by 192 weeks in which all subjects will receive open-label TDF (Week 49 to Week 240).
      Subjects will undergo regular safety and efficacy assessments every 4 weeks for the first 12
      weeks followed by every 12 weeks for a total of up to 5 years.
