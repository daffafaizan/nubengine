      compared with IMV in adult immunocompromised patients with moderate to severe acute
      respiratory failure (ARF). Patients who meet the indications for both ventilatory supports
      will be included. The intervention will consist of randomly allocation, treatment with NIV or
      IMV, concomitant medication. Primary outcome is 30-day hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes
      include in-hospital mortality, length of stay in hospital, improvement of oxygenation,
      nosocomial infections, seven-day organ failure, adverse events of intervention, et al.
      Subgroups with different disease severity, causes of immunodeficiency and types of ARF will
      also be analyzed.
