    
      This is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single-blind, parallel group clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FS Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during
      surgery. Approximately 172 pediatric subjects will be enrolled and will be randomly allocated
      in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups: FS Grifols or EVICEL. Enrollment will be
      monitored by surgery type to ensure at least 50% of the surgical procedures are hepatic.

      A specific bleeding site will be defined as the TBS when it is determined by the investigator
      (the surgeon) that control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques (including suture,
      ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical and requires an adjunct treatment to
      achieve hemostasis.

      When the TBS is identified, the investigator will record the precise anatomical location of
      the TBS, rate the intensity of the bleeding at the TBS (Grade 1-4 according to a 5-point
      validated bleeding severity scale), and record the size of the approximate bleeding surface,
      (small, medium, and large). For soft tissue surgery only, the investigator will also record
      the type of soft tissue (ie, fat, muscle, or connective tissue). In this clinical trial, only
      subjects with a TBS with bleeding of Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) intensity will be
      enrolled.

      This study includes a Screening Visit to determine subject eligibility, a Baseline Visit, the
      Surgical Procedure (Day 1), and Post-operative assessments at Days 1, 4, and 30. The total
      duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be no longer than 2 months
      from the Screening Visit to the Post-operative Day 30 Visit.
