    
      This is a prospective registry allowing a structured, non-interventional collection of data.
      Participating physicians will not be subject to any instructions with regard to the diagnosis
      and therapy of their patients. All patient treatment is carried out within clinical routine,
      at the discretion of the physician and according to existing treatment guidelines.

      This registry will be carried out as an investigator-initiated, multicentre, prospective,
      non-interventional and observational registry at approximately 200 sites in Germany, Austria,
      Switzerland, France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

      The registry will collect clinical data of approximately 2500 patients with CKD (eGFR 15-49
      mL/min per 1.73 m2) and NVAF receiving rivaroxaban, OAC with VKA, or no AC therapy, who are
      prospectively followed for a flexible duration with at least for 12 months (for the last
      enrolled patient) and with an estimated mean of 18 months for the whole study cohort.

      It is planned to include 1000 patients with rivaroxaban therapy and VKA therapy,
      respectively. Enrolment can be prolonged beyond 2500 patients until 1000 rivaroxaban patients
      are enrolled.
