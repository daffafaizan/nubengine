      toxicity of oral SCH 66336 with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced
      malignancy. II. Assess the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral SCH 66336 when administered
      with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium. III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of fluorouracil
      when administered with oral SCH 66336. IV. Assess antitumor activity of oral SCH 66336 with
      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of SCH 66336. Patients receive oral SCH 66336 twice
      daily for 56 days. Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 1-2 minutes immediately
      followed by fluorouracil IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Courses repeat
      every 56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of SCH 66336. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the
      dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during
      course 1, with at least 2 patients experiencing DLT at the next higher level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
