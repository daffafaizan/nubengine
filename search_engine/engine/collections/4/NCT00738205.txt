    
      An international, multicenter cross-sectional study (Observatoire des pratiques médicales®)
      involving a cohort of children treated with Saizen®, a growth hormone.

      The study does not require any changes to the usual medical management of these patients and
      should not be considered detrimental to their physical or psychological integrity. No
      specific procedures or examinations will be requested, nor does the protocol require any
      particular treatment or follow-up visits.
