      other secondary conditions and increasing quality of life. People with mobility limitations
      have a higher level of physical inactivity resulting from numerous personal and environmental
      barriers to physical activity participation. This project will evaluate the feasibility of
      increasing physical activity among overweight individuals with mobility limitations through
      physician-referrals to a personalized exercise programme at the Chicago-based National Center
      on Physical Activity and Disability (NCPAD).
