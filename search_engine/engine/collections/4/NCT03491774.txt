      in Pakistan particularly older adults mental health services are almost nonexistent.
      According to a recent report in Pakistan currently 8 million people are of age 65 and above
      who have long term physical and psychological health conditions. This is a tough challenge
      for the country due to its poor economic condition.Hence, there is a need to develop programs
      that can help and improve the health-related quality of life of this population in low
      resource settings.We need to do a lot more work to address this issue.

      One possible low-cost, accessible, non-pharmacological intervention for BPSD (Behavioral
      Psychiatric symptoms of dementia) is the Montessori approach which is evidence based.The aim
      of the proposed project is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using the
      Montessori intervention for people with dementia in Pakistan.
