    
      randomised double-blind cross-over study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application
      of a 0.2% morphine solution in patients suffering from radio- and/or chemotherapy induced
      oral mucositis. 60 patients will be included. Randomly assigned to either the morphine
      solution or a placebo mouthwash, they receive the first three days one of the solutions and
      then are switched over to the other treatment for three more days. General basic oral care is
      offered to all of the patients. Efficacy of treatment will be measured with a self-assessment
      pain scale. Doses of systemic opioids and other symptoms (appetite, dysphagia) will also be
      measured. If patient's don't receive systemic opioids, serum concentrations of morphine will
      be measured.
