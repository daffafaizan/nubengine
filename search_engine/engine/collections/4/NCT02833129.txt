      Wisconsin high schools in 1957 to investigate the link between playing high-school football
      and later life depression and cognitive impairment. The WLS has a number of attractive
      features that make it well-suited for such a study. First, it records whether study
      participants participated in high school football and also includes detailed measurements of
      later-life mental health, psychological well-being, and cognition. Second, it includes a rich
      set of baseline covariates which the investigators will use to construct matched sets of
      treated and control individuals, including family background, adolescent characteristics,
      educational and occupational achievement and aspirations. Third, the WLS is one of the few
      longitudinal data sets that includes an administrative measure of childhood cognition. In
      short, the WLS provides a large data set that facilitates comparing the later life mental
      health and cognitive ability of men who played high school football to those who did not,
      after carefully controlling for a range of potential confounders. The investigators will
      compare the primary outcomes of the treated subjects to the primary outcomes of the control
      subjects, after controlling for baseline covariates via full matching with a propensity score
      caliper. The primary outcomes are depression (modified CES-D score) and cognitive functioning
      (average of z-scores for letter fluency and delayed word recall) when participants are age
      65. Secondary outcomes that include cognitive scores on various domains, the Spielberger
      anger index, the Spielberger anxiety index and a hostility index will also be analyzed.
