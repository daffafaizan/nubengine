      now become mainstay, especially with the advent of minimally invasive procedures .

      To facilitate optimal recovery after extubation; muscle strength is vital to prevent
      reintubation, improved deglutition and quicker transition to lower oxygen requirements, and
      better respiratory and cardiac hemodynamics. It also expedites de-escalation of acuity of
      care. Several studies have shown residual muscle weakness after full reversal with
      neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Sugammadex is a direct reversal agent and can provide
      superior muscle strength, which optimizes respiratory function thereby preventing
      atelectasis, hypoxia and potentially avoiding reintubation.
