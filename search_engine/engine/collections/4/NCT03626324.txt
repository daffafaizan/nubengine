      standard-of-care urinary catheters. The C2P is fully internal, urethral indwelling urinary
      prosthesis designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders
      requiring catheterization, including NLUTD. The C2P is a sterile, single-extended use device
      that resides fully internally to the male lower urinary tract for an intended service life of
      up to 29 days per catheter
