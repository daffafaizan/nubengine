      Singapore and worldwide. CKD patients often suffer with inadequately controlled hypertension,
      the presence of which is associated with cardiovascular complications such as left
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, cardiac failure, and stroke. As such, novel treatments are
      required to improve blood pressure control in order to improve health outcomes in CKD
      patients.

      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) using transient limb ischaemia/reperfusion has been shown
      to protect the kidney and microvasculature in experimental and clinical studies, and daily
      episodes of RIC (termed chronic RIC or CRIC) applied for 1 to 12 months have been shown to
      lower systemic blood pressure (SBP), prevent stroke and reduce post-myocardial infarction
      left ventricular (LV) remodelling in experimental and clinical studies. Whether CRIC can
      reduce SBP in hypertensive patients with CKD is not known. In the ERIC-BP-CKD feasibility and
      efficacy study, we hypothesise that CRIC administered for 28 days will lower systemic blood
      pressure and improve blood pressure control in patients with CKD and hypertension.

      In this study, subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive therapy from either the
      active autoRIC® Device or identical sham autoRIC® Device.
