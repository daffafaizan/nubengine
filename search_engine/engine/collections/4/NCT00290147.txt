      countries in the South Pacific, Asia, the Caribbean, and Africa. The disease often presents
      with high fever, severe headache, and joint/muscle pain that usually goes away on its own,
      but it can also present as a sometimes deadly hemorrhagic (bleeding) disease. Humans catch
      this disease by being bitten by mosquitoes that have been infected with dengue virus.
      Scientists at the Naval Medical Research Center have been working on vaccines to prevent
      dengue disease. This vaccine, referred to as D1ME, is an experimental DNA vaccine that
      contains genes from the dengue-1 virus. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a
      new experimental vaccine against dengue and to see if the vaccine can stimulate the immune
      system.
