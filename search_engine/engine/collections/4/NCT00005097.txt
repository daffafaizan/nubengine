      (Polyphenon E topical ointment) in causing complete clinical and histopathologic regression
      in patients with actinic keratoses. II. Determine duration of treatment with Polyphenon E
      necessary to cause regression in these patients. III. Describe pathophysiologic and molecular
      alterations in actinic keratoses and sun damaged skin that are not present in skin that is
      not sun damaged in these patients. IV. Determine the effects of this treatment on biomarkers
      for skin cancer in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. One of the patient's
      arms is randomized to receive topical epigallocatechin gallate (Polyphenon E), the other arm
      to receive a placebo. Patients receive topical applications daily for 12 weeks, or until
      resolution of all actinic keratoses within the treatment field.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study over 10 months.
