      Most previous studies have focused on questionnaire surveys, and on the
      emotional/psychological aspect of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It has been shown
      that bariatric surgery can affect reproductive ability, but the relationship between hormonal
      changes and HRQoL has been sparsely studied.

      Hormone balance is affected by fat allocation, insulin levels and liver function, and these
      factors are all influenced postoperatively. Also body image and altered body mass composition
      can influence sexuality in diverse ways.

      This leads us to theorize that liver production of SHBG will change after surgery and impact
      serum concentrations of sex hormones. Normalized levels of testosterone and estrogen may lead
      to reduced symptoms of hyperandrogenism, restitution of normal menstrual cycles and changes
      in sexual functioning.

      The focus of this study is to analyze sexual and health-related quality of life through
      questionnaire analyses, and to investigate levels of sex hormones pre- and postoperatively in
      women undergoing bariatric surgery. Results from questionnaire analyses and hormone data will
      be tested for possible correlations.
