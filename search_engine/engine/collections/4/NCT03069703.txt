      Experimental plan This is a comparative, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open label,
      phase 2 trial in France, comparing two innovative "reinforced" anti-pneumococcal vaccine
      strategies to standard vaccination regimen in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides
      receiving rituximab therapy.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to three parallel arms to receive:

        -  Arm A (standard vaccination regimen): prime-boost strategy combining a single dose of
           13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar, PCV13) at Day 0 (lying within a
           window of ± 2 days of the first infusion of rituximab), followed by a single dose of
           23-valent unconjugated vaccine (Pneumovax, PPV23) at month 5 (M5)

        -  Arm B (innovative vaccine strategy 1): prime-boost strategy combining 2 doses of PCV13
           at Day 0 and 2 doses of PCV13 at Day 7, followed by a single dose of PPV23 at M5

        -  Arm C (innovative vaccine strategy 2): prime-boost strategy combining 4 doses of PCV13
           at Day 0, followed by a single dose of PPV23 at M5

      All participants will receive rituximab at 375 mg/m2/week for 4 consecutive weeks, at Days 0
      ± 2 days, Day 7 ± 2 days, Day 14 ± 2 days and Day 21 ± 2 days, as induction therapy of
      vasculitis flare, followed by 500 mg-rituximab infusion every 6 months as maintenance
      therapy, i.e. at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 18 (Stone, NEJM, 2010, Jones, NEJM, 2010;
      Guillevin, NEJM, 2014), as recommended.

      Day 0 will be defined as the first vaccine injection (within ± 2 days of the first infusion
      of rituximab).

      PCV13 vaccine injections will be performed at Day 0, and at Day 7 ± 1 day in the Arm B. PPV23
      injections will be performed at M5 ± 7 days in all arms.

      Analysis of immune responses will be performed in a centralized laboratory blinded for the
      trial arm, by ELISA at Day 0 (pre-vaccination sample), M1, M5, M6, M12, and M18 for the 12
      serotypes common to both conjugate and unconjugated vaccines, by OPA at Day 0, M6, M12, and
      M18 for the 12 serotypes common to both conjugate and unconjugated vaccines, and by ELISA at
      Day 0 and M6 for the 3 specific serotypes of PPV23.

      Safety monitoring Relevant adverse events related to vaccination will be continuously
      monitored throughout the trial, and pausing rules have been specified in the protocol that
      trigger an ad-hoc iDSMB meeting in case of any safety concern

      Number of participating centres

      This multicenter research will involve the participation of the French Vasculitis Study Group
      (FVSG) network, which includes more than 100 clinical departments involved in the management
      of ANCA-associated vasculitides.

      As previous trials conducted by the FVSG on this topic, around 50 centers will participate in
      the PNEUMOVAS research.

      Randomization Participants who fulfill all eligibility criteria for the study will be
      enrolled and randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 between the three different parallel arms.

      Randomization will be stratified on: personal history of PPV23 injection and age (≥ 65 or <
      65 years).

      Blinding methods and provisions put in place to maintain blinding

      Trial participants and site staff are not blinded to the vaccine arm. The central laboratory
      performing the immunogenicity assessment (ELISA and OPA) will be blinded for the trial arm in
      order to limit measurement bias.
