      assume a disease detection of 4.5% with acetic acid chromoendoscopy and 1.5% with protocol
      driven mapping biopsies. However, these assumptions are largely driven from a single centre
      cohort study and as such need clarification before they could be used for the purposes of
      powering a study. Based on the historical cohort studies and wide consultation within the
      British Society of Gastroenterology research committee and consultation with experts in the
      field, it is estimated that 200 patients would be reasonable for recruitment to enable the
      reproducibility and generalisability of this data to be established. The purpose of this
      study is not to produce statistically significant data in itself but to establish likely
      event rates and effect size to inform the power calculation for the definitive study.
