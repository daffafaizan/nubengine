    
      An open label multicentric Phase 1 study of oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor P7170 in patients with
      advanced refractory solid tumors.The study will follow an Accelerated Titration Design (ATD)
      with 100% dose increments until significant toxicity as described below; followed by standard
      dose titration with 40% dose increments. Dose and schedule (alternate dosing regimen eg. OD,
      BID, intermittent) will be determined by the dose escalation outlined in the protocol and
      considering pharmacokinetics of the study drug determined from earlier cohorts.
