      65-80 years as determined by sample size calculation below) recruited from the Salt Lake City
      area. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Protection of Human Subjects.
      Outpatient blood screening, including an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test, and bed rest
      experiments will take place in the University Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences
      (CCTS), a clinical service supported by an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award. The
      CCTS medical supervising physician oversees procedures. Participants will arrive at the CCTS
      fasted on Day 1 and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study will be performed as done
      previously with this unit. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies will be obtained before and three
      hours after the clamp. Periodic blood samples will be obtained as part of the clamp procedure
      for measurement of insulin and glucose. Muscle samples will be either cultured or
      flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for later analysis. After completion of the first
      insulin clamp experiment (Day 1), subjects will adhere to 5-days of strict bed rest as this
      is a clinically-relevant time frame for older adults hospitalized for acute medical illness,
      as well as being sufficient to induced insulin resistance. Established safety and comfort
      guidelines will be followed as done previously. On Day 5, after an overnight fast, a second
      insulin clamp study will be conducted and muscle biopsies will be again obtained.
