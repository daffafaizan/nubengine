      therapy on pain intensity at rest, functional disability, lumbar movement and ability to
      perform repositioning tasks (joint position sense) in patients with subacute non-specific low
      back pain. There are 2 groups receiving 2 different kinds of intervention: treatment group
      receiving core stabilization exercise (CSE) and control group receiving physical therapy
      including therapeutic ultrasound and hydrocollator pack. Each intervention will perform for 7
      weeks. The patients will assess for all outcome measures at baseline, 7 weeks of
      intervention, and 1- month follow-up
