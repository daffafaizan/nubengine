      osteorarthritis and degenerative disc disease. Anti-inflammatory components include
      inhibitors of matrix metalloproteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and
      interleukins. The product has low immunogenicity and is hypo-osmotic.2 Placental tissues,
      including amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and chorion are regulated as human cell and
      tissue products (HCTP) by the FDA. This regulation allows clinicians to use the allograft
      materials for human injection. AlloGen-LI is derived from placental tissues obtained from
      carefully screened healthy mothers at the time of scheduled cesarean section. The mothers
      have agreed to donate the tissues, which would otherwise be discarded. The experimental
      treatment would entail an injection of one dose of AlloGen-LI and marcaine into the epidural
      space under CT guidance, in an identical manner to traditional epidural steroid /marcaine
      injections.
