      type 2 diabetes. In addition, these programmes may favourably affect several other
      cardiovascular risk factors in these subjects. However, it still remains unclear how this
      evidence can be transferred into clinical practice, considering the very large number of
      diabetic patients and the characteristics of this population, made up predominantly of
      elderly, sedentary and overweight patients. In this regard, a realistic approach to this
      issue requires simple and easily available intervention models.

      Walking is a typical mild-moderate aerobic physical activity which is easy to organize and
      does not require specific skills or preliminary sophisticated medical evaluations. This
      activity could therefore fit well with the need of involvement of large numbers of patients
      in different logistic situations. However, it has been reported that, due to the low walking
      speed typical of type 2 diabetic subjects, self-paced walking is inadequate to obtain a
      significant metabolic improvement in these subjects.
