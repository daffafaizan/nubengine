      to assist in movement. Providing physical assistance may improve the flow of proprioceptive
      information to the nervous system, which may help a person relearn to move a limb. On the
      other hand, assisting movement with a robot may cause a person to "slack", not trying as hard
      during therapy. This study will test the effect of different levels of assistance on recovery
      of finger function during robot-assisted therapy after stroke.
