      promotes the development of donor-specific regulation which in turn allows for long-term
      maintenance therapy with a single drug (Myfortic) in selected patients leading to superior
      long-term outcomes. Subjects will be enrolled post-transplantation and will be liver
      transplant recipients who meet the eligibility and exclusion criteria. We will use
      post-transplant monitoring for donor-specific immunologic regulation (DSR+/ DSA negative) to
      direct the withdrawal of patients to Myfortic monotherapy. Donor microchimerism, DSR, DSA
      development will be performed on samples obtained every six months from patients on study.
      The ultimate objective of the study is to use immunologic monitoring to develop a rational
      approach to achieving individualized immunosuppression for liver transplant patients.
