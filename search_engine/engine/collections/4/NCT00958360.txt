      trial is to determine if the Interdisciplinary Team approach to low vision service delivery
      is more effective than the Basic Low Vision Service in improving visual reading ability for
      330 veterans with macular diseases and best corrected visual acuity of 20/50-20/200.
      Effectiveness will be measured with the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning
      Questionnaire (VA LV VFQ-48), a valid and reliable questionnaire that is administered by
      telephone to capture changes in patients' self-report of their difficulty reading and
      performing other daily living activities affected by visual impairment before and after
      rehabilitation. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of changes in patients' visual
      reading ability on the VA LV VFQ-48 after they receive low vision care from the
      Interdisciplinary Team or Basic Low Vision Care program. The secondary outcome measures are
      comparisons of changes in other VA LV VFQ-48 visual ability scores (overall, mobility, visual
      information processing, visual motor skills). Hypothesis: The improvement in visual reading
      ability measured with the VA LV VFQ-48 will be larger for patients who received low vision
      services from the Interdisciplinary Team than for patients who received the Basic Low Vision
      Service. Specific Aims:(1) Compare the mean changes in patients' visual reading ability
      (estimated from patients' difficulty ratings of reading items on the VA LV VFQ-48 before and
      after low vision service delivery) in the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Care
      Programs.(2) Compare the mean changes in visual ability [patients' difficulty ratings of
      other items on the VA LV VFQ-48 (mobility, visual information processing, visual motor
      skills) before and after low vision service delivery] in the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic
      Low Vision Care programs.(3). Identify the characteristics of patients who benefit from the
      Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Service. (4). Conduct an economic evaluation to
      compare the costs and cost effectiveness of the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision
      Service.
