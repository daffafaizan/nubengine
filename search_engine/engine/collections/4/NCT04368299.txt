      study will be performed at the Rheumatology clinics at the Prince of Wales Hospital, which is
      a regional hospital in Hong Kong.

      From May to October 2020, all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of SLE according to the
      2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification
      criteria will be invited to participate in the study if they are aged >18 years, able to
      speak or understand Chinese and are willing to come back for routine blood and urine tests
      [18]. Patients (or carers) need to possess the technology needed to conduct a TM visit - a
      smartphone, tablet, or computer. Patients will be excluded if they are pregnant or incapable
      of answering a questionnaire. Patients will be randomization to either TM (TM group) or
      standard follow-ups (SF group 1). Patients who refused to be randomized will be offered
      standard in-person outpatient follow-up (SF group 2). All patients who fulfill the inclusion
      criteria and have given written informed consent will be asked to complete the Systemic Lupus
      Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ), LupusPRO, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index
      (HAQ-DI), Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Scale (version 4) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS). They will also be asked to rate the confidence to the mode of care on a 10-point
      Likert scale (0 = not at all confident to 10 = very much confident). Their demographic,
      socio-economic and clinical data will be collected. Patient will be randomized in a ratio of
      1:1 to either TM group or SF group 1 using a computer-generated random number sequence.
