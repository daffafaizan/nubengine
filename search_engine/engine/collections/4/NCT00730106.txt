      and without alarm symptoms in Taiwan During the period from May 2008 to December 2009,
      consecutive adult outpatients, who receive upper endoscopy for characteristic reflux symptoms
      of heartburn or acid regurgitation, are invited to participate. All study participants are
      evaluated for presence of pre-defined alarm symptoms including odynophagia or dysphagia,
      gastrointestinal bleeding, involuntary body weight loss and anemia.

      Upper endoscopic procedures are performed with standard electronic videoendoscope (GIF-Q240
      or GIF-Q260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by experienced endoscopists; each of them had previously
      performed a minimum of 2,000 upper endoscopy exams. Representative images are taken and
      stored as electronic files in a digital image system for later analysis.

      The following five significant endoscopic findings are pre-defined endpoints of this study:
      1) any malignant lesion in the upper digestive tract, 2) Barrett esophagus, 3) severe erosive
      esophagitis (LA grade C or D), 4) peptic stricture, 5) peptic ulcer.
