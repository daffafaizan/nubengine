    
      Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a new class of therapeutics for the treatment
      of Type 2 diabetes. The investigational drug, HE3286, holds the potential to be the first in
      a new class of insulin sensitizers with a potentially novel mechanism of action that may
      improve the current therapeutic options available to a T2DM patient.

      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety,
      tolerance and activity of HE3286 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients
      receiving stable metformin or who are drug-naive will receive study treatment (HE3286 or
      placebo) for a treatment period of 12-weeks. Changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be
      assessed over a treatment period of 12-weeks.
