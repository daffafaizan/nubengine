      education delivered remotely to women who had a screening mammogram. The effect of TMD with
      SSE education will be assessed with a randomized control trial among women served by
      Northwestern Medicine in rural, suburban and metropolitan communities. Women who identify
      concerning moles will choose among three options: a) watch the mole to see if the border,
      color or diameter of the mole changes b) send a picture of the mole to the PI for
      consideration of mole self-sampling, or c) make an appointment with my healthcare provider to
      check the mole. As required a physician will supervise women, who will perform non-invasive
      mole self-sampling with non-invasive adhesive patches for genomic analysis of the concerning
      pigmented lesion (mole). If the genomic analysis suggests that the concerning mole may be a
      melanoma, then the recommendation will be to have the mole biopsied.The effectiveness of
      acquired samples suggestive of melanoma will be examined by the obtaining the pathology
      reports of biopsied moles. Health care providers' (HCPs) clinical/pathologic assessment of
      concerning moles will be identified in the Northwestern Medicine electronic health record
      (EHR) system.
