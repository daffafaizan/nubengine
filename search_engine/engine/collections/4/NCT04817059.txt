      of sMRI and fMRI scans. One scan set was collected using the head mold and the other without,
      and the scans were counterbalanced in order across participants. Using a specialized sMRI
      sequence embedded with vNAVs, we directly measured head motion during sMRI in order to more
      accurately evaluate the head mold's impact on structural metrics. To evaluate the feasibility
      and tolerability of the head mold, we concluded the scanning sessions with a brief interview
      that gauged participants' scanning experience and tolerance of the head mold. We investigated
      whether head molds would reduce head motion compared to standard scanning procedures and
      whether those reductions would result in improved data quality. We also tested the extent to
      which reductions in head motion impacted estimations of cortical volume and functional
      connectivity. Prior to data collection, we evaluated the noise dosage levels of the head mold
      condition, given the limited space available for additional hearing protection devices in the
      head coil while the head mold is on. We also assessed whether the head molds could balance
      head motion between typical and ADHD populations, and whether clinical variables such as ADHD
      diagnosis and trait anxiety, as determined by parent-reported dimensional measures, can
      predict head mold efficacy.
