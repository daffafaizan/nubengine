    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) delivered autologous CS1-CAR
      T cells for research participants with CS1+ recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rates at days 28, 100, and 180 post CAR T cell infusion.

      II. Measure the persistence of CS1-CAR T cells in blood and marrow. III. Measure phenotype
      and anti-tumor functionality of CS1-CAR T cells in marrow and blood.

      IV. Measure the levels of cytokines in blood and marrow, and soluble CS-1 in blood post
      infusion as a surrogate indicator of CAR T cell activity.

      V. Evaluate CS-1 expression on MM cancer cells before, during and at progressive disease (PD)
      to determine antigenic loss.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Describe the percentage of MM cells that express CS-1 surface marker before, during and at
      PD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CS1-CAR T cells.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis over 2-4 hours. Beginning 3-4 weeks, patients receive
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3 or fludarabine IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3. Patients then undergo CS1-CAR T therapy over 10-15
      minutes on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 day, at least every 2 days
      for up to a minimum of 14 days, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, then periodically for
      up to 15 years.
