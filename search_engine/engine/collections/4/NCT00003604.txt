      resected stage III or IV renal cancer treated with interleukin-2. II. Measure the degree of
      rebound lymphocytosis generated by this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive interleukin-2 IV over 15-30 minutes on
      3 consecutive days weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients receive 2
      treatment courses, each 8 weeks in duration. Patients are followed every 6 months until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued within 1 to 2 years.
