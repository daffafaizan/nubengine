      patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
      shunt), and compare the prognostic power with TPMT (transverse psoas muscle thickness).
      Furthermore, the role of myosteatosis, determined in CT by L3-SMI, MRI and ultrasound will be
      studied.
