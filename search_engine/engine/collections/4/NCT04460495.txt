      I. Determine the safety, feasibility, and sensitivity of oxygen-enhanced molecular magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy volunteers.

      II. Measure oxygen-enhanced molecular MRI characteristics in human brain tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scan and amine chemical exchange
      saturation transfer spin-and-gradient echo echo-planar imaging using amine proton CEST echo
      spin-and-gradient echo (SAGE) EPI (CEST-SAGE-EPI) while breathing normal room air (21%
      oxygen). Patients then undergo another ASL MRI and CEST-SAGE-EPI while breathing medical
      grade air (100% oxygen). Total ASL MRI and CEST-SAGE-EPI imaging scan time is 60 minutes.
