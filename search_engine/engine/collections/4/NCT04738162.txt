      Agency (EMA) (brand name: Gliolan®) for "the visualization of malignant tissue during surgery
      for malignant glioma (WHO III and IV) in adults." Similarly, approval for 5-ALA was granted
      by the FDA in 2017 as an "optical imaging agent indicated in patients with gliomas (suspected
      World Health Organization Grades III or IV on preoperative imaging) as an adjunct for the
      visualization of malignant tissue during surgery" (brand name: Gliolan®). Goal of the study
      is to investigate if the use of 5-ALA is safe in children and get preliminary information on
      the type of paediatric brain tumors which are suitable for fluorescence-guided resection with
      5-ALA.
