      of young children. We aim to conduct a cluster-randomised controlled trial in the Mkushi
      region of rural Zambia to test whether feeding children two daily meals containing Î²-carotene
      biofortified maize flour compared to regular white maize flour-based meals for six months can
      reduce the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and improve the vitamin A status among 4-8 year
      old children. Five hundred children in each arm will receive 2 meals a day, 6 days a week for
      6 months, after which changes in serum retinol concentrations will be compared. An additional
      arm of 250 children, enrolled from randomly sampled clusters, will not receive the maize
      flour intervention but concurrently followed in order to evaluate overall effects of the
      maize flour feeding scheme on measures of household food security.
