      diverticulitis with peritonitis is a feared complication and standard treatment (primary
      sigmoid resection such as Hartmann's procedure) still has unsatisfactory results. Both
      mortality and morbidity are quite high. Several uncontrolled trials have reported a lower
      mortality and morbidity when acute perforated diverticulitis is treated with laparoscopic
      lavage instead of radical surgery. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized multicenter
      trial in Scandinavia in order to compare the rates of severe postoperative complications in
      acute perforated diverticulitis if treated by traditional primary sigmoid resection or by
      laparoscopic lavage. The investigators are planning to include all patients admitted to the
      participating hospitals with clinical and radiological findings of acute perforated
      diverticulitis.
