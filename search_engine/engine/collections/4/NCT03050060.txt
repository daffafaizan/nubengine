      Beginning 7-14 days prior to start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab, patients
      receive nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 or 1-14 (dependent upon
      when treatment is started) up to 11-12 weeks. Patients also receive pembrolizumab, nivolumab
      or atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21-28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      hypofractionated radiation therapy over 3-14 days starting after cycle 1 and before cycle 3
      of pembrolizumab, nivolumab or atezolizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 2 years.
