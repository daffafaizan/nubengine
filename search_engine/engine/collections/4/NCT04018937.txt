      sickle cell disease (SCD) is evolving. Because of the low risk for graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) associated with younger age, HSCT is increasingly being performed prior to
      adolescence. The use of less gonadotoxic reduced intensity regimens (RIC) are more commonly
      be utilized to lessen the risk for infertility. Finally, with the recognition that most
      children, even those with relatively mild courses, will develop debilitating morbidities as
      adults and ultimately suffer an early death, HSCT is being offered to children across a wider
      spectrum of SCD severity. Long reserved for severely affected children, HSCT is being
      performed for a growing number of less severely affected children.

      This trial is designed to prospectively assess HSCT under these conditions. Eligibility will
      be limited to children less than 10 years of age who have an HLA MSD who is also less than 10
      years. A RIC regimen - fludarabine, alemtuzumab and melphalan (FAM) - will be employed.
      Finally, SCD severity criteria will be broadened to include less several affected children as
      well as those who are severely affected.

      This study has the following two specific aims:

      Specific Aim #1: To prospectively assess the safety and efficacy of HSCT using FAM
      conditioning in children with SCD of varying severity who are under 10 years of age.

      Specific Aim #2: To address current gaps in our understanding of the long-term effects of
      HSCT in children with SCD, by longitudinally assessing sickle cell related cerebrovascular
      disease, sickle cell related nephropathy and health related quality of life.
