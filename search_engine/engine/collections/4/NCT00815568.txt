      hematological malignancies involves conditioning with high doses of systemic chemo/radiation
      therapy such as cyclophosphamide (CY) plus 1200 or 1000 cGy total body irradiation (TBI;
      CY/TBI) or busulfan (Bu) / CY (BuCy). Unfortunately, such regimens have been associated with
      significant toxicities, limiting their use to otherwise healthy, relatively young patients.

      Recently, Fludarabine plus 4 day dose of busulfan (FluBu4) containing myeloablative regimen
      has been introduced successfully without increasing transplant-related mortality (TRM). To
      improve transplant outcomes without increasing the risk of recurrence, Russell et al
      introduced 400cGy of TBI with antithymocyte (ATG, 4.5mg/Kg) into FluBu4 regimen with
      successful outcomes.
