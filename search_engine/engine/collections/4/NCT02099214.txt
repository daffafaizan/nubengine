      HHC became quite low. As such, the interest towards the initial diagnosis and cardiological
      follow-up has been lesser. A subclinical myocardial iron overload can nevertheless exist and
      eventually lead to functional consequences in the medium and long term if neglected, even
      evolve into heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.

      The expected aftermath of this study is :

        -  The estimation of the frequency of myocardial iron overload measured by 3 Tesla MRI in
           patient with HFE hereditary haemochromatosis;

        -  The assessment of its consequences on heart function;

        -  The appreciation of a cardiological assessment strategy in patients with HFE hereditary
           haemochromatosis.
