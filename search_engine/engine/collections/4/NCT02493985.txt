      neuroophthalmological abnormalities suggesting elevated intracranial pressure. There is
      currently no suitable ground based analog to simulate these changes on Earth, or a standard
      methodological approach to monitoring the combined effects of head down tilt and atmospheric
      carbon dioxide. Given that carbon dioxide and cephalad fluid shifting are known factors in
      spaceflight, we sought to evaluate an approach to monitoring these effects in healthy subject
      in a ground based analog on Earth.
