      delivering NIV to term and preterm infants. Different interfaces have been used, most
      frequently binasal prongs or mask. The RAM cannula is a relatively new interface for
      delivering CPAP in preterm infants, specially to avoid nasal injury and discomfort. However,
      there are few studies in artificial models with different results in term of the percentage
      of pressure that is really delivered when we use the RAM cannula. The objective of this study
      is to to investigate in VLBW preterm infants who require respiratory support by nasal CPAP,
      whether or not using the RAM cannula as the interface will allow to provide the level of
      respiratory support equivalent to that with the traditional binasal prongs, measured by
      diaphragm electrical activity (Edi). The investigators hypothesize that in VLBW preterm
      infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), the use of CPAP with RAM cannula as the
      interface may provide lower PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure) than set and increased
      resistance to gas flow, leading to increased respiratory effort for the patient as reflected
      by an increase in Edi.

      This study will help Neonatologist determine if the amount of support provided with the RAM
      cannula as interface is equivalent to the support we achieve with the standard interfaces, to
      select the patients that could benefit from using this interface. The investigators will be
      able to utilize this information to decide on the most appropriate respiratory support
      modality for preterm patients.
