    
      Patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and receiving cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) in terms of advanced life support (ALS) in the city of Vienna, Austria,
      will be included. A special study team will be dispatched to the event sites by the ambulance
      service. Trained study fellows will include patients by placing NIRS optodes on the patients'
      forehead as soon as possible during and/or after CPR. Measurements will continue until 72h
      post return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or the patient's death.
