      subjective effects (i.e., Product Liking [PL], Overall Intent to Use Again [OIUA], Product
      Effects [PE], Urge to Smoke [UTS], and Overall Product Liking [OPL]), plasma nicotine uptake,
      and physiological measures (blood pressure and heart rate) during and following ad libitum
      use of the following five IPs by healthy subjects. Subjects will be evaluated in five
      separate Test Sessions and the active period of each Test Session will last for approximately
      4 hours during and following IP use.
