    
      In patients with persistent essential systolic hypertension,who are undergoing assessment of
      their current pharmaceutical burden for blood pressure control, a digital health offering is
      used (1) to provide automatic and passive electronic documentation of medication adherence
      and patterns of medication taking, (2) to assist providers in distinguishing inadequate
      medication adherence or pharmacologic unresponsiveness as the root cause for persistent
      hypertension, and (3) to inform management decisions (dose adjustment, medication addition or
      substitution, adherence counseling, referral to a hypertension specialist).

      Participating patients wear an adhesive Wearable Sensor ("Patch") continuously with
      replacement after one week, and ingest an inert tablet ("Pill") containing an Ingestible
      Sensor daily whenever they take their prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs.

      The Patch automatically detects and records the dates and times of each "Pill" ingestion,
      daily step count, sleep duration and sleep interruptions, and the circadian pattern of rest
      and activity. After completion of each Patch's use, the recorded data are downloaded and
      incorporated into a report that includes blood pressures that are obtained at the time of
      clinic visits at the beginning and after 2 weeks of service use.

      The final report is generated automatically and provided electronically to practitioners for
      review with their patient. The information that is obtained is incorporated by practitioners
      in advising next steps for blood pressure management.
