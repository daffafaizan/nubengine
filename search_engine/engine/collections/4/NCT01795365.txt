      Primary

      - To evaluate the equivalence of the time on active surveillance before an active treatment
      between group Epstein + and the expanded active surveillance group (Epstein -)

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) in the initial diagnosis and the
           follow-up of patients under active surveillance

        -  To evaluate the role of BCAR-1 to predict the clinical outcome of localized prostate
           cancer

        -  To evaluate the proportion of patients who discontinued active surveillance

        -  To evaluate the mortality at 10, 15 and 20 years from the inclusion in the study

        -  To evaluate the time to radical treatment

        -  To evaluate the time to metastatic disease

        -  To evaluate patients quality of life
