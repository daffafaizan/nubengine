      to the standard of care. To the investigators knowledge, there is no similar protocol and
      this will be a single center, pilot study. The control arm will consist of subjects who meet
      the inclusion criteria for the study and will receive current standard of care management for
      paramalignant pleural effusion. This will consist of either an indwelling pleural catheter
      (IPC) placement with subsequent talc slurry administration and hospital admission for
      continuous drainage, or schedule medical pleuroscopy with talc insufflation poudrage and
      subsequent IPC placement for continuous drainage while in the hospital. The intervention arm
      will consist of subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and then will be scheduled for IPC
      placement in the pulmonary procedure unit as either an outpatient visit or during their
      hospital admission (if the subject is already admitted to the hospital and recruited via our
      inpatient consult service). The subjects in this arm will then go home or back to their
      original admission status with a drainage bag for continuous drainage on the same day as the
      procedure. This protocol will utilize a circuit with an IPC connected to a continuous
      drainage bag via a one-way Heimlich valve. It is important to note that while utilizing this
      circuit is a new protocol for patients with paramalignant pleural effusions, the protocol is
      the current standard of care practice for patients with pneumothorax and persistent air leak,
      and is being utilized regularly for these patients by the investigator's department as
      standard of care for patient needing long-term chest tubes while at home.
