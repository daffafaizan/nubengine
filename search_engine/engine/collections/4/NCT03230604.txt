      cavities will be incrementally layered with resin composite and each increment will be cured
      as directed by the manufacturer with the light curing unit (Bluephase Style
      Ivoclar-Vivadent), with an energy 1,100 mW/cm² (±50 mw/cm²) and others group of cavities will
      be restored by bulk fill composite (3M ESPE) and other bulk fill composite (
      IVOCLAR-VIVADENT) as one increment then will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with
      the light curing unit.

      The study will investigate the clinical performance and efficacy of a bulk-filled composite
      resin restorative material for a period of 5 years
