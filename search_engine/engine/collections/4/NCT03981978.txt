      measurements, physical activity data through an accelerometer worn on the wrist and indirect
      physical activity measures via the Human Activity Profile and Godin self-report
      questionnaires. We will collect clinical information from the medical record including
      predictors of physical activity level in obesity such as nutritional lab and co-morbid
      conditions.
