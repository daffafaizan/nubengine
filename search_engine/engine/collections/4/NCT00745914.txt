      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Non-traditional risk factors such
      as inflammation and insulin resistance have important contributions to accelerated
      atherosclerosis in ESRD patients receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of
      ligand-dependent transcription factors. Activation of the PPAR-g has been shown in both
      clinical and experimental studies to have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic
      properties other than insulin-sensitizing effects. Recent study also showed that PPAR-g
      agonists reduce plaque inflammation by inhibiting the activation of proinflammatory genes
      responsible for plaque development and growth. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects
      of PPAR-g activation on the progression of carotid plaque in diabetic ESRD patients receiving
      long-term PD using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
