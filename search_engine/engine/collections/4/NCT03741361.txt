    
      120 consecutive female patients, 18-65 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists (
      ASA) physical status I to II, scheduled for hysteroscopic surgery under propofol-based
      intravenous anesthesia will be recruited in this prospective cohort study. The day before
      surgery, participants were asked to complete the modified HADS questionnaire in an isolated
      calm room, and the score was used to assess the patients' anxiety and depression level in the
      past 6 months. On the day of surgery, propofol (Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH, Graz,
      Austria)was administrated by using an intravenous target controlled infusion (TCI) pump
      (Alaris PK, Basingstoke, UK) with Schnider kinetic model. The initial effect-site
      concentration (Ce) was set as 1.0 μg/ml. After the TCI system displayed that Cp and Ce were
      at equilibrium, the target concentration of propofol was increased by an increment of 0.5
      μg/ml until the patients achieved the three desired levels of sedation.The Ce and dose of
      propofol and the consuming time were recorded.
