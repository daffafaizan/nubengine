      diameter stenosis≥50%, reference diameter≥2.75mm will be enrolled. OCT examination should be
      carried out after radiography, predilation, Drug coated balloon dilatation and follow-up.

      For target lesion, balloon should be used for predilation (the ratio of balloon diameter to
      vascular diameter being 0.8-1.0:1), and for good predilation effects, high pressure balloon,
      cutting balloon, dual-wire balloon and spines balloon can be adopted. OCT examination should
      be carry out after balloon satisfactory predilation. Satisfactory predilation radiography
      result is residual stenosis≤30%,TIMI 3 flow without major dissections (type C or higher) in
      NHLBI classification. OCT satisfactory result is residual stenosis≤30% without dissection, or
      with dissection but the dissection angle is ≤90°. Then carry out DCB balloon dilatation
      therapy. The ratio of balloon diameter to vascular diameter is 0.8-1.0:1, and both ends of
      DCB exceed the preprocessing area of lesion for 2-3mm, thus avoiding the occurrence of
      geographical mismatch. Dilation pressure is 8-10atm, lasting for at least 30s. Each DCB
      catheter can be used once only.
