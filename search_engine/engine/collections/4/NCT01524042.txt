      novel double pants randomly. Examinees who underwent colonoscopy within 3 years, with history
      of bowel resection surgery, cancer, colostomy or ileostomy, psychotic disease such as
      depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive disorder, treated with emergent colonoscopic
      procedure, and pregnant or lactating women, an illiterate person and foreigners will be
      excluded. Questionnaires before colonoscopy are educational background, martial status,
      indication of colonoscopy, examinee's preference of doctor's gender, and State-trait anxiety
      level of examinee. Questionnaires after colonoscopy are shame and trait anxiety level, and
      satisfaction of examinee during colonoscopy. We will also investigate colonoscopy specific
      quality Indicators such as the ASA status (American society of anesthesiologist's physical
      status), complications, procedure success. Finally we will compare the difference of
      satisfaction, shame, and anxiety during colonoscopy between examinees wearing novel double
      pants and conventional single pants
