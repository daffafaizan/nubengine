      drinking habit at 18-21 years of age in 2014/2015. Amongst them, 16.8% had scored higher than
      3 in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption (AUDIT-C) (an abbreviated
      version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, or AUDIT, designed by the World
      Health Organization(WHO)), while 3.5% had even scored 8 or above in the test. With higher
      prevalence to begin drinking within 18 and 23 years old, university students could have
      established higher tendency of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence as compared with other
      age groups. Therefore, early interventions such as the evidence-based Alcohol Brief
      Intervention (ABI) suggested by the WHO are particularly needed to target university drinkers
      who are 5% more likely to develop higher frequency of drinking in later of their lives
      compared with other age groups.
