      cardiovascular disease. There is evidence that individuals with OSA may have increased
      inflammatory mediators, changes in the metabolic profile, increased sympathetic activity with
      consequent elevation of blood pressure (BP) and endothelial dysfunction. Resistant
      hypertension (RH) is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP ≥ 140/90mmHg) despite the
      current use of three hypotensive drugs at full doses, including a diuretic, or the need for
      >3 medications to control BP. OSA has been reported as the most common secondary cause of
      high blood pressure maintenance.

      Objective: To determine the prevalence of OSA and associate it with the endothelial function
      behavior in patients with resistant hypertension comparing to those with BP controlled by
      medication.

      Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 40 hypertensive patients (20 with resistant
      hypertension and 20 with controlled BP), irrespective of race or gender, with ages between 18
      and 75 years. BP was measured by oscillometric method on automatic device. Endothelial
      function was assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) by EndoPAT2000® and the OSA
      diagnosis also through PAT, using the portable device WatchPAT200®. Anthropometric evaluation
      was performed through measurements of waist, hip and neck circumference, body mass index,
      waist to height ratio (WHtR), and body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance.
      Statistical analyzes were performed by GraphPad Prism software.
