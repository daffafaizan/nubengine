reaction of the adrenal cortex during controlled experimentalhypothermia .the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbitssubjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some ofthe animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitonesodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced bypentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of etheranesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbitsplaced in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount ofadrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of thestress reaction .in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in thedistribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reactionbrought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seemto inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to thetest animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of someextent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .
