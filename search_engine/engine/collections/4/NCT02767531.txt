      by extreme hypertriglyceridemia due to a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase or related
      proteins. Treatment of these patients is challenging as triglyceride-lowering medications are
      ineffective. A low fat diet is helpful, however, despite good dietary compliance, some
      patients continue to have severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis which can be
      life threatening. Therefore, Investigator wish to investigate whether inducing dietary fat
      malabsorption or inhibiting chylomicron formation will cause further lowering of serum
      triglycerides (TG) beyond the effect of limiting dietary fat intake.

      Investigator will study the efficacy and safety of an inhibitor of intestinal lipase
      (Orlistat) for reducing serum triglyceride levels in patients with Type I
      hyperlipoproteinemia. Investigator plan to enroll 20 patients with Type I
      hyperlipoproteinemia in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.
      During the last week of each study period, fasting blood samples will be drawn for three
      consecutive days for serum lipids and chemistry panel. The primary endpoint will be serum
      triglycerides; the secondary endpoint variables will be fasting and postprandial serum
      chylomicron-TG levels, postprandial serum TG levels during a meal tolerance test and retinyl
      palmitate levels during a meal tolerance test. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be
      used for statistical comparisons.

      These results may help in designing novel therapeutic approaches for patients with Type 1
      hyperlipoproteinemia.
