    
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed
      world. To date, two major polymorphisms on the HTRA1 and CFH genes have been associated with
      AMD. Progression and vision loss need to be followed and treated promptly in order to
      preserve vision. This study will provide more information on the genetics of disease
      progression and may lead to future guidelines for patient follow-up and treatment.

      This study consists of a blood draw and observation of eye conditions. Consented, enrolled
      patients will come in every four months as per standard of care. At each visit, visual acuity
      measurement, slit lamp exam, indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photos, and spectral domain
      optical coherence tomography will be performed. Every 8 months, or per standard of care,
      fluoroscein angiography will be performed. DNA extraction and genotyping will be performed,
      and correlations between HTRA1 and CFH genotypes and the progression to bilateral advanced
      AMD will be analyzed.
