      Background: Work breaks at close intervals are common in fields with high workload but not
      yet for medical operators. We evaluated the effects of intraoperative breaks (five minutes
      every half hour) on the surgeon and on the patient.

      Methods: Operations were randomized to either a scheme with intraoperative breaks and release
      of the pneumoperitoneum (intermittent pneumoperitoneum = IPP) or a conventional conduct
      (CPP). Stress hormones and Î±-amylase were determined in the surgeon's saliva pre-, intra- and
      postoperatively. Mental performance and error scores, musculoskeletal strain and continuous
      ECG were secondary endpoints. The children's physiology was monitored.

      Findings:

      Regular intraoperative breaks did not prolong the operation. The surgeon's cortisol levels
      during the operation were reduced. There were fewer intraoperative events in the IPP vs. the
      CPP group. The pre- to postoperative increase in the error rates of the bp-concentration test
      was reduced in the IPP group. The relevant locomotive strain-scores were reduced by IPP.

      There was no negative impact on the patient. Interpretation: Our data support the idea that
      work breaks during complex laparoscopic surgery can reduce psychological stress and preserve
      performance with at least similar patient outcome compared to the traditional work scheme.
