      of life, and measurements to understand why muscles of statin users are not able to fully
      utilize fats. The investigators are specifically interested in statin users and the impact of
      muscle symptoms on daily activities and quality of life.

      This study hypothesizes that patients with likely statin-associated myopathy have a metabolic
      dysregulation in fuel utilization such that compared to patients continuing statins, those on
      placebo will show:

        1. improved INQoL and SF-36 scores (primary end point)

        2. alleviation of muscle symptoms,

        3. increased utilization of fatty acids as a fuel source reflected by the metabolic test
           results

        4. decreased IMCL

        5. improved insulin sensitivity.
