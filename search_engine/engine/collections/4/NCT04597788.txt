      accompanied by obesity related complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
      osteoarthritis and even some types of cancer. However, there are not many lifestyle
      modification treatments available that have long-term effects other than drugs and surgical
      treatments in the management of obesity.

      Preserving muscle mass should also be considered in weight loss especially for elderly adults
      with obesity, because decreased muscle mass and strength can negatively affect morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly.

      Therefore, the investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the protein
      supplemented very low calorie meals on weight loss, body composition as well as metabolic
      changes compared with traditional low calorie low fat diet in people with obesity.
