      (machine-driven group) or torque wrench (manual group) in the maxilla. Forty patients were
      randomly divided in two study groups; 20 implants were inserted with a surgical motor and 20
      implants with a torque wrench. After the healing period, accuracy comparison method between
      planned and actual implant positions was performed based on digital intraoral scan. Coronal,
      apical and angular deviation parameters, insertion time and maximum insertion torque was
      evaluated.
