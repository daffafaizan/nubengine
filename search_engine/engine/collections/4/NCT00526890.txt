      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of selenomethionine in combination with
           chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small
           cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine if the incidence of excessive adverse events, in the form of esophagitis,
           pneumonitis, and myelosuppression, can be reduced with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate response rate, failure-free survival, and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Correlate selenium levels with degree of observed adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral selenomethionine twice daily for 1 week and then once daily for 6
      weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes once weekly for 6 weeks and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and weekly during treatment and analyzed by
      absorption spectrophotometry for selenium measurement of drug concentration

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
