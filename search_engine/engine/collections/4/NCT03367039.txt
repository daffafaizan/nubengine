    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial at 7 years of follow-up comparing
      ProDisc-C vivo artificial cervical disc replacement and ACDF (Anterior cervical discectomy
      fusion) to treat degenerative disc disease (DDD). 648 DDD patients (age from 20 to 70) from
      several hospitals matching the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups
      (324 patients in each group). One group will be treated with ProDisc-C vivo disc replacement.
      The other group will be treated with ACDF. The clinical outcomes and radiographic
      measurements will be compared between two groups at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months
      after the surgical treatments.
