      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) in patients with metastatic or local chest wall recurrent HER-2-amplified breast
      cancer. (Phase I) II. To determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
      (Phase I) III. To determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      PHASE I: Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14 and trastuzumab
      (HerceptinÂ®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of vorinostat until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PHASE II: Patients receive vorinostat at the MTD and trastuzumab as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
