    
      The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) screen patients with various neuromuscular
      disorders and facilitate their entry into appropriate research protocols; 2) help resolve
      puzzling diagnostic neuromuscular problems and train fellows in the evaluation and treatment
      of Neuromuscular Diseases; and 3) provide follow up to patients who finished their
      participation in a previous study but they are not currently entered in another research
      protocol. No investigational treatments will be performed on this protocol but the tissues
      collected can be used for future research studies.
