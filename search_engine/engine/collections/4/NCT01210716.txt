      with the return of replacement fluids to the patient. In the majority of cases, the treatment
      goal is to selectively remove the substance directly responsible for the patient's disease
      process.

      Fenwal's AMICUS separator platform is a centrifuge-based apheresis system which collects the
      blood components of interest and returns the remaining blood components along with saline
      back to a donor/patient. The device has been cleared for the following:

        -  The collection of platelets and plasma in Japan, Europe and the US (BK960005), 1996.

        -  The collection of mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the US (BK000047), 2002.

        -  The collection of a concurrent red blood cell (cRBC) product collected in ACD-A
           anticoagulant and stored in ADSOLÂ® Preservation Solution (BK000039), 2002.

      Fenwal has developed a new protocol on the AMICUS separator that enables the device to
      perform TPE procedures. The procedure is similar to the FDA cleared platelet and concurrent
      plasma collections, except that in TPE procedures the majority of plasma is retained and the
      red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBC) and the majority of the platelets are
      returned to the patient.
