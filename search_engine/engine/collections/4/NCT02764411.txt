      It is a prospective, open label, cohort study. Patients enrolled in the study will be
      followed at the Hospital For Sick Children for 16 weeks. They will come for the study visits
      6 times: in 1 week, 4,8,12, and 16 weeks after the treatment has been started. During each
      study visit the study investigators will assess any changes in the characteristics of CM
      lesion(s) captured by a Chromometer *, Analogue Scale and Erythema Assessment tools.
      Participants or their parents will assess the changes at the final study visit (VAS and EA
      tools).

      Patients will be provided with study medication for all duration of the study treatment (12
      weeks).

      The results of the treatment will be compared with the baseline data to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Onreltea (Brimonidine) gel in children with facial capillary malformations.
