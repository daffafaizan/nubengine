      complications, some of which may be relatively infrequent. The goal of this group is to
      create this registry to be used for local safety and quality improvement and multi-center
      benchmarking in this population. Reports generated from the registry will provide individual
      institutions with comparative data showing how their site performs compared to composite
      averages from all participating sites. Queries of the composite data set may allow for
      identification of factors associated with improved outcomes in this population. Future
      queries of the data-base for research purposes will require approval of the participating
      members of SPAIN.
