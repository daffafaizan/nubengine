      were recruited. Patients received a single injection of 3-ml of PRP into symptomatic ankles.
      The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score
      (0-10cm) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score,
      American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot score, single leg stance
      test (SLS), use of rescue analgesics and patient satisfaction. Adverse events were recorded
      during the study.

      Patients were followed at 1, 3 and 6 months postinjection .
