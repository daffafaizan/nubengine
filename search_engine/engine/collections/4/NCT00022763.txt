      for HIV-1 genotype and phenotype resistance testing are obtained at screening to aid in the
      selection of concomitant antiretrovirals. Simultaneous to initiating T-20, all patients begin
      a "new" optimized antiretroviral regimen based on the patients' prior treatment history,
      historical resistance testing results, and the results of the testing performed at screening.
      Patients are followed for safety and other assessments at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, then monthly
      through Week 24 and bimonthly through Week 48. Pharmacokinetic sampling at selected study
      visits are performed.
