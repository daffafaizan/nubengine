      postoperative residual curarization (PORC). Many anesthesiologists, however, use insensitive,
      qualitative neuromuscular monitoring or unreliable, clinical tests. Goal of this multicentre,
      prospective, double-blinded, assessor controlled study is to develop an algorithm of muscle
      function tests to identify PORC.

      Methods: After extubation a blinded anesthetist performs eight clinical tests in 165
      patients. Test results are correlated to calibrated electromyography train-of-four (TOF)
      ratio and to a postoperatively applied uncalibrated acceleromyography. A classification and
      regression tree (CART) is calculated developing the algorithm to identify PORC. This is
      validated against uncalibrated acceleromyography and tactile judgement of TOF fading in
      separate 100 patients.
