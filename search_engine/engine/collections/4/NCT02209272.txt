      deep joints like the hip. Lidocaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic in most
      medical practices. It is well known that lidocaine infiltration itself is painful. Many
      strategies have been studied to minimize pain associated with lidocaine administration,
      including buffering, warming, and slowing infiltration rate. BS is an alternative local
      anesthetic that has been shown to be less painful when injected into subcutaneous tissues
      compared with lidocaine. However, BS use has not been widely implemented for local
      anesthesia, and it has not been studied in the context of joint injections.
