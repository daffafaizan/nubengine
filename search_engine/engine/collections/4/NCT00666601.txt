    
      This study will be conducted in two parts: a Pilot Study and a Main Study. The Pilot Study
      will be conducted to assess recovery of exogenously administered TR-700 (microbiologically
      active moiety) via microdialysis. In the Main Study, pharmacokinetics of TR-700 will be
      determined in both soft tissues (via microdialysis) and plasma after a single oral dose of
      600 mg TR-701 (prodrug).
