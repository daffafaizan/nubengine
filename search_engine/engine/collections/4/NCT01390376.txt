      symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects. Refractory schizophrenia
      (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult clinical issue at present. Among
      schizophrenia patients, around 20-25%are treatment-resistant. According to the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) hypothesis, many clinical trials on NMDA-enhancing agents were
      studied. Adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids (D-serine,
      D-alanine), and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but
      limited efficacy for positive and negative symptoms. The investigators recently started to
      study the potential of DAAOI-1, a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor which can elevate
      synaptic concentration of D-amino acids.

      The aims of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-1 adjuvant
      treatment for clozapine-resistant refractory schizophrenia patients in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo - controlled trial.
