    
      We are interested in patterns of husband/wife communication and interaction regarding
      conflict resolution, trauma experiences, marital satisfaction, occupational functioning,
      social functioning, family functioning, and substance use.

      We hope to discover ways to assist couples in reducing marital stress.
