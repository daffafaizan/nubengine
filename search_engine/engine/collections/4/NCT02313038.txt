      deployment during the index hospitalization will be consecutively recruited in 30 tertiary
      hospitals scattered all over China. At study entry, participants will be interviewed during
      their index hospitalization, to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of
      life, and medical care. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features,
      diagnostic tests, medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be
      abstracted from medical records by well trained professional abstractors. And CAG imaging
      will be reviewed by national and international expert panels. At 1 month, 6 month, and 12
      month after discharge, participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits, a
      face-to-face interview will be conducted to get information about clinical events, symptoms,
      functioning, quality of life, and medical care during the recovery period. At 1-Month and
      12-Month follow-up visit, blood and urine sample will be collected. Participants' blood
      samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies. This study will examine the
      prognosis in groups with different brands of DES, and various real-life factors, that may
      affect patients recovery after the procedure. Evidence for clinical practice and health
      resource allocation will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes
      in future finally.
