      direct ingrowth of bone to the implant is crucial to the attainment of good results in those
      cases where cement is not employed.

      The construction of a femoral implant, Versys Fiber Metal TaperÂ®, by Zimmer includes a more
      extensive coating than previous femoral implants. The improved surface coating has been shown
      to provide these implants with better properties than those demonstrated by implants
      currently in general use.

      Theoretically, the greater porous surface of mid-coated implants should:

        -  Encourage bone ingrowth through improved osteoconductive properties, however more
           extensive coating might change the loss of bone due to stress shielding later in time

        -  Improve anchorage of the implant due to the higher friction coefficient

        -  Result in fewer postoperative complaints measured with the Harris Hip Score and visual
           analog scale scores

      The migration of femoral components will be evaluated by RSA, performing radiostereometric
      analyses at the Orthopaedic Center, Aarhus University Hospital. The follow-up RSA will be
      scheduled for week 1, as well as 3 months, 12 months and 2 years after surgery. Bone mineral
      density around the implanted femoral component will be examined by DEXA scan at week 1, as
      well as 1 year and 2 years after surgery.
