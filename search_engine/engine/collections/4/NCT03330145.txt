      following the loss of a loved one, approximately 7% of bereaved individuals will continue to
      experience persistent and intense grief-related symptoms associated with marked distress and
      functional impairment years after the death.

      While several studies aimed to evaluate risk factors of CG among adults, little is known
      regarding CG among children and adolescents. Therefore, prospective research directly
      examining the impact of bereavement on post-loss psychiatric symptoms, including CG,
      post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD), depression, attentional and behavioral avoidance among
      children are needed. Improving our understanding of CG risk factors among children will help
      direct healthcare professionals' clinical attention toward screening and care of this
      underserved population.

      Furthermore, identifying mechanisms explaining why cancer bereaved children may be at greater
      risk for persistent psychological distress and CG will inform the development of preventive,
      early intervention and treatment strategies.

      Participants will be recruited to the Child and Adolescent grief counseling of the College
      Hospital of Toulouse as well as with the Team Regional Resource Pediatric Palliative Care
      "Enfant-Do". At 3, 6 and 12 months post-loss, children and their parent will be invited to
      complete questionnaires assessing peritraumatic dissociative experiences, peritraumatic
      distress, security attachment, symptoms of CG, symptoms of PTSD and attentional avoidance.
