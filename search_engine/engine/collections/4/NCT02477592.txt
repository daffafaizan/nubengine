      modestly effective for long standing persistent atrial fibrillation ablation(LPAF) even with
      complex or combined approaches, which is mainly attributed to the substrate underlying AF
      remodeling. Severity of atrial fibrosis is closely associated with clinical outcomes after CA
      for AF . The more atrial scars and fibrosis present, the lower the success rate for AF
      ablation. Patients with LPAF have many more areas with scars and fibrosis than those with
      paroxysmal AF or non-AF controls. The MRI delayed enhancement technique provides a
      non-interventional tool for evaluation of atrial fibrosis, however, it must be performed in
      sinus rhythm.Three-dimensional electro anatomic mapping has proven as accurate as MRI and can
      be performed easily during AF ablation, thus providing a good tool for evaluation of atrial
      substrate during LPAF ablation.

      Although electro-anatomic mapping provided a desirable surrogate for delayed enhancement MRI
      to define AF substrate, there was an important technical issue to be considered. There were
      no good techniques to predict a desirable tip-tissue contact before the contact force
      catheter was applied. A poor tip-tissue contact could render the results of voltage mapping
      less reliable. On the other hand, excessively high contact force could increase the risk of
      steam pop and cardiac perforation during ablation. Hence it was important to use the contact
      force catheter to perform substrate mapping and ablation.
