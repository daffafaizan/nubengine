      tomography (oct) will improve diagnosis and enable a more specific or tailored treatment in
      stent failure. However, the prevalence of stentfailure (ie stent malapposition,
      stentfracture, stentedgedissections etc) not causing clinical endpoints is not known. In a
      subset of patients (n=100) with previously implanted stents performing a new coronary
      angiography based on clinical indication, functional or patent stents (decided by Heart team)
      will be characterized with OCT and the patients followed for 5 years. The purpose of this
      substudy, OCT IPS (OCT In Patent Stents), is to estimate the prevalence of stentpathology in
      patent or functional stents and compare findings with the active arm of PROCTOR.
