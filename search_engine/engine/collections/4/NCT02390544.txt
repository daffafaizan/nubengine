      patients with many hematological diseases. The adverse effects associated with chemotherapy
      agents used as part of HSCT preparative regimens are not insignificant and can be life
      threatening at times. The investigators' central hypothesis is that increased systemic
      exposure to melphalan due to variation in PK in younger children leads to increased toxicity
      seen in them. Although the PK of melphalan has been studied in animal models and in adult
      patients, limited data exists in pediatric patients especially those undergoing allogeneic
      HSCT. The objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of melphalan in
      children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Up to forty patients who are
      scheduled to receive melphalan as part of their preparative regimen will be enrolled. Prior
      to the start of the preparative regimen, study participants will receive a test dose of
      melphalan (10% of the standard dose). Blood samples will be collected at specific time points
      prior to and after the administration of the test dose and again around the full standard
      dose of melphalan. This study will establish that a novel method (dry blood spot assay) of
      determining PK of melphalan can be utilized in the clinical setting. Additionally, urine
      samples will be collected to measure markers of kidney injury, which will help correlate
      melphalan exposure with toxicity.
