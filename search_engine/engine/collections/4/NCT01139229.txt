    
      This randomized clinical trial compared a hybrid everted esophagogastric anastomosis with
      conventional hand-sewn or stapled esophagogastrostomy for prevention of anastomotic
      stricture. The patients were completely randomized to receive either a hybrid everted
      esophagogastric anastomosis (HE group), or the conventional hand-sewn (HS group), or a
      stapled (SA group) anastomosis, after the removal of esophageal tumor. The primary outcome
      measured the incidence of anastomotic stricture at 3 months after the operation (defined as
      the diameter of the anastomotic orifice <= 0.8 cm on esophagogram), analyzed by
      intention-to-treat.
