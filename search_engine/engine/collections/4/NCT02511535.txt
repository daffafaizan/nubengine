      individuals undergoing de-sensitization treatment display an increased production of immune
      suppressive cytokines. The investigators measure humoral and cellular immune responses to
      routine vaccination (Tick-borne Encephalitis [TBE] booster) in allergic patients with and
      without de-sensitization treatment to determine whether allergy negatively influences vaccine
      induced immune responses and protection.
