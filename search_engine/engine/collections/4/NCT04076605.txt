      enrolled. The investigators will collect multiple clinical characteristics from the medical
      record and follow the patients prospectively over the hospitalization and/or until 28 days to
      determine if clinical events have occurred including bleeding, thrombosis, re-hospitalization
      and death. Characteristics of the hospitalization will be recorded including presence of
      acute decompensation and acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Procedure type will be
      recorded including coagulation laboratory data before and after each procedure. All bleeding
      events will be recorded and characteristics surrounding each bleed will be recorded. Bleeding
      will be defined according to International Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions of
      major bleed and clinically relevant non-major bleed. REDCap (https://www.project-redcap.org)
      will be used to collect and centralize data maintained at the University of Virginia.
      Characteristics of each hospitalization will be recorded accordingly and patients will be
      followed for 28 days for outcome and mortality information. Each participating center will
      obtain local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to participate and enter data directly
      into REDCap. After center IRB approval is obtained, centers will consecutively enroll
      patients on a rolling basis for 4 weeks. Data will be collected from enrollment until death,
      transplant, discharge and/or 28 days on each individual enrolled.
