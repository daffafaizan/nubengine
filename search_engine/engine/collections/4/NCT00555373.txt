      falling incidence of acute rejection and improving allograft survival. In recent analyses of
      the NAPRTCS database, acute rejection is no longer the most common cause of hospitalization
      or allograft failure. Chronic rejection has now become the most common cause of allograft
      failure and accounts for over 35% of allograft loss. Chronic rejection is a complex clinical
      condition that includes both immunologic and non-immunologic causes and is more accurately
      referred to as Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Although Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)
      have played a central role in reducing acute rejection and improving allograft survival, it
      has long been shown that they contribute to interstitial fibrosis and chronic allograft
      nephropathy. Recent trials in adult transplantation have demonstrated that with the use of
      the TOR-inhibitor, Sirolimus, it is possible to withdraw Calcineurin inhibitors with no
      increase in rejection and with improvements in allograft function, interstitial fibrosis and
      long term survival (1). We hypothesize that the use of Sirolimus (SRL) in pediatric kidney
      transplantation will allow the withdrawal of Calcineurin inhibitor and improved kidney
      function and long term survival. We plan to enroll 50 patients at the time of
      transplantation. Patients will receive routine immunosuppression of CNI (Prograf),
      Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) and prednisone. Those patients with normal function and no
      rejection episodes after 6 months of transplantation will undergo a slow conversion from
      Prograf to Sirolimus (Rapamune). We will then assess the rate of rejection, allograft
      function, fibrosis on biopsy, and allograft survival over the following 18 months.
