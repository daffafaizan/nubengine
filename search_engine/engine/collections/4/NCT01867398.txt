    
      Objective: To determine the impact, as indexed by BOLD response, of the administration of
      aripiprazole and risperidone during the treatment of Conduct Disorder (CD) on the
      pathophysiology of CD.

      Study Population: Youth with CD receiving aripiprazole at admission to Boys Town Omaha, youth
      with CD receiving risperidone at admission to Boys Town Omaha, youth with CD not receiving
      antipsychotics at admission to Boys Town Omaha, typically developing youth.

      Design: The study will involve a 4 (Group: CD receiving aripiprazole at admission, CD
      receiving risperidone at admission, CD not receiving antipsychotics at admission, typically
      developing youth) x 2 (Time: At admission vs. four months subsequent to admission [when
      treatment for the antipsychotic groups will have been tapered off]) design. Principle
      dependent measures will relate to BOLD response indices of the pathophysiology of CD.

      Outcome Measures: Principle dependent measures will relate to BOLD response indices of the
      pathophysiology of CD. In addition, assessments of symptom severity will be collected, as
      will measurements of cognitive function.
