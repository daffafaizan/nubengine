    
      Subjects 40 years of age and older scheduled for a screening colonoscopy will be enrolled.
      Subjects will collect a stool sample that will be tested by the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal
      Neoplasia Test at a central laboratory and that will be tested using a commercially available
      FIT. After sample collection, subjects will undergo a screening colonoscopy per standard of
      care. Investigators will be blinded to the results of the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal
      Neoplasia Test during the study; the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal Neoplasia Test and FIT
      results will not be used for clinical management of subjects. Personnel performing the
      colonoscopy and reports from the colonoscopy and personnel performing the histopathological
      review of the tissue and/or any reports will remain blinded to the results of the LifeKit
      Prevent Colorectal Neoplasia Test results.
