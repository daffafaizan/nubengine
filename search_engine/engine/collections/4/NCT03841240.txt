      central venous catheters admit to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Zhujiang
      Hospital,Southern Medical University from February 2019. Ultrasound is used for screening
      catheter-related thrombosis, and catheter-related infections are diagnosed according to the
      Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections. The
      primary outcome is the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis and catheter-related
      infections. The primary exposure factors are age, gender, APACHE II, RBC, Hct, PLT, FIB,
      D-dimer, PCT, blood glucose, anticoagulants, and vasoactive drugs, catheter type, tube
      placement, indwelling time, etc. Descriptive analysis is used for the incidence of various
      complications. T-test or non-parametric statistical test is used for single factor analysis
      of risk factors, chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability test is used for counting
      data. Multivariate analysis of risk factors and the relationship between complications are
      analyzed by logistic regression. Statistical analysis is performed with SPSS Statistics
      version 20.
