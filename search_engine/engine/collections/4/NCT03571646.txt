      hospital ward at high risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular events. Phase I, 70
      patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p monitoring system or to PM1000N-RR
      pulse oximeter monitoring system and the alarms of both devices will be silenced and the
      screen information blinded, to establish a baseline for the incidence of respiratory events.
      Phase II, 140 patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p or to PM1000N-RR
      monitoring but the screen information will be visible at the bedside and through the Vital
      Syncâ„¢ remote patient monitoring system.
