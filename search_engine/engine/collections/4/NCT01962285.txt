      different mechanisms beyond the actual effect-site concentration of anesthetic drug. This
      eventual difference between dose response curves for loss of consciousness (LOC) and for
      recovery of consciousness (ROC) beyond hysteresis has received the name of neuronal inertia.
      We performed a volunteer-study comparing LOC and ROC curves, during a slow, steady-sate,
      stepped target controlled infusion of Propofol using Schnider's pharmacologic model. Our
      hypothesis is that, at steady-state conditions between plasma an effect-site concentration,
      there is still going to exist a difference between LOC and ROC, demonstrating the existence
      of neuronal inertia.
