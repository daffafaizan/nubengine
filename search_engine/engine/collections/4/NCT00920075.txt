      been recognized and diagnosed in recent years. The disease results from either diminished
      bone formation or increased bone removal (resorption) resulting in low bone density and
      fractures. No specific drug therapy has been recommended for juvenile osteoporosis. In an
      open label study, we earlier have shown that alendronate treatment (10 patients) for 12
      months increased bone density without side effects. Subsequently, in a double blind,
      crossover study, we have further confirmed that alendronate treatment (11 patients) increased
      bone density significantly whereas, placebo (11 patients with calcium and vitamin D),
      increased the bone density only minimally. There were no side effects. These patients were
      treated with alendronate only for 12 months and the clinical trials have been completed. We
      therefore, have designed a post study to evaluate the current status of the bone density and
      fracture history in the above participants after the discontinuation (1-6 years) of
      alendronate treatment. Available participants, who have completed the earlier study, will be
      scheduled for a one time clinic visit. Measurements include DXA bone density measurement of
      spine and hip, urinalysis and blood work. No treatment is involved.
