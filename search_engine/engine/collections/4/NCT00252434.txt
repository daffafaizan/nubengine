      culturally-specific cognitive behavioral therapy that integrates aspects of drug abuse
      treatment with HIV medication adherence interventions and cultural elements of being a gay or
      bisexual man receiving medical care for HIV/AIDS. To estimate the size of the signal of this
      intervention, the study proposes a two parallel group design in which 50 treatment-seeking
      HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men who meet criteria for methamphetamine abuse and who
      receive HIV medical care at the UCLA Center for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE)
      clinic are randomized to the study condition or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.
      Participants assigned to the experimental condition receive 12 weeks of twice-weekly GCBT,
      with a 6-months post-randomization follow-up visit. Participants assigned to the TAU
      condition are referred to the UCLA Addiction Medicine Clinic (AMC), where they receive the
      clinic's standard of care treatment for methamphetamine dependence for 12 weeks, and return
      for a 6-month follow-up visit. Analyses are conducted on all participants who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, express desire for treatment, and receive at least one "dose"
      of the cognitive-behavioral treatment or make one visit to the AMC. Participants in both
      conditions agree to weekly and monthly data collection visits, including the provision of
      urine samples. Primary outcome variables are methamphetamine use, sexual risk behaviors, and
      HIV medication compliance. The proposed design maintains the focus on intervention
      development and feasibility, while recognizing that the second phase of this development will
      be informed by having accurate estimates of effect sizes for the intervention and adequate
      resources to conduct the full-scale trial.
