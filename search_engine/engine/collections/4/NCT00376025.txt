      of both selenium and iodine in patients with this disease. Initial supplementation of these
      trace minerals provided no measurable benefit to the affected population. Research conducted
      by Innovative Humanitarian Solutions, suggests that such deficiencies may not be causal, but
      markers of an underlying condition of extreme oxidative stress brought on by the improper
      functioning of the Glutathione Peroxidase enzyme in synthesizing H202 during periods of
      critical cellular development, primarily in mesenchymal cell development.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in
      aiding the Glutathione Peroxidase enzyme in its proper function and thereby reducing
      oxidative stress and enabling the uptake of selenium and iodine which are necessary for
      proper bone growth and development.
