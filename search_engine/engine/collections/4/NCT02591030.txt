      have objectively shown a significant increase in overall survival of patients with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to gemcitabine alone (median of 11.1 months versus 6.8
      months, HR = 0.57 [0.45 - 0.73] p < 0.0001). The response rate and progression-free survival
      (PFS) have also been improved with these triple therapies; the response rates were 31.6%
      versus 9.4% p < 0.001 and the median PFS 6.4 months versus 3.3 months p < 0.001,
      respectively.

      The adverse events observed with the triple therapy occurred more frequently, for febrile
      neutropaenia (5.4%), with the need to treat with growth factors (G-CSF for 42.5% of
      patients). Haematological and digestive toxicity was also higher: grade 3-4 neutropaenia was
      observed for 45.7% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 18.7% of patients in the gemcitabine
      arm (p = 0.0001); vomiting was noted for 14.5% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 4.7% in
      the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.002). Quality of life was improved in the FOLFIRINOX arm.

      Due to the histological, therapeutic and prognostic similarities between pancreatic and bile
      duct cancer, it is interesting to assess this triple therapy compared to the current
      reference treatment in bile duct cancers: gemcitabine combined with cisplatin (GEMCIS). Due
      to the known higher levels of toxicity for this triple therapy (digestive and
      haematological), the investigators modified the conventional FOLFIRINOX regimen (mFOLFIRINOX)
      by removing the 5-FU bolus at D1 of each cycle. This modification to the regimen would appear
      not to decrease the efficacy of the treatment.
