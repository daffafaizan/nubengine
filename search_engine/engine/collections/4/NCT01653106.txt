    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the maximum inpatient mucositis grade after 120- vs. 360-minutes standardized
      cryotherapy regimens in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation at Ohio State Medical Center.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a pharmacokinetic model predicting variability in unbound serum melphalan area
      under the concentration-time curve (AUC).

      II. To compare the neutropenic fever and bacteremia incidence after 120- vs. 360-minute
      cryotherapy regimens.

      III. To compare patient-reported mucositis-related symptoms up until discharge utilizing the
      Patient-Reported Oral Mucositis Symptoms Scale (PROMS) after 120- vs 360-minute cryotherapy
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning fifteen minutes before melphalan treatment, patients receive 1 ounce of
      shaved ice in their mouth, allow it to melt and then replenish it immediately for 120
      minutes.

      ARM II: Beginning fifteen minutes before melphalan treatment, patients receive 1 ounce of
      shaved ice in their mouth, allow it to melt and then replenish it immediately for 360
      minutes.
