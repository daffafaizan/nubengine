           performed after receiving the informed consent of the patient.

        2. This study is single-blind because it is not possible to blind the practitioner
           performing the injection.

        3. Subjects were randomly assigned to the normal method group (group A) and the mirror use
           group (group B) by a random random number table, and the possibilities for belonging to
           any group were all the same and can not be artificially controlled by researchers.

        4. After the procedure, a resident who does not know of this study records the radiation
           exposure time displayed on the monitor and the overall procedure time
