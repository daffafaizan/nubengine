      GER. The following procedures will be done pre-transplant.

        1. Standard GER questionnaire (RDQ): This is a 12 item questionnaire. This questionnaire
           will ask questions about any reflux symptoms present.

        2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): This test will determine evidence of esophageal reflux
           and presence of a hiatal hernia.

        3. Scintigraphic evaluation of solid gastric emptying: This measures the speed with which
           food empties from the stomach and enters the small intestine.

        4. Twenty-four hour ambulatory pH testing: The ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring test will
           monitor the acid in the esophagus during a 24-hour period.

        5. Esophageal manometry testing: This procedure is done to evaluate the cause of reflux of
           stomach acid and contents back into the esophagus, and to determine the cause of
           problems with swallowing food.

      These procedures will be done again at 3 to 6 months post transplant. The results of the EGD,
      scintigraphic evaluation, answers of RDQ, pH testing, esophageal manometry and bronchoscopy
      will be collected as well as spirometries and any episodes of rejection.
