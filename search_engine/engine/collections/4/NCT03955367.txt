      patients without evidence of para-aortic metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs) and with at least one
      of the following characteristics are included in the present study: (a) Number of pelvic MLNs
      ≥ 2; (b)Short diameter of pelvic MLNs ≥ 1.5cm; (c)Pelvic wall involvement. Patients are
      randomly assigned to pelvic irradiation group and prophylactic EFI group. Patients in pelvic
      irradiation group receive pelvic irradiation, intracavitary brachytherapy and concurrent
      chemotherapy. Patients in prophylactic EFI group receive irradiation for pelvis and
      para-aortic lymph nodes region, intracavitary brachytherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. The
      upper border of clinical target volume (CTV) is at the level of renal vessels for patients in
      prophylactic EFI group. A dose of 45-50.4 Gy is delivered to CTV with IMRT in both groups.
      Patients receive cisplatin based concurrent chemotherapy (single cisplatin or cisplatin plus
      paclitaxel). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival.
