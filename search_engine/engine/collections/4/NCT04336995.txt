      (echocardiography) can be useful to estimate how much fluid is in a patient's circulation,
      which can influence diagnosis and treatment of certain types of heart failure. In some
      patients, the amount of fluid is normal at rest, but can increase with activity and thus a
      diagnosis of heart failure can only be made after exercising. Currently, the amount of fluid
      is measured invasively. We have shown that echocardiography can measure the amount of fluid
      in the lung circulation at rest without the need for an invasive procedure. We now seek to
      find out if we can make a similar measurement after exercise. If successful, the need for
      catheter procedures may be reduced in certain types of heart failure.
