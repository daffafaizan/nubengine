      especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had poor antibody response to rabies
      vaccination. Because of the role of the memory B cell, the investigators hypothesized that
      primary rabies immunization in HIV-infected patients could rise rapid anamnestic antibody
      response to ones after booster vaccination in case of re-exposure of rabies occur despite of
      their immunocompromised state.
