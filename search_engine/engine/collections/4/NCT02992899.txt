      feedback controlled vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) using positron emission tomography (PET)
      brain imaging and blood biomarker measurement with stress in healthy individuals. Healthy
      human subjects with a history of psychological trauma but without the diagnosis of a
      psychiatric disorder undergo PET imaging of the brain in conjunction with VNS or a sham
      treatment during exposure to neutral scripts and scripts of personal traumatic events. Blood
      is drawn simultaneously for measurement of a variety of stress responsive biomarkers,
      including inflammatory markers and neurohormones. A second PET scan with biomarkers assesses
      the delayed effects of VNS. On two other days subjects undergo exposure to random stressors
      with VNS or sham in conjunction with measurement of stress biomarkers.
