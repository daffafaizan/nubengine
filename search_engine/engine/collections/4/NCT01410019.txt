      treat patients with SCID-X1 without HLA identical family donor nor HLA identical unrelated
      donor (bone marrow and cord blood) available in an adequate time with the clinical conditions
      of the patient at diagnosis (approximately 6 weeks). This clinical protocol No. 2 of SCID-X1
      must be as efficient than the previous one but must involve a risk of insertional mutagenesis
      significantly reduced as compared to the first protocol.

      The main purpose of the study is the study of toxicity: tolerance and incidence of serious
      adverse effects.

      Secondary goals are the evaluation of immune reconstitution allowing the cure of infections
      present at the time of gene therapy, assessment of integration sites, and finally the
      long-term correction of immunosuppression.

        1. safety assessment : clinical effects, possible emergence of clonal lymphocyte
           proliferation, potential activation of proto-oncogene;

        2. efficacy assessment of ex vivo transduction of CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells of the
           patient through the use of retroviral vector pSRS11.EFS.IL2RG.pre;

        3. assessment of immune reconstitution : phenotype, number and function of different T, NK
           and B cells subpopulations;

        4. longitudinal evaluation of clinical effects in terms of improvement or complete
           restoration of immunity;

        5. biological efficacy assessment of this new vector SIN, assessment of molecular
           characteristics of retroviral integration.
