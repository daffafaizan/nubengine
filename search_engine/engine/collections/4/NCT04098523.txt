    
      A population-based screening study to determine the prevalence of carotid artery stenosis
      (CAS) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in the Brussels Capital Region.

      The study population is the 60+ inhabitants of the Brussels capital region; recruitment of
      4680 subjects. Using duplex ultrasound, a low invasive examination, information is obtained
      on the abdominal aortic diameter and the degree of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation.

      The objective is to determine not only the prevalence of, but also the risk factors
      associated with CAS and AAA among 60+ Brussels inhabitants. To collect these data, a
      questionnaire is made including demographic features, associated risk factors, but also
      previous treatment for AAA or CAS and the current medication of the subject.

      Examination is done by one-time duplex ultrasound to perform a diameter measurement of the
      abdominal aorta and determine the degree of stenosis of the carotid arteries.

      Data collection will be done in an electronic case report form, and statistical analysis will
      be done by a multi-variable logistic regression model.
