      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate in patients with
      taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated
      with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival in
      patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus
      tipifarnib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation
      of CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
