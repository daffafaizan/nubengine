      subjects undergoing non-emergent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) post
      market approval. The primary endpoint will be a composite clinical endpoint of major adverse
      events through 90 days following the PCI procedure. The outcome will be compared to the pre
      specified performance goal of 53%.
