      pre- and postoperative radiographic indices of hip dysplasia in order to identify factors
      predicting failure following PAO. The minimum duration of follow-up is 2 years. Failure
      following PAO is defined by a WOMAC pain score > 10 or the insertion of a total hip
      arthroplasty.
