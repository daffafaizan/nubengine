    
      This study was planned as a Phase II/III seamless, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in patients with AS who were na√Øve to TNF antagonist therapy. The
      study consisted of 2 parts, each preceded by a screening visit and followed by a common
      open-label extension phase. Recruitment into Part 2 commenced after completion of enrollment
      for Part 1.

      Part 1 was designed as a Phase II study exploring the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab
      therapy versus placebo. Part 1 was intended to determine whether Part 2 of the study would
      continue, based on a Week 12 analysis.

      Part 2 was designed to provide pivotal Phase III efficacy and safety data for tocilizumab in
      patients with AS. Approximately 400 patients were to be enrolled. Once randomization into
      Part 1 was complete, randomization into Part 2 of the study was to be initiated.

      Based on the results of the Week 12 Part 1 analyses of the primary endpoint (ASAS20) and
      secondary endpoints, and in consideration of all available safety data, a benefit/risk
      assessment was made and it was decided to halt the study because of lack of overall efficacy.
      Most patients did not complete the 24-week double-blind treatment period in Part 2.
