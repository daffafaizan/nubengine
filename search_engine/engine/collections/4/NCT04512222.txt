    
      This is a prospective, single-centered, non-randomized, observational registry study of AF
      patients that undergo radio-frequency catheter ablation, left atrial appendage occlusion or
      surgical ablation. Information of other medication intervention and clinical outcomes are
      also prospectively collected in the database. This project will establish a prospective
      registry of 5000 AF patients with follow-ups of up to 3 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate pathophysiological changes of both atrial and ventricular myocardial
           function in AF patients.

        2. To identify clinical indices (including baseline, comorbidities, medication or
           operational interventions) that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To spot potential therapeutical targets in the continuum of AF: from risk-factors
           elimination to mortality and disability prevalence reduciton.
