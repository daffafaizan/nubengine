      strength and postural control in stroke patients. However, there has not yet been a report on
      the cortical activity changes induced by whole body vibration exercise.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. One group will go through whole
      body vibration with exercise and the other will only perform exercise. The primary outcome
      measurement of this study was cerebral cortex activity based on changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral assessments
      were performed before and after the intervention session using the 10-meter walk test, timed
      up and go test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment.
