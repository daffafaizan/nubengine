      chemical resistance and the exceedingly rare allergy response. Although flexural strength,
      modulus of elasticity and rigidity of nylon (polyamide) denture base materials are relatively
      low, they demonstrate great impact strength, toughness, and resistance to fracture. It was
      suggested that by adding glass fibers to polyamides, their stiffness and other mechanical
      properties could be increased. The flexural properties of nylon denture base materials has
      promoted their usage only in conditions like unyielding undercuts, pronounced tuberosities,
      tori and bulging alveolar ridges. In 2013 Wadachi etal compared rigidity of polyamide and
      PMMA when used as a denture base material and concluded that; the modulus of elasticity of
      polyamide was very low in comparison to PMMA and was lower than ISO standard, and so they
      recommended that polyamide to be used as a denture base material it should be reinforced with
      metal frame
