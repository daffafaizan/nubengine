      problem, with more than three million cases al around the world as reported by the World
      Health Organization. This situation has put health systems under extreme pressure, being
      overwhelmed be the amount of patients requiring attention.

      Around 5% of patients will require ICU internation, due to severe lung inflammation giving
      rise to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a cytokine storm that ultimately
      affects other organs. In this group, mortality can be as high as 40%.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have shown great immunomodulatory effects, and are used in other
      inflammatory conditions as autoimmune diseases, being safe and preliminary effective in
      improving patients health status. They exert their effect via paracrine and autocrine
      pathways and have been shown to reduce IL-1, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and increase
      IL-10 in COVID 19 patients. One of the greater advantages of the MSC is that they express no
      Major Histocompatibility Complex, reducing the risk of host immune reaction.

      Given their immunomodulatory effects, research in this topic showing their safety and
      experimental efficacy are needed, as therapies for severe patients are lacking. Patients,
      researchers and data analysts will be blinded, and ARDS patients will be randomly allocated
      in standard therapy plus MSC arm or standard therapy alone to answer these questions.
