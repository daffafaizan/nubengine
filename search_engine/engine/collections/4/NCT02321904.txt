    
      In phase 1: To compare corneal nerve density (CND), length (CNL), and branching (CBD) by CCM
      between

        1. children with type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more to children without diabetes;

        2. children with type 1 diabetes with and without evidence of diabetic neuropathy;

        3. to examine the relationship between CND, CNL & CBD and known risk factors of diabetic
           neuropathy

      In phase 2:

        1. to examine for changes in corneal nerve morphology two years after the initial CCM exam.

        2. to describe the evolution of diabetic neuropathy based on clinical symptoms,
           neurological deficits, and other tests of nerve dysfunction.

        3. to assess if changes in corneal nerve morphology correlate with changes in nerve
           conduction velocity and autonomic testing.

        4. To examine the risk factors associated with progression of diabetic neuropathy in our
           pediatric population.
