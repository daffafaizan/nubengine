      room air breathing (21% inspired oxygen) with pure oxygen breathing (100% inspired oxygen) on
      brain blood flow and cortical electrical activity. The study involves a one-time data
      collection taking place at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center on the Case Western
      Reserve University campus in Cleveland, Ohio. The investigators will perform neuroimaging
      (MRI) with electroencephalographic (EEG) cortical network mapping and cognitive assessments
      in all participants during room air breathing and again while breathing 100% pure oxygen.
      Oxygen will be delivered through a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood partial pressure of
      oxygen (PaO2) will be measured twice, from arterial blood samples drawn during breathing room
      air prior to the MRI scan and again after 30 minutes of breathing 100% oxygen immediately
      following neuroimaging. Thus, the investigators will be able to determine if breathing pure
      oxygen may temporarily change brain blood flow and breathing, leading to changes in cognitive
      status such as euphoria or slowed reflexes. Information gained in this study may have direct
      operational relevance by helping us to understand one potential cause of "Unexplained
      Physiologic Events" that are reported in some aircraft pilots when flying at high altitude.
      Information gained could lead to development of new gas mixtures for use by personnel working
      in low oxygen high altitude environments.
