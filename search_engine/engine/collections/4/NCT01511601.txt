      it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma or leukocytes than can be safely
      obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely obtained using a
      well-established standard apheresis procedure that is in common use at the National
      Institutes of Health Apheresis Unit. This protocol describes the implementation of the same
      apheresis procedure at the National Blood Transfusion Center in Bamako, Mali. This is not a
      research protocol per se, but rather an adjunct protocol which allows healthy donors 18-55
      years of age to undergo apheresis. Subjects must already be enrolled in another protocol
      which has been approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
      Institutional Review Board and the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Odonto-Stomatology
      Ethics Committee.
