      the iliac crest and the costal margin. The needle is placed in the plane of the probe and
      advanced until it is between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. Once
      in the plane, 2 mL of saline is injected to confirm needle position, then the local
      anesthetic solution is injected. [10]

      For the ESP block, as mentioned previously, the ultrasound is positioned in a parasagittal
      fashion, 2-3 inches lateral to the spinous process. This approach visualizes the transverse
      process. The needle is inserted cranial-to-caudal to make contact with the shadow of the
      transverse process, with the needle tip deep to the fascial plane of the erector spinae
      muscle. Injection of saline confirms the location of the needle, and the anesthetic is
      injected.

      All patients will receive PO acetaminophen and PO gabapentin the morning of surgery. Pt. will
      be placed on PRN oxycodone/acetaminophen (Percocet) postoperatively. PRN IV dilaudid may be
      given for severe breakthrough pain.

      Opioid usage at 1, 24 and 48 hours after the block will be recorded by a member of the
      research team. Pain scores at rest and on movement will be measured by the investigator using
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system
      (none=0; mild=1; moderate=2; severe=3). Sedation scores will also be assessed by a member of
      the study team using a sedation scale (awake and alert=0; quietly awake=1; asleep but easily
      roused=2; deep sleep=3). All these parameters will be measured at 1, 24 and 48 hours after
      the blocks and patients will be encouraged to ambulate on postoperative day 1 under
      supervision. Their ambulation activity will be recorded.
