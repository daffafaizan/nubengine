      well as contribute to a wide variety of skin diseases. Skin care products hydrate the skin
      and breaks the dry skin cycle. While there is extensive evidence of benefits of using mild
      cleansers and moisturizers, much of the previous studies are limited to the effects of single
      cleanser or moisturizer.

      In this study, the investigators are going to enroll up to 100 people over the age of 18 with
      dry, itchy skin and they will be split into 2 groups. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to skin care regimen group (approximately 75% of total enrolled) and control group
      (approximately 25% of total enrolled). All evaluation include clinical assessments, subject
      questionnaires and photography will be conducted similarly in both groups.

      Analysis will include paired and unpaired t-tests with two-tailed p-values. Values obtained
      at baseline, in middle of the study and after completing the study will be compared. The
      difference of measure values will be compared between application group and control group.

      The moisturizing lotion and wash are generally very well tolerated.Rarely, they can induce a
      burning sensation, dryness, skin irritation, erythema, stinging, sensitization, and
      dermatitis. Risk events, problems, and deviations will be reported by the PI directly to the
      Institutional Review Boards.

      The investigators hope to learn the importance of regular skin care regimen in improving dry
      skin and overall skin health.
