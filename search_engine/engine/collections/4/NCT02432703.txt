    
      This is a Phase 2a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      Investigator nor the participants know about the study intervention), placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multi-center study of JNJ-42165279 in participants with social anxiety
      disorder. Participants will receive 25 milligram (mg) JNJ-42165279 or matching placebo orally
      once-daily from Day 1 up to 12 weeks. Participants will primarily be assessed for the change
      from baseline in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) at Week 12. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
