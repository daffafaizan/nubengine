    
      A total of 26 intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis as diagnosed by
      radiographs, were selected for the study after taking an informed consent. The selected sites
      were randomized in 2 treatment groups.

      Group I - sites were treated with allograft (DFDBA) Group II - sites were treated with
      allograft (DFDBA) in combination with Atorvastatin gel.

      Clinical parameters like probing depth and clinical attachment level and radiological
      assessment of intrabony defect fill were done at baseline and 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
