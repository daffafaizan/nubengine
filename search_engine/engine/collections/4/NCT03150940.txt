      functional, or electrophysiologic cardiac abnormalities in a population of young athletes
      using bedside cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram (ECG) and a physical exam.

      The investigators will attempt to answer the question regarding the feasibility of screening
      all collegiate athletes with bedside cardiac ultrasound, ECG, and history/physical exams
      results in a higher sensitivity for abnormalities than screening using ECG and physical exams
      alone. The investigators will also analyze the cost and cost effectiveness of screening the
      young athlete population with bedside cardiac ultrasound. Costs will be calculated to include
      the amount of dollars spent on equipment, gels, and other supplies, but will not include the
      cost of performing the bedside cardiac ultrasound, which will be assumed as part of the
      physical exam. Additionally, the investigators will be gathering a number of data markers
      from the bedside cardiac ultrasound, including but not limited to right ventricular and left
      ventricular cavitary size, septal wall thickness, free ventricle wall on RV, and free
      ventricle wall on LV, in evaluation of the athlete's heart. The importance of these
      measurements is for the continued knowledge and data set analysis collection as there is
      limited known athletic cardiac measurements. There is minimal risk involved in this study.
      The investigators believe that by adding bedside cardiac ultrasound to the history, physical,
      and ECG, it will increase the sensitivity and specificity of screening for these
      life-threatening abnormalities in young athletes, and reduce the morbidity and mortality
      associated with these conditions.
