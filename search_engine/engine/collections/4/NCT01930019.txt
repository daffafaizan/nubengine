      premedication. After the patient's arrival in the operating theater, standard monitoring was
      commenced. All the patients were oxygenated. Depending on the study group, either etomidate
      or thiopental was used as an induction agent for general anesthesia. Both anesthetics were
      administered according to ideal body weight. When the ciliary reflex disappeared, either
      suxamethonium chloride or rocuronium bromide was administered, depending on the possible
      problems in endotracheal intubation. The general anesthesia was maintained with desflurane,
      continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil, and repeated doses of rocuronium bromide as
      required.

      Each patient had their serum cortisol concentration level measured five times. The first
      measure was taken the afternoon of the day before surgery (A sample), and the second two
      hours after induction of anesthesia with etomidate or thiopental (B sample). Subsequently a
      short stimulation test with intravenous injection of 250 μg of tetracosactide, a synthetic
      analogue of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), was performed. The third sample was taken
      thirty minutes after the short stimulation test blood (C sample), and next, the fourth (D)
      sample was taken 24 hours after induction of anesthesia. Immediately afterwards, a second
      short stimulation test with 250 μg of tetracosactide was performed, and 30 minutes later, the
      fifth blood sample (E sample) was taken.

      The serum cortisol concentration was measured by electrochemiluminescence.

      The patients' participation of the study ended when the last, fifth blood sample was
      withdrawn.
