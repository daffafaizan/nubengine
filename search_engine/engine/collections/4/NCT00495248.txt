      after stroke. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and social isolation are occurring among 20 to 60
      percent. Little is known about intervention for people with mild neurological symptoms who
      simultaneously perceive social isolation, depression and reduced satisfaction in their daily
      life after stroke. Lifestyle redesign (LR) is developed in the USA and is a health promoting
      group intervention programme with focus on the participants' exchange of experiences and
      involvement. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect on thriving, activity and social
      participation of a group intervention program inspired by Lifestyle redesign for community
      dwelling persons with stroke. The study is conducted as a multicentre randomized controlled
      trial. Participants are recruited from five hospitals and the intervention is carried through
      at six to seven senior centres. The control group is offered a physical activity programme at
      the senior centre once a week. The intervention group is offered the same with the additional
      intervention programme also once a week. The study will contribute to knowledge whether this
      group intervention will promote social participation and thriving in daily life and prevent
      social isolation and depressive symptoms among community dwelling elders with stroke or TIA.
