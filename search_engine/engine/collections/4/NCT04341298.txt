    
      Avulux® is intended to reduce the severity of headache pain in adult patients diagnosed with
      episodic migraine headaches. In this study, the investigative Avulux® device shall consist of
      a pair of optical filters in the form of spectacle lenses, provided in a standard spectacle
      frame; the lenses contain a dye that effectively blocks light at specified wavelength ranges
      while minimizing distortion of the visible spectrum. The optical filters block a portion of
      the optical spectrum that is suspected to stimulate photophobic responses that trigger some,
      and exacerbate most, migraines.

      The control/sham device for this study shall be a pair of plastic lenses provided in a
      standard spectacle frame, which will have negligible light-blocking properties at the optical
      wavelengths which are blocked by the Avulux® device.
