      gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GBMSM) using an iterative user-centered design
      process, which will result in a refined version of the uTECH intervention. In Phase 2, we
      will conduct a comparative acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility trial with 330
      individuals, who will be randomized to receive the uTECH intervention or an existing,
      evidence-based motivational enhancement intervention for HIV risk and substance use
      prevention (Young Men's Health Project). uTECH is innovative in that it includes both core
      intervention modules and highly personalized intervention content based on participants'
      social media use. The tailored intervention content can be delivered via text message or
      Facebook messenger. This content relies on our previously developed machine learning
      algorithm, which helps participants understand their technology-use behavior in relation to
      HIV-risk and substance use.
