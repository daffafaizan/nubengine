      following distribution in terms of COPD Stage as per GOLD 2013 (updated) spirometric
      classification of disease severity, are deemed to be sufficient for assessing the inhalation
      profile through the NEXThalerÂ®:

        -  10 to 20 COPD GOLD Stage I patients

        -  20 patients in each of the COPD GOLD Stage II to IV. Assuming a screening
           failure/drop-out rate of 10%, a maximum of 89 patients will be screened in order to
           reach the required number of completed patients.

      All the analyses will be performed separately for the first and the second inhalation.
      Results stratified by disease severity and overall will be presented.
