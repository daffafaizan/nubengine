      I. To determine the toxicities and ability to complete the planned treatment of a dose-dense
      regimen of cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in patients with newly
      diagnosed stage I-II breast cancer.

      II. To estimate recurrence free survival of a dose-dense regimen of cyclophosphamide and
      paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed stage I-II breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [Her-2] neu positive patients):
      Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for
      5 courses and then every 21 days for 14 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.
