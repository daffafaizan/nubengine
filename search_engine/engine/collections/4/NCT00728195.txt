    
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), double-blind (neither the participant nor the physician know the study
      medication drug name), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group (a clinical trial comparing the response in two or more
      groups of participants receiving different treatments), dose-response study in participants
      with schizophrenia. The total study duration will not exceed 16 weeks for each participant
      and will include following visits: screening, baseline, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11
      and 13 (end of treatment or early withdrawal), and a post-study safety visit (1 week after
      final dose of study drug). All participants will be hospitalized during the first 2 weeks of
      treatment for detailed follow-up of safety and disease status. Following a screening period,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups to receive oral doses of
      JNJ-37822681 (10, 20 or 30 milligram [mg] twice a day) for 12 weeks, olanzapine 15 mg daily
      for 12 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks followed by olanzapine 15 mg daily for the remaining 6
      weeks. Olanzapine will be initiated at 10 mg daily for 1 week and then increased to 15 mg
      daily for the remainder of the treatment period. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will also be monitored at
      each visit.
