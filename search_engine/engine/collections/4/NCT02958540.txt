    
      A total of 48 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 49 years will be recruited. The first 24
      subjects will be randomized 3:1 to SynGEM® low dose level (140 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs) or
      placebo administered at Day 1 and Day 29 (Group 1). After completion of recruitment of Group
      1, if no pausing rule is met until 7 days post prime in all Group 1 subjects, 24 additional
      subjects will be randomized 3:1 to SynGEM® high dose level (350 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs) or
      placebo administered at Day 1 and Day 29 (Group 2).

      Recruitment will be guided by pre-specified pausing rules. Recruitment of Group 1 will be
      staggered as follows: a sentinel cohort of 2 subjects (1 subject receiving SynGEM® and 1
      subject receiving placebo) will be recruited on study Day 1; subjects will be followed up to
      Visit 2 (3 days post-dosing) and if no pausing rule is met, a second cohort of 2 subjects (1
      subject receiving SynGEM® and 1 subject receiving placebo) will be vaccinated; subjects will
      be followed up to Visit 2 (3 days post-dosing) and if no pausing rule is met, recruitment
      will be extended to the remaining 20 subjects (16 on SynGEM®/4 on placebo) of Group 1.

      Escalation to the high dose level will be implemented only after collection of safety data of
      all subjects in Group 1 for at least 7 days post-prime if no pausing rule is met. Group 2
      will also be comprised of a total of 24 subjects and recruitment will be staggered and
      subjected to the same pausing rules as in Group 1.

      Each subject will return to the site for study visits 3, 7 and 28 days post-prime
      vaccination; 28 days after prime vaccination the boost vaccination will be administered and
      subjects will return 3, 7, 28 days after boost vaccination. A primary analysis will be
      carrying out on data collected up to this timepoints. Subjects will be followed up for safety
      and immunogenicity thereafter up to 180 days post-prime.
