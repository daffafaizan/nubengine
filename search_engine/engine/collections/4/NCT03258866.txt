      into 2 groups: group A(n = 32) and group B(n = 30). In group A, Rituximab was given with a
      fixed dose of 100 mg administered as an intravenous infusion weekly (on day 1, 8, 15 and 22).
      In group B, Rituximab was given with a single dose of 375mg/m2. The clinical effect, onset
      time, duration of efficacy and adverse reactions were observed to compare the efficacy and
      safety of two different plans.
