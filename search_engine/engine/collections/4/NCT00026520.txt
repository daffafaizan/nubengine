        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with stage IV melanoma
           treated with interferon alfa and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response rates in patients
           with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously twice daily and oral thalidomide once daily
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses
      after documentation of CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
