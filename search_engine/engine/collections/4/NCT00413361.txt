    
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a treatment which allows preventing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (SLE) exacerbations.

      HCQ can be measured in whole-blood by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography).

      Interindividual variability in blood HCQ concentrations is important and a correlation
      between HCQ level and clinical efficacy of HCQ has been demonstrated in SLE in a monocentric
      study of 143 unselected SLE patients.

      The main objective of study PLUS is to determine the potential benefits of individualized HCQ
      dosing schedules aimed at maintaining the whole-blood HCQ concentration above 1000 ng/ml

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To define biological and clinical hallmarks present at M1 (month 1) which are predictor
           of SLE exacerbations in the next 6 month,

        -  To establish the parameters of HCQ pharmacokinetic model, by a study of population,
           using a "Bay√©sienne" approach.

        -  To study the influence of allelic variants of drug carriers and other genes in the
           interindividual variability of blood HCQ concentrations.

        -  To study the influence of the compliance in the blood HCQ concentration variability

        -  To study the relation between blood HCQ concentrations, SLE activity and quality of life

        -  To study the relation between blood HCQ concentrations, SLE activity and lipid profile
           of the patients

        -  To study the relation between ECG abnormalities and blood HCQ concentrations

        -  To constitute a bank of serum, a DNAbank, and a RNAbank to permit subsequent studies
