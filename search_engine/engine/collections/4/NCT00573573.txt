      increased levels of calcium in the blood stream, which can lead to weakening of the bones and
      to kidney stones.

      We are postulating that the non-invasive energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the
      central nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to stop the
      over secretion of the parathyroid hormones and normalize the body's metabolic functions.
