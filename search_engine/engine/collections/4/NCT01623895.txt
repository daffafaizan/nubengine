      convenient long acting oral agent, has been introduced in clinical practice with promising
      efficacy. However, some patients experience drug-related toxicities and cannot tolerate it.
      To investigate effect of genetic variations on the toxicities and find optimal target
      population, we planned to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A
      (UGT1A) subfamily, multi-drug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer
      resistance protein (BCRP) among pediatric patients received deferasirox.
