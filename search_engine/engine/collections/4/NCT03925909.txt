    
      Individuals of both sexes between 30 and 60 years of age who present fasting glycemia between
      100 mg / dL (5,6 mmol / L) and 125 mg / dL (6,9 mmol / L) 50, or concentration of glycated
      hemoglobin between 5.7% (39 mmol / mole) and 6.4% (47 mmol / mole) 50, or glycemic
      concentrations in the oral glucose tolerance test between 140mg / dL (7.8 mmol / L) to 199mg
      / dL (11.0 mmol / L) 50. The study will also include insulin-resistant individuals: insulin
      above 25 uU / mL, or who present HOMA-IR score above 2.7.

      Individuals using supplements (vitamins, bioflavonoids), pregnant women and those who
      practice intense physical exercise (> 10h / week) will be excluded from the study.

      The primary endpoint will be alteration of the microbiota with possible improvement of the
      glycemic profile, leading to the reversal of pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.
