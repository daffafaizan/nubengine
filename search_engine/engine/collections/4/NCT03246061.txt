      Ablation arm participants will be approached to participate in a sub study of 3 additional
      years of follow-up at their 24 month visit (total of 5 years of follow-up).

      Control arm subjects who were originally to be offered optional crossover treatment after the
      12 month follow-up visit were offered crossover per the DSMB recommendation at a mean of
      176.5 days.
