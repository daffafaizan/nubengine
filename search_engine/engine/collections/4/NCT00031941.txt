        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-5013 in patients with refractory solid tumors
           and/or lymphoma.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine whether any correlations can be made between plasma concentrations of this
           drug and toxicity or clinical activity or biological activity in these patients.

        -  Characterize the side effect profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral CC-5013 on day 1. Within 4-10 days, patients begin second course and
      receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Subsequent courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
