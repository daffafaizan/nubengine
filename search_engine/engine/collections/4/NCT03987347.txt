      risks associated with Cannabis use, and means that the reported adverse effects of Cannabis
      are not so important, suggesting that Cannabis may be useful for their illness as an
      alternative or complementary therapeutic.

      More Canadian physicians prescribed Cannabis for their patients. Both Recreational and
      medical use of Cannabis increase and will continue to grow up in the next coming years.
      Regardless, the typology of Cannabis use, more information on the health condition of
      Cannabis consumers may be helpful for the medical prescription of Cannabis, in particular in
      older adults who are more at risk of side effects.
