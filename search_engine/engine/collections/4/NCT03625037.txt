    
      The purpose of the escalation part of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as well as to establish the safety profile of
      epcoritamab GEN3013 (DuoBodyÂ®-CD3xCD20) in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory
      B-Cell Lymphoma.

      In the expansion part additional patients will be treated with epcoritamab with the RP2D and
      the purpose is to further explore and determine the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab.
