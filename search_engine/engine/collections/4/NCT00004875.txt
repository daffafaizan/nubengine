      according to tumor type and type of anticoagulation (heparin or enoxaparin) in patients with
      cancer. II. Determine the incidence of portacath clots and its correlation to TFPI
      releasability in this patient population. III. Compare these anticoagulation drugs in terms
      of releasability of TFPI in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      within the past 3 weeks (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of standard heparin subcutaneously (SQ) followed by
      evaluation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) response at 5 and 10 minutes post
      injection. Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of enoxaparin SQ followed by evaluation of
      TFPI response as in arm I. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-200 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 months.
