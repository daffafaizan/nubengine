      anaesthetics agents. Intraoperative opioid administration is still relying on simple
      parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure variations. However, many studies in both
      adults and children have shown the poor accuracy of those parameters in predicting pain
      because of their sensibility to other intraoperative events such as depth of anaesthesia and
      volaemic variations. Consequently, intraoperative analgesia is still inadequately managed
      with periods of under dosage or over dosage of opioid agents. This has been hypothesized to
      cause postoperative hyperalgesia related to both intraoperative pain (in case of under
      dosage) or to opioid agents (in case of over dosage). The main resulting effect is an
      increase of postoperative opioid consumption and the inadequate postoperative rehabilitation
      because of adverse effects of opioids.

      During the last decade, many pain-monitors have been investigated. Most of these devices are
      relying on the determination of the sympathetic-to the parasympathetic systems balance. Among
      those monitors, the Analgesia Nociceptive Index (ANI) quantifies the parasympathetic system.
      The ANI device can produce two parameters the instantaneous ANI (ANIi), derived from 60
      seconds analysis and the mean ANI (ANIm) derived from 4 minutes analysis. Studies have shown
      the accuracy of ANIi to detect both experimental and clinical pain in various populations.
      Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial during spine surgery in adults has found ANIi
      to decrease the intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption when used
      intraoperatively for guiding the administration of opioid agents
