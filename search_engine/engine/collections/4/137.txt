responses of b. subtilis (atcc 558) to streptomycin .to observe in detail the influence of streptomycin on the growth of smdependent type, the author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) and madeexperiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference tothe relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its smdependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the sporesformed . the results are as follows .1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found asits mutant .2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth at sm concentrationbelow 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/ml, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .3. sm resistant type grows well between sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, thegrowth declines rapidly at about sm 10,000 r/ml .4. sm dependent type shows normal growth between sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/ml, the growth get worth below sm 10 r/ml, and the cell shape elongatesseveral times, at sm below 1 r/ml each cell becomes filamentous form andhas several ten times length of normal cell, as if the cells havestopped to divide at low sm concentration .6. the germination and outgrowth of spores of the sm dependent typeslow down with decline of sm concentration, but the germinated sporesgrow in normal forms until sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, then thegermination becomes much slower, and the cells grow in filamentous formsor irregular forms . at extremely low sm concentration both germinationand outgrowth nearly stop .
