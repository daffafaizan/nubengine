      Outpatient adolescents diagnosed with GAD will be recruited to undergo 8 x 30 minutes
      intervention sessions over 4 weeks. Participants who are enrolled will continue to receive
      treatment-as-usual prescribed by their treating psychiatrist, except for the use of
      psychotropics. This population is selected as they could elucidate whether our intervention
      can be beneficial as an early intervention program for GAD.

      During the 8 bi-weekly intervention sessions, participants will don a head-mounted VR display
      set and a mobile EEG-biosensor. The hardwares are non-invasive.
