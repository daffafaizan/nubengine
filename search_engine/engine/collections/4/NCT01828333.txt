      in children reduced the case fatality substantially. An overall reduction of 22.5 % of
      mortality in African children (< 15 years) was reported using injectable artesunate compared
      to injectable quinine for treatment of severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. These
      results with high quality evidence led to a change in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of
      severe malaria in 2011. The WHO now recommends intravenous artesunate as the treatment of
      choice for severe malaria in children and adults. In early 2012 the Programme National de
      Lutte contre of Paludisme (PNLP) of the DRC with support from the relevant ministry
      departments decided to follow the WHO guidelines and changed the policy for the treatment of
      severe malaria in children and adults from injectable quinine to injectable artesunate.
      However, this process is a complex undertaking, requiring many operational and clinical
      adaptations. In order to support this process, there is a need for on-site operational
      information on the process and consequences of the switch from quinine to artesunate. The
      MATIAS study aims to demonstrate through limited scope implementation studies how injectable
      artesunate may be progressively rolled out nationwide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
      as the preferred treatment for severe malaria.
