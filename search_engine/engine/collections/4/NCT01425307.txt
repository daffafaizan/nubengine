      erythrocyte transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children with Sickle Cell Anemia
      (SCA) remains controversial for many practicing hematologists, as well as for patients and
      families. Transfusions have proven clinical efficacy in preventing first stroke in children
      with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities, but their indefinite use may still be difficult to
      justifY.

      The risk of transfusion acquired iron overload is now recognized as a serious consequence of
      chronic erythrocyte transfusions in children with SCA. After one to two years of monthly
      transfusions, virtually every patient will have excess hepatic iron deposition that warrants
      intervention with chelation therapy. The effectiveness of iron chelation has not yet been
      realized, despite the availability of the oral chelator deferasirox (ExjadeÂ®), due to its
      lack of palatability and increasing recognition of serious drug-related toxicities including
      renal and hepatic dysfunction. Simply put, indefinite erythrocyte transfusions cannot be
      viewed as adequate and acceptable long-term therapy for primary stroke prevention in SCA.
      There is an urgent need to develop an equivalent effective alternative therapy for the
      prevention of primary stroke in children with SCA, specifically one that better manages iron
      overload and improves quality of life.
