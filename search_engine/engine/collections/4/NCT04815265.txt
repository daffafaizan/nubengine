           Mechanical Ventilation

        2. Research center: Single Center

        3. The Design of the study: Randomized, Controlled, Non-inferiority Trial

        4. The population of the study: The main inclusion criteria are 18 years old or above,
           invasive mechanical ventilation is required, and the clinical need is mild to moderate
           Sedated (RASS score 0 to -3) patients

        5. Sample size: Enroll 488 patients (244patients in each group)

        6. Interventions: Participants in the test group received remimazolam for sedation, while
           participants in the control group received dexmedetomidine, The analgesia drug in two
           group is fentanyl.

        7. The aim of the research: To investigate the efficacy and safety of remimazolam for
           sedation in ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation

        8. Outcome# 1) Primary outcome# the ratio of the time to reach the target sedation (RASS
           score, 0 to -3)in the total duration of drug infusion, and the duration of mechanical
           ventilation. 2)Secondary outcome#; Length of stay in ICU and Length of stay in hospital;
           Incidence of complications (including re-hospitalization); Total expenses during
           hospitalization

        9. The estimated duration of the study#2-3years
