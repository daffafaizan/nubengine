      usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards
      to dose, population and indication. No data currently exist that characterize patient types
      and adalimumab administration within the Russian population. Further, it is important to
      characterize the compliance, acceptability of patient self-injection, tolerability and safety
      profile of this therapy option with the routine clinical care.

      The total follow-up for each participant was planned to be 12 months, with approximately 6
      follow-up visits occurring at average intervals of 2-3 months. However, since this was an
      observational study, follow-up was performed according to routine clinical practice; for 127
      participants the follow-up period consisted of more than 12 months and the maximum
      observation period lasted 18.2 months. Follow-up visits were designated sequential visit
      numbers (Visit 1-6), regardless of the time point at which they occurred.
