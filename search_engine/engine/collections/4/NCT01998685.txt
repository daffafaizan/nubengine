      prostatectomy (LRP) is still controversial. Moreover, different anaesthetic techniques could
      modify coagulant factors. Thus, in this study we will be to investigate the variations of
      pro- and anti-coagulant and fibrinolytic factors in two established types of anaesthesia in
      patients with prostate cancer undergoing elective LRP.
