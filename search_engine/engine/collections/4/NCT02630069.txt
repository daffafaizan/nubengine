      cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) in amphetamine-type stimulants-using
      adolescents. Multi-level assessments will be performed to determine whether CDP-choline
      administration with supportive psychotherapy, compared to placebo administration with
      supportive psychotherapy, will 1) repair ATS-induced neural cell damage of the target brain
      regions, 2) improve cognitive deficits and normalize the relevant target neural circuits, and
      then 3) reduce ATS-taking behaviors in ATS-using adolescents.
