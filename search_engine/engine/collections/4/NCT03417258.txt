      and patients without sporadic colorectal adenomas matched for sex, age and BMI were enrolled
      in group II (control). All participants underwent the following evaluations: BMI, dietary
      history (for quantitative and qualitative analysis of dietary habits), quantitative analysis
      of phytoestrogens (by dietary questionnaires), medications (chronic assumption of aspirin at
      low doses), characteristics of the polyps (for a calculation the cancer risk), analysis of
      urinary excretion of phytoestrogens [by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)] and
      intestinal flora [by mass spectrometry with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
      Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) technology]. At the enrolment, patients will be invited to assume
      a standard quantitative of phytoestrogens at 8:00 a.am. and collect both a fecal sample and
      the urine of the following 24 hrs.
