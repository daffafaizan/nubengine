      wide. It is often called a functional disorder, a term used to characterize painful
      conditions, whose biological mechanisms are not fully understood.

      Diagnosis is made based on symptoms and exclusion of other conditions rather than specific
      tests or biological markers.

      Treatment usually starts with diet counselling and a change of eating habits. If symptoms
      persist, a physician can prescribe medication of different types. But for some patients
      neither change of diet, nor medication is sufficient. Some of these patients may benefit from
      psychological treatment. There are a few different psychological treatments that have been
      proven efficacious in clinical trials. Most researched is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).

      Our study is a clinical effectiveness trial without a control group. The data comes from a
      gastroenterology clinic in Stockholm and is collected as part of the work with continous
      improvement at the clinic.

      Patients with diagnosed IBS are offered group treatment with a specific CBT protocol
      developed by our research group at Karolinska Institutet. The treatment comprises 6 different
      modules and stretches over ten sessions. The modules are: 1. Information regarding the
      treatment, IBS and mindfulness. 2 Hypervigilance and anxiety. 3. Behaviors and thoughts. 4.
      Behavior change part one - toilet habits including exposure to feared situations. 5. Behavior
      change part two - exposure to symptoms and avoidance/control behaviors. 6. Summary and
      relapse prevention.

      Group sizes range from 4-7 patients and the treatment is given by licenced psychologists who
      are employed at the clinic.
