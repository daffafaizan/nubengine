      considered to be the amount required to optimize plasma selenoproteins. There are two
      selenoproteins present in the plasma: selenoprotein P (Se-P) and glutathione peroxidase 3
      (GPX-3). Although the amount of selenium required to optimize GPX-3 has been determined, the
      amount required to optimize Se-P in the plasma remains unknown. We aim to determine this
      amount by supplementing selenium deficient subjects with varying amounts of selenium as
      selenomethionine.

      The study will take place in Mianning County, China, where selenium status is low.
      Approximately 150 people will be screened for eligibility to participate in this study. 98
      subjects will be enrolled. Background information obtained from each participant will be:
      age, height, weight and smoking status.

      Subjects will be randomized to a selenium supplement group. The selenium supplement will
      contain either 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 Âµg of selenium as selenomethionine. A CDC
      worker will visit each participant daily to give them their selenium supplement. The CDC
      worker will watch them take their supplement and will ask if they have any unanticipated
      problems. Blood samples of 20 ml will be obtained at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and
      40. Hair samples and 24-hr urine collections will be obtained at 0, 20 and 40 weeks. The
      total study duration is 40 weeks.
