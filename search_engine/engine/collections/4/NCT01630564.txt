      I. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of infusion of ex vivo expanded
      cord blood T cells (CLI), in cord blood (CB) transplant recipients with relapsed
      hematological malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete remission rate and overall response as a result of CLI infusion.

      II. To determine the effect of CLI infusion on the chimerism. III. To evaluate the incidence
      rate and grade of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after CLI infusion.

      IV. To determine the disease-free survival, cytopenia rate, relapse incidence after CLI
      infusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded T-cells.

      Patients undergo ex vivo-expanded umbilical cord blood progenitor cell donor T cell infusion
      with aldesleukin 11-14 days after T-cell co-stimulation begins.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
