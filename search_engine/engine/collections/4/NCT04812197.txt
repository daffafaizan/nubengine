      I. To determine if skin microbial diversity (estimated by the Shannon Index) significantly
      differs between inflamed and non-inflamed skin from patients who have immune checkpoint
      inhibitor (ICI)-induced dermatitis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate if certain bacterial species and strains are present in higher
      concentrations of inflamed versus non-inflamed skin of patients with ICI-induced dermatitis.

      II. To compare the immune cell phenotypes of inflamed and non-inflamed skin from patients who
      have ICI-induced dermatitis.

      III. To characterize the immune cell phenotype in the peripheral blood in patients who have
      ICI-induced dermatitis.

      IV. To elucidate any association between the skin microbial diversity and response to
      immunotherapy, characterized by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria (e.g., durable complete response [CR] versus partial response [PR] versus stable
      disease [SD] versus primary progressive disease).

      V. To ascertain if higher concentrations of certain bacterial species are associated with a
      response to immunotherapy, characterized by both RECIST and immune response criteria.

      VI. To evaluate associations between the non-inflamed skin flora and cancer subtypes (e.g.,
      renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, lung cancer).

      VII. To examine if skin microbiome is associated with specific demographic characteristics
      such as age and gender.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo punch biopsies of inflamed and non-inflamed skin and a blood sample
      collection.
