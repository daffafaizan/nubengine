      followed forward in time for the outcome of the study), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), observational study intended to examine the effectiveness of
      Fentanyl matrix through the degree of improvement of pain. Fentanyl matrix is a transdermal
      (through the skin) system providing continuous delivery of fentanyl for 72 hours. Fentanyl
      matrix will be administered to patients with chronic (prolonged) non-cancer pain under
      routine practice during 12 weeks. Dose will be adjusted in accordance with patient's degree
      of pain and treatment response in the investigator's judgment.
