      promote functional recovery and spasticity in chronic SCI. The tsDCS effect on
      neuro-physiological measures such as H reflex and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) wiil
      be evaluated in subjects with SCI. This incremental, design will allow the establishment of
      strong electrophysiological data prior to rapid clinical translation of the findings about
      this promising, early-stage technique.

      The central hypothesis is twofold: 1) active tsDCS will lead to a change in Hmax/M max ratio
      than sham tsDCS, in a polarity dependent manner; and 2) active tsDCS will lead to a change in
      SSEP amplitude and latency, in a polarity dependent manner.
