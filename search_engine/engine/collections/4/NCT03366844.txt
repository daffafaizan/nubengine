      public health burden. Over the past decade, molecular subtyping of breast cancer has
      identified intrinsic subtypes that may be at enhanced risk for both local and distant
      recurrence. This study focuses on the immunogenicity of high-risk breast cancer subtypes that
      are likely to display a dense lymphocytic infiltration including including TNBC and HR+/HER2-
      tumors.

      Immune build up via immune co-stimulatory molecules permits the ensuing immune response to
      strengthen and destroy cancer systemically. Thus, the effect of the anti-tumor immune
      response initiated by the radiation to an intact tumor by combination with checkpoint
      blockade is increased.

      Pembrolizumab is an optimal immunotherapy agent to study, as this agent has recently been FDA
      approved for use in multiple tumor types. It is therefore ready to be tested for efficacy in
      other disease sites and in combination with other treatments.
