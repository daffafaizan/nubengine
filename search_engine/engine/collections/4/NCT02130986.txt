      infection. Infections, particularly in the early stages, can have protean manifestations,
      often do not manifest with "classic" signs, and clinically overlap with non-infectious
      conditions. However, the imperative to quickly give antibiotics for bacterial infection has
      led to antibiotic overuse and resistance.

      Strategies that combine novel diagnostics with therapeutics have improved decision-making in
      oncology, cardiology, and other fields. These strategies aim to identify those patients most
      likely to be helped or harmed by the therapeutic intervention and allow more individualized
      care. This approach takes diagnostics to the next level, by demanding a test not only measure
      well, but also that clinical care be improved by tying the test to a treatment strategy.

      Procalcitonin, a novel biomarker of bacterial infection, may help physicians make more
      appropriate antibiotic decisions. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an ideal trial
      population. LRTI accounts for a large proportion of antibiotic prescription, and exemplifies
      the imprecise clinical phenotype of infection.However, key questions of generalizability and
      safety preclude widespread application.
