      explant specimens from the tumor explant population from 8/1/1994 to 12/31/2005. We will
      prepare 5-10 slides from each tumor explant block and measure HIF-1Î± using
      immunohistochemical staining. We will also be performing a retrospective chart review for
      specific data points which we believe are needed to assist us in our analysis of the
      histopathologic specimens.

      In addition, we will be looking at data in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
      database: www.unos.org, which will allow us to develop a more thorough and robust analysis of
      the subject's experience with liver cancer. This is a public, mandatory reporting vehicle
      that the government mandates all transplant centers to report to. Even if the subject was
      transplanted at Northwestern, and moved, accessing UNOS data will allow us to see what the
      morbidity/mortality for that patient is.

      Secondly, we will start enrolling subjects in a prospective fashion. Those that either have
      been treated, those currently undergoing treatment, or those newly diagnosed. From these
      subjects we will obtain informed consent to; a) look at the medical records (current, future
      and retrospective data), b) collect blood specimens for future analysis and correlation with
      their explant slide data, c) allow us to follow these subjects indefinitely to obtain ongoing
      outcomes data, morbidity and mortality information.
