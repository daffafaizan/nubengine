      expected to be good in most patients but there is limited scientific evidence about the
      indication for non-surgical and surgical treatment.

      Two randomised controlled trials comparing cervical decompression and non-operative treatment
      with cost-effectiveness analysis and assessment of expectations and predictors of outcome.
      The main research question will be evaluated at one-year follow-up.

        1. To test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of surgery as measured by the change in
           Neck Disability Index (NDI) and arm pain at 1-year follow-up in patients with cervical
           radiculopathy is not different from non-surgical treatment in:

             1. Study 1: one level disc herniation (C5/6 or C6/7)

             2. Study 2: one or two level spondylosis (C5/6 and/or C6/7)

        2. To test the hypothesis that surgery is more effective in patients with more clinical
           finding (dermatomal sensory loss, myotonal weakness and reflex disturbance) at baseline
           when adjusted for other possible predictors such as age, gender, baseline pain,
           duration, radiological findings, expectations, and psychological factors).

        3. To estimate cost-effectiveness for health care costs and societal costs (including
           sickness absence) in surgical versus non-surgical patients.

        4. To assess radiological (MRI and CT) measurements of foraminal area and nerve compression
           and if changes can predict clinical changes (NDI and arm pain) at 1-year .

        5. To evaluate treatment outcome expectations at baseline asking the patients to fill in
           their expected improvement.
