        -  To determine the ability to recruit and retain patients with breast cancer receiving
           curative radiotherapy in a Complementary and Alternative Medicine trial.

        -  To determine the acceptability of weekly healing touch therapy to patients with breast
           cancer who receive curative radiotherapy.

        -  To examine the effect of healing touch on fatigue and quality of life for patients with
           breast cancer receiving radiotherapy as a component of therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by type of treatment (radiotherapy alone vs chemotherapy
      completed prior to radiotherapy)

        -  Arm I:Patients receive healing-touch therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by
           a healing-touch therapist for the duration of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive sham-therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by a
           sham-practitioner (NOT a healing-touch therapist) for the duration of radiotherapy.

      Patients complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and a demographic variables
      form (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment) at baseline. Patient fatigue is
      measured on a weekly basis throughout radiotherapy with completion of the Brief Fatigue
      Inventory (BFI). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast form (FACT-B) is
      completed at baseline and the end of radiotherapy. Patients undergo a 20-minute interview at
      the end of study to determine the acceptability of the intervention.
