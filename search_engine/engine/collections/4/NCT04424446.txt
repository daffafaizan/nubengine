      interested in identifying different strategies for detecting infection. A technique that is
      less intrusive would put individuals undergoing testing at lower risk for complications,
      would likely increase compliance with subsequent tests, and would decrease risk to the
      providers who are conducting the test. For asymptomatic screening, some institutions are
      using midturbinate swabs instead of NP swabs, for increased compliance due to decreased
      discomfort. The NIH has switched to midturbinate collection in asymptomatic collections only.
      A test that would require only expectorating saliva and/or collection of a midturbinate swab
      would address the issues of NP collection discomfort. Saliva is the most preferred by
      patients or asymptomatic staff due to no collection in the nasal cavity at all. Although the
      CDC lists midturbinate swab as an acceptable specimen type, there are minimal data about the
      sensitivity of this collection for SARS-CoV-2, and decisions to use midturbinate swabs are
      based in part on experience with other respiratory viruses. Also, if saliva were found to be
      equivalent to NP for patient testing, there will be a benefit to future patients in providing
      this option for testing. Therefore, we propose to validate these sample types for SARS-CoV-2
      detection. The RT-PCR results based on a saliva sample alone or a saliva sample coupled with
      a midturbinate swab, will be correlated with the results using surveillance or diagnostic
      swab samples to validate their use for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
