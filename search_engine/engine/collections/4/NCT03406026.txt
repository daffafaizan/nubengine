      of 70 stroke survivors (N = 35 patients in the control group and N = 35 patients in the
      intervention group), who Are in the subacute stage of the disease, meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and require hospitalization to perform the rehabilitative treatment.

      For this, a rehabilitation treatment protocol was designed focusing on the equilibrium
      systems. The intervention of the study will be carried out during 4 weeks. The control group
      will receive conventional rehabilitation treatment for stroke patients, consisting of
      physiotherapy therapy for 60 minutes; While the intervention group will receive conventional
      rehabilitative treatment during the first 45 minutes and the last 15 minutes therapy will be
      based on the protocol designed.

      The evaluation of the program will be carried out based on the stated objectives. In order to
      evaluate the improvement of the patients in terms of balance, gait, risk of falls and patient
      autonomy, these will be assessed at the beginning of the intervention at 15 days and at the
      end (30 days). After the intervention two more assessments will be made; At 3 months and at 6
      months to follow up in time.
