      cause of morbidity and mortality. Prognosis of HF subjects depends on severity, age and sex.
      Subjects with HF require lifelong treatment. Pharmacological treatment aims to improve both
      the quality of life and survival of HF subjects.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objective:

        -  To analyze the association between genetic polymorphism of beta-adrenergic receptor and
           the effects of beta-blocker (bisoprolol) in Korean HF subjects

      Secondary objective:

        -  The frequency of polymorphism of beta adrenergic receptor in Korean HF subjects

        -  To evaluate change from baseline in 6-minute walking test, heart rate (HR), blood
           pressure (BP), pro B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level at week 26 or End of Treatment
           (EOT)

        -  To compare frequency and duration of hospitalization due to heart failure

      The method involved in this study will be as follows:

        -  Initial evaluation of HF subjects

        -  Blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation and collection

        -  Bisoprolol treatment as add on therapy with standard treatment for HF subject for 6
           months

        -  Genotype of beta adrenergic receptor polymorphism

        -  Follow up evaluation of treated subjects

      Bisoprolol will be given in a starting dose of 1.25 milligram (mg) once daily for two weeks
      and if it is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 2.5 mg, 3.75 mg, 5 mg once daily
      in intervals of two weeks, 5 mg daily as a maintenance therapy. If the subject is tolerable,
      the dose can be increased as 10 mg/day as maximum dose.
