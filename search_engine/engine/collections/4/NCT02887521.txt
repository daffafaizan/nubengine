      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) vs. standard care at a number of healthcare centers throughout
      the United States. This study will be open for 36 months. Randomization will be stratified by
      three variables: very severe lung function (yes vs. no), prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for
      this operation (yes vs. no) and open thoracotomy vs. video assisted thoracoscopy. The primary
      and secondary objectives are provided below.

      Primary Objective:

      To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on the
      length of hospital stay in patients that undergo a lung cancer resection and have COPD
      compared to a matched control group. Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR
      will significantly reduce the length of hospital stay.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on
           the number of postoperative complications in patients that undergo a lung cancer
           resection and have COPD compared to a matched control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly reduce
                the number of postoperative pulmonary complications.

        2. To prospectively determine the effect of a 10-session preoperative PR on the trajectory
           of quality of life at 3 and 6 months after the curative resection compared to a matched
           control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly and
                meaningfully (more than the minimal clinically important difference) improve
                quality of life after surgery compared to a control group.

      Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 months post-surgery.
