      transplantation followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched (â‰¥1/6 HLA-match with an
      identical ABO blood type) CD3+/CD19+ depleted bone marrow transplantation in bone marrow
      failure and end-stage lung disease. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic,
      progressive, and fatal interstitial lung disease for which lung transplantation is the only
      therapy shown to prolong survival. Given the association of IPF with hematologic cytopenias
      and bone marrow failure, it is proposed that a tandem lung transplantation and bone marrow
      transplantation from a single cadaveric donor could be successful. This protocol focuses on
      performing combined transplantation for candidates that are unable to undergo standard lung
      transplantation. Lung transplantation prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) would allow
      for restoration of pulmonary function prior to BMT, and to restore hematologic function post
      BMT transplantation. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the feasibility and long-term
      complications associated with combined solid organ and BMT including the ability to initiate
      and successfully withdraw from immunosuppression following BMT and to attain independence
      from growth factors, red blood cell or platelet transfusions.
