    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After obtaining informed
      consent, participants will be randomized to either consume 0, 15 or 25 grams of resistant
      maltodextrin (RMD) during the first arm of the study. During the first intervention period,
      participants will consume the RMD everyday for 3 weeks. After a 2-week post intervention
      period, participants will be crossed to one of the other treatments for 3 weeks, followed by
      a 2-week post intervention and then receive the final intervention for 3 weeks.

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires and weekly gastrointestinal symptom
      questionnaires during the intervention and post-intervention periods. Stool samples will be
      collected at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Dietary intake will
      also be assessed weekly during each intervention period.
