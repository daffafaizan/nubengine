      have identified that stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and
      sympathoadrenal system acutely. Additionally, there are delayed effects of prior exposure to
      hypoglycemia. The day after being exposed to a hypoglycemic stimulus there are: 1) decreases
      in the catecholamine release to a new hypoglycemic stress; 2) decreases in the muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) response to either a new hypoglycemic challenge or
      transient hypotension; 3) decreases in cardiac vagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS); and 4)
      increases in sensitivity to thermal pain and altered temporal summation (decreased tolerance
      to a repeated minimally painful stimulus). This project will test the hypothesis that these
      delayed changes in autonomic nervous system function are secondary to a rise in ACTH that
      occurs in response to stress.

      Primary Aim. Infusion of ACTH (cosyntropin) will lead the next day to decreased cardiovagal
      baroreflex sensitivity in healthy subjects.
