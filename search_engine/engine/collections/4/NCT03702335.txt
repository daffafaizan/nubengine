      40 subjects will complete the study. This is a 24-wk parallel, single-bind, prospective study
      design with subjects randomly assigned to either receiving comprehensive dietary counselling
      (intervention group) or not receiving comprehensive dietary counselling (control group).
      Subjects in the intervention group will only receive comprehensive dietary counselling for
      first 12-wk and then they will be followed for another 12-wk without comprehensive dietary
      counselling. Subjects in the control group will be followed for 24-wk without any
      intervention. Dietary quality, mental health, sleep quality, daily physical activity and
      quality of life will be assessed and blood lipid-lipoproteins, glucose and insulin
      concentrations will be measured from the collected blood samples.
