      (RCC). Thus, systemic therapy for RCC should still be considered only in patients who have
      contraindications to surgery.

      Results of Phase 3 CheckMate 214 study showed that a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab
      has a significant impact on tumor burden in intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic RCC
      patients with a complete response rate of 11% (Motzer et al. Lancet Oncology 2019). Median
      time to objective response was 2.8 months. Among all complete responders to nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab in the intention-to-treat population, 5% achieved a complete response at the first
      scan, whereas most converted from the partial response at a median of 6.9 months or from the
      stable disease at a median of 11.3 months.

      We hypothesize that this combination could completely eliminate primary tumors in patients
      with small primary (less than 4 cm) ineligible for surgical treatment. There are no studies
      evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in this setting in RCC patients.
