      variations that affect medication-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and medication
      targets. Recent reviews demonstrated significant potential of pharmacogenomic testing in
      improving treatment of major depressive disorder. One of the major barriers towards
      successful implementation of pharmacogenomic testing for patients with major depressive
      disorder is lack of systematic evaluation of impact of this approach in routine clinical care
      settings. The major goal of this study is to systematically evaluate impact of comprehensive
      pharmacogenomic testing on the treatment of major depressive disorder in ambulatory setting.
