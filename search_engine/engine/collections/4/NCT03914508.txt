      the role of memory on food consumption in an overweight population.The pilot study will be an
      open label trial of a memory+behavioral weight loss (M+BWL) group treatment. The treatment
      will be administered in 14 group sessions over 16 weeks. The investigators will recruit
      adults with overweight and obesity and will assess them at baseline (prior to treatment),
      during treatment, post-treatment (immediately following treatment), and follow-up (3 months
      after treatment). Assessments will include body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge
      eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. This study will contribute to the study of
      basic behavioral mechanisms and food intake, could provide a novel model for the treatment of
      obesity, and could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment.
