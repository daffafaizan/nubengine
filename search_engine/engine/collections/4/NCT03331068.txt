      There are, however, problems in the identification of certain disorders that require
      appropriate psychological management. In order to diagnose patients with anxiety more finely,
      a prostate cancer-specific anxiety measurement scale (MAX-PC) was developed and validated.
      This scale includes three sub-dimensions: anxiety related to prostate cancer, anxiety related
      to the PSA assessment and fear of recurrence. This scale generally has good psychometric
      properties which are found in different populations and in different countries. The
      dimensions of the MAX-PC correlate with other anxiety measurement scales such as Beck or
      HADS, but do not show redundancy: it captures a specific anxiety related to the experience of
      patients with prostate cancer.

      To date, this sclae is not validated in French, and its use in the frame of clinical trials
      or in routine practice require a first validation.
