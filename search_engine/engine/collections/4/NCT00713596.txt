      this procedure include a significant recovery following surgery which may often require nasal
      taping and casting. Swelling and bruising in and around the surgical site may persist for
      months after the operation. At present, there is no standard regarding the length of time
      nasal tape and cast should be used following septorhinoplasty. It has never been proven that
      taping or casting is required - in surgeries that require minimal amounts of tissue handling,
      we may not use any tape or cast following the procedure. Homologous fibrin glue has been used
      for various cosmetic facial plastic procedures since the early 1980's. It has been shown to
      decrease bruising and swelling following surgery. This study is being undertaken to evaluate
      these benefits of using fibrin glue in nasal surgery.
