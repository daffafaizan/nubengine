      cancerous tumors using imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
      An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and is available for research use only. 124I-NM404 is only taken up by
      the cancer cells, not the normal cells. Compared to traditional methods such as CT (computed
      tomography) or MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging), 124I-NM404 may help physicians more
      accurately see and evaluate cancerous tumors. This agent has been safely studied in animals
      and a limited number of human patients with lung cancer. This study is being done to
      determine the best dose to use and to fully evaluate the images that result from using this
      new agent.
