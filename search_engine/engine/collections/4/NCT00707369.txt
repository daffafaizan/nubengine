      infection that is followed by destruction of tooth supporting tissues. Standard of care
      consists of lifelong mechanical removal of the biofilm. However, outcome is variable.
      According to recent EFP and AAP reviews, adjunctive antimicrobial therapy may be beneficial.
      We plan to conduct a double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled
      multi-center efficacy study that addresses the following objectives:

        1. What is the size of the benefit of an adjunctive empiric antibiotic therapy compared to
           standard mechanical debridement and oral hygiene instructions in a representative sample
           of German periodontitis patients?

        2. Does the administration of the antibiotic therapy delay recurrence of periodontitis in
           the general population and in specific high risk groups (e.g. smokers) under standard
           supportive therapy?

        3. Is the presence of specific microbial complexes a useful predictor of outcome and
           recurrence of periodontitis?

        4. Does the administration of the antibiotic therapy affect the "oral health related
           quality of life"?

      The primary hypothesis tested is: the administered empiric adjunctive antibiotic therapy
      reduces about one half of the proportion of sites with attachment loss compared to
      subgingival debridement alone over a 27.5-month period in a statistical and clinical
      significant manner.

      To test this hypothesis about 500 patients will be enrolled in the clinical trial. According
      to the intention-to-treat principle, the primary efficacy analysis will include all
      randomized subjects. In addition, a per-protocol analysis will be done.
