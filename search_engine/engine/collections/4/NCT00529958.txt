      the meniscal and chondral structures in the knee, osteoarthritis and an impaired quality of
      life. The successful treatment of an ACL deficient knee aims to preserve the intact meniscus
      and chondral structures, and to provide a functionally stable knee so that patients can
      return to pre-injury activities and restore their quality of life. The current standard of
      care for ACL deficient knees is with a surgical ACL reconstruction procedure. A Cochrane
      Review was done and demonstrated that the existing literature is controversial. To date, no
      existing trial has used validated patient-based outcome assessment, accounted for the
      critical differences between acute and chronic ACL deficiency or used modern techniques to
      ensure randomization concealment and a sufficient sample size to avoid type II error. The
      existing information does not define graft failure or re-ruptures, involve long-term
      follow-up to address osteoarthritis development, nor compare outcomes between single- and
      double-bundle reconstructive techniques. The current standard includes either a patellar
      tendon or quadruple semitendinosus/gracilis tendon autograft reconstruction. The newest
      option is a double-bundle semitendinosus/gracilis graft. This option attempts to restore the
      complex ACL anatomy by using two separate tendon components to reconstruct the ACL. This
      study will measure disease-specific quality of life at short- and long-term post-operative
      intervals (1, 2, 5 and 10 years). Additional secondary outcomes, including the incidence of
      traumatic re-ruptures and graft failures, will also be compared between treatment groups.
