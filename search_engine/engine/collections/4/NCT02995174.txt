      stereopsis before and after training mild amblyopia by perceptual learning through dichoptic
      video game playing.

      Hypothesis: It has been shown that the visual acuity, stereopsis and fixation stability are
      compromised in amblyopic eye. Perceptual learning via video game playing has been found
      effective in improving visual acuity and stereoacuity in moderate and severe amblyopic eyes,
      but there is no study on such treatment in mild amblyopia. In this study, we hypothesize that
      fixation stability, visual acuity and stereopsis will be improved after training by dichoptic
      video game playing in mild amblyopia.

      Methods: Participants (aged 7 or above) with Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) ≤ 0.28
      logMAR in the amblyopic eye and an interocular acuity difference ≥ 0.2 logMAR will be
      recruited. An anaglyphic, contrast balanced dichoptic video game will be provided on an i-Pod
      Touch (Apple Inc.) for 6 weeks of home-based training (60 mins per day). Fixation stability
      quantified using bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA by micro-perimeter (MP) Nidek MP-1),
      BCVA and stereopsis will be assessed before and after treatment.
