    
      This is a pilot/feasibility study of bendamustine, rituximab, and lenalidomide combination
      with a goal of assessing maximum tolerated dose, safety and feasibility of this combination.
      Patients receive rituximab IV over 5-8 hours on day 1, bendamustine hydrochloride IV over
      30-60 minutes on days 1-2, and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Ancillary treatment is available per the protocol (eg, supportive care for rituximab
      infusions).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum-tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine
           and rituximab chemotherapy

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine and
           rituximab chemotherapy

        -  To assess progression-free survival

        -  To assess the overall and complete response rates of lenalidomide in combination with
           bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin
           lymphoma (NHL)

      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during treatment
      for correlative studies. Tumor tissue samples may also be collected.Patients are followed up
      for up to 5 years post-registration.
