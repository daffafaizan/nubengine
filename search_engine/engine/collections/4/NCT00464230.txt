      will be randomized by means of closed numbered envelopes to operation groups:

        1. Two parallel screws (Olmed).

        2. Hemiarthroplasty with Charnley/ Hastings prosthesis. A priori one would expect that
           there would be less morbidity and mortality with the less extensive and quicker
           operation with parallel screw and that a faster and better rehabilitation would be
           achieved with hemiarthroplasty.
