      pruritus medication for the subjects was used first.Then, subjects with "existing
      treatment-resistant" pruritus will continue to receive basic pruritus treatment if the
      corresponding treatment is not sufficiently effective, and the experimental drug or placebo
      will be added to this treatment to evaluate the effectiveness.
