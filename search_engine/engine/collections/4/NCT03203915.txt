      grape seed extracts (GSE) containing only soluble components. In animal models, GSE has been
      shown to prevent increases in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and insulin resistance. In
      humans, there have been improvements in blood pressure, however no significant effect on
      blood cholesterol levels. Whole milled grape marc flours deliver more dietary complexity than
      seed extracts alone. In addition to the extractable and non-extractable polyphenols, flour
      offers dietary fiber, minerals, sterols and polyunsaturated fats. Grape marc flour is
      currently used as a food ingredient that is incorporated into various baked goods. However,
      to obtain good control of the dose level, the product will be provided in capsule form for
      this study. For reference, a ½ cup of of a high polyphenol food such as blueberries, contains
      about 325 milligrams of polyphenols, thus even with the higher dose, participants will be
      receiving an amount of polyphenols that is less than ¼ cup of blueberries. The grape marc
      powder is prepared in a facility that is certified for producing food-grade products, and the
      nutritional composition and safety of the product will be thoroughly evaluated before we
      begin the study. The objective of the current study is to determine if this chardonnay grape
      marc powder enriched with grape seed extract supplementation has beneficial impacts on the
      human blood lipid profile and to correlate gut biome changes to human metabolism.
