    
      Pelvic Organ prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms
      such as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with patient's
      sex life. An ideal procedure for vaginal apical support should provide a durable suspension,
      have minimal complications, and not affect sexual or visceral function.

      Vaginal procedures used for restoring the vaginal apex support include Ischia spinous fascia
      fixation procedure with native tissue and modified total pelvic floor reconstructive surgery
      with mesh. They are both developed and popular in China. Clinical practice showed that they
      were both safe, efficient and cost-effective. Recurrent rates of both procedures after 1 year
      follow-up were about 10%, and quality of life improved significantly from the baseline, while
      the.complications are different.

      The purpose of this multicenter, prospective, and comparative study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of these two procedures in the treatment of symptomatic pelvic organ
      prolapse Stage III in China.
