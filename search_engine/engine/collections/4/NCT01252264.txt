      available to investigators who are studying birth defects of the head, face, and eye. Data
      and samples will be deidentified prior to use by other investigators. Researchers will be
      allowed to use samples and medical information only after approval by the FaceBase
      Biorepository Data Access Committee. Once the FaceBase Biorepository Data Access Committee
      has established that the proposed use of the samples and clinical data meet the criteria for
      sound, ethical research, then the investigator will be granted permission to use a small
      portion of the sample and have access to clinical data stored in the computer database.
      Investigators who are not part of the FaceBase Biorepository Research Team will not know
      participant's names or other personally identifiable information.
