      III breast cancer. Participation in a preoperative chemotherapy trial investigating
      anthracycline and taxane based regimen is allowed, but not mandatory for all patients.
      Patients must have significant remaining tumor tissue in the breast and/or axillary lymph
      node. This implies resistance to further chemotherapy and a clinically relevant risk for
      relapse. Bisphosphonates have a distinct mechanism of action and have demonstrated efficacy
      in the treatment of breast cancer with metastasis to the bone as well as adjuvant treatment
      after surgery of primary breast cancer. The 3rd generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has
      a favorable toxicity profile and can be conveniently given to patients over a long term
      period.
