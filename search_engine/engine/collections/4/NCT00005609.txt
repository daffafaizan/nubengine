      patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia receiving rituximab. II. Determine the
      associated toxicities with this treatment, specifically the frequency of febrile or
      hypotensive events, in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no). Patients with
      prior treatment are further stratified according to type of treatment (alkylating agents vs
      purine nucleoside analogues). Patients receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (33 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 36 months.
