      un-manipulated autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) using the patient's own lymphocytes
      collected using apheresis, and infused after the completion of radiation/chemoradiation.
      Primary Objective To investigate the preliminary efficacy of autologous lymphocyte infusion
      (ALI) in improving the absolute lymphocyte counts in lung and esophageal cancer patients who
      had undergone chemo-radiation (CRT). Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of ALI in patients who had undergone
           chemoradiation.

        2. To identify lymphocyte clonal populations in the tissue that are specific for tumor
           cells

        3. To identify immune reconstitution in the peripheral blood shaped by ALI.

        4. To conduct clonal analysis using T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing from tumor and from
           peripheral blood.
