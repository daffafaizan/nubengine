      motion of the cervical disc. Its concept is based on a ball and socket joint, anchored
      between adjacent vertebral bodies. The modular prosthesis comprises the following elements:
      an inferior CoCr plate component anchored in the endplate of the caudal vertebral body. The
      UHMWPE inlay is securely fixed in this inferior component. The second element is the superior
      CoCr component, which is anchored in the end plate of the cranial vertebral body. It forms a
      ball joint with the inlay of the inferior plate component.

      The activ C product range enables reconstruction of various disc heights as well as
      adaptation to the end plate sizes. Secure primary anchorage of the prosthesis to the
      vertebral bodies is achieved by convexly shaped superior end pla tes and fixation means
      (spikes and grooves on the superior end plate, a small keel on the inferior end plate),
      whereas secondary stability is facilitated by an osseointegrative Plasmapore® coating.

      The objective of the study is to collect outcome information on the Activ® C Disc Prosthesis.
