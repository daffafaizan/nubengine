      trial of adjunct rTMS to the right DLPFC for ADM with PTSD receiving TAU at Laurel Ridge
      Treatment Center (LRTC; San Antonio, TX). Methods: Consenting ADM receiving TAU for PTSD at
      LRTC will be randomized to receive 20 consecutive days of adjunct rTMS according to one of
      these two treatment arms: Arm 1 TAU plus rTMS to the right DLPFC and Arm 2 TAU plus sham
      rTMS. At UTHSCSA's Research Imaging Institute (RII), where all brain imaging will be
      conducted, rTMS treatment plans will be generated based on (pre-treatment) anatomical and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to guide the optimal robotic positioning of the
      TMS coil to accurately target each subject's DLPFC. Initial diagnostic interview and weekly
      clinical follows ups will be conducted at the LRTC by research clinicians blinded to
      subjects' research group. A comparison of baseline brain connectivity measurements with
      subjects' neuroimaging follow ups conducted at treatment Week 3 will be conducted to identify
      network connectivity changes potentially associated to treatment response.
