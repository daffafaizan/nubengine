      in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of Başkent University.

      We enrolled 185 participants who were admitted to hospital for weight loss therapy. After
      initial evaluation, all participants were prescribed an appropriate diet with caloric
      restriction and an exercise program and underwent a follow-up examination 3±1 months later.
      At the end of the follow up, 103 participants attended to the research. Anthropometric,
      bioimpedance and laboratory measurements performed at baseline and second visit. We
      calculated the difference in anthropometric, bioimpedance and laboratory measurements between
      the first and second evaluations. Correlation analysis, multivariate linear regression
      analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis performed to assess associations of
      laboratory metabolic variables with a decrease in anthropometric and bioimpedance analysis
      (BIA) measures, after diet and/or exercise therapy. The secondary aim was to determine
      whether abdominal BIA was better than simple anthropometric measurements and conventional BIA
      for assessing changes in metabolic variables.
