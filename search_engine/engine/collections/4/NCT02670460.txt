    
      This study is being conducted to determine if in an anaesthetized (sedated, intubated and
      mechanically ventilated) subject the LIVE Catheter can be inserted percutaneously and
      activated via the electrical stimulator to stimulate the left and right phrenic nerves
      causing the diaphragm to contract in synchrony with mechanical ventilator breaths via phrenic
      nerve stimulation from a transvenously delivered electrical current.
