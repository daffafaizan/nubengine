      implantation in HBR patients. A minimum of 640 to a maximum of 800 subjects will be
      registered from approximately 50 sites in the United States and Canada. Subject registration
      is capped at 75 per site. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be
      assessed at 1-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat
      coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 1
      month (prior to 1-month visit but at least 28 days) after stenting AND have been compliant
      with 1-month DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for
      > 7 consecutive days are considered as "1-month clear", and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor as early as 28 days and continued with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month
      follow-up.

      All registered subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The
      data collected from the XIENCE 28 USA Study will be pooled with the data from the XIENCE 28
      Global Study (Protocol # ABT-CIP-10235) to compare with the historical control of non-complex
      HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to 12 months from the XIENCE V USA
      Study.
