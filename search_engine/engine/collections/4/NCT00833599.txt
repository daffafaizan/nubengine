      (developed following surgery or trauma) lymphedema, hereditary lymphedema or other
      lympho-vascular disorders. The causes of these disorders, and the means to distinguish
      between them, is not available from existing diagnostics. A method to monitor lymphatic
      function could assist in the development of new therapies, the prediction of a patient's
      susceptibility to develop these disorders, and the evaluation of patient's conditions or
      responses to therapy and treatment. In this Phase I/II trial, we inject Indocyanine Green
      (ICG) off-label as a lymph contrast agent and use a custom designed fluorescence imager to
      conduct near-infrared fluorescence imaging to dynamically follow lymphatic trafficking in
      subjects. Blood is also collected for DNA analysis. The resulting images are analyzed, and
      the phenotypes observed in both normal and diseased subjects are used to correlate to
      mutations of specific genes reported to be associated with lymphatic development.
