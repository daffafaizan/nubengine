      carcinoma after receiving treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without
      topotecan. II. Compare progression-free survival of these patients after receiving these
      treatment regimens. III. Compare the response rate and response duration in these patients
      treated with these regimens. IV. Determine the toxic effects of the combination of
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and topotecan in these patients. V. Compare the toxic effects of
      these treatment regimens in these patients. VI. Compare quality of life of these patients
      treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and stage (stage IIB and stage III optimally debulked to no greater than
      1 cm residual tumor vs stage IV regardless of residual tumor or residual tumor greater than 1
      cm). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel
      IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 0.5-1 hour on day 1 and topotecan IV over 0.5 hour on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses (topotecan is administered for 4
      courses only). Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Quality of life is assessed before courses 1, 3, and 5
      and at 3 weeks and 3 months after completion of treatment in both treatment arms; before
      courses 1 and 3 of topotecan in arm I; and at 6 months after completion of treatment in arm
      II. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 914 patients (457 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study over 2 years.
