      hypertrophy. While hyperplasia is associated with preservation of insulin sensitivity,
      hypertrophic AT exerts a number of metabolic defects. The mechanisms by which hyperplasia is
      suppressed at the expense of AT hypertrophy remain unknown, but it is expected that the
      hypertrophy of adipocytes is primarily driven by insufficient recruitment and differentiation
      of available preadipocytes. The limitation of hyperplasia occurs already in non-obese healthy
      subjects who are genetically predisposed to Type 2 Diabetes. Using these and control
      subjects, the LIMEX project aims to analyze the mechanisms of AT expandability. The project
      will combine in vivo characterization of AT and in vitro studies on human preadipocytes
      derived from AT biopsies obtained during clinical study. In vitro, proliferation,
      adipogenesis and lipogenesis of adipose cells will be monitored and these properties will be
      related to the degree of AT hypertrophy in vivo, insulin sensitivity and genetic
      predisposition to metabolic complications.
