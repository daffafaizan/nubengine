      tolerability of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab at increasing
      doses in pediatric patients with advanced solid malignancies and hematological malignancies
      (including lymphomas) and for whom no standard of care treatments exist. Although treatment
      efficacy is not a primary objective of this study given its early phase nature, the patients
      screened for this study have no curative options and this study offers the potential of some
      benefit.

      The study will also characterize the PK of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with
      tremelimumab in children and adolescents and explore potential biological activity and
      immunogenicity by assessing pharmacodynamics, anti drug antibody (ADA) levels, and anti-tumor
      activity. The results from this trial will form the basis for decisions for potential future
      pediatric studies.
