      performance is growing throughout the scientific literature and has physiologically plausible
      mechanisms, likely through the diverse molecular and enzymatic actions of individual (or
      combinations of) minerals (such as Calcium and Magnesium).

      Despite the biological potential, there is little consciences whether mineral supplementation
      can improving markers of, and exercise performance. One recent investigation of deep ocean
      mineral water (high in marine minerals) showed that when consumed prior to exercise, blood
      lactate response improved with hyperthermal running and is supported in animal models -
      however, this is not supported elsewhere in humans. Nonetheless, others have shown, in human
      models, that deep ocean mineral water may improve exercise recovery, aerobic exercise
      performance, improve lower leg power output and hydration status compared to either placebo
      or sports drink. Furthermore, animal models support these plausibilities with improved
      mitochondrial biogenesis, biomolecules of exercises performance, cardiovascular hemodynamics,
      inflammatory cytokine responses to exercise and overall exercise adaptation.

      As ocean minerals are absorbed by marine organisms, Algae species such as Lithothamnion have
      higher concentrations of the same ocean minerals but structured differently at the nano scale
      and thus may have the potential to be more effective at improving exercise phenotypes.
      Therefore, the proposed exploratory RCT will investigate the effects of water soluble
      Lithothamnion species on exhaustive exercise-induced lactate accumulation, recovery and power
      output in trained cyclists, compared to a placebo.
