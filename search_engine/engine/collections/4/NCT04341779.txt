      clinic in Durban. HIV-positive individuals aged 16 years and above, who are initiating a
      tenofovir-based, first-line ART will be randomized to receive POC VL testing and POC TFV
      adherence testing, versus standard-of-care (SoC) viral load testing. The schedule for VL
      testing and management of VL test results will follow South African guidelines for HIV VL
      testing after ART initiation. 540 participants will be randomized (1:1) at ART initiation
      into the intervention arm (routine POC TFV adherence testing with POC VL monitoring) or the
      standard-of-care (SoC) arm (no objective TFV adherence testing and SoC VL monitoring).

      Participants will be followed to compare concentrations between study arms at 24 weeks after
      ART initiation and a composite outcome of VL suppression and retention in care between the
      study arms at 72 weeks after ART initiation. The study will use process evaluation data,
      interviews and focus groups with patients and staff to assess implementation of the POC
      assays. Micro-costing will be conducted to estimate intervention costs.
