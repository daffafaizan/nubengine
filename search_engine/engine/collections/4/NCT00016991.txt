        -  Determine the activity of ZD 1839 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first
           relapse.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor status in these
           patients and activity of this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
