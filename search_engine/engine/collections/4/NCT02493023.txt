      bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (EBUS). An in-house research and
      development navigation platform displays the intraoperative position of the endoscope inside
      the airways, and shows its exact position in three-dimensional (3D) maps made from the
      patients' own preoperative CT images. The navigation system is used for acquiring position
      data from a bronchoscope or EBUS-scope (same sort of output data acquired from both
      endoscopes in this study) equipped with a position sensor for electromagnetic tracking. From
      intraoperative position data, the accuracy of the image-to-patient registration and the
      navigation system accuracy can be calculated. When targeting a certain lymph node or tumor
      for sampling, the pulmonologist can use electromagnetic navigation combined with preoperative
      CT images to navigate directly, precisely and accurately to the area of interest. Functional
      systems for navigated bronchoscopy and EBUS may therefore lead to considerable improvements
      in lung cancer diagnosis and mediastinal staging.
