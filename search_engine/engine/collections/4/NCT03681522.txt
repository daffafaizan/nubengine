      biopsy-related pain leading to changes in the type of anesthetic agents and site of
      injection. Of these anesthetics and combinations, pelvic plexus block and periprostatic nerve
      block seem to be the very effective way to control prostate biopsy-related pain. However, few
      studies have compared these two methods.
