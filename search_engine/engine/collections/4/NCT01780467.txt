      Many decisions involve the possibility of gaining or losing relative to the status quo. The
      loss aversion behaviour is a cognitive concept explaining that people are more sensitive to
      the possibility of losing objects or money than they are to the possibility of gaining the
      same objects or amounts of money.

      We hypothesised that dopamine could be involved in the loss aversion behaviour. To highlight
      this, we have chosen a model of dopaminergic depletion : the Parkinson's disease The primary
      purpose of this protocol is to study the role of dopamine in the loss aversion phenomenon by
      comparing brain activity in parkinsonian patient with and without treatment with L Dopa, when
      they are exposed to mixed (gain/loss) gambles using money.

      The second purpose is to highlight the role of a dopamine depletion by comparing patient
      without treatment vs healthy paired control.

      2 groups :

        -  20 parkinsonian patients (tested two times : with and without treatment by L dopa)

        -  20 healthy paired control

      Description of the protocol for patients :

      J0 : Inclusion visit (duration : 4h):

        -  motor assessment (UPDRS)

        -  neuropsychological and psychiatric assessment (MMS, MATTIS, BREF, Stroop, Ardouin scale,
           UPPS, MADRS, Hamilton, LARS).

      J0+1 day and J0 +2 days : 2 visits of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) acquisition (with or
      without treatment) :

      Each acquisition was composed by an orientation sequence+ an anatomic sequence + a functional
      sequence.

      For healthy subjects, they have only one visit of 2 hours including a MMS, a MADRS and the
      MRI acquisitions.
