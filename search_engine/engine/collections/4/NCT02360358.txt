    
      Multicenter, randomised clinical trial in out patient in which patients with chronic
      (arterio-) venous leg/foot ulcers are treated with an autologous cultured human living skin
      substitute (Tiscover®: test group) or with Acellular donor dermis (AS210: control group).
      During a pre-inclusion evaluation period of 4 weeks (non healing) chronicity of ulcer is
      ensured (ulcer size change of < 30%). To determine ulcer type ABI, Doppler and CEAP is
      performed.

      The test group will receive 2 applications of Tiscover®. Week 0: wound activating
      pre-treatment, application of at least one quarter of the wound surface. Week 1: removal of
      patches, application of patches on total wound surface.

      The control group (16 patients) will follow the same application protocol.
