    
      -  Participants will be receiving two study medications, SOM230 and RAD001, during each
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks.

        -  For the first four weeks of treatment, the participant will self-administer the SOM230
           twice a day by subcutaneous injection. If they tolerate the SOM230 after 4 weeks, they
           will switched to the long-acting SOM230 which will be administered during scheduled
           treatment visits once every 4 weeks. For the first two weeks after switching to the
           long-acting SOM230, participants will continue to self-administer the short-acting
           SOM230 twice a day.

        -  RAD001 will be taken orally once every day.

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle, a physical exam and blood tests will be performed. Following
           every 2 cycles of treatment an assessment of the tumor by CT scan wil be performed.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (pK) blood samples will be taken on days 1 and 15 of cycle one. The pK
           samples will be taken right before the study drug is administered and then 1, 2, 3, and
           5 hours later.
