      in HIV-infected children are similar to those of HIV-uninfected children with classic growth
      hormone deficiency. Evidence suggests that therapeutic administration of growth hormone (GH)
      can induce anabolic effects, reverse pathologic catabolism, and perhaps even improve immune
      function. As survival to adolescence and beyond improves with modern therapy in children with
      HIV infection, it will become increasingly important to address the problems of stunting and
      short stature in this population. [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/04/01: Recent evidence suggests that
      needle-free delivery is preferred by young children below the age of ten years. Given the
      advantages of a needle-free delivery system for the administration of growth hormone, most
      significantly the reduction of risk for HIV contaminated needle-stick injuries to care
      providers and other household members, it has been decided to use this method of study drug
      delivery for all study participants.]

      Children are assigned randomly to 1 of the following treatment groups:

      Group 1: Children receive a single dose of r-hGH once a day. Group 2: Children receive half
      the dose of r-hGH that Group 1 receives, once a day.

      Group 3a: Children receive no r-hGH for the first 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48
      weeks] of the study. After Week 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: Week 48], they receive the
      same dose as that of Group 1.

      Group 3b: Children receive no r-hGH for the first 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48
      weeks] of the study. After Week 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: Week 48], they receive the
      same dose as that of Group 2.

      Subcutaneous injections are administered [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/04/01: using a needle-free
      device], daily for 96 weeks in Groups 1 and 2; after 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48
      weeks] on study, the treatment-delayed control group (Group 3) receives injections for 72
      weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48 weeks]. The first injection is at the clinic and
      parents/guardians are trained how to prepare and administer the injections. Children are
      closely monitored for toxicity, with dosing adjustments if needed. Evaluations and laboratory
      tests are done at clinic visits every 4 weeks to determine growth indicators, body
      chemistries, CD4 cell counts, HIV-1 RNA PCR, and anti-hGH antibodies and for routine
      hematology testing, dietary intake assessment, and MRI scans. [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: MRI
      scans are no longer performed.]
