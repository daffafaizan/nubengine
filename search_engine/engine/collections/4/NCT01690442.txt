      risk reduction intervention to decrease new cases of HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) and incidence
      of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as to reduce unsafe injection practices
      and increase condom use among injecting drug users (IDUs) and their heterosexual intimate
      partners in Kazakhstan. Central Asia has experienced one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS
      epidemics due to a sharp increase in injection drug use. For the proposed study, the
      participants will be 400 IDUs and their heterosexual intimate partners. These 400 couples
      will be randomized to one of two interventions: a 5session couplesbased HIV/STI risk
      reduction intervention or a 5session couplesbased wellness promotion intervention, which will
      serve as a control condition. Participants will be assessed with repeated measures at
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12months postintervention. The primary behavioral outcomes are
      selfreported proportion of injection acts in which needles or syringes are shared in the past
      90 days and proportion of condom protected acts of sexual intercourse in the past 90 days.
      The primary biological outcomes are the rate of new HIV and HCV cases, and the cumulative
      incidence of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis over the 12month postintervention period. The
      proposed study will advance the understanding of HIV/HCV/STI risk reduction among IDUs and
      thereby may help to stem the rising epidemic of HIV, HCV, and STIs in Kazakhstan and Central
      Asia.
