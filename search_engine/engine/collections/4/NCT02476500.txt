      gynecologists (,experts') will be included. All participants undergo a video training with
      demonstration of the LLETZ procedure on a training model using a sausage as previously
      described (Hefler et al. 2014). After the Video Training, the LLETZ procedure will be
      performed by the study probands and their performance will be assessed using an Objective
      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) protocol with 23 consecutive items. The
      exact time Frame for the assessment of the Primary outcome is within 1 hour after the Video
      Training. Using metrical and non-metrical items, the construct validity of the LLETZ training
      model to distinguish between experts and novices will be assessed. The study hypothesis is
      that the LLETZ Training model as used in this study has construct validity and is therefore a
      valid Instrument to discriminate between experts and novices. Secondary endpoints are
      differences in OSATS scores within the group of novices based on gender and handyness, as
      well as satisfaction of the novices with the learning experience.
