    
      A Phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation pilot study designed to obtain preliminary safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy information on visilizumab administered as a first-line
      therapy to patients with acute, Grade II, III, or IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It is
      anticipated that up to 34 patients at up to 10 study centers could be eligible for enrollment
      in this study. Patients will be eligible for enrollment within 24 hours of beginning standard
      steroid treatment (2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone IV, or 10 mg/kg hydrocortisone IV, per day).
      Steroids will be rapidly tapered over one week following visilizumab administration.
