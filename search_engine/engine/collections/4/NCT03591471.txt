      follows a large-sample multicenter centerrandom open-label controlled perspective method,
      enrolls HSPN children with hematuria associated with proteinuria and isolated proteinuria
      from 2 to 18 years of age, classifys five traditional Chinese medicine patterns of syndrome:
      wind-heat complicated with blood stasis, blood-heat complicated with blood stasis, yin
      deficiency complicated with blood stasis, both qi and yin deficiency complicated with blood
      stasis,damp-heat complicated with blood stasis. For TCM group,according to the severity of
      HSPN, stepped treatment should be taken. The initial dosage of GTW for severe HSPN is
      2mg/kg/d, continued with 1.5mg/kg/d and 1mg/kg/d; The initial dosage of GTW for light HSPN is
      1.5mg/kg/d, continued with 1mg/kg/d. On the above base, the comprehensive treatment are taken
      combined with TCM syndrome differentiation, medicated with Sulfotanshinone Sodium
      Injection.For controlled group,the treatment for severe HSPN is prednisone combined with
      heparin plus lotensin and dipyridamole tablets;for light HSPN is heparin plus lotensin and
      dipyridamole tablets.12 weeks after treatment, the third-party statistics evaluate the
      efficacy and effect,and a follow-up lasting 36 weeks will go on.
