      lispro. Eligible participants were switched to a fixed evening LY2605541dosing regimen at the
      beginning of the 12-week lead-in period. LY2605541 was administered SQ once-daily using a
      prefilled insulin device. The LY2605541dose was adjusted using a dosing algorithm adapted
      from Bartley and Bolli (Bartley et al. 2008, Bolli et al. 2009) based on the participant's
      blood glucose (BG) values and documented hypoglycemia during the previous week. Participants
      not already receiving insulin lispro for prandial dosing were switched to insulin lispro at
      the beginning of the 12-week lead-in period. Adjustments to insulin lispro doses were based
      on the insulin dosing algorithms adapted from Riddle and Bergenstal (Riddle et al. 2003,
      Bergenstal et al. 2008). At the time of randomization, participants were randomized to begin
      either the fixed evening dosing regimen or the variable time dosing regimen. Each participant
      was crossed over to the alternate regimen after 12 weeks. The insulin device (prefilled pen)
      remained the same throughout the study.
