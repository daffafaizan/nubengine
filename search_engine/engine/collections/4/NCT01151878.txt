      adulthood and decrease quality of life. The standard treatment, mostly osmotic laxatives such
      as lactulose or polyethyleneglycols, are often ineffective and may cause adverse events.
      Therefore, alternative treatment measures are being searched for.

      Glucomannan, a water-soluble fiber polysaccharide from the tubers of the Japanese Konjac
      plant, has been reported to be effective in constipated children. To date, 2 randomized
      trials were performed.1,2 One evaluated the effect as glucomannan as an adjunct to standard
      treatment.1 Another was conducted in neurologically impaired children, who constitute a
      specific population that cannot be compared to patients with functional constipation.2 In
      both trials, the number of patients was relatively small.

      Well-powered, randomized controlled study is required to evaluate clinical effectiveness of
      glucomannan as a sole treatment in childhood functional constipation.
