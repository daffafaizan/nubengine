      allergic severe asthma. In this observational study patients aged over 18 year with
      uncontrolled severe persistent asthma are selected for add-on therapy with omalizumab.
      Patients were on high dose of ICS and had a documented history of 2-6 exacerbations requiring
      treatment with systemic corticosteroids ( with >15 mg/day prednisone or other medications at
      similar dose, for at least 3 days). The individual dose and frequency of omalizumab
      administration is assessed from the dosing table. Lung function tests and asthma
      questionnaires (ACQ, AQLQ and RQLQ) are used in the aim of assessing clinical improvement
      after omalizumab treatment. Induced sputum (IS) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are used
      as a simple non-invasive methods for monitoring cellular and biochemical changes in the
      airways. Total blood eosinophil count, IS cytology, IS and EBC periostin and IL-6
      concentrations are measured. Analyses are performed at entry and after 16, 52 and 104,156
      weeks of omalizumab treatment.
