      will continue on to one of three treatment arms in Part 2-A which consists of a single lower
      dose of MK-1775 in combination with standard chemotherapy: 1) MK-1775 +Gemcitabine (1000
      mg/m^2), 2) MK-1775 + Cisplatin (75 mg/m^2) or 3) MK-1775 +Carboplatin at an area under the
      time curve concentration of 5 mg/min/ml (AUC5). Following completion of Part 2-A, MK-1775
      will be administered twice daily (BID) for 2.5 days (multi-dose) starting concomitantly with
      each administration of chemotherapy in Part 2-B. After a preliminary combination MTD of
      MK-1775 and chemotherapy has been established in Part 2B, the MTD confirmation expansion will
      occur in Part 3.
