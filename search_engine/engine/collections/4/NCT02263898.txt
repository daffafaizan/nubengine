      I. One year progression free survival (PFS) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain biopsy samples from patients treated with an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and
      MEK162 to study adaptive and acquired resistance as well as melanoma evolutionary patterns.

      II. Study molecular changes of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance to LGX818 and
      MEK162 in circulating melanoma cells.

      III. Study plasma samples for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), microribonucleic acid
      (microRNA) and protein signatures of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance.

      IV. Explore the median progression free survival and overall survival of patients receiving
      an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and MEK162.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive LGX818 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and MEK162 PO twice daily (BID)
      continuously for 8 weeks, followed by intermittent dosing in subsequent cycles (3 weeks off
      therapy, 5 weeks on therapy). Cycles repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
