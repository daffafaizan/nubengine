      admissions. When a surgical intervention is not required, usual treatment combines hydration
      and anti-inflammatory drugs.

      Alpha1-blockers, firstly developed as anti-hypertensive drugs, are now also used in the
      management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, due to their relaxing properties on the urinary
      tract. The aim of the study is to investigate whether tamsulosin could lower the delay of
      elimination of the stone in patients with pelvis ureterolithiasis. Patients are randomized to
      receive either tamsulosin or a placebo in addition to usual treatment until stone
      elimination. Efficacy is assessed by evaluating the time to spontaneous passage of the stone
      between day 1 and day 42, the need for surgery and pain recurrences.
