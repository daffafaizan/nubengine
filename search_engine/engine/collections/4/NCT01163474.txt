        1. To compare surgeons' decisions on patient disposition between V-visits and FTF-visits
           (gold standard).

        2. To assess the acceptability to patients and surgeons of using V-visits in the
           postoperative care of cardiac surgical patients;

        3. To assess the technical feasibility of using community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs)
           for delivery of postoperative cardiac surgical care;

        4. To determine the recruitment rate for eligible subjects.

      We plan to conduct this pilot study at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center
      (MEDVAMC) in Houston, Texas, along with satellite CBOC facilities in Lufkin and Conroe. Once
      the accuracy, acceptability, and feasibility of the use of video conferencing (VC) in the
      postoperative care for cardiac surgical patients are established, we will submit a full
      proposal to conduct a two-arm RCT in future.
