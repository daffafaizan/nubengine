      bacteria and phage strains using pore strips on up to 400 human subjects. An additional P.
      acnes visual detection method (VISIOPOR Â® PP34N) will be used in this study as per PI
      decision to explore whether there is a correlation between P. acnes bacterial presence and
      fluorescent signal.
