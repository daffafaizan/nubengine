      (PPH) as the loss of more than 1,000 mL after cesarean delivery. In the majority of cases,
      uterine atony is responsible for the occurrence of excessive bleeding during or following
      childbirth. The Millennium Development Goal of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75 %
      by 2015 will remain beyond the investigator reach unless prioritize the prevention and
      treatment of PPH in low-resource countries. Consequently, the administration of uterotonic
      drugs during cesarean section (CS) has become essential to diminish the risk of PPH and
      improve maternal safety. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog proven in several
      randomized controlled trials to be effective in preventing PPH because of its strong
      uterotonic effects. In addition, misoprostol is inexpensive, stable at room temperature, and
      easy to administer. Misoprostol has been broadly studied in the prevention and treatment of
      PPH after vaginal delivery; however, its use in conjunction with CS has not been investigated
      as much.T he buccal route is recognized as having the greatest benefit due to its rapid
      uptake, long-acting effect, and greatest bioavailability compared with other routes of
      misoprostol administration. Anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid (TA), reduce
      the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients. On the other hand, it has been suggested that
      TA administration reduces blood loss and the incidence of PPH in females after vaginal or
      elective CS. The investigators designed this study to evaluate and compare these two new
      therapeutic options in controlling PPH following emergent CS.
