    
      This study is a multicenter prospective observational study to show non-inferiority of
      clinical efficacy for small molecular inhibitors after 48 week of treatment to biologic
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in patients having moderately to severely
      active RA and who have been intolerant to conventional synthetic disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) including methotrexate.

      Primary end point is a percentage of participants of achieving low disease activity according
      to Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-Erythrocyte Sedientation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at weeks 24.
      A total of 506 RA patients will be included, and allocated in ratio of 1:1 to bDMARD group
      and small molecule inhibitor group. Group allocation is determined by shared-decision making,
      so that the number of participants could be re-assessed according to recruitment status of
      participatns.
