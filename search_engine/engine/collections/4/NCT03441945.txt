      disease. However, the incompletion of small bowel examination may reduce the diagnostic
      accuracy, which mainly caused by delayed capsule gastric emptying. Thus the aim of this study
      was to validate the effect of magnetic steering on enhancing gastric emptying and mucosal
      visualization within duodenum during magnetically controlled capsule gastroscopy (MCCG)
      examination.

      Methods: As a historical prospective cohort study, the research continuously enrolled 100
      patients undergone MCCG between May to December 2017 as the intervention group with magnetic
      steering of capsule in the pylorus and duodenum, and randomly selected 100 patients before
      May 2017 from the database as the control group with passive movement of the capsule. The
      difference of the pyloric transit time (PTT) and duodenal papilla detection rate (DPDR)
      between the two groups were compared, and related factors were also investigated.
