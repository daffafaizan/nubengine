      the face and can distort lip anatomy and lead to disfunction. Infantile hemangiomas in lip
      had significantly higher incidence than the others. It is often difficult to decide which
      patient with an lip hemangioma is at higher risk.

      The investigators are interested in conducting a study on the clinical features of lip
      hemangiomas. The investigators are collecting medical records and photos of lip hemangiomas,
      including demographic information, maternal process, birth, location, size and complication.
      Based on the data, sum up the main points of clinical characteristics and complication.
