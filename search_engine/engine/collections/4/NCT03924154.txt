    
      This is an exploratory Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of RVT-1201 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

      Study participation for each patient will last approximately 3 months and will consist of a
      screening period (up to 28 days in duration), a baseline period (day 1, pre-dose), a 6-week
      treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up period.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 patients at approximately 20 centers across the United
      States and Canada.
