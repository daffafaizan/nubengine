    
      In five sites in Sweden (Linköping, Norrköping, Jönköping, Kalmar and Stockholm), 40
      consenting adult patients with mild to moderate drug-susceptible pulmonary TB will be
      recruited.

      The study participants are randomized to receive either 6-month standardized TB treatment
      (n=10) or a 4-month regimen (n=30) of rifampicin (RIF) 35 mg/kg and isoniazid (INH) 5 mg/kg
      complemented the first 8 weeks by pyrazinamide (PZA) 40 mg/kg and ethambutol (EMB) 15-20
      mg/kg.

      First-line drug concentration is determined at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h Day 1 and Week 2
      and potential side effects thoroughly monitored throughout the study.

      Early bactericidal activity (EBA) and sputum culture conversion are evaluated by time to
      culture positivity (TTP) in liquid medium system BACTEC MGIT (MGIT, mycobacteria growth
      indicator tube) 960 of induced sputum samples collected at day 0, 5 and at week 1, 2 and 8
      after treatment initiation.

      Clinical symptoms are assessed by a clinical scoring tool (TBscore II). Final treatment
      outcome and occurrence of relapse after the end of treatment are recorded according to World
      Health Organization (WHO) definitions.

      Peak drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 0-24h
      will be estimated by non-compartmental analysis and conditions for early therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM) of high-dose RIF/PZA will be explored by model-based analysis.

      Primary and main secondary outcomes in the study are the distribution of pharmacokinetics
      (Cmax, AUC) of high-dose PZA/RIF regimen, safety in terms of incidence of adverse
      event/severe adverse event (AE/SAE) probably related or related to TB treatment, and drug
      exposure (AUC) of high-dose PZA/RIF in relation to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
      drug-susceptibility level (MIC) compared with standard-of-care and suggested
      literature-derived pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets.
