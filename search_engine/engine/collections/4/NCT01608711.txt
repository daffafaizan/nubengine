      gemcitabine administration. If subjects have grade 4 adverse events considered to be related
      to AGS-1C4D4 at anytime during the study, AGS-1C4D4 treatment will be discontinued for that
      subject.

      Subjects will continue to have their tumor status assessed by computerized tomography (CT)
      and magnetic resonance (MRI) scans according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST Version 1.1) guidelines every eight weeks (Q8W). Subjects without evidence of disease
      progression will continue to receive AGS-1C4D4 and gemcitabine until intolerability, disease
      progression or consent withdrawal.

      Subjects who discontinue AGS-1C4D4 for any reason will undergo an end of study visit 4 weeks
      after their last AGS-1C4D4 infusion.
