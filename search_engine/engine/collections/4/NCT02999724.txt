      to Mount Sinai Hospital eligible for surgery with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms requiring
      hysterectomy with other pelvic reconstruction (repair of cystocele and/or rectocele, with or
      without TVT) will be provided with a written informed consent to be randomized to either
      receiving pre-operative gabapentin single dose or placebo 2 hours prior to surgery. The
      single dose of gabapentin will be 600 mg for patients under 65 years old and 300 mg for those
      65 years old and above. All patients will have pre-operative assessment according to the
      usual routine that will include urogynecological history taking, physical examination,
      urodynamic testing and blood work. Urodynamic testing will include measurement of the
      post-void residual by urethral catheterization or bladder scan, uroflowmetry, a filling
      cystometrogram and urethral pressure profilometry. Medication and placebo will be prepared by
      the hospital pharmacy to look alike to blind staff and patients. Medication or placebo will
      be given with other pre-anesthesia medications such as celecoxib and acetaminophen according
      to usual protocol. Routine peri-operative surgical/anesthesia management will be unchanged
      from the usual care. Post-operative pain score will be measured using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) from 1 to 10. Total Opioids use during the first 24 hours after surgery will be
      calculated from patients' paper and electronic chart, and conversion will be made to morphine
      equivalents.
