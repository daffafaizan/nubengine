      available weight loss program, on changes in body weight. The current investigation aims to
      add to this body of evidence by providing additional data on changes in body weight and
      enhance the current evidence-base in regards to evaluating other health-related outcomes.

      There is no evidence that demonstrates whether or not the weight loss as a result of the
      Weight Watchers program elicits changes in health-related outcomes related to aerobic
      capacity, flexibility, functional fitness, sleep, and other psychological measures.
      Additionally, within a scientific research protocol, measures of adherence and satisfaction
      have not been evaluated. This study will evaluate these outcomes beyond weight changes
      achieved across the 24-week program.
