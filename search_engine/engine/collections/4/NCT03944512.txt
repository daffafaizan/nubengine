      maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortality. Women who experience preeclampsia in one
      pregnancy are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy than those
      who have never experienced the condition. There is evidence from laboratory studies and
      clinical trials, as well as biological plausibility, to suggest that statins may prevent the
      development of preeclampsia by reversing various pathways associated with preeclampsia.
      Pravastatin has a favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties.

      The study is a randomized placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trial of 1,550 women with
      a prior history of preeclampsia that required delivery at less than 34 weeks, randomized to
      either 20mg pravastatin or an identical appearing placebo daily until delivery. Women with a
      singleton or twin gestation will be randomized between 12 weeks 0 days and 16 weeks 6 days
      will be followed monthly during pregnancy and then at 6 weeks postpartum. Children will have
      follow-up visits at 2 and 5 years of age to assess growth, cognition, behavior, motor skills,
      vision and hearing.
