    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of dendritic cell (DC)-AdGM carbonic anhydrase IX
      (CAIX) administered by intradermal injections at study doses and schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical antitumor effects following study treatment according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1. Parameters include
      objective response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]), duration of response in
      patients with objective response, and time to disease progression.

      II. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by enzyme-linked immunospot
      (ELISpot) for numeric determination of CAIX specific T cells in blood.

      III. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by cytokine profiling of T cell
      culture supernatants for characterization of the immune response in subjects with
      demonstrated immune activation may be performed.

      IV. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      antibody response.

      V. To evaluate tumor biopsies for immune cell infiltrates.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive AdGMCAIX-transduced autologous dendritic cells intradermally (ID) on days 1,
      15, and 29.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for at least 6
      months.
