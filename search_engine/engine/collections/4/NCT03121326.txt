      system. In translational research, metabolomics approaches may enable the detection of
      multiple disease risk factors and interactions, disease progression, and response of patients
      to a particular therapy with or without side effects. Metabolomics may provide comprehensive
      information and improve diagnosis and prognosis which are particularly promising in human
      complex degenerative diseases. The investigators use Metabolomics to explore the biomarkers
      of the sarcopenia and aging of the senior adults.
