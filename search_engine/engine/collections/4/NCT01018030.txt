      and the paranasal sinuses that generally lasts up to 4 weeks. Despite ARS being a
      self-limiting condition, untreated or inadequately treated sinus infection can lead to the
      development of complications. Uncomplicated ARS is a subset of ARS and is distinguished from
      the common cold by the persistence or the worsening of sinus inflammation after the usual
      period for recovery of viral infection of the nasal cavity (i.e., 10 days). Clinically the
      difference is based on the following criteria: symptoms are present at least 10 days but less
      than 4 weeks beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms OR symptoms worsen after 5 days
      from their onset.

      In the primary care settings, ARS is often treated empirically with antibiotics although they
      are shown to provide limited benefit in the uncomplicated ARS population. Alternatively, the
      use of an intranasal corticosteroid (INS) to control symptoms of uncomplicated ARS is
      plausible based on clinically proven ability to reduce inflammation and mucosal swelling.

      This study is a phase II study.

        -  Objective - The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two
           doses of FFNS (110 mcg once daily and 110 mcg twice daily) compared to placebo as
           monotherapy in the treatment of adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older
           with uncomplicated ARS.

        -  Study Design - This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group,
           multi-centre, 2-week treatment study. The study includes a 2-week post-treatment
           follow-up period.

      Approximately 720 subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups for a period
      of 14 days: FFNS 110 mcg QD, FFNS 110 mcg BID, and placebo nasal spray.
