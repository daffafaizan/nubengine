      against perceived threat and can, therefore, be conceptualized as 'avoidance responses'.
      Exposure treatment with response prevention (ET+RP) is aimed at exposing patients to their
      obsessive thoughts and perceived threats while preventing engagement in compulsive avoidant
      responses. This induces extinction of threat perception and fearful arousal and hence reduces
      the motivation to avoid. While successful in many patients, however, as much as 40% dropout
      during treatment or display persistent avoidance after ET+RP. There is a clear need for
      treatment improvement for these often highly disabled patients.

      Improving ET+RP outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive
      excessive and persistent avoidance in OCD patients. Psychological theories ascribe an
      important role to the relief that follows avoidance when the anticipated threat is
      successfully averted. This positive feeling arguably functions as a reward to reinforce the
      foregoing avoidance actions. Indeed, fMRI studies have found that the neurocircuitry of
      relief overlaps with that of reward, including the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum
      and orbitofrontal cortex. Here, the authors will test the hypothesis that
      excessive-persistent avoidance is linked to exaggerated activation of the relief circuitry in
      OCD patients. For that purpose, we will acquire functional brain images of OCD patients in an
      MRI scanner and compare to healthy participants, while they participate in a computer task
      that is designed to model avoidance learning and relief.
