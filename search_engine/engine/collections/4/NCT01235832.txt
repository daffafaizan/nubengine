      effects of a moderate fat blood cholesterol-lowering diet that provides one avocado per day
      (total fat = 34% total energy, MUFA=18%, SFA <7%) to an Average American diet (AAD),
      Lower-Fat diet (total fat = 24% total energy, SFA <7%), and Moderate Fat diet (with
      equivalent fatty acid profile to the avocado diet) without avocado. The study population
      consists of 40 overweight (BMI25-35 kg/m2) men and women with moderately elevated LDL-C,
      between the25-90th percentiles from NHANES. The investigators hypothesize that a moderate fat
      heart-healthy diet, including 1 avocado per day will reduce CVD risk factors including
      lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein particle size, markers of oxidative stress
      and inflammation, blood pressure and reverse cholesterol transport compared to an AAD,
      Lower-Fat diet, and moderate fat diet without avocado.
