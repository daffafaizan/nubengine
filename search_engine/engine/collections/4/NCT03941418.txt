      barrier as well as immune system. It has been proven to be efficient in treatment and
      prophylaxis of travellers diarrhoea, HIV associated diarrhoea, antibiotics associated
      diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection. However there is a limited data available on
      effect of therapy with Saccharomyces boulardii (as add-on to standard therapy) in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, knowing the effect Saccharomyces boulardii has
      on intestinal flora, intestinal epithelium and immune system it can be hypothesised that
      Saccharomyces boulardii used as add-on to standard therapy in IBD patients can lead to
      improvement in symptoms and therefore in quality of life.
