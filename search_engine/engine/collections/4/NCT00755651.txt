      (vaginoscopic) hysterectomy which avoids the need to instrument the vagina with speculums and
      tenaculums, and also avoids the possible need for cervical dilatation. We wish to study the
      ease of use and efficacy of the new device compared with traditional techniques of
      endometrial sampling at hysteroscopy in terms of biopsy adequacy, the time taken to obtain a
      biopsy and patient experience.
