    
      Trial Objectives To test the vasoactive and anti-inflammatory effects of prasugrel in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome, endothelial function -as a surrogate parameter of NO
      bioavailability- and different markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and platelet
      activation will be assessed in patients with unstable angina.

      Trial Design Single center, double blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel trial.

      Endpoints

      Primary Endpoint Assessment of endothelial function (FMD) via high-resolution ultrasound
      (Sonoline G50, 12 MHz linear array transducer, Siemens, Germany) by experienced sonographer.

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  Non-invasive assessment of microvascular perfusion and oxygen saturation by laser
           Doppler perfusion imaging and tissue spectrometry (O2C, Lea Medizintechnik, Giessen,
           Germany)

        -  Determination of leukocyte activity: plasma MPO levels (ELISA), plasma elastase levels
           (ELISA)

        -  Assessment of platelet activity: plasma levels of sCD40 ligand (ELISA), RANTES (ELISA)

        -  Measurement of different oxidative stress markers: hsCRP (ELISA), CD40 ligand (ELISA),
           carbonylated proteins (ELISA), urinary 8-iso-PGF2Î± (gas chromatography mass
           spectrometry)

        -  Determination of platelet-leukocyte aggregates by fluorescent activated cell sorter
           (FACS)

        -  Assessment of platelet function (PADA-test)
