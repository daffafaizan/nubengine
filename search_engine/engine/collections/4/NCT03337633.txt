      conducted to compare ordering from one of two menu designs (easy - E, hard - H) developed in
      a prior pilot study. In the second experiment, restrained eaters were specifically recruited
      and asked to fast before the experiment to determine the influence of cognitive load of menus
      on energy ordered (n=31). Galvanic skin response was used as an objective proxy for relative
      cognitive load, and questionnaires were used to assess perceptions of the menus. The main
      outcomes were the number of items ordered and total energy of the items ordered (in
      kilocalories).
