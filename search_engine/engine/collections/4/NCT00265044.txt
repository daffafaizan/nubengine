      quality improvement interventions of increasing intensity on BP control in veterans.
      Providers in each stratum and their eligible patients were randomized to one of three study
      arms. The providers randomized to the first arm received education alone, and were considered
      the controls. Providers randomized to the second arm received both provider education and a
      hypertension alert. The third arm included provider education, a hypertension alert, and
      patient education. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 21- 90 years and
      filled their medications with the VA pharmacies. Between July and December 2003, we
      determined patient eligibility using a search strategy using data from the Mid South Quality
      Improvement Data warehouse, which is downloaded monthly from Veterans' Health Information
      System and Technology Architecture (VistA).
