      combination with whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with non-AIDS related primary
      central nervous system lymphoma. II. Assess the response rate and safety of this chemotherapy
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive the first course of chemotherapy as soon as possible after
      diagnosis and staging. Methotrexate (MTX) IV is administered over 40-60 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Cytarabine (AraC) is administered intrathecally on days 1 and 15. The second course of
      chemotherapy begins on day 29 or after bone marrow recovery. Radiation therapy begins no
      later than 3 weeks after completing chemotherapy. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued.
