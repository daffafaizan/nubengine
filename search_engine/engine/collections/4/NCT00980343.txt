      I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) measured from start of treatment following
      surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity. (Clinical) II. Overall survival. (Clinical) III. Tumor response. Partial
      Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR): MacDonald criteria). (Clinical)

      Correlative Studies

        -  Determination of in vivo drug effect in recurrent Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM).
           (Correlative studies)

        -  Determination of in vitro drug effect on CD133+ glioma-derived neurospheres.
           (Correlative studies)

        -  Determination of Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation in primary vs. recurrent GBM.
           (Correlative studies)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate clinical outcome (6 mo PFS) with biologic correlates (1-3) above.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily for 7 days before
      surgery.

      Arm II: Patients do not receive treatment before surgery. Beginning within 28 days after
      surgical resection, all patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue samples are collected for correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
