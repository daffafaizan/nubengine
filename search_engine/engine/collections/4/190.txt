on the mechanism of erythropoietin-induced differentiation iv. somecharacteristics of erythropoietin action on hemoglobin synthesis inmarrow cell culture .some of the characteristics of the erythropoietin stimulation of hemo-globin synthesis by rat marrow cells in culture have been studied . therelationship between cell number and rate of hemoglobin synthesis at va-rious levels of erythropoietin is sigmoid rather than linear suggestinga cooperative action among the sensitive cells . the magnitude of theerythropoietin effect on the cells increases with time of contact withthe hormone,. at the time of one-half maximal effect there is no discer-nible loss of erythropoietin from the culture medium . a previously des-cribed lag time in the response to erythropoietin appears to be largelydue to the conditions of culture and disappears when the cells are pre--incubated for 9 h . replacement of a large fraction of the medium at24-h intervals enabled the cells to continue hemoglobin synthesis for anadditional 24 h .
