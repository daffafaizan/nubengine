      controlled knee joint (NMPK). After fitting of the 3C60, the patient will undergo at least
      five rehabilitation sessions, adapted to his/her individual needs, so that he/she knows how
      to use the device and is ready to go along with the planned testing.

      After the trial with the 3C60 knee, the patient will again be fitted with his/her non
      microprocessor controlled knee joint (NMPK) and will be required to undergo one
      rehabilitation session to regain his/her walking abilities.
