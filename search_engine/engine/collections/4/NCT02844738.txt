    
      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the shoulder. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder due to degeneration or
      chronic injury. They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose
      Ultrasonic Cell Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by the
      RegenLab (RegenKit BCT-3) PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints.
      Patient outcomes will be tracked with laboratory tests for inflammation markers, the DASH and
      SPADI questionnaires and a follow up MRI at various endpoints to 6 months. SF-36 forms (a
      quality of life measure) and numerical ratings scales (NRS) will also be used to assess
      safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction in patient medication and/or delay
      in pending shoulder planning/replacement therapy.
