    
      Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      one of the following treatment arms (see figure below):

        -  Arm A (investigational arm): eryaspase in combination with either gemcitabine/Abraxane
           or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI [FOLinic acid-Fluorouracil-IRInotecan regimen] or
           OnivydeÂ®/5 fluorouracil/leucovorin), or

        -  Arm B (control arm): gemcitabine/Abraxane or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI or
           Onivyde/5-FU/leucovorin)

      The chemotherapy will be investigator's choice and based on what patient has received in
      first line treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or the patient's withdrawal of consent.

      An End of Treatment visit should occur within approximately 30 days from last dose of
      eryaspase or chemotherapy regimen.

      A survival follow-up period will include the collection of survival, progression of disease
      if applicable, treatment updates, and quality of life assessments every 8 weeks.
