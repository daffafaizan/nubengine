      preventing conversion of plasminogen in to plasmin. Various regimens of TXA administration
      (routes, doses, timing) have been used to decrease perioperative blood loss and improve
      clinical outcomes among patients undergoing different orthopedic surgeries. We are conducting
      this prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to compare the effect of the two most
      common regimens of TXA administration on hemostasis and clinical outcomes among patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty. All recruited patients receive the first dose of 15mg/kg
      of IV TXA prior to skin incision. The second dose of 15mg/kg IV TXA or identical placebo is
      administered prior to the release of the tourniquet.

      The assessment of hemostasis is performed using whole blood sample via viscoelastic testing
      by rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM). A blood sample is collected in the preoperative
      area and after the administration of each dose of TXA. Clinical data is collected until 90
      days after surgery.
