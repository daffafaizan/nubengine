      neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called,
      sympathoadrenal imbalance, (SAI). In SAI, plasma epinephrine levels increase progressively
      and to a greater extent than do plasma norepinephrine levels, before development of NCS. The
      SAI pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation, which also precedes NCS. We
      hypothesize that increased occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high
      circulating epinephrine levels precipitates a neurocirculatory positive feedback loop leading
      to NCS. In this protocol we test this hypothesis using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor
      blocker, propranolol. We predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and
      tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up
      tilt table testing, in a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      trial. The main department measures are occurrence of tilt-induced NCS, duration of tilt
      tolerance, hemodynamic and neurochemical indices of SAL, and patient questionnaire reports.
