      chronic pain patients who are either started on opioids or who receive an increase in
      pre-study opioid dose level and then observed during long-term (20 weeks) stable opioid
      therapy. In addition to clinical measures of relief of ongoing chronic pain, estimation of
      tolerance development will be supplemented by periodic assessment of the anti-nociceptive
      effects of opioids using the brief thermal sensitization model.
