      previous drug-use, and drug-taking behavior appears to be partly controlled by such cues.
      While some theories postulate that such facilitation is mediated by cue-induced craving
      states, others hypothesize that the underlying processes are highly automatized and can
      happen without conscious control or even awareness. One way to approach psychological
      mechanisms of cue reactivity is to measure disruption of ongoing mental activity by
      drug-related material in dependent individuals while manipulating the degree to which
      cognitive evaluative processes can unfold. Craving measurement under these conditions can
      elucidate its relationship with automatic processing versus conscious evaluation of drug
      cues. Autonomic and neural correlates can be identified by concomitant psychophysiological
      and fMRI recording. Results from these studies will shed light on the role of spontaneous
      automatic reactions versus cognitive evaluation for different measures of cue reactivity. By
      helping to elucidate the psychological mechanisms and neurobiological basis of drug-cue
      reactivity in dependent individuals, this may have substantial implications for the
      understanding of mechanisms and treatment of drug dependence. Thus, while there are no direct
      benefits to subjects participating in these experiments, the results may benefit the health
      of society. MRI-related risks to subjects (injury from metal implants, claustrophobia,
      temporary deafness due to the loud banging noises) will be minimized by prescreening and
      providing earplugs. Drug-related cues may induce acute craving; subjects will be dismissed
      only after craving levels have returned to baseline.
