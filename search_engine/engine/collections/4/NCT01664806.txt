    
      SPECIFIC AIM:

      Compare incidence of skin burns caused by using coag versus blend monopolar instrument modes
      at the active electrode port site (epigastric port), and at the non-active electrode port
      sites (umbilical and right abdominal wall).

      OUTCOME MEASURE:

      Histologic evidence of thermal injury at the skin biopsy sites of the active electrode port,
      the camera port and the medial assistant port. Histology will be performed by a blinded
      pathologist.

      POPULATION TO BE ENROLLED:

      Subjects undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be recruited in the principle
      investigators pre-operative clinic. All subjects will be 18 years and older.

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:

      Written informed consent will be obtained in all subjects prior to enrollment. Subjects will
      be randomized on the day of surgery to undergo the laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation
      with either the coag or blend modes of using standard monopolar electrosurgery instruments.
      The randomization process will occur by using a random number generator. A total of 40
      subjects will be recruited; 20 subjects per group. Shave skin biopsies will be performed at
      the edge of the incisions of the active electrode port, the camera port and the medial
      assistant port on the right abdominal wall. The incisions and skin will be otherwise opened
      and closed in the routine clinical manor.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The incidence of skin burns created using coag or blend modes will be
      compared individually at all three port sites using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test where
      appropriate. Baseline demographic data (e.g., gender, age, body mass index, operation time,
      blood loss, indication for operation and histology) will be compared in the two groups.
