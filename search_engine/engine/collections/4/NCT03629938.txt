    
      The aim of the study is, to evaluate and classificate the medial longitudinal arch height in
      adult individuals.

      Aged between 18-40 years,350 adults who are voluntarily participate is going to be evaluate
      with Feiss Line(FL), Navicular Height(NH) and Longitudinal Arch Angle(LAA) in subtalar
      neutral and resting position. Maximum, minimum values are going to be calculated.

      Participant's height, weight and foot length, from posterior aspect of calcaneus to the
      longest toe's tip, will be measured. Center of the medial malleolus, the navicular tuberosity
      and the head of the first metatarsal bone will be marked with a CD marker. With these
      landmarks in foot's relaxed position, neutrally, FL, NH and LAA will be measured by a ruler.

      Feiss Line is a drawn line between the center of the medial malleolus to the head of the
      first metatarsal bone and then perpendicular line distance between this line and the
      navicular tuberosity will be drawn.The vertical line between the ground and the tubercle
      indicates Navicular Height. Center of goniometer placed at the navicular tuberosity then
      goniometer arms follow the medial malleolus and the head of the first metatarsal bone, degree
      between two arms indicates Longitudinal Arch Angle.

      FL, NH, LAA mean values will be calculated. The 95% and 68% prediction intervals will be used
      as cut off limits.
