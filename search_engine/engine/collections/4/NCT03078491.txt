      been shown to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia in adults with T1D including some more
      functional patients over 65 years old. However, the Medicare population is heterogeneous and
      may have age-related clinical and functional impairments that can impact self-care. These
      patients will require additional targeted guidance and support to fully realize the potential
      benefits of CGM. To address these age-specific barriers which could limit the effective use
      of CGM, in our planned RCT (Specific Aim 1) the use of CGM will be coupled with the DMP
      (Diabetes Management Platform), a tablet-based technology platform ( termed enhanced CGM
      (eCGM)). The CGM, insulin delivery, and activity data uploaded from the DMP will be analyzed
      by the clinical decision support system (CDS), which will provide insulin dosing
      recommendations to the study physicians, who will then accept or reject changes in therapy.
      The use of the DMP is expected to help the less technologically proficient Medicare patients
      to derive benefit from CGM. Specific Aim 2 will involve extensive mixed methods research
      (including semi-structured interviews of patients and caregivers) directed at making an
      in-depth assessment of barriers to the use of diabetes technology in older adults. This
      investigation will provide the evidence-base for future improvements in both the technology
      and clinical approach to the training of older adults and their caregivers. Specific Aim 3
      will involve a cost-effectiveness analysis of the technology system (CGM with DMP = enhanced
      CGM [eCGM]) used in the trial as well as quality of life measures, providing a foundation for
      decision-making on coverage.
