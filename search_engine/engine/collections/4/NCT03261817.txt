      with schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorders (SCZ), reflected by an increase in the
      overall volume of hippocampus.

      The secondary objectives will also be to assess the impact of APA on the SCZ compared to the
      HV:

        1. on other cerebral variables (changes in the different subregions of the hippocampus
           (Cornu Ammonis (CA: CA1,CA2-3-4), subiculum and dentate gyrus), cortical thickness,
           N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate as well as changes in the white matter through
           the diffusion markers (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity in
           the frontomedial-hippocampal fibers) and cerebral irrigation

        2. on physiological variables (neuromuscular, cardiovascular (heart rate variability) and
           aerobic)

        3. on cognitive variables by measuring working memory, episodic memory, attentional and
           executive functions

        4. on circadian rhythms (temperature, actimetry and wake-sleep cycle)

        5. on the clinical status of patients (severity of symptoms, quality of life, level of
           activity and physical abilities).

        6. on biological variables (fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, High-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc)
