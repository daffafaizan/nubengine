      Primary

        -  To select a regimen (erlotinib hydrochloride with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel)
           for further testing against standard treatment, based on median progression-free
           survival for â‰¥ 3 months, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
           with a Zubrod performance status of 2.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the feasibility of selecting patients for a trial based on central EGFR
           testing of serum in a cooperative group setting.

        -  To evaluate the objective tumor response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and
           partial response), in a subset of patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21. Courses
           repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
           on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 2-16. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 4 courses. Beginning in course 5 and for all subsequent courses,
           patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride alone on days 1-21. Courses with erlotinib
           hydrochloride repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 2 years.
