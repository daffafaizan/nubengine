    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of the study drug in male and female
      patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The study consists of a 2 week
      treatment-free run-in period where entry criteria are verified, a 4-week treatment period, of
      which the first week of treatment will be performed as an in-patient study in a clinical
      pharmacology unit (CPU) and the remaining three weeks of treatment will performed as an
      out-patient study, and a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period.

      Safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and will include clinical and vital
      signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, ECGs, and AE monitoring. Pharmacodynamic assessments
      will include, but are not limited to, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), blood pressure, and
      stool sodium excretion. Pharmacokinetic assessments will include blood sampling for
      measurement of study drug plasma concentrations.
