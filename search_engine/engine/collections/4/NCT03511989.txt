      is considered the least stable orthognathic procedure. Different surgical techniques have
      been advocated to improve the transverse stability. However, the pattern of transverse dental
      and skeletal expansion and long-term stability after segmental Le Fort I osteotomy (SLFIO)
      and surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME) have never been compared
      systematically with different fixation techniques or distraction appliances.

      Purpose: Test the H0-hypothesis of no difference in transverse stability after SLFIO without
      fixation of the palatal vault compared to stabilizing with either a bone block graft or a
      biodegradable plate. Moreover, test the H0-hypothesis of no difference in transverse
      maxillary dental and skeletal expansion and stability after SARME with either a tooth-borne
      (TB) or a bone-borne (BB) distraction appliance.

      Method: 60 patients scheduled for SLFIO are included in a randomized clinical trial and
      allocated into 3 groups; I) stabilization of the palatal vault with a bone block graft, II)
      fixation of the palatal vault with a biodegradable plate and III) no fixation of the palatal
      vault. Moreover, 30 patients undergoing SARME are randomly allocated to either a TB or a BB
      distraction appliance. Transverse expansion and stability is assessed by clinical and
      radiographic measurements evaluating differences between dental and skeletal expansion, the
      pattern of skeletal expansion and the long-term stability.

      Primary impact goal: Long-term transverse maxillary stability after SLFIO and SARME.
