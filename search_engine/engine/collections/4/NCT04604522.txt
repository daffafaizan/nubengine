      I. To characterize epithelial cell phenotypes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
      (allo-HCT) recipients at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and in lung transplant recipients
      at Houston Methodist who have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples and 3 brushings of the airway during standard of
      care (SOC) bronchoscopy. After the bronchoscopy, patients undergo 2 nasal brushings (swabs).
      Patients' medical records are also reviewed for data collection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
