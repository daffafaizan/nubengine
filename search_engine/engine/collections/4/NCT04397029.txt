    
      This is a single-center, prospective, case-control study being conducted to determine the
      sensitivity of the SureTouch device in detecting known masses at a pre-determined level of
      specificity.

      Results of the mammography will be compared to the SureTouch examination results.

      Subjects will have between 1 and 3 research visits and 3 follow-up surveys, up to two years
      from the initial visit. The number of visits will be based upon comparison of the SureTouch
      examination to conventional breast screening techniques (mammogram and ultrasound).
