      participants who informed verbally about the surgical procedure and the potential
      postoperative complications,. Also, a written informed consent document was given.
      Participants in the study group were asked to watch a video which was previously uploaded to
      the internet and was showed procedural details of an impacted right lower third molar
      extraction (with permission and written consent). Participants in the study group were also
      informed verbally about the surgical procedure-possible postoperative complications and was
      given with a written informed consent document. In both groups questions of the participants
      were answered by the same surgeon. To evaluate anxiety; participants were asked to complete 3
      questionnaires one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after
      watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the
      procedure.
