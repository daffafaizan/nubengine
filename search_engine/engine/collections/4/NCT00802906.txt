    
      To evaluate the clinical efficacy of an initial subthreshold retinal
      micropulselasercoagulation in twelve eyey per group versus a single intravitreal 1.5mg
      bevacizumab injection in central serous choriretinopathy, as the micropulse will selectively
      treat the damaged RPE to induce reproliferation of healthy RPE cells. BCVA in EDTRS score,
      OCT, and leakage in FLA, static perimetry of both groups will be correlated to a control
      group without treatment over 10 months.
