      there is no known effective treatment or cure. The pathogenesis is largely unknown; however,
      recent studies implicate caspase activation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and free radical
      toxicity as possible causes of HD. Pharmacological agents that block these pathways may be
      therapeutic in HD. Minocycline is an antibiotic that also inhibits caspase-1 and caspase-3
      expression, and inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity, which are factors that may play
      an important role in the mechanisms of neuropathology in HD.

      Two dosages of minocycline or placebo will be given to ambulatory patients with HD over an
      8-week period and the tolerability will be compared. Additional measures of safety and the
      change in motor, behavior, cognitive, and function features will be examined.
