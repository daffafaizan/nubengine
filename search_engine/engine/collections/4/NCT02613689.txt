      control group. All participants in both groups will complete surveys at the baseline, end of
      program, and 6 month time points. All participants in both groups will also receive
      supportive counseling text messages at various times during the day over a period of 4 weeks.

      Participants assigned to the SGR intervention group will receive their intervention, in
      addition to the supportive counseling messages received by the control group, via text
      message over a period of four weeks. Participants will initially report their smokeless
      tobacco use according to their usual habit, and over the course of the intervention be
      directed via text message precise times to start and stop each instance of smokeless tobacco
      use, gradually reducing the occurrences of use.
