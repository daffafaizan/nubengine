      randomized to mentored (glucometer transmission with feedback from mentors) or control
      (glucometer transmission without feedback) groups and were examined for 12 weeks. Five
      mentors were interviewed and selected, of which two were T1DM patients themselves and three
      were parents with at least one child diagnosed with T1DM since more than 5 years ago.
