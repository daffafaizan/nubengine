      (BAHA) implantation surgery. Patients will be randomized to either postoperative medicinal
      honey and standard care or postoperative standard care alone using a random number generator.
      There will be a total of two patient groups. The type of BAHA device used, laterally and the
      surgical technique will be recorded.

      Treatment groups:

      Group 1-patients undergoing BAHA implantation who will be postoperatively treated with
      medicinal honey and standard care.

      Group 2- patients undergoing BAHA implantation who will be postoperatively treated with
      standard care.
