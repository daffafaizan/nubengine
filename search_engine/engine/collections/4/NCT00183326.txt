      intimate partners. DV exposure puts these children at an increased risk for developing
      behavioral problems, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. While studies targeting PTSD in
      DV-exposed children are limited, data indicates that TF-CBT is effective in improving PTSD as
      well as depression, anxiety, and behavioral symptoms. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing PTSD and other DV-related psychological symptoms in
      children from a community DV agency in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

      This study will last 8 weeks. Children and their mothers will be randomly assigned to receive
      8 weeks of either TF-CBT or CCT. In TF-CBT, patients recall the events of their trauma and
      try to deal with the emotions that arise. Supportive treatment empowers children to deal with
      their emotions in general. Both the children and their mothers will complete questionnaires
      at study entry and at Week 8. Children will also complete self-report scales at study entry
      and at Week 8. The questionnaires and self-report scales will be used to assess symptoms of
      PTSD, depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. Children and their mothers will be
      contacted 6 and 12 months after study completion for follow-up interviews.
