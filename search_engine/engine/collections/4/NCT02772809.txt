      system uses off-the-shelf computer gaming wheels with force feedback to help reduce motor
      impairment and improve function in the arms of stroke survivors. Preliminary results from
      various studies have shown that the original TheraDrive system lacked a robust mechanical
      linkage which could withstand the forces exerted by patients, lacked a patient-specific
      adaptive controller to deliver personalized therapy, and was not capable of delivering
      effective therapy to severely low-functioning patients. A new low-cost, high-force haptic
      robot with a single degree of freedom has been developed to address these concerns. This
      study has two purposes: first, to test the viability and usability of the new robot system
      alongside the original TheraDrive system; and second, to test if low-functioning patients
      benefit, and if so how much, from using force-feedback therapy as opposed to devices with
      zero impedance. This will be done by recruiting approximately 36 human subjects. Exercises
      will be performed by study subjects and an adaptive controller will monitor patient
      performance to ensure that exercises are difficult but doable, which is important for
      maintaining patient motivation. It is hypothesized that not only will the new system be
      viable, but that it will provide better robot-assisted therapy to a large variety of
      patients, especially low-functioning stroke survivors with hemiplegia.
