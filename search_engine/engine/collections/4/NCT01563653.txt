        -  Compare the prognostic ability of the clip strip test with the TVT maneuver

        -  Compare the maximum intraurethral pressure during various tests

        -  Compare the quality of life before / after surgery

        -  Estimate patient satisfaction one year after surgery

        -  Describe the intra and inter-operator reproducibility of various prognostic tests.

        -  Estimate the optimal threshold of the Q-tip angle based on surgical results and compare
