      assigned to one of two groups: +EED or -EED. After assignment to one of the two groups,
      proposed subjects will be randomized to one of four supplement groups: Micronutrient powder
      (MNP) with 15 mg Zn, MNP with 10 mg Zn, MNP with 5 mg Zn, and MNP with 0 mg Zn. Children will
      receive the supplement once with a meal on Day 8 of the study. Absorption of zinc from the
      supplement and from other non-supplemented meals will be determined using zinc stable isotope
      technology.
