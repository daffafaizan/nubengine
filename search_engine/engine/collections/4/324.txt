4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamstersin normal chinese hamsters (cricetulusgriseus) the mean concentration of freefatty acids (ffa) in serum varied fromgroup to group, but was (1) consistently 4to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrianhamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higherthan in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  theepididymal adipose tissue of the chinesehamster (1) had initial concentrations offfa comparable to those in the rat andsyrian hamster; (2) released, in the sametime interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffain vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) hadhigher concentrations of ffa after incubationthan the incubated tissue of the rat.the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissueof the chinese hamster was less ac-tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than theepididymal, but was, however, moreactive than the epididymal adipose tissue ofthe rat.  these characteristics of ffametabolism in the chinese hamster wereapparently attributable to species, not toage, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-sue per gram of body was relatively high.it appears that in this species the rate ofrelease of fatty acids from adipose tissueis great, leading to high ffa concentra-tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and ratadipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-sulin (separately) reduced the rate of releaseof ffa and the amount of ffa in thetissues, but glucose and insulin togetherproduced the greatest reduction.  the netreduction in ffa release by glucose andinsulin in vitro was greater in tissue fromthe chinese hamster.  insulin markedlyincreased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-sues of both species.  the possible relationof the results to spontaneous diabetes inthe chinese hamster is discussed.
