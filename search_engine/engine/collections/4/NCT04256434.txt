      which is within 28 days prior to receiving the study drug (Day 1). Eligible subjects will be
      admitted into the study site on Day -1 and will be required to stay in clinical site for 5
      (Cohort 1) or 2 nights (Cohort 2) for study procedures in each cohort. Eligible subjects will
      undergo additional eligibility assessments on Day -1 and those reconfirmed eligible will
      intramuscularly receive NALDEBAIN ER Injection (Cohort 1) or nalbuphine (Cohort 2) on Day 1.

      88, and 96 hours after dosing. Subjects will be discharged after the 96-hour blood sample and
      return to the clinical site for the sample collection at 120, 168, 216, 288 and 360 hours
      post dosing. The blood sampling timepoints for Cohort 2 will be predose, 5, 15, and 30
      minutes postdose, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose.

      administration in Cohort 2.
