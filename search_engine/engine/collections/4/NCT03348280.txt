      their risk for cardiovascular disease. Inflammation plays a role in the development of these
      diseases, and monocytes, a type of white blood cell, may be critical. This study will isolate
      monocytes from blood samples of patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure who
      have either high levels of vitamin D or low levels of vitamin D, and determine what their
      effects are on stimulating production in kidney cells of a hormone that increases blood
      pressure.
