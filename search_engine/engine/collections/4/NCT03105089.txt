      from subsequent ischemia. PC stimulus may be ( ischemic ;pharmacologic or Physical)
      Pharmacological pc may be induced by variable agents e.g. (Sevoflurane ;isoflorane, opioids
      etc ) Ischemic pc includes local ;remote and the idea is temporary interruption of blood
      supply to the organ so that liberation of protective mediators occurs The liberated mediators
      have favorable effects not only upon the myocardium But ;it extend to protect other organs
      against inflammatory activation ;ischemia reperfusion injury Inotropic score IS is already an
      evident predictor of postoperative cardiac mobidity and mortality
