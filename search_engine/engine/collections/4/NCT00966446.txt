    
      The overall goals of this project are to:

        1. to investigate the determinants of and evaluate potential interventions to reduce the
           spread of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in community
           settings in order to reduce the burden of this illness in the State of Pennsylvania.
           This objective has the following specific aims:

             -  to identify host, microbiological and environmental risk factors for prolonged MRSA
                colonization, MRSA transmission and clinical MRSA infection among patients with
                MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and their household contacts and to
                use stochastic agent-based modeling methods to quantify secondary spread of CO-MRSA
                in households.

             -  to evaluate the impact of a decolonization intervention on MRSA infections in the
                household.

             -  to identify immunological mechanisms underlying the ability of Streptococcus
                pneumoniae colonization to inhibit MRSA colonization, transmission and infection in
                order to identify potential future immunological targets for interventions.

        2. to foster multi-disciplinary and cross-institutional collaborations and develop the
           infrastructure for a Center of Excellence focused on antimicrobial drug resistance
           research, with the capacity for activities linking basic science, epidemiological and
           clinical intervention studies

        3. to enhance opportunities for basic and clinical research training for undergraduate and
           graduate students, particularly from underrepresented minorities, in order to increase
           the pipeline of future biomedical scientists and clinical investigators
