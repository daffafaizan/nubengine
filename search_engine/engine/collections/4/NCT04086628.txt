      patients vaccinated against influenza. He will then compare the 2 groups of vaccinated and
      unvaccinated patients : comparison of patients characteristics, comparison of asthma
      characteristics (severity, asthma control...). He will also analyze the causes of vaccination
      or non-vaccination.
