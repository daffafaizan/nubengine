    
      Comparative clinical trial, non blinded, controlled and sequential, evaluating the effects of
      propofol and dexmedetomidine in the basal ganglia of PD patients through a DBS electrode.

      It is a phase IV clinical trial evaluating the effects of a drug outside the approved.

      The study takes part in three phases:

        1. DBS placement under sedation with dexmedetomidine at 0.2 μg/kg/h. This will be called
           "dexmedetomidine record".

        2. Four days later and with no sedation, a recording will be registered in one of the
           specialized electrically isolated rooms at the Neurophysiology Department. This will be
           dubbed "basal recording". The equipment used is also the standard one used for routine
           postoperative recordings.

        3. 5 days after the initial surgery, and following the protocol in place for these
           procedures, the tunnelization and battery placement will take place. This is done under
           general anaesthesia. During anaesthetic induction, the patient is exposed to incremental
           doses of propofol. Different plasmatic concentrations will be targeted using the
           mathematical model in the target controlled infusion (TCI) pump. These recordings will
           be called "propofol at a 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 μg/mL".
