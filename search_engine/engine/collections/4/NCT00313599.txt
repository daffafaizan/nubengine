    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a 2-day pulse of lapatinib that can be
           given prior to paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) (ABI-007;
           Abraxane™) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  Define the toxicity of this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy and safety of ABI-007 when preceded by
           a 2-day pulse of lapatinib.

        -  Characterize the potential of the molecular markers within circulating tumor cells as
           markers of response (e.g., HER2 and AKT) or apoptotic markers.

        -  Determine whether lapatinib given at MTD prior to ABI-007 alters the pharmacokinetic
           properties of the paclitaxel component of ABI-007.

      OUTLINE: This is a does-escalation study of lapatinib. Patients are stratified according to
      dose level.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and paclitaxel
      (albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) (ABI-007; Abraxane™) IV over 30 minutes on days
      3, 10, and 17. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of lapatinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
