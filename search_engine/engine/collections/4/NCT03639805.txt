      induced by a mutation in the β-globin chain of hemoglobin with production of hemoglobin S.
      The course of the disease is characterized by very painful, for which treatment is
      notoriously limited. vaso-occlusive crises pain is multifactorial with biological and
      psychological components. A few studies suggest a beneficial effect of relaxation techniques
      in the management of Sickle cell disease pain. MUSIC CARE® is a novative music therapy
      program which proved efficient in different models of acute or chronic pain. the hypothesis
      is that this program can help alleviate severe pain in synergy with traditional treatment in
      SS Sickle cell disease patients, via a dual biological and psychological effect. The main
      objective of this prospective, randomized, open label study is to test the effect of the
      music therapy program MUSIC CARE® on daily mean morphine consumption during the 3 first days
      of hospitalisation for severe vaso-occlusive crises in adult SS Sickle cell disease patients.
      Secondary outcomes will include mean daily Visual Analogic Scale during the first 3 days of
      hospitalization for severe vaso-occlusive crises, acute complications of vaso-occlusive
      crises, duration of severe vaso-occlusive crises and of hospitalization, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale.

      20 patients will be included in each group for this pilot study.
