    
      This is a prospective, single-center clinical study. Ten patients will be enrolled and
      undergo an TLIF with a spinal fixation system and receive Solum IV (Celling Biosciences) and
      patient's BMC with GFC.

      The bone marrow aspirate (BMA) will be taken from the iliac crest of the enrolled subjects.
      The BMA will be transferred to a processor that will use ART BMC Plus (Celling Biosciences,
      Austin, TX) platform technology to obtain the BMC preparation. The plasma component that
      remains as a by-product of generating the BMC will then be concentrated by the ART BMC Plus
      device to create a concentrated plasma/general fluid concentrate (GFC). The enrolled
      subjects' BMC and GFC will be provided to the principle investigator who will combine the two
      together with Solum IV using the Graft Delivery Kit (Celling Biosciences) and perform a TLIF
      procedure. (See Appendix B for Graft Delivery Kit). All subjects will be assigned to receive
      lumbar interbody fusion via a TLIF approach with Solum IV bone graft and BMC with GFC in the
      interbody space of a TLIF using cynch bullet cage (@SpineSmith) and Stryker based pedicle
      screw system (Xia 3 system).

      All study subjects will be assessed for fusion rate, complication rates and subject-reported
      outcomes at designated intervals up to 12 months after surgery. X-rays (anterior-posterior,
      lateral, flexion-extension) will be taken at pre-operatively, 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-treatment.
