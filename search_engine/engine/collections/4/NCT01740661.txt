      chronic injuries. It is believe that the application of cryotherapy can help to decrease
      pain, muscle soreness, soft tissue swelling, and cause vasoconstriction of blood vessels
      reducing heat loss. The nerve conduction velocity and muscle-spindle firing rate also
      decreases with cryotherapy, which results in changes in proprioception acuity. Cryotherapy
      has also been used prior to exercise (pre-cooling) to improve endurance activities. However,
      given the possible detrimental effects of cryotherapy on proprioception acuity, the use of
      this treatment modality prior to exercise could pose an increased risk of musculoskeletal
      injury. The effects of cryotherapy on lower extremity biomechanics during athletic movements
      is poorly understood despite the wide use among physiotherapists, athletic therapists and
      clinicians. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of cold
      water immersion on lower extremity biomechanics during running. The investigators hypothesize
      that cryotherapy as a form of treatment can increase the load in the lower extremity joint
      during gait biomechanics.
