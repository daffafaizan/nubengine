    
      Purpose: To establish safety of titrating PEEP based on transpulmonary pressure as measured
      by an esophageal balloon in mechanically ventilated neurosurgical patients.

      Participants: Adult patients admitted to the Neuro ICU at UNC Hospital and requiring
      mechanical ventilation who have an intracranial pressure monitoring device in place.

      Procedures (methods): All enrolled patients will have esophageal balloons placed with
      measurement of transpulmonary pressures. All patients will have baseline measurements
      recorded of intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral autoregulation.
      PEEP will then be titrated based on transpulmonary pressure measurements with recording of
      physiological measurements over the next hour. At the conclusion of the hour, all patients
      will be returned to their prior ventilator settings.
