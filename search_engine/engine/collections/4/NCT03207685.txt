    
      To demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Embrace device in identifying convulsive
      seizures (CS) and notifying a caregiver during patient hospitalization at an epilepsy
      monitoring unit (EMU).

      Subjects will be fit with an Embrace device upon admittance into the EMU. The Embrace system
      will be used in conjunction with the EMU standard care practices to monitor the subject
      during the subject's stay. EMU standard care practices will not be impacted by the Embrace
      system, but rather the Embrace will be used to supplement the EMU monitoring. The events
      detected by Embrace will later be compared to the gold standard results of the video EEG.

      A convulsive seizure (CS) is defined for the purpose of this study as any seizure with
      non-facial motor activity involving one or both upper and/or lower extremities that has
      repetitive motor activity (rhythmic motor movements).
