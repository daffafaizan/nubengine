    
      Specific Aims

        -  Develop two intervention formats (Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Motivational
           Computer (MC)) for increasing motivation to initiate and engage in substance abuse
           treatment and/or HIV / AIDS testing and, if appropriate, HIV care.

        -  Test the efficacy of MI and MC on treatment initiation and participation, substance
           abuse, HIV testing/care, and recidivism, as compared to Supervision As Usual (SAU);

        -  Evaluate offender characteristics (e.g., risk level, gender, ethnicity, motivation) as
           potential moderators of the intervention effect; and,

        -  Assess the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of MI and MC on substance abuse
           treatment and/or linkage to or participation in HIV/AIDS care, supervision outcomes,
           recidivism, and substance abuse.
