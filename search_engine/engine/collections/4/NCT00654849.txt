      network who required hysterectomy surgical treatment for benign causes All patients included
      in the study signed an informed consent form, knowing all possible implications of the
      procedure Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two techniques: 1. plasmakinetic
      bipolar energy forceps (Gyrus PK) and 2. Standard technique using sutures The surgical steps
      other than placement of suture are identical to those used during standard abdominal
      hysterectomy. Time of the procedure was considered from the moment skin was first cut-open,
      until it was fully closed, previously checking satisfactory homeostasis.

      Blood loss was estimated by the anesthesiology service. Further data compiled included time
      spent in hospital and the total cost of the procedure.

      Post-surgery complications were recorded at the follow up visits one and 4 weeks after the
      surgery.
