      difficulties in working memory (WM). WM deficits are notably compromised in early-onset and
      prodromal HD patients. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a computer-ized WM
      training program (Cogmed QM), novel to the HD population. Nine patients, aged 26-62, with
      early stage HD underwent a 25-session (5 days/week for 5 weeks) WM training program (Cogmed
      QM). Training exercises involved the manipulation and storage of verbal and visuospatial
      information, with difficulty adapted as a function of individual performance.
      Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after training, and performance on
      criterion WM measures (Digit Span and Spatial Span) and near-transfer WM measures (Symbol
      Span and Auditory WM) were evaluated. Post-training inter-views about patient experience were
      thematically analyzed using NVivo software. Seven of nine patients demonstrated adherence to
      the training and completed all sessions within the recommended timeframe of 5 weeks. All
      adherent patients reported that they found training helpful (n=7), and almost all felt that
      their memory improved (n=6). Compared to baseline scores, patients showed significant
      improvement on the neuropsychological measures of verbal WM, including Digit Span (p = .047)
      and Auditory WM (p = .041). This pilot study provides support for feasibility of computerized
      WM training in early-stage patients with HD. Results suggest that HD patients can improve WM
      with intensive training, though a full-scale intervention project is needed to understand the
      reliability of changes over time.
