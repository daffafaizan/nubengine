    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether endogenous metabolomics compounds obtained before cyclophosphamide
      administration can predict the ratio of 4hydroxycyclophosphamide to cyclophosphamide area
      under the curve (4HCY/CY AUC).

      II. To validate mathematic models of CY and mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics and
      develop mathematic models including these pharmacokinetics, -omics data and clinical
      outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess if recipients' metabolomics and pharmacokinetics (e.g., CY and it's metabolites
      AUCs) are associated with acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and other clinical outcomes.

      II. To assess the association of the intestinal microbiome with the plasma metabolome, acute
      GVHD and other clinical outcomes.

      III. To obtain donor blood samples at one time pre-transplant and assess if donors'
      metabolomics are associated with acute GVHD and other clinical outcomes.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Donor and recipient germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation and genomic analysis.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (PATIENTS RECEIVING A HAPLOIDENTICAL TRANSPLANT): Patients undergo collection of blood
      prior to transplant, on day 0, days 3-7, day 14, and day 21. Patients also undergo collection
      of saliva prior to transplant and collection of stool prior to and post-transplant. Donors
      undergo collection of blood and saliva within 8 weeks prior to donation.

      ARM II (PATIENTS RECEIVING A NON-HAPLOIDENTICAL TRANSPLANT): Patients undergo collection of
      blood prior to transplant and on days 0, 3, and 4. Patients also undergo collection of stool
      prior to and post-transplant. Donors undergo collection of blood and saliva within 8 weeks
      prior to donation.
