      intra-operative hypoxia due to the large shunt that develops when only one lung is being
      ventilated. Ventilation with a higher fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) is one of the
      commonly chosen strategies for the treatment of hypoxemia during (OLV) for thoracic surgery.
      Using an FIO2 of 1.0 at all times during (OLV), however, may increase the risk of absorption
      atelectasis intra and postoperatively which itself leads to persistent hypoxia and
      potentially pneumonia.

      The aim of this study is therefore to determine the impact of adding air to the inspired
      fraction of oxygen during (OLV) primarily on the incidence of postoperative atelectasis of
      the nonsurgical lung after lung resection using video assisted thoracic surgery and
      secondarily on intraoperative and postoperative oxygenation.
