      reported in 20%-30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3-ITD-positive AML
      patients have an inferior survival, primarily due to lower complete remission (CR) rate and
      higher relapse rate. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)
      improves the outcomes of some FLT3-ITD-positive AML, a significant number will suffer disease
      recurrence after allo-HSCT. Sorafenib, an inhibitor of multiple kinases including FLT3, has
      shown promising activity in FLT3-ITD-positive AML. Recent studies have shown that sorafenib
      monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are effective in attaining CR, but they do
      not have significant improvement in relapse. Currently, prophylactic use of sorafenib after
      allo-HSCT has been rarely reported, and whether it can improve outcomes of FLT3-ITD-positive
      AML remains unclear.
