        -  Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with
           persistent or recurrent stage III or IV uterine carcinosarcoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-47 patients will be accrued for this study within 20
      months.
