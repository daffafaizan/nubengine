      breast cancer in a lifetime is high among north-american women, about one out of eight, with
      66% of the cases occurring after menopause and 15% when women are under 40 years old.
      Published cohort studies show clear evidences that women who practice intense physical
      activities have the risk for breast cancer reduced. The risk reduction for these women is
      70%, and 10% for those who practice physical activities at a low level. During adolescence
      and adult age, moderate to intense physical activities may protect against a future breast
      cancer development. But some questions still need to be answered: Were women with a breast
      carcinoma diagnosis already physically active during life? Were there changes in these
      physical activities after treatment? Why? Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify
      the level of physical activities in patients before and after breast carcinoma treatment, and
      to observe if there were changes in the level of these activities. Subjects and Methods: 303
      patients who had already had the diagnosis of breast cancer and had already been treated at
      the Ambulatory of Botucatu School of Medicine were selected. The measuring tool used for the
      level of physical activities was the International Physical Activities Questionnaire
      (IPAQ-short version), validated by the World Health Organization - Physical Activities and
      Health International Committee (1998).
