      node-negative NSCLC and confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to
      durvalumab or placebo.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab with SoC SBRT
      compared to placebo with SoC SBRT in terms of PFS. Key secondary is to assess the efficacy of
      Durvalumab with SoC SBRT compared to placebo with SoC SBRT in terms of OS.
