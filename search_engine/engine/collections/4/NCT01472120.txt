      and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes.

      M2 form is converted (or polarized) to M1 phenotype in various metabolic disorders such as
      obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, these forms also are related to insulin
      resistance and inflammation in adipose tissue.

      Today, there is no study that investigate the role of adiponectin an anti-inflammatory
      adipokine, on macrophage polarization in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
