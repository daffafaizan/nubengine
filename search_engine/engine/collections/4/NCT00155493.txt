      current rejuvenation techniques, or developing new ones. However, no such study has been
      reported in the literature.

      Hundreds of people came to our hospital requesting upper blepharoplasty every year. Taking
      advantage of the discarded soft tissue in the blepharoplasty surgery, samples of bilateral
      pretarsal fat can be easily obtained from patients of various ages. This study is designed to
      objectively evaluate the age-related changes of the preadipocytes in human periorbital
      adipose tissue regarding their proliferation and differentiation capability.

      The adipose samples taken during the surgery are sent to the lab immediately to separate the
      preadipocytes from the specimens. Their number is estimated under the microscope, and then
      the cells are cultured in vitro to evaluate their proliferation and differentiation
      capability. Proliferation is assessed by counting the number of preadipocyte everyday for 7
      days, and differentiation is assessed by Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) assay.

      A linear regression analysis is used to analyze correlations of the parameters with age.
      Moreover, by dividing the subjects who had their periorbital fat sampled during upper
      blepharoplasty operation into three age groups, the parameters are compared with ANOVA test.
      Therefore, the age-related changes of the proliferation and differentiation capability of the
      preadipocytes in human periorbital adipose tissue can be concluded.
