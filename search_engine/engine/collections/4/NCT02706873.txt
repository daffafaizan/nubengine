    
      This study includes 2 periods (a 48-week double-blind treatment period and a long-term
      extension period) and a Japan substudy. In Period 1 participants will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3, and 4 below, except for participants from Japan, who
      will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4:

        -  Group 1: Upadacitinib 7.5 mg once daily (QD) monotherapy (participants in Japan only)

        -  Group 2: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy

        -  Group 3: Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy

        -  Group 4: Methotrexate monotherapy

      Participants who complete the Week 48 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long-term
      extension, Period 2 (212 weeks) and continue study treatment per assignment at the end of
      Period 1 in a blinded fashion. Starting with Protocol Amendment 6, participants receiving
      upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, and
      participants receiving methotrexate will receive open-label methotrexate.

      A global analysis will be conducted for the comparisons of the primary and secondary efficacy
      endpoints between the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD treatment groups versus the
      methotrexate treatment group for all participants (excluding the Japan specific upadacitinib
      7.5 mg treatment group). Analyses will be conducted separately for United States (US)/Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA), European Union (EU)/European Medicines Agency (EMA), and
      Japan/Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) regulatory purposes, each according
      to a pre-specified sequence of primary and ranked secondary endpoints.

      A separate Japan sub-study analysis will be conducted for the comparisons of the efficacy
      endpoints between the upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD treatment groups versus
      the methotrexate treatment group for participants enrolled in Japan only.
