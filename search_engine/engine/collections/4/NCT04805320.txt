    
      Twenty-five healthy adult subjects (aged 21-70) requiring extraction of a posterior tooth
      will be recruited for this study. Prior to extraction, a limited-view cone beam computed
      tomography radiograph will be taken as well as clinical measures of periodontal inflammation
      (probing depths, recession, bleeding on probing, gingival crevicular fluid sampling). The
      extraction will be completed atraumatically and with local anesthesia. Following extraction,
      a small biopsy of the soft tissue of the extraction site will be taken and the site then
      sutured. At the two-week postoperative visit, sutures will be removed and another soft tissue
      biopsy of the healing site will be collected (along with clinical data from the adjacent
      teeth). The soft tissue biopsies will be fixed and processed for inflammatory endocytes
      present during wound healing. At the three-month postoperative visit, all clinical parameters
      of wound healing will be evaluated; including inflammatory measures (probing depths,
      recession, bleeding on probing, gingival crevicular fluid sampling) from the adjacent teeth;
      as well as a limited-view cone beam computed tomography radiograph.

      The biopsies will be processed to obtain single cell counts with half of the preparation
      stained and analyzed via multiparameter flow cytometry. The other half of single cells
      obtained from the tissue biopsies will be cryopreserved for cellular indexing of
      transcriptomes and epitopes-sequencing.
