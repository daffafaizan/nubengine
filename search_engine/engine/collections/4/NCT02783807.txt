    
      Subjects (patients) will be recruited via word of mouth.

      The study duration will be approximately 1-2 weeks, assuming a recruitment rate of 15
      subjects per week. The images will be recorded within 15 minutes and will involve minimal
      disruption to the clinical workflow.

      In the Study Environment setting (Foothill Medical Offices), the User Interface will be
      evaluated by comparing retinal pictures taken with subject device OC and predicate device OP.

      Patient subjects will be given an Information and Consent Form to complete prior to the study

      The technicians employed by Foothill Eye Clinic will operate the device on patient
      participants by taking a retinal picture using OC.

      The technicians will use the predicate device OP to take retinal pictures.

      The Ophthalmologist will compare the results with the pictures taken by OC and OP. The
      Ophthalmologist will be blinded to what picture was taken by which camera and record his
      assessment of the quality for each picture.

      Patient subjects will receive a standard of care exam with or without dilation.
