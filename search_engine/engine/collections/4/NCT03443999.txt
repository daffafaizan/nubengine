      stent (DES) with a biodegradable polymer has been designed. The first-generation
      sirolimus-eluting or paclitaxel-eluting stents have a polymer release of antiproliferative
      drugs from a stainless steel stent platform. More recently, second generation DES have been
      developed not only to improve long-term DES safety but also to facilitate the procedure by
      using a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) stent platform. Co-Cr is stronger and more radiopaque than
      stainless steel, and thus allows strut thickness and total stent volume to be reduced while
      maintaining radial strength leading to a more flexible and deliverable stent platform.

      The Sahajanand Medical Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (SMT) has developed sirolimus-eluting stent
      that contain a biodegradable polymer coating and a Co-Cr stent platform. The purpose of this
      registry is to evaluate the Supraflex Family sirolimus-eluting stent in a 'real-world'
      patient population, in order to determine the safety and efficacy of the stent in wider
      usage.
