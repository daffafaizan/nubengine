      pathophysiological background is unknown, but several studies have shown disturbed melatonin
      secretion after surgery. It is unknown whether melatonin substitution will improve general
      wellbeing, fatigue or sleep disturbances after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We set out to
      study in a randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect of 5 mg melatonin versus
      placebo, on postoperative sleep disturbances, fatigue and general wellbeing.
