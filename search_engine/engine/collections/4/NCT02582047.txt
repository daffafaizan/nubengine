      IIV3 given concomitantly with either PCV13 (PCV13+IIV3) or PPV23 (PPV23+IIV3) in a 1:1 ratio.
      Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies for IIV3 were measured at the time of
      vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded prospectively in a
      clinical diary during a 7-day period.
