      ICA stenosis and must be performed by a trained and certified vascular technologist using
      advanced duplex imaging equipment and with subsequent interpretation by a trained physician.
      this test is not considered suitable for screening for disease. It would be of value to
      develop an accurate, reliable, low-cost, and easily accessible tool to screen for
      extra-cranial ICA disease in an office based setting. However, such a tool would require
      novel technology that allows for quick, accurate, reproducible, and safe evaluation.

      This study will evaluate a new technology called the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS) developed by
      CVR Medical. The CSS instrument uses sensitive transducers to detect low frequency pressure
      fluctuations associated with flow disturbances downstream from areas of arterial narrowing.

      Subjects will undergo a clinically ordered clinical carotid duplex ultrasound as part of
      standard of care. Subjects will have a noninvasive CSS assessment either before or after the
      carotid duplex ultrasound.
