      antigen recognition cells in the esophageal mucosa that initiates a chronic allergy-based
      inflammatory response . It is believed that this exposure is facilitated through dilation of
      the intercellular spaces (DIS) between esophageal epithelial cells (termed spongiosis). This
      is substantiated by several studies which have demonstrated that: first, DIS is commonly
      found in biopsies from patients with active EoE and reverses with steroid therapy; second,
      DIS correlates to physiologic demonstration of increased esophageal epithelial permeability
      as shown through transepithelial small molecule flux in mucosal biopsies appraised in Ussing
      chambers and increased conductivity of electric current as measured in a mucosal impedance
      probe (Katzka, et al., in press, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol). Although these mechanisms make
      intuitive sense, no one has shown the presence of food antigen in esophageal mucosa after
      ingestion and the correlation of this presence to dilation of intercellular spaces.
