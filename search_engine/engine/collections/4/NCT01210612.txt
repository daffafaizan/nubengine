      orthotic insoles also have been shown to influence the neuromuscular control system by
      enhancing the proprioceptive and cutaneous afferent inputs to the central nerve system;
      thereby improving postural control. There is a unique style of socks that have become popular
      in Japan among athletes that could also improve postural control by enhancing cutaneous
      afferent inputs from the plantar surface of the foot and toes. The purpose of the study is to
      determine the effectiveness of five-toed socks on dynamic postural control in individuals
      with and without chronic ankle instability.
