      I. Determine if a baseline molecular-pathologic androgen receptor response (AR-response)
      signature predicts efficacy to abiraterone plus apalutamide in patients with hormone-naive
      metastatic prostate cancer (HNMPCa).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of abiraterone acetate plus apalutamide in patients with HNMPCa.

      II. Evaluate the safety of abiraterone acetate plus apalutamide in patients with HNMPCa.

      III. Explore the relationship between molecular markers and clinical efficacy outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patient receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) daily, prednisone PO twice daily (BID), and
      apalutamide PO daily. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then for up to 6
      months.
