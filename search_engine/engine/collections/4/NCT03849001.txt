      different intensities (i.e., light, moderate, and vigorous) versus a control condition (i.e.,
      quiet rest) on symptoms of RLS in persons with MS. This study involves a within-subjects,
      repeated measures design that includes a proposed sample of 24 participants diagnosed with
      both MS and RLS. Participants will complete four sessions with supervised exercise or rest
      conditions in the lab, one session per week, over the course of four weeks. The order of the
      three conditions will be randomized and counterbalanced and include: (1) leg cycling with no
      resistance (i.e., light), (2) leg cycling at moderate intensity, (3) leg cycling at vigorous
      intensity, and (4) seated, quiet rest (i.e., control condition). The primary study outcome
      includes the objective measure of RLS severity using the Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT)
      that will be administered immediately before and immediately after each condition (i.e.,
      light, moderate, vigorous, and quiet rest).
