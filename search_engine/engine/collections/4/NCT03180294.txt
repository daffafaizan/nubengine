      I. Measure the ability of two dose levels of bupropion hydrochloride (bupropion), 150 or 300
      mg of extended release, to improve sexual desire more than a placebo at 9 weeks (8 weeks on
      the target dose) as measured by the desire subscale of the female sexual function index
      (FSFI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the side effects of 150 and 300 mg bupropion extended release and differentiate
      these side effects from those observed in the placebo arm.

      II. Evaluate the effect of 150 and 300 mg of bupropion extended release on the Patient
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue scale, PROMIS sexual desire
      and satisfaction measure, patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-4, and the FSFI total score, at
      5 and 9 weeks, as well as the desire subscale score of the FSFI at 5 weeks.

      III. Evaluate the effect of 150 and 300 mg of bupropion extended release on the global
      impression of change scale and the patient?s perception of risk versus (vs.) benefit at 5
      weeks (4 weeks at target dose) and 9 weeks (8 weeks at target dose).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive bupropion hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-63 and
      placebo PO QD on days 8-71.

      ARM B: Patients receive bupropion hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-7 and 64-71, and twice daily
      (BID) on days 8-63.

      ARM C: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-7 and 64-71, and BID on days 8-63.
