      Occupational Therapy intervention will be examined in this study. The study will be conducted
      in two stages: the first will be conducted at the Child Development Center of the Clalit HMO
      (Health Maintenance Organization), and the second will take place in the child's home.

      The first intervention will take approximately 8 to 10 weeks, during which eight data
      collection sessions will be conducted, each of 45 minutes duration.

      The study group will integrate the use of Timocco in occupational therapy sessions while the
      control group will be given conventional occupational therapy without using Timocco.

      In the second intervention, the study group will be given access to the virtual-reality
      environment of Timocco to be used at home, and will not include therapy sessions at the Child
      Development Center. An assessment before and after intervention will be held for both groups
      for comparison.
