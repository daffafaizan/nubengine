      seyal or Acacia senegal. It is highly soluble and broadly used in numerous solid and liquid
      food matrices.

      For the assessment of non-digestible carbohydrates as dietary fiber, it is eminent to
      demonstrate that its consumption is related to a specific beneficial physiological effect
      shown in an appropriate clinical study. The aim of the present trial was to expand the
      clinical evidence with respect to beneficial effects of gum acacia on post-prandial blood
      glucose levels, post-prandial insulin levels and prospective ad libitum food intake, in
      normal-weight and overweight subjects.

      The present double-blind, randomized, controlled, three-way cross-over study was to evaluate
      the effect of gum acacia versus no treatment on post-prandial glucose (PPG) levels in
      normal-weight and overweight subjects during a 2-7 weeks intervention period.

      Additionally, post-prandial insulin (PPI) levels, prospective ad libitum food intake, as well
      as the safety and tolerability of gum acacia were assessed.
