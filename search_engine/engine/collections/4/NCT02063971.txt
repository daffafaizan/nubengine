             9. Nasolabial folds (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            10. Cheek wrinkles (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            11. Neck wrinkles (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            12. Lines on the neck opening (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            13. Skin firmness (0= very firm skin to 10= no firm skin)

            14. Skin elasticity (0= very elastic skin to 10= no elastic skin)

            15. Sagging skin (0= no sagging skin to 10= severe sagging skin)

            16. Radiance (0= very radiant skin to 10= no radiant skin)

            17. Smoothness (0= very smooth skin to 10= no smooth skin)

            18. Skin softness (0= very soft skin to 10= no soft skin)

            19. Colour evenness (0= good evenness to 10= bad evenness)

            20. Skin tone (0= good complexion to 10= bad complexion)

        -  Optical colorimetry: measurement of skin colour (L*a*b*) by Spectrophotometer CM-2600d.

        -  Photographic documentation: Canfield imaging station equipped with visible, polarized,
           fluorescence and UV light and with specific lighting for shadows.

        -  Skin replicas and profilometry at level of crow's feet (image analysis of: total surface
           of the wrinkles, mean length of the wrinkles, total length of the wrinkles, number of
           the wrinkles)

        -  Skin elasticity measurement by suction (CutometerÂ®)

      Tolerance evaluation (investigator's judgement):

      At each evaluation time, the investigator considering the appearance of possible adverse
      effects related to the tested creams and all comments reported by the subjects on diary card
      will judge the tolerance of the products under study.
