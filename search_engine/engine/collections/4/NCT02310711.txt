    
      This is a single-center, prospective, pilot observation study. Eligible subjects who enroll
      in this study will begin at the time of informed consent, which will occur during the
      pre-operative, surgical evaluation time. Once consented, a 3-dimensional 180Â° camera surface
      image will be taken and a pain-scale score will be completed. Data from the medical history
      will be recorded. As standard of care, the surgery will be scheduled and performed. Following
      surgery, a series of 5 standard of care visits will occur over the subsequent 6 months, that
      will include research measures of local ultrasound x5 and 3-dimensional surface imaging x3.
      The pain scale score will be administered pre and post ultrasound on the 5 post-operative
      visits. A judging of the cosmesis will take place at weeks 10 and 26 by independent surgeons.
      The participant's role in the study will be completed after the week 24 visit.
