      attentional neuronal mechanisms by eliciting event related potential components known to
      reflect automatic stimulus detection as well as involuntary and voluntary attentional
      processes. The that end the proposed research has two specific aims. 1) Identify what areas
      of the frontal lobe and corresponding cognitive functions are impacted by excessive
      sleepiness in shift work sleep disorder and 2) identify specific brain areas affected by
      armodafinil and their role in improvement of fundamental attentional processes using a
      complex cognitive task targeting attentional control.
