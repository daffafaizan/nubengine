      Commission of the University of Extremadura. 58 senior citizens institutionalized with
      dementia in residential homes in Extremadura (Spain) received a treatment focusing on
      activities of daily living with the SADL programme and with conventional occupational therapy
      during 5 weeks. The studied variables were the cognitive level and the independence level
      performing ADL. The variables were measured by an occupational therapist independent to the
      study at baseline, after 5 weeks of experimental treatment and 6 weeks after the treatment
      was completed. The standardized tests used were Barthel Index, Lobo's Cognoscitive mini test,
      Lawton and Brody Scale and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).
