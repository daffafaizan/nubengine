      Francisco. Caregivers will undergo a telephone screening according to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Written consent for participation will be obtained from participants,
      parents and/or legal guardians. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment conditions: TF-CBT, CCT, or TAU. Assessments will be administered at 4 time points:
      1) pre-treatment, 2) mid-therapy, 3) post-treatment, and 4) three month follow-up. A
      medical/developmental history form will be completed only pre-treatment. The UCLA PTSD
      Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) parent and child versions will be used to assess exposure to
      traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Given that trauma has high comorbidity
      with depression and anxiety disorders these symptoms will be assessed using the
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).
      Executive functioning will be assessed by both child and parent report using the Behavioral
      Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).

      In addition, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) will be conducted at each of these
      time points to assess tasks of working memory, response inhibition, and facial recognition.
      The investigators will be using the NIRScout which is a portable NIRS recording unit. NIRS
      technology uses specific wavelengths of light, introduced at the scalp, to enable the
      noninvasive measurement of changes in the relative ratios of deoxygenated hemoglobin
      (deoxy-Hb) and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in the capillary beds during brain activity.
