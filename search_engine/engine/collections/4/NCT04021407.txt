      according to supraglottic devices used. The following parameters were recorded in both
      studied groups, continuous Electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), means arterial
      pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), end tidal carbon di-oxide (PCO2)..Oro
      pharyngeal leak pressure in (cmH2O), exhaled tidal volume in (ml), leak volume in (ml), leak
      fraction in (%) number of shifting from LMA to air Q or ETT and shifting from air Q to LMA or
      ETT was recorded with absence or presence of surgical blood on The undersurface of the device
      used.
