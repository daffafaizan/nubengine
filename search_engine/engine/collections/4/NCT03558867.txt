      a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, fatty liver, kidney,
      ophthalmic, renal and neuropathic disease, and cancer.

      Effective management of dysglycemia in pre-diabetes and diabetes and prevention of diabetes
      in individuals at risk reduce the risk of organ damage and associated co-morbidities and
      improves the affected individuals' quality of life.

      Metformin, an oral biguanide, is the first-line treatment of newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes
      patients, and the pharmacological choice for preventing diabetes in individuals with
      pre-diabetes. Metformin is an ideal medication to initiate for diabetes prevention, due to
      its excellent safety profile (lack of hypoglycemia), neutral to marginally beneficial effect
      on body weight, evidence of cardio-protection, and low cost. However, clinical practice,
      backed by randomised clinical trials, suggests that metformin mono-therapy fails to achieve
      glycemic goals in 20-40% of type 2 diabetes patients and to prevent diabetes in approximately
      20% of individuals with pre-diabetes.

      While the mode of action of metformin is still being investigated, the liver and the
      gastrointestinal tract are thought to be the main targets responsible for the improvement in
      glycemia. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important
      role in obesity, prediabetes and diabetes, and alterations in gut microbial composition have
      been described in individuals with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. Interestingly,
      metformin-treated diabetes patients have a "healthier" gut microbial composition compared
      with treatment-naïve diabetes patients, and changes in gut microbial composition with
      metformin treatment has been suggested to contribute to the therapeutic effect of the
      medication.

      Randomised, clinical study with parallel assignment and single-masking will be performed in
      treatment-naïve individuals with pre-diabetes or early type 2 diabetes (diagnosed in the last
      6 months) aiming to compare the effect of metformin (extended release [XR]) 1500 mg/d
      administered with personalized diet (based on the Weizmann Institute Personalized Nutrition
      Project) or administered with a healthy (low fat) diet.
