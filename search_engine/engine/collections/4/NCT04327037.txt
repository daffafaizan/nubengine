      patients with cancer. However, for better efficiency high doses of NK cells are required. For
      this purpose, NK cells were expanded in the presence of feeder K562 cells gene-modified for
      expression 4-1BBL and membrane bound IL-21. In the result of expansion, large number of
      activated NK cells are obtained.

      Protocol of immunotherapy includes conditioning (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide or any other
      protocol of chemotherapy) followed by expanded NK cells intravenous infusion. To sustain
      proliferation of donor NK cells in vivo patients receive 6 doses of Il-2 every second day. 10
      patients will be enrolled in phase I to test different doses of NK cells: 20, 50, 70, 100 and
      >100 x 10^6/kg.
