      underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant between June 29, 2011 and December 31, 2019 at
      Westchester Medical Center (WMC). For this analysis, eligible patients will be identified
      through our transplantation database and clinical data collected through electronic medical
      record. This analysis will comprise of 100 pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant
      recipients. CMV viremia will be defined as ≥2 CMV positive PCRs ≥500 copies and CMV disease
      will be defined as isolation of CMV in any body fluid or tissue specimen along with end-organ
      disease, as we have demonstrated.8 CMV viremia/disease will be evaluated through day +100
      following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Review of clinical records and collection of
      data with de-identified information will be performed. The study team will not access medical
      records (paper or electronic) directly. Medical records will be obtained through the
      Hospital's Health Information Management (HIM) department. HIM will query requested data /
      variables and provide a report / records of interest to Investigator.
