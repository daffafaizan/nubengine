      trials. The purpose of this research study is to learn more about Friedreich's Ataxia (FA)
      progression in children. There will be biannual visits which will include a core set of tests
      and procedures. These include: a collection of medical history, detailed neurological exam,
      ataxia scales, and health questionnaires. At each visit, blood and cheek swab samples will be
      obtained to monitor frataxin levels.

      A select number of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) participants will have the
      opportunity to participate in further procedures to better understand how FA affects
      different tissues. These include a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and a Motor Evoked
      Potentials (MEP) procedure.

      The MRI scan analyzes how muscle activity is affected in FA. The magnet will be used to
      capture images of the calf muscle before and after exercising on an ergonomic foot pedal.

      The MEP procedure measures how strong the connection is between the brain's motor cortex and
      a selected body part, specifically the participant's dominant hand.
