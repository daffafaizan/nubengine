      following treatment groups:

        -  Romosozumab 90 mg/mL

        -  Placebo 90 mg/mL

        -  Romosozumab 70 mg/mL

        -  Placebo 70 mg/mL

      After completing a 6-month treatment period, participants entered a 3-month follow-up period
      with an end of study (EOS) at month 9.

      For the analysis of efficacy endpoints, the 2 placebo groups were combined into a single
      placebo group. For safety analyses, the data for placebo were presented separately for each
      group.
