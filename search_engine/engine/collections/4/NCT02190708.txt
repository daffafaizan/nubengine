    
      This will be an open-label, crossover, fixed sequence study in healthy male subjects. Thirty
      six (36) subjects will participate in the study and will be enrolled as two groups of 18
      (Groups 1 and 2).

      If the PK data from Group 1 demonstrate a clinically important inhibition of the CYP3A4
      and/or CYP2C19 enzymes then the second optional group (Group 2) might be studied at a lower
      dose level of PQ912 .

      Each subject will participate in one treatment period, residing at the CRU from Day -1 (the
      day before dosing) to Day 7 (until after the last PK sampling occasion).

      All subjects will return for a post study visit 5 to 7 days after their final dose.

      Dose Regimen:

      Each subject will receive single oral doses of midazolam and omeprazole on the morning of Day
      1.

      On the morning of Day 2, all subjects will commence the multiple dose regimen for PQ912,
      which will continue for 5 days in total.

      Subjects in Group 1 and (if it necessary) in Group 2 will receive PQ912 twice daily (bid) on
      Days 2 to 6 inclusive and subjects in Group 2 will receive PQ912 bid on Days 2 to 6
      inclusive.

      On the morning of Day 6 subjects will be given single oral doses of midazolam and omeprazole
      co-administered with PQ912.
