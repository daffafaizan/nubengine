      stimulation that involves the application of brief weak electric current to the scalp. tDCS
      may induce neuroplasticity, thereby engaging some of the same systems that figure prominently
      in the pathological neuroplasticity caused by addictive drugs.

      OBJECTIVE: To assess whether tDCS delivered along with nicotine patch reliably increases a)
      quit rates, b) duration of abstinence, and c) percentage of participants abstinent at
      follow-up.

      METHOD: Active (20min; 2mA) and sham (30sec; 2mA) stimulation will be applied to the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both cerebral hemispheres.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Active tDCS (20-min; 2 mA) will increase abstinence in a standard smoking cessation
           protocol relative to a sham procedure.

        2. The benefits of active left anodal stimulation (anode-left/cathode-right) to the DLPFC
           will be greater than of active tDCS in the reverse configuration
           (cathode-left/anode-right).
