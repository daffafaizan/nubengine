      point in mental illness (Griffiths et al, 2006). The related literature has focused on
      individuals with schizophrenia although there are indications that stigma act negatively in
      patients with bipolar disorder; this, in turn, is described in a few studies, always with
      heterogeneous samples, chronic and symptomatic patients (Perlick et al, 2001). It is also
      known that there is a significant association between affective symptoms and the presence of
      stigma, (Vázquez et al, 2010).

      There are reports of higher levels of public stigma towards people with schizophrenia,
      compared to patients with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression, however there are no
      studies available on internalized stigma in such samples, especially in remitted patients .
      Since schizophrenia coexists with significant impairment of insight, such individuals may
      exhibit more difficulty internalizing the external bias and stereotypes. On the other hand,
      patients with bipolar disorder - despite being less discriminated by the public in relation
      to schizophrenia - probably have a high potential for self-stigma and its fearsome
      consequences, justified by higher levels of insight.

      The investigators would like to examine whether the lower impairment of insight in young
      bipolar patients(in relation to young people with schizophrenia) could be accompanied by an
      increase in internalized stigma in this sample. It´s an observational, cross-sectional study
      with no intervention.

      Hypothesis: the internalized stigma in young adults with bipolar disorder is identical to
      that of young patients with schizophrenia.
