    
      Individuals with Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) previously reviewed at HHTIC
      London will be sent an invitation to participate in a short questionnaire study.

      Quantitative variables from the questionnaires for statistical analysis will be the number of
      individuals responding (and number of questionnaires sent out); number of flights taken and
      number of complications, subgrouped by type, and flight duration in hours. Complication rates
      will be expressed as proportion of person flight hours.

      The quantitative data from the questionnaire will then be compared with quantitative data
      from patients' medical records using non parametric methods such as Mann Whitney for
      univariate analyses.
