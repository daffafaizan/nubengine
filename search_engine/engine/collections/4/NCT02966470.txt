      containing multiple components. For frail patients particularly, it can be difficult to
      ascertain all the information requested. There is a need for a simple, one step, objective
      screening measure of frailty. There is some evidence in the medicine patients that grip
      strength may be related to frailty, but no such information is available for surgical
      patients.
