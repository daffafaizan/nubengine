      To assess immunogenicity of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza
      vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL of seasonal H1N1,
      H3N2 and B influenza antigens each), as measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.

      Safety and Tolerability Objectives:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability (incidence of adverse events) of a single intramuscular
      (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient
      content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL).
