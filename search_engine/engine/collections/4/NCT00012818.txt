      Despite the development of significant pharmaceutical treatments, morbidity and mortality of
      chronic heart failure (CHF) patients remain high, patientsï¿½ quality of life is poor, and
      their health care utilization is heavy. It is therefore important to find a cost effective
      non-pharmaceutical treatment to help CHF patients manage the disease. The relaxation response
      has been found to be effective in managing CHF-related conditions. With its favorable
      physiological changes, the relaxation response is likely to benefit CHF patients.

      Objectives:

      1. To evaluate the effects of a 15-week relaxation response intervention program on improving
      functional capacity and health-related quality of life as compared with an ongoing 15-week
      educational program for cardiac disease management, and a control group of usual cardiac
      care; 2. To identify the costs of conducting the intervention and the cardiac care education
      and the costs associated with cardiac care services; and to compare cost among three study
      groups.

      Methods:

      This is a single-blind three-armed randomized trial in CHF patients who receive care at the
      Boston VA Medical Center. Enrolled patients are randomly assigned, with equal numbers, to one
      of the three study groups. Outcomes include cardiac functional capacity and self-reported
      health-related quality of life. We also conduct a qualitative study to interview patients by
      phone about their experience in the study.

      Status:

      This project has completed the data collection phase and is in the data analysis phase.
