      patients. However, there are many studies reporting adverse effects of this intervention and
      final data on benefits are not available. There are no prospective studies in oncologic
      patients regarding red blood cell transfusions requirements. There are observational and
      experimental studies suggesting worse outcomes including higher rates of infection and other
      clinical complications, maybe higher cancer recurrence, in patients submitted to red blood
      transfusion. Hemoglobin levels around 9 g/dL are usually recommended although not based in
      evidence . The investigators purpose is to prospectively evaluate two strategies of
      transfusion in 400 patients with cancer admitted to intensive care unit for severe clinical
      condition: a liberal strategy - patients receive blood transfusion when hemoglobin is lower
      than 9 g/dL since the admission to ICU until ICU discharge; a restrictive strategy - patients
      receive blood transfusion only when hemoglobin is lower than 7 g/dL.

      Clinical outcomes, costs and quality of life will be compared.
