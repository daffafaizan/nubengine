      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of short-term fasting prior to administration of
      combination chemotherapy with platinum in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity profile of platinum-based chemotherapy in subjects who eat
      normally compared to those who undertake short-term starvation.

      III. To investigate changes in plasma insulin, glucose, IGF1 and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)
      levels, and oxidative stress markers in subjects who undertake short-term fasting compared to
      controls.

      IV. To investigate whether changes in grp78 expression occur after fasting and after
      chemotherapy administration in human subjects.

      OUTLINE:

      STAGE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. GROUP I: Patients fast for 24
      hours on day-1.

      GROUP II: Patients fast for 48 hours on days -2 and -1.

      GROUP III: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -3, -2, and-1.

      GROUP IV: Patients undergo a modified 48-hour fast with minimal caloric intake on days -2 and
      -1.

      STAGE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -2, and on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients proceed to chemotherapy without fasting.

      All patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and
      cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
