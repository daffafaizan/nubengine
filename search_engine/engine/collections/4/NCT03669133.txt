      vitamin E for treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in persons living with HIV.
      Hypothesis: Vitamin E will improve radiographically measured hepatic fat content and
      circulating markers of liver inflammation and injury in persons living with HIV who have
      NASH.

      A. Perform a pilot randomized placebo controlled trial of vitamin E 800 IU/daily for 6 months
      in 56 persons living with HIV with biopsy-proven NASH B. Measure change in liver fat content
      by magnetic resonance proton-density fat fraction (Primary outcome) C. Determine the impact
      of vitamin E treatment on noninvasive markers of hepatic and systemic inflammation, hepatic
      fibrosis, and systemic oxidative stress (Secondary outcomes) D. Define baseline hepatic gene
      expression signatures predictive of response to therapy.

      Upon completion, the proposed clinical trial may establish vitamin E as an excellent and
      inexpensive candidate for further development as a treatment for NASH in persons living with
      HIV.
