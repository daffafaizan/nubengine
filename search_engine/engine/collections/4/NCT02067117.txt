    
      This is a Post-Marketing, Multicentre, Open, Randomized Phase 4 Clinical Study. Subjects who
      gave voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study were screened for
      eligibility in the study, and those who met the eligibility criteria were randomized in the
      investigational group.

      An investigator assessed the effectiveness (immunogenicity) and safety of the study vaccine
      in each subject during his/her participation in the study.

      Subjects were randomized (Visit 1) into the investigational group according to a
      randomization table previously generated, and were vaccinated with influenza split vaccine,
      'GC FLU®Pre-filled Syringe Injection' and 'GC FLU®Injection'.

      12 Assessments for HI titre to each strain of influenza were performed at Visit 1
      (pre-vaccination), and at Visit 3 (21 days after vaccination) for the efficacy
      (immunogenicity) evaluation [Picture 1].For the safety assessment, subject diaries were
      handed out to subjects, who were instructed to record any adverse event emerging ager the
      receipt of study vaccine.
