    
      This trial is an uncontrolled, open-label, single-center phase I study in liver cirrhosis
      patients caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection
      with hemophilia.

      Liver cirrhosis patients due to co-infection of HIV and HCV with hemophilia who have a
      Child-Pugh classification of A or B are included. OP-724 is intravenously administered twice
      a week (4 hours) for 12 weeks as an administration schedule.

      At 14 days before the administration of the first cycle, the dose planned for the first cycle
      will be administered once by continuous intravenous administration for 4 hours, and the
      safety and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated from the day of administration to the day after
      the administration. If an integrase inhibitor is used in combination as a key drug for
      antiretroviral drugs, its pharmacokinetics will be evaluated at the same time.

      A dose escalation study with 2 doses (cohort 1: 140 mg/m2/4hr (starting dose), cohort 2: 280
      mg/m2/4hr) will be conducted, and 3 patients in each cohort will be enrolled. Comprehensively
      investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic data after OP-724 administration, and evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of OP-724 administration.
