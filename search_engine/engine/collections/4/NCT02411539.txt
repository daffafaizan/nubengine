      including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections. mAbs may also be a potential
      treatment for people infected with HIV. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of an experimental human mAb, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), in HIV-infected
      adults receiving ART. Study researchers will also evaluate the effect of VRC01 on the number
      of infected cells containing unspliced HIV-1 transcripts in the blood in participants.

      This study enrolled HIV-infected people 18 to 65 years old, who had been receiving ART for at
      least 2 years and who had a CD4+ count of 200 cells/mm^3 or greater. Participants were
      randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Participants in Arm A received an intravenous (IV)
      infusion of VRC01 at Day 0 and Week 3 and an IV infusion of placebo (normal saline) at Weeks
      6 and 9. Participants in Arm B received an IV infusion of placebo (normal saline) at Day 0
      and Week 3 and an IV infusion of VRC01 at Weeks 6 and 9. Participants recorded their
      temperature and symptoms for 3 days after each infusion. Study visits occured at study entry
      (Day 0), and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, and 30. Study visits
      included physical examinations, clinical assessments, and blood collection.

      The primary safety outcome for this study was descriptive and assessed the occurrence of
      Grade â‰¥ 3 AEs including signs/symptoms, lab toxicities, and/or clinical events that are
      possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment (as judged by the core team,
      blinded to treatment arm) at any time from the initial dose of study treatment to the end of
      study follow-up. Since this outcome is descriptive, no statistical significance testing was
      performed.
