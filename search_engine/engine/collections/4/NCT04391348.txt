      developing on cirrhosis in 90% of cases. The prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor with
      an overall survival of around 10% at 5 years for all tumor stages combined. The diagnosis of
      HCC relies on non-invasive conventional imaging criteria (computed tomography [CT] and/or
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and/or histology. Conventional imaging (liver CT and/or MRI
      and lung CT) enables HCC staging according to the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC)
      system, linking each stage to therapeutic modalities. Accurate staging with reliable imaging
      methods is therefore crucial to determine the best treatment strategy. The principal
      objective is to demonstrate that the identification of new tumor lesions by an experimental
      procedure combining 18F-FDG and 18F-Fluorocholine PET-CT scans in patients with HCC, modifies
      the initially planned therapeutic strategy of a curative treatment palliative treatment, from
      locoregional palliative treatment to systemic palliative treatment.
