      of the general population (7.6%), and the degree of anemia increases with the severity of
      CKD. A number of RCT studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of oral Roxadustat in
      the treatment of renal anemia, but there is a lack of evidence from cohort studies. A
      prospective cohort study is planed to conduct to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Roxadustat for renal anemia in the real world. It is planned to continuously recruit patients
      with renal anemia in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital from October 2020 to June 2023. The
      treatment of anemia will be recorded (Roxadustat or erythropoietin), and the observation
      period is one year. Collect the patient's demographic characteristics, drug dosage,
      adjustment plan, hemoglobin. The main outcome indicators were: the average change in Hb from
      baseline to 28-52 weeks, and the Hb response rate reached during two consecutive visits; the
      secondary outcome indicators were: the maintenance rate of the target Hb level, iron
      metabolism indicators, 0 to 8 weeks of Hb level increase rate, dose adjustment and safety
      indicators. The generalized additive mixed model of repeated measures was used to analyze the
      changes and differences of outcome indicators in different groups. Expected results: In the
      cohort study, the effectiveness and safety of roxastat in the treatment of renal anemia, the
      starting dose and the adjustment plan, provide a basis for guiding the clinical safe and
      effective application of roxastat.
