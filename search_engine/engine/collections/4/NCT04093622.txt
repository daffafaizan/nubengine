    
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who
      received a Fate Therapeutics NK cell product that has been modified by lentivirus-mediated
      genetically engineering. The period of follow-up is 15 years after the administration of the
      NK cell product.

      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Fate Therapeutics clinical studies. Upon withdrawal
      or completion of the parent interventional study, the study site will contact the
      subject/healthcare provider/legal guardian annually.
