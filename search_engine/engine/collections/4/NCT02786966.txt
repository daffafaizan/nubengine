      application of the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR). Once the training has been completed,
      paramedics will begin using the CCR to evaluate patients with potential c-spine injuries. For
      the first three months of the evaluation period, paramedics will use the CCR to evaluate
      eligible patients, but continue to use spinal immobilization for transport according to their
      existing protocols. After this validation period, participating services will be randomized
      in stepped wedge fashion in clusters of 4 services to actively use the CCR and selectively
      immobilize according to the CCR.
