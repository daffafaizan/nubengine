      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of OCD+BPD children, it calls for a preliminary
      open pilot treatment study to explore these issues as a logical first step that could lead to
      systematic randomized controlled trials in the future. SSRI's are the first line and most
      commonly used anti-OCD agents. It remains unknown, which of the standard SSRIs is least
      activating for youth with BPD. Fluoxetine along with fluvoxamine and sertraline are FDA
      approved for the treatment of OCD in children. Fluoxetine remains the most extensively
      studied SSRI in children. We will test the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in children and
      adolescents with BPD and OCD.

      The proposed study includes 1.) the use of a 12-week design to document the response rate and
      2.) careful assessment of safety and tolerability
