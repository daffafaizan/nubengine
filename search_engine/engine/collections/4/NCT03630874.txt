      events, which justifies the implementation of risk minimization actions. Avoiding
      inappropriate oral AT combinations is a major concern, particularly for patients with
      multiple chronic conditions. The first step is to provide fast and easy access to the latest
      recommendations. From a systematic review of international guidelines (2012-2018), a
      prescription support-tool synthesizing national and international guidelines on chronic
      management (â‰¥ 1 month) of oral AT agents without considering in-hospital management and
      bridging therapy will be developed. Our main objective in this study is to evaluate the
      accuracy of this tool by measuring the appropriateness of oral AT prescriptions according to
      the most recent guidelines.

      Methods and analysis: In this web-based randomized controlled trial, participating French
      general practitioners and cardiologists in the outpatient setting will be randomized by use
      or not of the prescription support-tool. They will be asked to provide the number of drugs,
      drug class, duration and dosage of ATs, within a time window of 10 minutes, for 3 different
      clinical situations presented as clinical vignettes (multiple-choice questions). The
      scientific committee has created and validated 30 clinical vignettes illustrating outpatient
      clinical situations for which the use of oral ATs (single, dual or triple therapy) is
      recommended or not according to the guidelines. All data will be treated anonymously.

      Ethics and dissemination: If the prescription support-tool is associated with more
      appropriate prescription of AT combinations, its dissemination to further evaluate outcome
      data including haemorrhage, ischemic events, and death will be considered.
