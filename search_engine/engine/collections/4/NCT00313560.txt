      This study is a phase II trial of erlotinib in combination with chemoradiation in patients
      with resected stage I/II adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are candidates for adjuvant
      chemoradiation. Eligible patients will receive adjuvant treatment with erlotinib 100 mg plus
      Capecitabine 800 mg/m2 PO BID (5 days on/ 2 days off regimen) and External Beam Radiation
      Therapy (EBRT) at doses of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions after pancreatectomy (Dosing for
      capecitabine and erlotinib was amended after considering the toxicity profile of the first 6
      patients). Approximately 4-8 weeks after the conclusion of chemoradiation, it is recommended
      patients will continue treatment with 4 cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15
      every 28 days plus daily erlotinib 100 mg.

      Eligible patients will receive adjuvant treatment with erlotinib 100 mg plus Capecitabine 800
      mg/m2 PO BID (5 days on/ 2 days off) and External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) to the tumor
      bed plus adjacent lymph nodes at doses of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions after surgery. For patients
      with close or positive margins after resection, they will be able to receive 54.0 Gy over 30
      fractions. Approximately 4-8 weeks after the conclusion of chemoradiation, it is recommended
      patients will continue treatment with 4 cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15
      every 28 days plus erlotinib 100 mg/daily.
