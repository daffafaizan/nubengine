heterogeneity of the 'cleft palate population' and research designsthe primary point made in this paper is that we must reject the notionthat there is some inherent, universal commonality among individualswho are born with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate.  we must recognize thevarious pertinent subgroups within this population.  this does not mean,however, that one must always recognize the smallest subgroup in doing agiven study.  on the contrary, we would defend the use of fewest possiblesubgroups consistent with the specific research purpose.  nevertheless, wefeel that time spent considering the purposes of a study and the subgroupswhich need to be identified will tend to minimize the number ofcontradictory results, and will assist us in the interpretation of theobservations that our insight and technology make possible.
