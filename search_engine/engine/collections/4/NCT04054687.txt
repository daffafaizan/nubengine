    
      Pledget soaked in either saline or TXA will be applied to the bleeding nare of the patient
      presenting with anterior epistaxis. After fifteen minutes, the pledget will be removed and
      patient reassessed.

      Informed consent will be obtained prior to patient enrollment.

      Enrolled patients will be placed in one of two groups: either the group receiving a cotton
      pledget soaked in (0.9%) saline or (100mg/1mL) TXA. Patients will initially be asked to
      gently blow their nose to remove any clots. Group 1 will receive the saline soaked pledget.
      After fifteen minutes the pledget will be removed. If patient continues to bleed within a
      reevaluation period of fifteen minutes, this will be deemed a 'failure' and the examiner will
      pack the nose with the method of his or her choice. Group 2 will receive the TXA soaked
      pledget and the procedure will continue like Group 1.

      Patient satisfaction will be assessed in both groups during ED stay and one week after ED
      stay.
