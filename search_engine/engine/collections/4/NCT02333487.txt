      multiple oral doses for up to 21 days before the PET scans were performed. The doses in all
      groups were selected with the aim of characterising the exposure response (occupancy) curve.
      The doses for all groups, with the exception of A1, B1, and C1, were subject to change within
      the dose range already investigated and found tolerable. The next dose for the groups was
      established at a dosing conference based on an evaluation of the occupancy obtained, and
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from all previous cohorts.
