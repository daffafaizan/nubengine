      treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Prior to taking the study medication,
      subjects will have medical and psychiatric evaluations, complete self-report questionnaires,
      do a functional MRI scan, and complete a set of cognitive tests. While taking the study
      medication, participants will meet weekly with a study doctor and be administered interviews
      and questionnaires. At the end of the 8-week trial, participants will be asked to repeat the
      MRI scan and cognitive tests.
