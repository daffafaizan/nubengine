      receptor function, profoundly elevated concentrations of low density lipoproteins,
      accelerated atherosclerosis and death by early adulthood. This disease is heterogeneous in
      both the degree of LDL receptor dysfunction as well as the age of death. Liver
      transplantation has been demonstrated to virtually normalize plasma lipoprotein
      concentrations in homozygous FH and the recent cloning of a functional LDL receptor gene
      holds promise in the definitive treatment of this condition. We propose performing
      longitudinal sequential cardiologic studies utilizing noninvasive techniques in homozygous
      patients with well-characterized LDL receptor defects. Sequential cardiovascular study of
      these patients will not only characterize the progression of atherosclerosis heart disease in
      this disease, it may also permit the identification of individuals with would be likely to
      benefit from liver transplantation and/or genetic engineering.
