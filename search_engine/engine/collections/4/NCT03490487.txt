      sensorimotor seizures in the face during sleep, which may secondarily generalize, along with
      spike-wave discharges, reflecting nonlesional cortical excitability from rolandic regions.

      The prognosis is usually considered to be excellent. Over the past years, however, some
      investigators have questioned whether Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes is indeed
      benign, considering the variety of different presentations associated with the disorder.It is
      not uncommon for Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes to be associated with
      neuropsychological deficits, such as linguistic, cognitive, and behavioral impairment. In
      particular, reading difficulties and speech/language disorders are more common in children
      with Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes than in healthy controls.Various
      neuropsychological deficits seem to be very dependent on the spike index, as well as the
      predominant localization of epileptiform discharges.Furthermore, the frequency of
      epileptiform discharges is closely related not only to the degree of neuropsychological
      deficits, but also to an atypical evolution of benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes.

      The high comorbid prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy
      suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship between these disorders .Cognitive
      impairment and attention problems are particularly crucial issues in children with epilepsy
      who are in a vigorous phase of neurodevelopment.

      Resolution of continuous spike-and-wave during sleep had been achieved with conventional
      antiepileptic drugs including ethosuximide, valproic acid, levetiracetam, and sulthiame. When
      these agents fail to normalize the EEG, a trial with second-line agents such as steroids or
      high-dose diazepam is attempted.
