      physical activity reduction (-50% steps per day) and overfeeding (+50% kcal per day,
      comprising 65% fat) on peripheral (conduit artery and skin microvessels) and cerebrovascular
      function and insulin sensitivity in healthy male participants. Moreover, the investigators
      will explore whether the detrimental impact of this lifestyle can be mitigated by daily tea
      consumption (equivalent to 6 cups/day). To explore this hypothesis, the investigators will
      perform measurements of these parameters before and after 7-days of reduced physical activity
      and overfeeding, with and without the combination of daily tea ingestion.
