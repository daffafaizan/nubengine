      is an important issue, most physicians usually use conventional methods such as the
      difference between the amount of intake and output (I & O), which is not objective way.

      Meanwhile, bioimpedance electrical vector analysis presents the patients' fluid status with
      more objective data.

      Thus, the investigators will investigate the clinical benefit for monitoring fluid balance by
      using InBody S10 (0, 1, 2-day, and 7-day from CRRT initiation), one of representative
      bioimpedance electrical vector analysis, compared with conventional methods among the
      patients who need continuous renal replacement therapy.
