    
      24 patients will be included in a double blind placebo controlled cross-over 8 week study
      comparing placebo to Niaspan (a long release formulation of niacin). In order to prevent any
      drop out linked to the flushing side effect of niacin, patient will take aspirin (300mg)
      prior to treatment throughout the study duration. The study will include at start and end of
      each arm, a full lipoproteins quantification as well as a measure of enzymes involved in
      lipid metabolism. On day 42 and 56 of each period, after an administration of either placebo
      or 500mg of immediate release niacin respectively, changes in plasma free fatty acid levels
      will be measured for 8hours in order to assess potential loss of activity of niacin over time
      upon chronic treatment with niaspan. Half of the patient will have an exploration of their
      glucose metabolism using hyperinsulinic clamp technique, whereas in the other half a
      metabolic turnover study using stable isotopes will focus on their lipoproteins,
      triglycerides and cholesterol handling. These explorations will be done at the end of each
      treatment period.
