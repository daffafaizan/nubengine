        -  Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with
           AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with lomustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide,
           and procarbazine.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on the underlying HIV infection in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1 (course 1 only), oral etoposide on days 1-3, and
      oral cyclophosphamide and oral procarbazine on days 22-26. Patients may also receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 28-42. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for
      2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on days 1 and 22 of each course, at day 84, and then
      every 3 months for 1 year.

      Patients are followed at day 84 and then every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 in the United States and 44 in Africa) will be
      accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
