      of cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide. Standard fixed doses of this combination have
      been based on calculating a patient's body surface area. This method of dose calculation has
      been shown to be poorly correlated with the activity of many chemotherapy drugs, and some
      patients do not obtain adequate levels of the drug in their circulation. Recent reports
      suggest that patients who have a very high tolerability to chemotherapy (without significant
      toxicity), are at risk for having less effectiveness of the therapy. This study will compare
      fixed doses of standard chemotherapy with a new strategy of the same chemotherapy with doses
      that will be adjusted according to the toxicity observed.
