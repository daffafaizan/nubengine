    
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, (Pharmacokinetics) PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in Japanese
      subjects with advanced solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

      Subjects will receive ascending dose levels of CC-122 from Cycle 1 onwards to measure PK and
      to determine safety and tolerability.

      An initial cohort of at least three subjects will be given CC-122 at a dose of 2.0 mg on an
      intermittent dosing schedule (5 continuous days out of 7 days per week) and 3-6 subjects will
      be enrolled in subsequent dose levels. Dose escalation for subsequent cohorts will proceed
      according to a standard dose escalation design (3+3 design) (Storer, 1989) to establish
      initial toxicity.
