      syndrome. MPS II is a lysosomal storage disease with an X-linked recessive inheritance type,
      which is characterized by a decrease in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S), caused by a mutation in the IDS gene. Enzyme deficiency leads to
      the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in lysosomes, mainly fractions of heparan and
      dermatan sulfates. Because of the insufficient activity of iduronate sulfatase participating
      in the first stage of catabolism of GAG, they accumulate in lysosomes of almost all types of
      cells of various tissues and organs. The disease is manifested by growth retardation, damage
      of many organs and systems, severe deformations of bones and joints, gross facial features,
      pathology of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, damage to parenchymal organs
      (hepatosplenomegaly), and hearing impairment. A severe form of the disease occurs with the
      involvement of the nervous system in the pathological process, including mental retardation,
      behavior anomalies, and impaired motor function.

      GNR 055 is a modified enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase capable of penetrating the blood-brain
      barrier and thus it is expected to prevent neurodegenerative consequences and the development
      of cognitive deficit in the future that will allow achieving a significant improvement in the
      life quality and expectancy of patients with MPS II
