      Primary

        -  Evaluate clinical tumor response at 6 months in patients with hormone-sensitive
           non-metastatic breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant anastrozole and fulvestrant.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate tumor regression by mammography and ultrasound in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the rate of breast conservation at 6 months of treatment in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of these regimens.

        -  Estimate the relapse-free survival at 5 years.

        -  Identify molecular signatures predictive of response in these patients.

        -  Identify genes implicated in response in these patients.

        -  Identify changes in mRNA splicing of genes involved in breast tumorigenesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-comparative multicentre randomised phase II study in which patients
      from three French centres were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either
      anatrozole or fulvestrant.

      All patients undergo biopsy at baseline. Patients are randomized between the two treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1, 14, and 28 and then once
           a month at 2-6 months.

      Within 8 days after completion of hormone therapy, all patients undergo surgical resection of
      the residual lesion followed by radiotherapy. Patients then receive oral anastrozole once
      daily for 5 years.

      Tissue samples from biopsy and surgery are analyzed to assess molecular signatures and
      sensitivity to treatment, and to compare gene expression variation with response.
