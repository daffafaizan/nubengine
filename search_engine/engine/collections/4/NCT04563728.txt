      test the potential effectiveness of a surveillance intervention to reduce frequency and
      severity of elder abuse among older populations. Eligible participants will be recruited from
      community-dwelling populations in which an older adult victim has experienced elder abuse
      (abuse, exploitation, neglect) according to New Jersey APS referrals or our screening. With
      informed written consent, participants will be evenly randomized into one of three
      conditions: camera, mock camera, and control (usual care).

      Primary outcomes are elder abuse cases including psychological, physical, sexual abuse,
      financial exploitations, caregiver neglect, and self-neglect measured by 83 items. For
      psychological and physical abuse, we use eight items and ten items from a modified Conflict
      Tactics Scale (CTS).46-53. Sexual abuse will be assessed by a question asking about
      experiences of being touched in private areas when unwanted. Financial exploitation will be
      assessed by the 17-item Financial Exploitation Scale, adapted from Conrad et al in a study
      funded by the Department of Justice.54 Caregiver neglect will be assessed by 20 items of
      unmet needs in key activities of daily living among individuals living with at least one
      person.35,55 Self-neglect was assessed by a widely used and validated measurement56,57.The
      measurement was reviewed by a community advisory board of over 20 community organizations led
      by a geriatrician and has shown good contend, convergent58, and predictive validity59.
