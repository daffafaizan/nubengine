      biliary drainage in patients with malignant high grade biliary stricture. Malignant high
      grade biliary stricture has not been well defined. The investigators define this malignant
      high grade biliary stricture using these arbitrary number include total bilirubin ≥ 15 mg/dl
      and or bile duct diameter ≥12 mm. based on the investigation's experience.

      The study will be divided patients with inoperable malignant high grade biliary stricture
      into 2 groups, group (A) will be undergone ERCP with biliary stenting and group (B) will be
      undergone EUS guided biliary drainage. If the assigned intervention is not successful, then
      patients will be crossed-over to the another intervention.
