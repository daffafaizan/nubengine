      outcomes of the Menicon Z Night orthokeratolgy contact lens for reducing myopia progression
      in children in comparison with a group of distance, single-vision glasses over a 2-year
      period. Efficacy was evaluated by assessing differences in the axial length between groups.
      Safety was evaluated by comparing the incidence of adverse events between groups. Differences
      between groups in patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire that
      assessed vision-related quality-of-life measures.
