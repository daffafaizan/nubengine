        -  Determine the side effects of radiofrequency ablation in patients with bone metastases.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on pain in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on mood in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of narcotic usage in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the relationship between laboratory and imaging features of this treatment and
           the effects of the treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the metastatic
      lesion over approximately 12 minutes.

      Pain and mood are assessed at baseline, daily for 14 days after treatment, and at 1 and 3
      months after treatment.

      Patients are followed at 1 week and then at 1 and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12.5
      months.
