      safety, reliability, and accuracy of these devices for continuous ICU EEG signal
      measurements, and 3) demonstrate these devices are preferred by patients and parents to
      current EEG devices. Once validated, such sensors could fundamentally change the way patients
      are monitored by EEG in the ICU, allowing wireless, continuous, real-time detection of brain
      wave activity in ICU patients, reducing limitations in mobility as well as access by staff
      and caregivers to the patient, and ultimately offering opportunity to reduce morbidity and
      mortality in ICU patients.
