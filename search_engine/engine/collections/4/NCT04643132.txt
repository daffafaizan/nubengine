      become a major health problem which impairs the life quality of patients and burdens
      healthcare systems worldwide. Poor post-surgical pain control is a leading factor that
      hinders the physical rehabilitation and musculoskeletal functional recovery, and causes acute
      cognitive impairment and chronic pain syndrome. Also, existing treatments of opioids and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have potential drawbacks, which may in turn interfere
      with bone healing. Therefore, prophylaxis of fracture-associated pain is indispensable to
      postoperative comfort and satisfaction.

      There is no denying the fact that pathologic pain is related to central glutaminergic system
      and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation induced central sensitization. Also, we
      previously reported that neuroinflammation is associated with pain development and cognitive
      dysfunction. Ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, is effective in reversing NMDA receptor
      activation underlying pain states. But the side effects of ketamine limit its clinical
      application, such as Delirium, gibberish and agitation. It is clarified that S-ketamine has
      lower side effects than ketamine and that antinociception of S-ketamine is stronger than
      ketamine. The following study is carried out to evaluate whether S-ketamine can prevent
      postoperative pain and cognitive impairment after tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery in
      patients.
