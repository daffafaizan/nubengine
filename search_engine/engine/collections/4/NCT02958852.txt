    
      A randomized, open-labelled, phase II trial in the first and second-line metastatic treatment
      setting, comparing standard endocrine treatment (aromatase inhibitor (AI)) with endocrine
      treatment plus atorvastatin (1:1). Upon progression in the first line setting, and as part of
      the translational studies on mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy, the patients will
      receive second line endocrine treatment using fulvestrant. Upon progression to first line
      treatment, patients that were receiving atorvastatin will stop this treatment.
