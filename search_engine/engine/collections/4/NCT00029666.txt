      of gait and freezing. A promising technique is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) that, so far, has produced small effects on bradykinesia in drug free patients in
      limited trials. We hypothesize that rTMS will have a beneficial effect on gait and freezing
      in medicated patients, and propose to test this in a controlled trial. Specifically, we
      propose to look at the effect of 25 Hz stimulation since this type of stimulation has been
      shown to increase the excitability of the cerebral cortex. Over a one-year period, we will
      enroll 40 adults with PD and evaluate the effects 8 treatments over a period of 4 weeks. We
      will investigate effects on the motor cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex since
      both of these regions may be underactivated in PD and recent data suggest a change in
      diencephalic dopamine function with rTMS of the prefrontal cortex. Symptoms will be evaluated
      with standard tests of motor function including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      and specific tests of gait and freezing. We will look for acute effects of stimulation and
      for cumulative effects.
