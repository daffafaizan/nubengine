      mortality. It is estimated that 20% of premature infants surviving beyond the first three
      days of life will have one or more culture-proven bacteremic sepsis. There is increasing
      epidemiologic and biologic evidence suggesting that preterm newborns are more susceptible to
      infection than term newborns and adults. Immaturity of the immune system, and, in particular,
      defects in innate responses to pathogens are of foremost importance in the pathogenesis of
      neonatal sepsis. The aims of the study are the:

        1. Determination of the opsonic capacity of plasma from premature infants, vs. term
           newborns, and identification possible molecular innate immune defect(s) in preterm
           plasma.

        2. Characterization of the role of TLR2 and TLR4 responses in phagocytes from premature
           infants using classical TLRs agonists. Determination of the capacity of plasma from
           premature infants to sustain TLR pathways, with a particular attention paid to the
           possible role of soluble MD-2 in plasma from premature infants in TLR-dependent
           opsonophagocytosis.

        3. Determine prognostic factors for neonatal sepsis. The identification of a quantitative
           and/or qualitative defect in innate plasma protein(s) in premature newborns has the
           potential of identifying those infants who are likely to develop a neonatal sepsis.
