      increase in the malaria case fatality rate in areas of low transmission.
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used widely in Africa for the systematic intermittent
      presumptive, or preventive, treatment (IPTp) during the second and third trimester of
      pregnancy and a national program of IPTp with SP has been implemented recently in Mozambique.
      There is evidence that the kinetics of several other antimalarial drugs are altered in
      pregnancy to the extent that doses are not adequate in pregnancy, however no published study
      has included a pharmacokinetic component to confirm that standard doses of SP are optimal in
      this vulnerable patient group. This study therefore creates the opportunity to study whether
      the pharmacokinetic properties of SP are altered by physiological changes that occur during
      pregnancy.
