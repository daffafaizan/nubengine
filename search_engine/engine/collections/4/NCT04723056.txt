      defecation or a change of bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS can be looked through the
      biopsychosocial model of disease which is defined by the complex interplay between genetic,
      cultural, environmental, and psychosocial factors.

      Treatment of IBS is multifaceted and ranges from exercise to dietary restrictions, however,
      psychological treatments to target the gut-brain axis such as cognitive-behavior therapy
      (CBT) have also been shown to be an effective therapy, and aims to address the psychological
      and environmental stressors that contribute to the symptoms. Therefore the purpose of the
      study is investigate the effectiveness of Zemedy, a mobile application that enables the
      digital delivery of a CBT program to people with IBS.

      CBT has been shown to reduce the severity of intractable IBS symptoms by as much as 70%. The
      investigators hope to learn whether the Zemedy mobile application is effective in the
      reduction of IBS. This will be measured based on their IBS Symptom Severity Scores (SSS) at
      week 8 compared to baseline.
