      a modifiable, prognostic response to hemodynamic stimuli across physiologic (e.g., exercise)
      and pathologic states (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis). The extent of myocardial
      hypertrophy is determined by a combination of cardiomyocyte size and extracellular volume
      (ECV) expansion/interstitial fibrosis: while physiologic (exercise-induced) hypertrophy
      reflects mostly reversible cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, pathologic hypertrophy (e.g., in heart
      failure) is a combination of both interstitial fibrosis (potentially irreversible) and
      cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (reversible). Current methods to delineate the potential for LV
      reverse remodeling (e.g., natriuretic peptides and echocardiographic or clinical markers)
      detect primarily advanced disease, missing a critical opportunity to intervene and follow
      patients at an early disease phase where myocardial pathology may be reversible. Therefore,
      establishing novel, quantitative metrics of myocardial tissue phenotype that define a
      transition from hypertrophy to fibrosis, and then to irreversible LV remodeling/dysfunction
      may facilitate targeting therapies at a modifiable stage of disease in HF. The investigator's
      group has recently extended cardiac T1 mapping MRI techniques to quantify the intracellular
      lifetime of water (Ï„ic) serially as an index of cardiomyocyte diameter, validating this
      technique histologically in mouse models of pressure overload.
