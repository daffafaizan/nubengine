      and health care team (HCT). The system includes a decision support system to be used by the
      HCT aiming to aid clinical decision making with mathematical models. The system does not
      intend to replace clinical judgement and all recommendations are to be approved by the HCT.

      Forty (40) diabetic patients on multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) with abnormal HbA1c
      and identified as potential end users of the device will be recruited to the study and
      screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patient's daily blood
      glucose will be measured and the GlucoMe App will give its recommendations for change in
      insulin dose, as well as recommendations for pre and post-meal carbohydrate and exercise.
      Patient's daily blood glucose levels will be followed by the HCT biweekly for 12 weeks and
      patients will be instructed to change their insulin doses according to the decision of the
      treating physician. At the end of the study, the HCT's recommendations for treatment
      adjustment will be compared to those of the system for both safety and efficacy. Study
      subjects and the HCT will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the GlucoMe system
      usability.
