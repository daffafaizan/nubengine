      assessing implementation, effectiveness and safety of TFV gel in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
      All study participants in CAPRISA 008 have also participated in CAPRISA 004 and thus have
      several years of experience using TFV gel with the prefilled, plastic applicator. CAPRISA 070
      will allow us to assess acceptability of the user-filled, paper applicator among women who
      have had extensive experience with the pre-filled, plastic applicator and are well-positioned
      to provide feedback and comparisons on a new gel delivery method.
