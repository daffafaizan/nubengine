      (CBD) versus placebo for chronic non-cancer pain. Participants will include individuals with
      chronic pain, who will be randomized into one of two intervention conditions: low THC/high
      CBD or placebo. In addition to receiving CBD or placebo, participants also will complete
      symptom assessments of chronic pain data (intensity, quality, interference/disability)
      throughout the study. These measures will be gathered prior to and following the fifth doses
      (dosing will occur once per day for five days) of CBD or placebo. A secondary objective will
      be to examine the association between clinical and inflammatory markers.
