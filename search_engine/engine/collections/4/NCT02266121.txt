    
      tDCS will be used in a sham-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over control trial in
      MS patients suffering from cognitive impairments and/or motor deficits. After informed
      consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or
      sham tDCS, that will be applied during working memory and attentional tasks. A few days/weeks
      after completing one arm, the patients will enter the other arm (double-blind cross-over
      design).

      Baseline and follow-up outcomes about cognitive aptitudes, motor tasks and fatigue will be
      collected.
