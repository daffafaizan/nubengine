    
      This project runs in parallel to a larger randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in which the
      'modern neuroscience approach to WAD' is compared to usual care evidence-based physiotherapy
      (clinical trial registration number: NCT03239938). For the current study, additional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) measures will be taken in a subsample of patients, who will be
      recruited from this larger RCT. In addition, a pain-free age- and sex-matched control group
      will be recruited for comparison.

      The current study consists of 2 MRI measurements that will take place at the University
      Hospital of Ghent (UZ Gent): baseline (pre-treatment) and follow-up (post-treatment;
      approximately 16 weeks after baseline). After pre-treatment assessment, the patients will be
      randomly allocated to the modern neuroscience approach or usual care physiotherapy, as part
      of the RCT.
