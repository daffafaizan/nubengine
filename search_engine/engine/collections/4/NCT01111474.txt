      initial cervical dentin hypersensitivity was checked throughout a thermal test (air blast).
      The 434 teeth included were that with a score ≥5 in a numerical scale rating of pain. Teeth
      were randomly assigned according quadrants (split mouth design) - 216 were allocated to LILT
      group and 218 for the Super Bonder® group. Thermal tests with a tetrafluoroethane spray
      (Endo-Ice®) and air blast were performed and considered as baseline. Pain parameters were
      recorded using a numerical scale rating with 24 hours, 30, 90 and 180 days after the
      interventions. Quality of life of the patients was also assessed with the use of OHIP-14 at
      baseline and after 180 days.
