      with lung cancers are already in advanced stages when diagnosed, and the 5-year survival rate
      of advanced lung cancer is less than 5%. Therefore, exploring effective treatments is of
      great significance for improving the survival and quality of life of patients with lung
      cancer. Immunotherapy represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors has received widespread
      attention in the field of lung cancer, and several PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors
      have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However,
      its overall effective population is only 20%, even in studies of enriched populations (such
      as PD-L1 â‰¥ 50%), its single-drug effective rate is only about 40%. Therefore, this study aims
      to explore the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy
      in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy in the first-line treatment
      of advanced central non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled,
      prospective clinical trial to examine the efficacy, safety and mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1
      monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted
      interventional therapy versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with
      chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of patients with advanced central NSCLC.
