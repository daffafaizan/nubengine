      Conditioning therapy will start on day -5 in patients who are randomized to receive Cy+ATG.
      Hydration with 0.45% NaCl at 6 liters/24 hours will be started on day -5. Cy 50 mg/kg in D5W
      200 ml i.v. over 1-2 hours on days -5 to -2 by pump through a central venous catheter. Mesna
      12 mg/kg iv push immediately before Cy and 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after Cy. Thymoglobuline 3
      mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL
      (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication for ATG (ALG) will
      include methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and Avil 45.5 mg iv push.
      The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated using actual body weight.

      Conditioning therapy will start on day -6 in patients who are randomized to receive
      Cy+fludarabine (FludaraÂ®, Berlex Laboratories, Richmond, CA)+ATG. Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 will
      be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W 100 ml for 5 consecutive days (days -6 to
      -2). Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15
      mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication
      for ATG (ALG) will include methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and
      Avil 45.5 mg iv push. Hydration with 0.45% NaCl at 6 liters/24 hours will be started on day
      -3. Cy 50 mg/kg in D5W 200 ml i.v. over 1-2 hours on days -3 to -2 by pump through a central
      venous catheter. Mesna 12 mg/kg iv push immediately before Cy and 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after
      Cy. The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated using actual body weight.
