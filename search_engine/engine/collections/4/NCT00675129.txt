      Exact data on the repetition of self-harm over 16-20 week and 12 months observation periods
      for adolescents in outpatient psychiatric treatment are not available. Building on previous
      clinical studies and RCT studies in adults receiving DBT, we anticipate that the 16 week
      repetition rate will be 50% for adolescents who receive EUC and 25% for adolescents who
      receive DBT. With an alpha error level of 5% 60 patients in each group is needed to provide
      80% power with a two tailed test. We anticipate a drop out rate from research assessments of
      no more than 25%. To compensate for this attrition, it is calculated that 15 patients in each
      treatment group should be added, leading to a total number of 150 patients to be included in
      the trial. A more precise power analysis and determination of how many patients to include in
      the study will be based on data from the first 40 patients who have been included.

      A power analysis conducted on the basis of the first 40 patients showed that:

        1. There had been no attrition from research assessments

        2. With an alpha error level of 5% 40 patients in each group is needed to provide 80% power
           with a two tailed test

      A final number of patients to include was therefore fixed at 80.
