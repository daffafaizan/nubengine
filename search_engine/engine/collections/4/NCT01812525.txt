      year of life and leads to a large number of hospital admissions. The only recommended
      treatment is supportive. However many different types of drug inhalations have been studied
      but their efficacy remains controversial.

      Our study will compare recommended supportive therapy to supportive therapy combined to
      hypertonic saline (NaCl 3%) inhalations in the treatment of moderate to severe bronchiolitis.
      This will be the first study to use a true control group with no inhalation.
