      I. To determine the maximum-tolerable radiotherapy (RT) dose fraction for accelerated
      hypofractionated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of radiographic response to treatment. II. To estimate the rates of
      progression: local/regional/distant. III. To estimate the progression-free survival. IV. To
      estimate the overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy.

      CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo accelerated
      hypofractionated radiotherapy using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 4-5.5
      weeks.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
