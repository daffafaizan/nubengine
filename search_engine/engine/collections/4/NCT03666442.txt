      investigators design this phase II trial to explore the effect of 2 cycles Xelox
      chemotherapy,so as to explore the early detection of sensitivity of tumor. With inclusion of
      early,intermediate,and bad stage II/III rectal cancer patients, four cycle of Xelox
      chemotherapy was given. After the second cycle, MRI,TRUS,DE,endoscopy,and blood DNA test was
      down to compare with these characteristics of four cycles.so that to detect the data about
      the chemosensitivity of tumor in the early stage.In future, a phase III trial that explore
      the effect of radiation or surgery in these chemoresistant patients.
