      complex system that modulates local gut homeostasis and systemic biological processes.
      Several environmental factors have been shown to influence the gut milieu (including
      microbiota), and thus both gastrointestinal and host health. Relevant to the current proposal
      is the influence of body weight, diet, and circadian rhythms. In the current study, the
      investigators propose to use these common disruptors of gastrointestinal health through
      recruiting obese shift workers with a low-fiber diet to identify if these disrupted
      individuals can benefit from blueberry intake. Specifically, the study objectives are to
      determine if 21 g whole blueberry powder consumed daily can beneficially modify intestinal
      permeability, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and both gut-derived and systemic
      inflammation in those most susceptible to a pro-inflammatory milieu. This will be
      accomplished through a 14-week crossover study in which 28 individuals will be randomized by
      treatment group order to 4 weeks of whole blueberry powder and placebo powder, with a 4-week
      wash out in between the treatment periods.
