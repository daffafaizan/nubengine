      March 2005 and April 2009 were reviewed, with follow-up between 2 and 6 years. The retention
      rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between TNFi was done after
      adjustment using a Cox model. Factors associated with better retention were identified by
      multivariate analysis. Medical charts of all patients with RA starting a first TNFÎ± inhibitor
      therapy between March 1, 2005 (start of commercialization of adalimumab in France) and April
      30, 2009 (allowing at least 2 years of follow-up) were systematically reviewed in detail by 2
      rheumatologist investigators
