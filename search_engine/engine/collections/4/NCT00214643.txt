      effective and safe combination of antibiotics which demonstrated good activity against
      malaria parasite in previous phase II studies in African children. In this phase III trial,
      the efficacy and safety of the combination will be evaluated in African children with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. A single dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, the standard
      antimalarial in Gabon, is used as comparator.
