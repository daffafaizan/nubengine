      are preterm less than 34 weeks gestational age, in the first group umbilical cord milking
      will be done for preterm infant with placental insufficiency. Two control groups are present,
      in the first one umbilical cord milking will be done for preterm infants without placental
      insufficiency (Insufficiency vs. no insufficiency), another group of immediate cord clamping
      for preterm infants with placental insufficiency will be added (milking vs. no milking), 30
      cases will be recruited in each group.

      Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is typically performed by placing the infant below the level of
      the placenta. The cord is held at 20-25 cm distance from the baby and milked vigorously
      towards the umbilicus for 3 times at a speed of 10 cm/sec. After completion, the cord is
      clamped, and the neonate is handed to the resuscitation team.

      One milliliter of fetal blood will be taken from peripheral venous blood in the first 30 min
      of life and CD34 will be assessed by flow cytometry. Secondary outcomes will be documented
      during NICU stay that include admission CBC, peak bilirubin concentrations, CBC after 2
      months, neonatal morbidity such as sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity and polycythemia, therapeutic interventions such as
      need for inotropes, nasal CPAP, mechanical ventilation and phototherapy.
