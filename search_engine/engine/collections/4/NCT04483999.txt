      offers various experiences to users. Motion sickness can be observed in people after using
      virtual reality applications or simulation devices in education. There are questionnaires in
      the literature such as "Simulator Sickness Questionnaire" and "Motion Sickness
      Questionnaire". However, these questionnaires are specific surveys to evaluate symptoms that
      develop after vehicle handling or use of simulation devices for pilot training, while they
      are not ideal questionnaires to evaluate symptoms that may develop after virtual reality
      applications. Because there are important differences between virtual reality systems and
      simulation systems in terms of the appearance of motion disturbance symptoms. For this
      reason, "Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire" has been developed that can evaluate these
      symptoms.

      There is no Turkish version of the "Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire" in the
      literature. For this reason, this study is planned for the cultural adaptation and validity
      of the "Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire".
