    
      Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), also
      known as the Philadelphia Chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), are not
      congenital, but acquired. The purpose of this project is to find genes whose mutations cause
      these disorders, as well as improve diagnostic measures for these diseases. When this is
      accomplished new therapies to control and eventually cure the disease can be designed.

      All subjects will be asked to donate 4-6 teaspoons of blood. On occasion, if the blood cells
      from a particular sample do not grow well and the DNA from that sample is used up or other
      tests are needed, we may ask to collect additional samples. In patients who have undergone a
      bone marrow biopsy as part of their clinical evaluation, we will test the reproducibility
      between pathologists for the revised 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria to diagnose
      myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).
