      occurring in 2-3 per 1,000 live births. Although the primary deficit in CP is injury to the
      brain, secondary impairments affecting muscle function such as weakness, contractures, and
      spasticity are often far more debilitating and lead to worsening disability throughout the
      lifespan. Some have suggested that these muscle changes in CP may be irreversible; however,
      it is now known that muscles are one of the most 'plastic' tissues in the body. In fact,
      recent evidence suggests that gross muscle hypertrophy and architectural changes within
      muscle fibers can occur as early as 3-5 weeks after resistance training in healthy adults. It
      is also unknown how effectively muscles in CP can adapt to training stimuli that target
      specific muscle architectural parameters, such as fascicle length and cross-sectional area.
      These parameters have been observed to be decreased in CP, suggesting loss of sarcomeres
      in-series (fiber shortening) and in-parallel (muscle atrophy). We propose here that specific
      training-induced muscle architectural adaptations can occur in CP, leading to improved motor
      function.
