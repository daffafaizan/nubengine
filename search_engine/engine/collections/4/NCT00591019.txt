      treating attention problems found in Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). This
      study will investigate the efficacy of Modafinil upon attention deficits found in tinnitus
      patients by assessing pre-attentional and attentional processes (e.g., the amplitude of
      auditory evoked responses and simple reaction time).
