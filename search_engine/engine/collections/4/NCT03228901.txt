      administration of oxytocin modifies non-verbal communication with a stranger.

      This dataset involves a conversation between two strangers that took place 45 minutes after
      drug administration. While Liu et al. coded the video for markers of interpersonal distance
      (physical distance, eye contact, conversational intimacy), the investigators seek to analyse
      oxytocin's effects on non-verbal communication of affiliative and sexual cues (e.g., smiles,
      lip puckers). Based on findings that oxytocin's effects depend on context, the investigators
      will explore these relationships as a function of the conversational context (where
      participants converse with each other using low-, medium-, and high-intimacy topics, or in an
      unstructured conversation).
