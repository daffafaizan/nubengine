      amylase. Changes in salivary alpha amylase concentrations reflect alteration of CNS
      structures anatomically linked to the vagus, thus alertation of alpha amylase would indicate
      the efficacy of tVNS. This study is intended to study basic mechanisms and is not directed
      toward the treatment of any disease state. Particapants taking part in the study will spend
      about one hour in a single session.
