      and screws were often used to repair these fractures but this treatment had limitations
      including restricted weight bearing. Intermedullary nailing is an alternative to plate and
      screw treatment. Weight bearing is allowed and the procedure can be a less invasive. Among
      intramedullary nailing complications are iatrogenic fractures that can be further divided
      into trochanteric and femoral shaft fractures. Trochanteric fractures often heal without
      additional intervention however femoral shaft fractures usually require an additional
      surgical procedure to facilitate healing. This study will monitor fracture healing using
      clinical and radiographic evaluations of subjects with trochanteric fractures of the proximal
      femur treated with the ATN system.
