      consecutive patients for 5 years with prostate cancer who undergo IRE are collected. Data
      from each patient will be collected at participating centers over a 5-year period. Patients'
      data at baseline visit (pre-IRE), peri-operative data and follow up for 5 years will be
      recorded. Follow up data will be collected according to the following schedule:

      1 - 2 weeks after surgery

        1. st year: every 3 months

        2. nd year: every three months

        3. rd year: every 6 months

        4. th and 5th year: once a year. Data from participating centers will be collected through
           electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs), with use of an online Data Management System
           (DMS), which is located and maintained at the CROES Office. The data collection or
           patient participation in this study does not interfere with the choice of treatment,
           sample collection, procedures and the treatment itself, which should entirely follow
           standard hospital practices, including the follow up.
