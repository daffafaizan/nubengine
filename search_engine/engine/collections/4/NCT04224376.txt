      primary ACL reconstruction surgery were recruited at a single tertiary healthcare center
      between April 2016 and February 2018. An ethical approval has been given by MHH ethic
      committee and an IRB was involved. Due to different postoperative treatment protocols and
      different surgical approaches we could include participants between 13 and 46 years. A
      computer based randomization was performed by generating a list of randomized numbers which
      have been provided in sealed envelopes by an independent examiner. The postoperative
      treatment protocol was apart from the use of the GenuSport knee trainer identically
      standardized. The pain management was the same for all patients, none of the participants
      received a continuous peripheral nerve block. The postoperative physiotherapy protocol
      included gait training, assisted walking with crutches, active and passive knee mobilization,
      strength exercises and stair climbing. In the training group each participant was
      additionally provided with a GenuSport knee trainer device (prototype plus tablet with
      software application) with the active knee extension training program for 6 weeks. Except of
      that fact the postoperative protocol was identical in both groups. Participant had to train
      five times daily with the knee trainer starting at the day of surgery.
