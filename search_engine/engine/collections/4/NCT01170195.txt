      view of the resemblance of its structure and lipophilicity to those of estradiol. The results
      indicate that glabridin is a phytoestrogen, binding to the human estrogen receptor and
      stimulating creatine kinase activity in rat uterus, epiphyseal cartilage, diaphyseal bone,
      aorta, and left ventricle of the heart. The stimulatory effects of 2.5-25 mg/animal glabridin
      were similar to those of 5 mg/animal estradiol. Chemical modification of glabridin showed
      that the position of the hydroxyl groups has a significant role in binding to the human
      estrogen receptor and in proliferation-inducing activity. Glabridin was found to be three to
      four times more active than 2*-O-methylglabridin and 4*-O-methylglabridin, and both
      derivatives were more active than 2*,4*- O-methylglabridin. The effect of increasing
      concentrations of glabridin on the growth of breast tumor cells was biphasic. Glabridin
      showed an estrogen receptor-dependent, growth-promoting effect at low concentrations (10
      nM-10 mM) and estrogen receptor-independent antiproliferative activity at concentrations of
      >15 mM. This is the first study to indicate that isoflavans have estrogen-like activities.
      Glabridin and its derivatives exhibited varying degrees of estrogen receptor agonism in
      different tests and demonstrated growth-inhibitory actions on breast cancer cells.
