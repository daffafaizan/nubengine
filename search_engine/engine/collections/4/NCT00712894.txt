      poor clinical outcome. The present pharmacological management involves the use of different
      vasodilators including nitrates, verapamil, adenosine and nicorandil. But no randomized trial
      has been conducted to assess any of these agents, or to determine the appropriate dosage.
      This prospective randomized study aimed to confirm favorable effects of diltiazem on
      no-reflow/slow-flow during direct PCI for AMI compared with verapamil and nitroglycerin.
