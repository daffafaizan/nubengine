    
      The Rectal Surgery Evaluation Trial will be a prospective, observational, case-matched,
      four-cohort, multicenter trial designed to study TME with LAR using open laparotomy,
      laparoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, or transanal surgery in high-surgical-risk patients with
      mid-to-low, non-metastatic rectal cancer. All surgeries will be performed by surgeons
      experienced in a technique. Oncologic, morbidity and functional outcomes will be assessed in
      a composite primary outcome, with success defined as circumferential resection margin â‰¥1 mm,
      TME grade III, and minimal postoperative morbidity (absence of Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV
      complications within 30 days after surgery). Secondary endpoints will include the co-primary
      endpoints over the long-term (2 years), quality of surgery, quality of life, length of
      hospital stay, operative time, and rate of unplanned conversions.
