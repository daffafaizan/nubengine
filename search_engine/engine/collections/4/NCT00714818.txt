      defined above). Each participant will be randomized into one of 3 groups of approximately
      equal size: one of which will receive genetic counseling within 1 month after enrollment
      (GC), another will receive the educational brochure within 1 month (EB), and the last will be
      assigned to waitlist (WT). After randomization (but prior to intervention for GC and EB
      groups, and within 1 month after enrollment for the WT group) we will gather baseline
      information regarding the 4 outcome measures (perceived risk and control, stigma, and
      knowledge). We will re-assess the 4 outcome measures immediately post-intervention for GC and
      EB groups. A further follow-up (for all groups) will be conducted two months after enrollment
      (which is 1 month post intervention for GC and EB groups).
