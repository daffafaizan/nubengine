      impression that the limb is still present. In many cases, the sensation is painful for
      reasons that are currently not well understood. A small subset of amputees (<10%) never
      experience phantom limb pain (PLP), the painful sensation felt in the amputated limb. This
      difference suggests that there may be a genetic component that precludes some patients from
      ever experiencing PLP. Understanding the genetic components of PLP may help in predicting
      which patients will experience PLP and which amputees will respond to the various treatment
      options available.

      In order to understand the genetic aspects and ultimately develop more effective treatment
      options in the future, patients with and without PLP will be asked to give 30 mls of blood
      after overnight fasting. These blood samples will be de-identified and sent to the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where all of the genetic analyses will take
      place.
