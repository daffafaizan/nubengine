      commencement of treatment from culture results collected at the Screening visit were
      evaluated for primary efficacy whereas all treated toenails were evaluated for safety. At
      each visit, the investigator was asked to make a clinical evaluation of the targeted great
      nail, marking whether or not they considered the nail to be clear of onychomycosis. This
      evaluation was the basis for determining whether or not study medication should be dispensed
      at the visit.
