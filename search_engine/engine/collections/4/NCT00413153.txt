      patients before and after switching from a regimen containing Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to
      one containing atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r). Secondary outcome measures of interest will
      include insulin sensitivity determined by clamp testing, and lipid metabolism and hepatic
      glucose production assessed using stable isotope techniques. We hypothesize that switching
      protease inhibitor (PI) to ATV/r from LPV/r will result in direct increases in glucose uptake
      in muscle and visceral adipose tissue in association with improvements in overall whole body
      insulin sensitivity compared to remaining on LPV/r. We will complete a prospective randomized
      trial of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients who have been on a stable
      antiretroviral (ARV) regimen containing LPV/r for at least 6 months and who will be
      randomized to either switch to a regimen containing ATV/r or remain on LPV/r for 6 months.
      Each subject will complete Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
      imaging during a hyperinsulinemic clamp study at baseline and 6 months after randomization.
