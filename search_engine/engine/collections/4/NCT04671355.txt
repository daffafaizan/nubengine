    
      An open label, multicentre, randomised, 2-way cross-over exploratory clinical trial comparing
      a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate plus formoterol fumarate plus
      glycopyrronium administered via pMDI (TRIMBOW®) and a fixed combination of fluticasone
      furoate plus vilanterol administered via DPI (RELVAR® ELLIPTA®) on lung stiffness reduction
      assessed through area under the reactance curve (AX) using forced oscillation technique (FOT)
      in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
