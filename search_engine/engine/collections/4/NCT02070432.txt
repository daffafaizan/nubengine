      head and neck cancer. PDT with LUZ11 involves the intravenous administration of LUZ11
      followed by irradiation of the target tumor with laser light of an appropriate wavelength.
      The light causes the drug to react with oxygen, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      locally and induces tumor cells death and damages the blood vessels of the tumor thus
      preventing it from receiving nutrients.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability of LUZ11 following single
      ascending doses of LUZ11. The secondary objectives of this study are to explore the LUZ11
      dose that has anti-tumor effect following photoactivation and to determine LUZ11
      pharmacokinetics.
