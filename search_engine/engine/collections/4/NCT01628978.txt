      young children. It is usually determined by an equation according to the patient's age (12 +
      age/2, cm) or auscultation method. The auscultation method is to intentionally place the tip
      of the endotracheal tube into the right main stem bronchus and then withdraw it until breath
      sounds are equal. The tube is fixed 1 or 2 cm proximal to the point where breath sounds
      become equal. However, in small children or infant, as the breadth sound in unilateral lung
      transmits the contralateral lung field and is often difficult to listen in a noisy operation
      room, it is often difficult to determine the depth by auscultation method. Pleural sliding
      sign, or sliding lung sign is a ultrasonographic finding that the visceral pleura moves
      against the parietal pleura. It is used to identify whether the lung is ventilated by
      ultrasound. The investigators are trying to use this pleural sliding sign to determine the
      depth of endotracheal tube, and compare this method with auscultation method.
