      of selected nutrient biomarker(s) of food intake determined using a single plasma sample
      either alone or in combination are stronger, objective predictors of subsequent death from
      CHD or MI compared to selected food intake data derived from subjective, self-reported food
      frequency questionnaires. The nutrient biomarkers (phospholipid [PL] eicosapentaenoic acid
      [EPA], PL docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], PL trans fatty acids, phylloquinone,
      dihydrophylloquinone) and foods (fish, dark fish and tuna, vegetables, fruits, and whole
      grains, and unsaturated fat rich foods) targeted have previously been either directly or
      indirectly associated with CVD risk. We propose to test our overall objective by conducting a
      nested case-control study using plasma samples and food frequency data from the observational
      cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Our cases (n=1200) will be selected from the
      subset of women who did not report dietary supplement use and who died of CHD or MI
      (collectively referred to as WHI CHD cases). The control subjects (n=1200) will be selected
      from the subset that were free of CHD or MI events and matched with cases for standard
      National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) risk factors (WHI controls). Nutrient biomarker
      data will be newly generated using stored specimens whereas the selected food intake data
      have previously been collected by the WHI investigators.
