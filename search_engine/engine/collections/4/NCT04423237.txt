    
      The present retrospective study will be conducted at the Bone Marrow Transplant Center, IRCCS
      Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy. All pediatric patients who underwent one or more allogeneic
      HSCTs between 2010 and 2018 will be enrolled according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      The following data will be collected in a retrospective manner:

        -  Data on the underlying disease (diagnosis, therapeutic protocol, transfusion regimen,
           possible relapses, type of transplant, conditioning regimen, infectious complications,
           immunosuppressive treatment, including use of steroids);

        -  Pre-transplant liver and pancreatic function, as well as quantification of iron content
           by nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI);

        -  Pre-transplant histological evaluation of liver parenchyma in case of pre-existing liver
           disease;

        -  Post-transplant liver and pancreatic function and the evaluation of parenchymal
           accumulation of Fe+;

        -  Length and doses of DFX treatment, and corresponding drug plasma concentrations as per
           routine drug monitoring protocols;

        -  Treatment tolerability according to CTC-AE grading V5.0, November 27, 2017 The
           post-transplant data will be collected within 2 years from HSCT (or the last HSCT when
           more than one).

      The data entered in an appropriate anonymous database will be processed by descriptive
      statistics and uni- multivariate statistical analyses according to study endpoints. DFX
      plasma concentrations will be analyzed by means of to a nonlinear mixed effect modeling
      approach to elaborate a population pharmacokinetic (POP/PK) model. POP/PK findings will be
      further analyzed together with clinical and laboratory data.
