      middle-aged adults who are overweight and have high blood total cholesterol and LDL-C
      concentrations will be recruited. Participants will consume a HEP - all foods provided -
      during 5-week controlled feeding periods. The three HEP interventions will be: high RM, low
      NSS; moderate RM, moderate NSS; and low RM, high NSS. Each participant will complete two of
      the three controlled feeding periods, separated by four weeks when participants will consume
      their usual unrestricted diet (washout). The HEP consumed during the controlled feeding
      periods will be the same except for the amounts of RM (1, 5, or 9, 3-oz servings/wk) and NSS
      (high, moderate, and low, with amounts adjusted to isocalorically offset changes in RM energy
      intakes). Poultry, egg, and legume intakes will be the same among the three HEP. The
      investigators will measure clinically important cardiovascular disease risk factors before
      (usual unrestricted diet) and during the last week of each HEP intervention. The
      cardiovascular disease risk factors will include, but are not limited to, comprehensive lipid
      and lipoprotein profile (changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C; primary
      outcome), lipoprotein fractionation and particle numbers, and blood pressure. The
      investigators will compare improvements in heart disease risk factors and consumer
      satisfaction among the three HEP.
