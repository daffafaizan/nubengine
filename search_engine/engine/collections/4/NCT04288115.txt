    
      This is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Semi-structured
      interviews, from randomized participants and LT4 prescribers, will be completed at the end of
      the trial.

      Methodology The investigators will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      where eligible veterans diagnosed with SCH and on LT4 will be 1:1 randomized to either
      continue LT4 or change to placebo. The primary outcome is intervention feasibility
      (willingness to enter the trial, recruitment rate, and completion rate). Secondary outcomes
      are: 1) changes in QoL measures (Hypothyroid Symptom and Tiredness scale scores of the
      ThyPRO, EuroQoL 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire) measured at baseline, 6-8 weeks and 6
      months and 2) changes in lipids assessed at baseline and 6 months, and 3) incidence of
      adverse events (overt hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, fractures, acute
      myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, mortality).

      The investigators will assess the acceptability of LT4 discontinuation through
      semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants and LT4 prescribers at the
      completion of the clinical trial.
