      nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), parallel group (each group of
      patients will be treated at the same time), multicenter non-inferiority (the effect of the
      new treatment is not worse than that of the comparison treatment) study. A new formulation of
      paliperidone palmitate with a 3-month injection interval (PP3M) is being tested for use as
      maintenance treatment for subjects with schizophrenia who have been first stabilized on
      paliperidone palmitate with a 1-month injection interval (PP1M). The study consists of 3
      phases: a screening/washout/tolerability phase (up to 21 days); a 17-week open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) stabilization phase (referred to as the
      Open-label Phase) and a 48-week fixed dose, randomized, double-blind controlled phase
      (referred to as the Double-blind Phase). After completion of the Screening Phase, all
      patients will receive PP1M in the Open-label Phase. During this time, flexible dosing will
      occur at Weeks 5 and 9. At Week 13 patients are to receive the dose of PP1M that was
      administered at Week 9. Patients who are clinically stable at the end of the Open-label Phase
      will enter the Double-blind Phase and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      fixed doses of PP3M or PP1M.
