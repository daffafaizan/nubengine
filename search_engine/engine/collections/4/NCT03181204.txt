        -  Confrontation of the two models of in vitro generation of bronchial epithelium by iPS
           and ALI in order to validate our model of study of the human bronchial epithelium COPD
           generated by the iPS.

        -  Inducing a "COPD-like" epithelial phenotype by exposing the bronchial epithelia
           generated from the iPS to a source of in vitro toxin (tobacco) and studying its effects
           by transcriptomic analysis via high-throughput sequencing (NGS) at key steps during the
           model.

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining iPS from peripheral blood sampling.
