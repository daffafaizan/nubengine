      prostate volume downsizing, disease control and ease of Brachytherapy, in this patient
      population. The improved potency preservation rate seen with brachytherapy, when compared to
      other treatments such as radical prostatectomy or external beam, may be an important
      determinant in the patient's choice of treatment modality. Hence, testosterone recovery
      should be an important endpoint to consider in this patient population since prolongation of
      testosterone suppression may also delay the return of erectile function.

      In order to compare the impact of LHRH agonist preparations on the rate of testosterone
      recovery, we propose a randomized clinical trial using one versus three-month Leuprolide
      preparations in patients otherwise suitable for our Brachytherapy Program.

      The primary objective of this study is the median time to testosterone recovery in patients
      receiving 6 X 1-month or 2 X 3-month LHrH preparations and TPIP as radical treatment for
      limited stage prostate cancer.

      In this context, testosterone recovery is defined as the return to the lower limit of normal
      for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels.

      Analysis will mainly focus on time to testosterone recovery as defined by return to the lower
      limit of normal for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels. The
      lower limits of normal are defined as 5.8nmol/L and 5.5nmol/L for < 50 and > 50 years old

      Changes in PSA level, QOL and erectile function will also be recorded
