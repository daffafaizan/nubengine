      arms.

      ARM A: Patients with HLA-matched related or unrelated donors receive ²¹¹At-OKT10-B10
      intravenously (IV) on day -7 (day -10 to -5) and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to
      -2. Patients then undergo TBI and allogeneic HCT on day 0.

      ARM B: Patients with HLA-matched haploidentical donors receive ²¹¹At-OKT10-B10 IV on day -8
      (day -14 to -7), fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2, and cyclophosphamide IV
      over 1 hour on day -6 and -5. Patients then undergo TBI on day -1 and allogeneic HCT on day
      0.
