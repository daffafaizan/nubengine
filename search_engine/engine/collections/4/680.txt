the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and thezona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex inthe sodium losing and the hypertensiveforms of virilizing adrenalhyperplasiapathological and biochemical observationsare presented in two cases of virilizing ad-renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losingtype and the other of the hypertensive type.examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in thecase exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  theadrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of thezona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized thatthe chronic state of sodium loss causedchanges in the intravascular compartmentwhich led to compensatory activity of thejuxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-tion of the zona glomerulosa.examination of the hypertensive case(known to involve a different enzyme defi-cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-tion of sodium-retaining steroids associatedwith the genetic defect in this clinical formcould account for both the hypertensionand the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular apparatus.
