      insomnia (PI), which is a double-blind (patient-blind and assessor-blind) RCT. 288 patients
      will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: the treatment group (Group A) and the control group
      (Group B). Group A will be treated with AA plus oral Eszopiclone, while Group B will be
      treated with sham AA plus oral Eszopiclone. All patients will receive a continuous 4-week
      treatment and 28-week follow-up. The data will be analyzed by the third party who is not
      clear about allocation and treatment.
