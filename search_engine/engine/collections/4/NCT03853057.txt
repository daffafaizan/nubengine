      pressure support and control pressure ventilation using a tight nasal mask. Volumetric
      capnography and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) will be continuously recorded during
      the protocol. Different body positions were randomly tested. Analysis of global and regional
      distribution of ventilation using EIT will be matched with changes observed in volumetric
      capnography-derived parameters.
