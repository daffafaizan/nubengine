      I. To determine the overall response rate with erlotinib in patients with locoregionally
      recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (CSCC) that is not amenable to
      curative treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine duration of response and duration of stable disease. II. To determine
      progression-free and overall survival. III. To determine safety and tolerability of
      erlotinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate baseline expression of estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR),
      expression of markers of EGFR activation (such as phosphorylated [p] EGFR and pAKT) and
      related cell-signaling pathways, and EGFR mutation status with response to erlotinib therapy.

      II. To determine the effects of erlotinib on relevant biomarkers of the EGFR pathway in tumor
      tissue and in normal skin, and to correlate with response to therapy.

      III. To determine if there is a correlation between the development of erlotinib-induced skin
      rash and response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive erlotinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
