    
      This is a prospective, single-center, open label, single-arm pilot study of the eShunt
      System. The study population consists of patients with post-aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH) treated for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resulting in symptomatic
      hydrocephalus using an external ventricular drain (EVD) to facilitate CSF drainage and who
      cannot be "weaned" from the EVD seven or more days following the hemorrhagic event.

      The study will be performed a single site with up to 30 subjects who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria for the study. Subjects will be evaluated every 30 days for the first 90
      days following eShunt Implant deployment with standard neurological evaluation appropriate
      for patients with communicating hydrocephalus. In addition, follow-up will occur at 180 days,
      12 and 24 months post-operatively and will include imaging in addition to the standard
      neurological evaluation.
