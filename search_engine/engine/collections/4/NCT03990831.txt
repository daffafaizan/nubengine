      rehabilitation of burn victims with neurological locomotor deficits. However, the effects of
      peripheral neurological injury on locomotor network remains unknown. A wearable functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device has been developed for studying cortical
      hemodynamics. Changes in cortical activity has not previously been documented in patients
      with burn injury.

      Investigators assessed 15 patients with lower extremity burns and 11 healthy controls.

      Investigators measured walking-related cortical activity using an fNIRS device at baseline
      and during usual walking.

      Cortical activity was measured by evaluating relative changes in oxyhemoglobin level. The
      NIRST Analysis Tool v2.1 was utilized to analyze fNIRS data in a MATLAB environment.
