      bladder and urgency urinary incontinence refractory to anticholinergic or Î²-agonist treatment
      was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013. Since then,
      multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
      treatment. Currently, Allergan, Inc. and the FDA recommend the intravesical administration of
      onabotulinumtoxin A with dilution to 100 units/10 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium
      Chloride Injection, as 20 injections of 0.5 mL each. Currently, in clinical practice there
      has been no standardization in the number of intravesical injections, with a single dose of
      onabotulinumtoxin A being administered in as few as 1 injection to as many as 40 injections
      into the detrusor muscle. Given the increasing use of this treatment modality, the
      investigators aim to compare patient outcomes for patients given a 100 unit dose of
      onabotulinumtoxin A split into 5 as compared to the recommended 20 injections for the
      treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence refractory to
      medical treatment.
