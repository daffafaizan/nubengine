      ultrasonography. Both methods can measure passive and active soft tissue properties. These
      methods are the gold standard to measure stiffness and elasticity, but they are expensive,
      operator dependent and need a laboratory settings.Recently, myotonometric device has been
      used to measure the mechanical properties of the muscles and tendons. This method serves many
      advantages, such as non-invasive, painless and cost-effective. There is an increasing
      literature on athletic training about how training effects viscoelastic properties. However,
      to the best of our knowledge, there were no studies assessing stiffness and elasticity of AT,
      PF and ITB and the relation with ankle mobility in different sport disciplines. The purpose
      of this study were to demonstrate the mechanical properties of AT, PF and ITB and find out
      relation with restricted ankle mobility in athletes.
