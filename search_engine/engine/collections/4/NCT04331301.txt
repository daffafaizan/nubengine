    
      Aim: compare safety and efficacy and adverse events of endoscopic enucleation of large
      prostate using hot knife electrode (needloscopic enucleation) versus the standard
      vaporization electrode ( vapoenucleation) patients & methods: Patients will randomly be
      divided into two equal groups: Group A: Patient will be subjected to bipolar endoscopic
      enucleation of the prostate by vaporization electrode (vapoenucleation).

      Group B: Patient will be subjected to endoscopic enucleation of the prostate by bipolar hot
      kife electrode (needloscopic enucleation) Inclusion criteria: patients with Qmax of less than
      15 mL/second due to BPH, severe LUTS/BPH requiring surgical treatment, and International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)>7 due to BPH.

      exclusion criteria: prostate and/or bladder cancer, bladder diverticula, urethral stricture,
      active urinary tract infection (UTI), unless treated, and men with neurogenic voiding
      dysfunction.

      Operative Technique: Endoscopic enucleation of the prostate in saline utilizing either
      bipolar vaporization electrode or bipolar hot knife (collin's) electrode.

      follow up: operative time, resected tissue weight, cath time, hospital stay and change of;
      IPSS,QOL, Qmax, PVR, PSA, IIEF-5 & MSHQ-EjD besides; perioperative adverse events are
      recorded & followed-up.
