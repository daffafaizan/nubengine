    
      The Clearblue Advanced Ovulation Test is designed for home use by women who are trying to get
      pregnant now or in the near future. It identifies those days in a woman's cycle on which
      intercourse is most likely to lead to conception.

      The product defines three phases of fertility through urine hormone measurement: Low (small
      chance of conceiving), High (increased chance of conceiving) which is achieved by the
      detection of a rise in the level of estrone-3-glucuronide and Peak (highest chance of
      conceiving) which provides an early warning of impending ovulation through detection of the
      luteinising hormone surge which precedes it by 24 - 36 hours.

      This protocol aims to demonstrate the successful usage of the Clearblue Advanced Ovulation
      Test product by lay-users in the intended environment.

      Elements of system usability, product satisfaction and ease of use will be used to assess
      overall product performance in lay-user hands.

      Lay users will be required to user the product according to the instructions for use for a
      mimimum of 1 complete menstrual cycle after which they will be required to provide feedback
      on product use.

      A usability scale which focusses on providing subjective feedback from users. This is a
      simple ten-item attitude Likert scale which each volunteer will complete after 4 weeks of
      product use. The primary endpoints of this study will focus on the use of this scoring scale
      to determine the usability of the product in lay-user hands.
