      short course zidovudine (ZDV) is in widespread use to prevent mother-to-child HIV
      transmission throughout the developing world. Though the public health benefits cannot be
      overstated, widespread use of NVP in this fashion may come at a cost. Non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations are induced in at least 20% and probably
      a larger proportion of women exposed to NVP in this fashion. Addition of short-course ZDV
      does not appear to mitigate this effect substantially. The full implications of these NVP
      resistance mutations are yet unknown, though there is concern that they may result in reduced
      efficacy of the NVP or other NNRTIs in long-term, therapeutic regimens.

      We are conducting a clinical trial of tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), marketed as a
      fixed dose combination, Truvada â„¢, to reduce NNRTI-resistance post-delivery in the setting of
      NVP with or without ZDV for PMTCT. TDF and FTC are both Category B drugs and are approved for
      use in pregnancy. They have several characteristics that make them ideal candidate drugs for
      use in conjunction with NVP, including long intracellular half-lives and established safety
      profile among adults for HIV treatment.

      Women will be enrolled between 28 and 38 weeks of gestation. As part of normal PMTCT
      services, they may choose NVP-boosted ZDV or single dose NVP for PMTCT; We anticipate that
      most (~80%) will choose the former. At arrival for delivery, they will be randomized to
      receive either the two study drugs (intervention) or no drug (control). A total of 400 women
      will be randomized, and followed, along with their infants, for 6 months.
