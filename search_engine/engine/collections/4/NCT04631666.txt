      dose-escalation phase (Groups 1A-1D and Group 2C). Subsequently, the highest tested and
      tolerated dose will be administered to an expansion cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals
      (Group 2D). In this randomized and blinded group, participants will receive DZIF-10c or
      placebo by intravenous infusion.
