      hypoglycemia, the counter-regulatory pathways to restore normal glucose are blunted, and
      patients can become unaware of the hypoglycemia. It is estimated that 40% of patients with
      T1D have hypoglycemia unawareness.

      The study has the following objectives:

        1. Primary:

           a. To assess non-inferiority of dangerous hypoglycemia with administration of intranasal
           insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia.

        2. Secondary:

             1. To describe changes in overall glycemic control with administration of intranasal
                insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia

             2. To describe changes in hypoglycemia awareness with administration of intranasal
                insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia

             3. To describe changes in safety endpoints with administration of intranasal insulin
                in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia.

        3. Exploratory:

             1. To describe changes in memory, attention and executive function with administration
                of intranasal insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia
