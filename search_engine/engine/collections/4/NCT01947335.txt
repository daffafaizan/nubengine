      coronary interventions. Despite various efforts, very few preventive measures have been shown
      effective in reducing its incidence. The final volume of contrast media utilized during the
      procedure is a well-known independent factor affecting the occurrence of CI-AKI.

      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been largely used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool during
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). When fully explored, IVUS provides precise
      information for guiding the PCI strategy. IVUS allows accurate vessel and lesion sizing,
      determination of plaque calcification (and the need for pre-stent plaque preparation),
      assessment of post-stent results (including edge dissections and residual lesion, as well as
      stent underexpansion or incomplete apposition). Therefore, IVUS has the potential to reduce
      the utilization of contrast media during PCI.

      In the present study, we hypothesize that IVUS guidance is associated with a significant
      reduction in the volume of contrast media during PCI, in comparison to standard
      angiography-guided intervention.
