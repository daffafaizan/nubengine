    
      To develop a cohort of patients treated with GLP-1 R Agonists who are phenotyped at baseline
      and at 6 month follow up to determine clinical, imaging and other biomarker predictors of
      glycaemic response to GLP-1R Agonists. The hypothesis is that one, or a combination, of these
      biomarkers is associated with glycaemic response to GLP-1R Agonists. The primary outcome is
      therefore HbA1c reduction after 6 months of GLP-1R A treatment.

      This is a cohort study of 800 patients being treated with either exenatide or liraglutide for
      6 months, and carried out in 4 UK centres.
