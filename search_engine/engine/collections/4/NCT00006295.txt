      Low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been found to be associated
      with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the genetic basis for this
      association is not well understood and the clinical implications of this association have not
      been extensively addressed. The study, in seeking to elucidate the genetic basis for low
      HDL-C and examine the clinical implications of low HDL-C, focuses upon an important research
      topic.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Specific aims of the study include: 1) Collection and characterization of plasma and DNA from
      probands with very low HDL-C. Linkage analysis will be performed using highly polymorphic
      markers within or near HDL-C candidate genes. The hypothesis to be tested is that polymorphic
      microsatellites segregate with the low HDL-C phenotype.

      2) Further genetic characterization of families evidence of linkage to specific HDL-C
      candidate genes identified in Specific Aim 1. The hypothesis to be tested is that structural
      variants in HDL-C candidates are responsible for low HDL-C.

      3) Evaluate the physiologic significance of novel genomic variants identified in Specific Aim
      2. The hypothesis to be tested is that structural variants will affect expression of the gene
      product.

      4) Examine early atherosclerosis in low HDL-C syndromes. The hypothesis to be tested is that
      increased carotid intima-medial thickness is prevalent with isolated low HDL-C.
