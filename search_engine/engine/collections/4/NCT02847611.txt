    
      Measure of the strength of prehension with JAMAR and LABIN according to the following
      protocol:

        -  Position: the subject sits comfortably on a chair without armrests, feet put on the
           ground, the pond at the bottom of the seat, the hips and the knees in 90 째 of flexion,
           shoulder in adduction and neutral rotation, the elbow bent in 90 째, forearm in neutral
           position, the wrist between 0 and 30 째 of extension and between 0 and 15 째 of slope
           ulnaire. The dynamometer is vertically presented and in front of the forearm to maintain
           the standardized positions.

        -  Test: regulation of the zero by making a vacuous acquisition during 5 seconds. The order
           "Jamar then Labin" or Labin then Jamar is chosen by randomization. The operator
           encourages the subject to every test. The subject does not see the curve displaying.

        -  Test: 3 clampings of a handle of a dynamometer LABIN by the right hand during 5 seconds,
           with a break of 30 seconds between the tests. After 2 minutes of break the subjects make
           3 clampings with a left hand. After that , the same session is realized with the
           dynamometer JAMAR

      The order "Jamar then Labin" or Labin then Jamar is chosen by randomization. The operator
      encourages the subject to every test. The subject does not see the curve displaying.

      Total duration of participation in the study for the patient: 30 minutes

      Main analysis: the calculation of the coefficient of correlation (Pearson or Spearman with
      regard to the statistical distribution), coefficient of linen concordance and the coefficient
      of intra-classy correlation.
