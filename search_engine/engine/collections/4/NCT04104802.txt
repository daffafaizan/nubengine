           gadolinium injection performed at the A. de Rothschild Foundation. Evaluation by two
           radiologists of the exact position of the parotid tumor with respect to the trunk of the
           facial nerve and its first branches, classified into two categories: contact (â‰¤ 5 mm) or
           distance (> 5 mm).

        2. nd visit: Surgical intervention of the parotid tumor. The surgeon will specify the same
