      memory. Further, the hippocampus would be responsible for recollection, or the rich and
      contextualised retrieval of a memory; whereas the perirhinal cortex (PRC) would process
      familiarity, or the feeling that a stimulus has been encountered before, without remembering
      where or when it happened. However, there is growing evidence questioning this view, and
      supporting an alternative proposal. The representational view of the MTL proposes that such
      regions would not be organised according to cognitive processes, but rather according to the
      representations (or the mnemonic content, represented by a pattern of neuronal spikes. A
      2018-fMRI study demonstrated that the engagement of the hippocampus in recollection depends
      on the presence of a spatial scene in the memory that is retrieved, and not on the
      reconstructive nature of the retrieval. However, this demonstration is incomplete, as the
      only process that was investigated is recollection. The current project aims to extend such
      results to memory processes such as familiarity, and even to non-mnemonic processes such as
      visual discrimination. A fMRI study will thus be conducted, where 30 healthy participants
      will first perform a visual-discrimination task on scenes and objects, before taking a
      recognition task, in which images will either be presented in full or in the form of circular
      cues only. Multivariate-Pattern Analyses (MVPA) will complete traditional fMRI analyses, in
      order to determine whether activity in the MTL can be categorised on the basis of
      representations through a machine-learning classifier.
