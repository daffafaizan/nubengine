      POCD is not clear yet and no effective therapy method. In the present study, we conducted a
      single-center observational prospective cohort trial in elder patients who undergoing hip
      joint replacement surgery with general anesthesia to test our hypothesis that preoperative
      chronic pain is one of the risk factors of POCD after major joint replacement surgery.
