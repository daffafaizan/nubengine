      type 2 diabetes on psychological, health behavior, and clinical outcomes. Eligibility
      criteria included age 21 to 65 years, overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] >27 kg/m2),
      and no prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. At baseline, participants (N=601) had conventional
      risk factors assessed, including demographics, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and family
      history. They also provided blood samples for genetic testing of TCF7L2, PPARG, and KCNJ11,
      three genes that confer elevated risk for development of type 2 diabetes. Participants were
      then randomized to receive conventional counseling plus control eye disease counseling
      (CR+EYE) or conventional counseling plus genetic test results (CR+G). Two to four weeks
      following the baseline visit, when the genetic test results were available, participants
      returned for a visit with a genetic counselor. All participants received conventional risk
      counseling based on their lifetime population risk, FPG results, and family history. Next,
      participants were informed of their randomization assignments; CR+EYE participants received
      counseling on eye diseases, whereas CR+G participants received genetic counseling. Then
      perceived risk, affect, self-efficacy, and readiness to change were assessed. All other
      outcomes were also assessed at 3 and 6 months.
