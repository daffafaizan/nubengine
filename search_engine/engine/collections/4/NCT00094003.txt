      once daily, 1-hour I.V. infusions of the drug for 5 days followed by a 23-day rest period.
      During the rest period, subjects are seen at the clinic once weekly for evaluation. Subjects
      having favorable or stable results after 2 cycles may continue to receive NS-9 in the
      extension phase of the study until the disease progresses or until they get a side effect
      that prevents them from continuing with therapy.

      After each two cycles, if appropriate, the liver tumor will be measured by radiologic imaging
      to compare it to its pre-treatment size.
