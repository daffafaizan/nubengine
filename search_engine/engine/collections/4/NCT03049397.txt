    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the feasibility of the study protocol in advanced cancer patients and co-parents
      (recruitment/retention, dosage and fidelity of the intervention; program acceptability of
      program; and logistics).

      II. Evaluate the short-term impact of the program on the diagnosed parents', co-parents' and
      children's adjustment and family functioning using a within group design (pre- and posttest
      design).

      III. Compare outcomes from the Enhancing Connections Palliative Program with similar outcomes
      obtained from the completed phase III trial (between group design) for the patients and
      children outcomes.

      IV. Evaluate the longer term impact of the program on the co-parents' and children's
      adjustment, including bereavement outcomes when appropriate, using a within and across group
      design (pre- and posttest design).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and co-parents participate in the Enhancing Connections program consisting of 5
      sessions over 1 hour each in the clinic or over the telephone. Session topics include
      managing cancer-related emotions when talking to children, developing deep listening skills,
      initiating difficult cancer-related conversations with children, interpreting a child's
      behavior, recognizing newly acquired gains from the program, and identifying available
      resources that can be used after program completion.

      After completion of the study, participants are followed-up at 6 months.
