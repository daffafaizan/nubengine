      inflammation and severe muscle atrophy especially in the muscles in the thigh and the finger
      flexors. In time the muscle weakness will cause the affected person to become unable to walk
      and carry out basic tasks in the every day life.

      Currently no effective treatment exist for sIBM patients, however several studies indicate
      that exercise may be beneficial for the patients.

      In the resent years a lot of research attention has been directed toward low-intensity
      training with partial vascular occlusion as an alternative to the conventional high intensity
      strength training. Interestingly the low-intensity blood-flow occluded training is found to
      be at least as beneficial in causing muscle growth as the conventional strength training but
      with very little mechanical load on joints and tendons. Furthermore the blood-flow occluded
      training seem to result in a hyper-activation of muscle stem cells which play an important
      role in muscle regeneration.

      This make the blood-flow restricted training modality a very interesting treatment
      possibility for sIBM patients because it might be able to restore and/or maintain the
      skeletal muscle tissue and therefore also muscle function.
