      and we intend to understand the complex relationship between vitamin D, the growth factors
      and maternal and infant anthropometric variables and hope to unravel the reasons of vitamin D
      deficiency in our population.

      The investigators expect that if vitamin D is supplemented to pregnant women and their
      newborn infants it will inevitably replenish the micronutrient stores and aid to resolve the
      maternal and neonatal morbidity due to Vitamin D deficiency.
