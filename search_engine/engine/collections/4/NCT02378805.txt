      of opportunity" for early intervention. Currently there are no causal therapeutic options
      which are proven to delay renal failure in AS. ACE-inhibition (ACEi) has been shown to reduce
      proteinuria in Alport patients and to delay renal failure in Alport-mice suggesting it may be
      of value as an effective treatment to delay renal failure in humans. To test this we
      established the European Alport Registry to collect data over several generations of Alport
      families across Europe. Small children with AS first develop microscopic hematuria,
      proceeding to microalbuminuria, overt proteinuria, impaired renal function and end up with
      end stage renal disease. These different steps of disease enabled us to assess if earlier
      introduction of ACE-inhibition at earlier degrees of disease is more effective than later
      therapy in delaying the time to dialysis and improving life-expectancy.

      Heterozygous COL4A3/COL4A4 mutations result in the phenotype "familial benign hematuria" or
      "thin basement membrane nephropathy" (TBMN). Affected subjects typically present with
      hematuria. Having longtime been regarded as "benign" familial hematuria, those patients might
      have an increased risk to develop severe renal impairment - comparable to the findings in
      female XLAS carriers (see above). TBMN is not a rare disease, as at least 1% of the
      population is affected.

      For the first time, the present study compares the risk of renal impairment, end stage renal
      disease and premature death in between heterozygous carriers of XLAS and of ARAS mutations.
      Additionally, the nephroprotective effect of RAAS-blockade in patients with heterozygous
      Alport-mutations is evaluated.
