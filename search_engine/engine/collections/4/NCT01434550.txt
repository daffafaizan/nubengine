      radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. These standard treatments are not a cure and often
      extend life by just a few months. Recently, a new approach has been developed, called
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Based on the results of earlier studies using
      SBRT, the study doctors at Moffitt feel this is a reasonable alternative to the standard
      treatment for your disease.

      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers high radiation doses to the tumor every
      day for 5 days which gives the usual 5-6 week course of radiation in less than a week. It has
      also been shown to have much less side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to see if SBRT will be a better way to treat pancreas cancer and
      to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this treatment will have on you and your cancer.

      Six patients will be asked to be part of a subgroup called TBRI (Tissue, Blood, Research
      Imaging). In this subgroup, the investigators want to study if there is early death of tumor
      cells from the treatment by looking at the tumor using PET/CT scans and biopsies, and by
      testing your body's white blood cells taken by a procedure called leukapheresis. You do not
      have to take part in the TBRI subgroup to get treatment on this study with SBRT.
