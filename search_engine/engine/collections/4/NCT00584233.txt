      standard care (BIRADS 4 and 5) will be recruited to undergo additional imaging prior to
      biopsy, including (research) pre-and post-contrast enhanced breast CT imaging of both
      breasts, as well as (standard, FDA approved) contrast enhanced breast MRI. The potential of
      non-contrast enhanced breast CT will be compared using receiver operating characteristic
      (ROC) methodology against mammography alone, as well as with mammography + tomosynthesis. The
      breast CT images (including both pre-and post-contrast images) will be compared using ROC
      methodology against standard-of-care contrast-enhanced MRI (which includes both non-contrast
      and contrast images). The results of the clinical trials proposed in this investigation
      should provide strong evidence in regards to the potential of breast CT for breast cancer
      screening in the normal risk and high risk populations.
