      nutritious foods, increase the diversity of foods in the home, and ultimately improve diet
      quality and well-being among children.

      Target Population: 40 school districts (115 schools) in 12 counties within the Chickasaw
      Nation territory in Oklahoma. Within these districts, households with school-age children
      (both Native American and non-Native American) who were eligible for free school meals or
      attended a school that participated in the community eligibility provision were eligible to
      participate in the project.

      Intervention School districts were matched, and then one was randomly assigned to either a
      treatment (n=20) or control group (n=20). Treatment households received one food box per
      eligible child, per month, delivered to the household, which contained (1) shelf-stable
      foods, including 6 protein-rich items, 2 dairy items, 4 grain foods, 4 cans of fruit, and 12
      cans of vegetables; (2) a nutrition education handout (e.g., a recipe); and (3) a $15 Fresh
      Check for frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables that participants could redeem at any of 38
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)-authorized
      stores or farmers' markets in the study counties. Control households did not receive the
      treatment benefits but still could participate in other available nutrition assistance
      programs.
