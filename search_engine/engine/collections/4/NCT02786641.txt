      Gy or higher in 33 fractions to the primary tumor. Nomogram-predicted low risk patients
      (Group A) receive concurrent chemotherapy, while nomogram-predicted high risk patients are
      randomized to receive concurrent chemotherapy (Group B) or induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemotherapy (Group C). Induction chemotherapy consists of docetaxel 65 mg/m², D1,
      cisplatin 75 mg/m², D1 and Xeloda 2000mg/m², D1-14 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Concurrent
      chemotherapy consists of cisplatin 100 mg/m², D1 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.The primary
      endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS),
      locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and the
      incidence of grade 3 or higher acute toxicities. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the
      intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive
      their randomly assigned treatment.
