      inoperable histologically proven inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.
      Eligible patients must be therapy na√Øve and have received no previous chemotherapy or immune
      therapy for their inoperable gastric cancer. Neo/Adjuvant Chemotherapy or adjuvant
      Chemo/Radiotherapy are allowed. A total of 40 evaluable patients will be recruited and
      evaluated for efficacy and safety of a sequential chemoimmunotherapy combination regime.

      Overall Study Design:

      Eligible patients will receive Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab for 3 cycles followed
      by Docetaxel and Bevacizumab for a further 3 cycles. Upon completion of the combination
      therapy cycles Bevacizumab will be continued until progression. Safety assessments will be
      conducted in 4-weekly intervals; efficacy assessments will be conducted at 12 weekly
      intervals, at completion of every third treatment cycle.

      This study is expected to start in Q1 2009. The last patient is expected to enter the study
      in Q2 2010, following an 18 month recruitment period. Taking into account treatment duration
      the study is expected to end in Q4 2010. Study end will be at Last Subject Last Visit at
      Final Staging upon disease progression. Follow-up after Last Subject Last Visit will be
      conducted according to local standard of care thereafter, and is not part of study
      procedures.
