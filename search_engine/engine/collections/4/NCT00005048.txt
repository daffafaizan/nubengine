      patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this
      combination at the MTD of paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Determine any objective
      tumor response arising from this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive oral estramustine
      daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly for 6 weeks followed by 1
      week of rest. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
