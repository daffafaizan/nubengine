      transduced T cells that can safely be given. Three cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with
      increasing doses of TIL 1383I TCR transduced T cells. Patients will be monitored clinically
      and immunologically for a year after infusion. Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 7.5 X
      10^6/kg TIL 1383I TCR transduced T cells. Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive 2.5 x 10^7/kg TIL
      1383I TCR transduced T cells. Subjects in Cohort 3 will receive 7.5 x 10^7/kg TIL 1383I TCR
      transduced T cells.
