      administration of MVA85A in BCG vaccinated adults when evaluated for safety and
      immunogenicity.

      If MVA85A can be given safely by intramuscular route and it is at least equally immunogenic
      and efficacious in a prime-boost strategy, then it would probably be the preferred route in
      subsequent phase II and III trials. There are several reasons for this:

        -  Reduced pain associated with injection.

        -  Reduced local reaction at the injection site.

        -  More straightforward procedure; less technically demanding; less time consuming.

        -  Easier production and storage of vaccine.

        -  Larger volume of vaccine can be given.

      Trials of MVA85A to date have established 1 x 10^8 pfu as the optimal dose for intradermal
      injection in adults. We therefore intend to administer this same dose intramuscularly in
      order to directly compare the two routes for both safety and immunogenicity. These results
      will guide future trials in which the intramuscular route, if safe, could be further
      evaluated at either higher or lower dose depending on immunogenicity at 1 x 10^8 pfu dosage.
