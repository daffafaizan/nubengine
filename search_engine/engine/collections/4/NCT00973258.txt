      criteria for frailty are randomized to received nutritional, physical training, cognitive
      training, combined or control arms for 24 weeks and followed up for 12 months. Baseline
      evaluations will include an extensive range of potential markers of frailty and outcome
      measures, including functional disability and hospitalizations.

      Frail subjects who were selected for the interventional trial (N=250) are followed up at 3, 6
      and 12 months after baseline assessment. Non-trial subjects (about 2750) are followed up at 1
      year after baseline assessment
