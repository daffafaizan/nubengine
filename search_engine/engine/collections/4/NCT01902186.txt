    
      The objective is to assess the improvement in Bone Mineral Density and markers of bone
      turnover in women on TDF/FTC (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/ emtricitabine)+ ATV/r
      (atazanavir/ritonavir) in a switch arm (RAL (raltegravir) + ATV/r) vs. an unchanged arm
      (TDF/FTC + ATV/r).

      The clinical hypothesis is that removing tenofovir (associated to a boosted PI, and therefore
      in the worst clinical scenario) in both pre-menopausal and menopausal women could be
      beneficial and being associated with reduced bone mineral density loss measured by DEXA
      (densitometry)scan scores and markers of bone turnover. The underlying mechanism is believed
      to be the reduction in hyper-phosphaturia induced by proximal tubular dysfunction: therefore
      measuring renal tubular markers and hormones involved in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis
      (such as vitamin D and parathormone) will explain the suspected mechanism.
