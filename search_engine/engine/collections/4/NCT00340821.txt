      National Cancer Institute have been studying the epidemiology of HTLV-I and its role in the
      etiology and pathogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ALT), and aggressive T-cell
      lymphoma. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate familial and genetic aspects of ATL
      and its relationship to two other HTLV-I related conditions, HTLV-I associated myelopathy
      also known as tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and infective dermatitis. Enrollment of
      infective dermatitis cases was recently added and the disease entity is thought to be a
      harbinger for later development of either ATL or HAM/TSP. The purpose of this study is to
      interview patients with these conditions and perform laboratory studies (specifically, HLA
      and other viral or genetic studies) to better understand these diseases and their
      relationship to the HTLV-1 virus and the family history and genetic factors that may be
      involved as well.
