    
      The present study aims to evaluate a targeted, progressively challenging, online cognitive
      training program comprised of 49 distinct exercises targeting a variety of cognitive
      capacities. The cognitive training program will be compared to a plausibly beneficial active
      control condition in which participants completed online crossword puzzles.

      The investigators hypothesize that the cognitive training will show greater transfer to a
      range of underlying cognitive abilities than the active control, as measured by a broad
      battery of neuropsychological assessments and participant-reported outcomes.
