      screening strategies. Considering that the general population is susceptible to 2019 nCoV, a
      great number of people need to be screened for NCIP. The new screening strategy of minipool
      testing may not only obtain a comparable accuracy to the standard individual testing, but
      also save time and money, which may benefit the current clinical practice.
