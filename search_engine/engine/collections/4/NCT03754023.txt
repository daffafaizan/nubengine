      presence of AKI or exclude; but unfortunately Serum creatinine (SCr) variations (based on
      KDIGO or AKIN criteria), take 24 to 48 hours to manifest the presence of acute renal ongoing
      damage. AKI is currently, infact, defined as an increase in SCr of 1.5-fold from baseline
      within 24 to 48 hours, and decrease in diuresis from admission in hospitalization, using
      KDIGO.

      As consequence, similarly to other biomarkers, such as troponins in acute coronary syndrome
      and D-dimer in pulmonary embolism, a laboratory test to rule in or rule out AKI is needed in
      critical patients in ED and our primary objective would be to evaluate the role of urine
      TIMP-IGFBP7 in this setting.

      Primary Objective of the BRAVA Study would be to evaluate the role of the urine biomarkers
      TIMP-IGFBP7 in predicting the occurrence of AKI in patients presenting to ED with different
      acute diseases and need for hospitalization.
