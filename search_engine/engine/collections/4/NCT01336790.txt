      Diseases. This project will be completed through an affiliation with the Lymphatic Education
      & Research Network, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote research and the
      development of new therapies for patients with lymphatic diseases, including lymphedema. The
      registry will provide researchers with much-needed clinical data to study the impact of
      diseases of the lymphatic system, in order to develop improved treatments and find a cure for
      lymphatic diseases, lymphedema, and related disorders. The establishment of this initiative
      is a major step forward in research for direct study of groups of patients with lymphatic
      disease. In the future, this project will be able to be linked with a biorepository, in which
      tissue and blood samples derived from patients will be made available for research into human
      disease states. An international patient registry and tissue/cell bank program paves the way
      for future clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies designed to treat lymphatic
      disease in human subjects.
