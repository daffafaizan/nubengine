      treatment guideline for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction(AEJ), but the effect of
      laparoscopic mediastinal lymph node dissection remains unknown. The aim of this study is to
      provide standard technical details of laparoscopic mediastinal lymph node dissection, and
      explore the potential clinical effects, gather key information for following study regarding
      sample size calculation, primary outcome and feasibility. This study report intervention
      development, governance procedures and selection and reporting of outcomes to optimize
      methods for using the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL)
      framework for surgical innovation that informs evidence-based practice.

      Methods and analysis: This is an IDEAL stage II, prospective, parallel control, open label,
      multi-center and exploratory study. The inclusion criteria is Siewert II/ III, AEJ,
      cT2-4aN0-3M0(AJCC-8th Gastric Cancer TNM stage manual), decide to receive radical
      gastrectomy, without preoperative anti-neoplastic therapy. Lymphadenectomy should include at
      least No.110, No.111 and part of No. 112(112pul and 112aoA). Allocation is not assigned by
      investigator. The primary outcome is the number of lymph node dissected in No.110, No.111,
      secondary outcome include complication, surgery length, postoperative death, R0 resection
      rate, etc. Expected sample size is 518 in each group, thus has 80% power to detect a
      difference of 0.17 in the average number of lower mediastinal lymph node dissected in between
      two groups.
