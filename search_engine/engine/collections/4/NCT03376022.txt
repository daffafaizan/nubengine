      throughout life, it is of importance to help the older maintain a good oral health when the
      cognitive functions and physical ability decreases. In 1999, a new dental care system was
      introduced with the aim to offer elderly with long-term need for extensive care, home visits
      for oral health assessment and, if necessary, be offered the necessary dental care. The aim
      was also to offer nursing personnel education and training in dental health and oral care, in
      order to provide and perform oral care. The effect of the education program has never been
      evaluated.
