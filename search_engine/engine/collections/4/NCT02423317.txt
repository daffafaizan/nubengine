      randomised prospective study was planned to compare size 1 Airtraq (Prodol Meditec S.A.,
      Vizcaya, Spain) with Miller blade of same size.

      The children included in the study were 2-10 years of age, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II and posted for elective surgeries requiring
      tracheal intubation. The following were excluded from the study: (i) patients with upper
      respiratory tract symptoms, (ii) those at risk of gastroesophageal regurgitation and (iii)
      those with airway-related conditions such a trismus, limited mouth opening, trauma or mass.
      Sixty patients were equally randomized to one of the two groups (Airtraq and Miller) of 30
      each for airway management using a computer-generated randomization program.

      Written informed consent was taken from the parents prior to intervention and a standardized
      protocol for anesthesia was maintained for all cases. All the children were kept nil per
      mouth as per standard guidelines. Intubation attempts were taken using Airtraq or Miller on a
      random basis.
