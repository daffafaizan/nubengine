      optimum cosmetic results (OCR).

      Each treatment will consist of up to 15 injections in total, each consisting of up to 0.1 ml
      of product, delivered to the mid to deep dermis of the skin of each Nasolabial fold using a
      27G needle.

      Each patient will receive the same preparation implanted as a bolus of 0.1mL at Day 1 into
      the mid-deep dermis of the skin of the medial aspect of the upper arm using a 27G needle, and
      two 2mm biopsies will be taken at the same visit on Day 57, Day 85 or Day 169 depending on
      randomisation for histopathology assessment.
