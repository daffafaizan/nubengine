      forecast of decline in physician manpower. Challenges that are specific to hemodialysis (HD)
      include reimbursement constraints, a growing shortage of nurses and major technological
      advances in dialysis equipment. There is a growing interest in alternative dialysis regimen
      and frequency, but a lack of patient incentive for self-care dialysis either in the center or
      in the home setting. The proposed phase 4 post-marketing study plans to explore whether daily
      HD is economically attractive compared with thrice weekly HD, while improving health-related
      quality of life and other dialysis adequacy measures. This project is unique as it provides a
      large prospective cohort of patients converted to daily HD, with a longitudinal follow up and
      an ability to compare to a matched cohort from the United States Renal Data Services. This
      study will help develop whether daily dialysis is economically attractive through the use of
      new technologies that reduce treatment costs and decrease hospitalization rates, with the
      long-term hope of increasing life expectancy. All patients will have the option to
      participate in the Quotidian Dialysis Registry, coordinated by the Lawson Health Research
      Institute (LHRI) in London, Ontario.
