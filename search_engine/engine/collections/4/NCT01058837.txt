      needed. We will acquire these data by re-approaching the patient population from the original
      Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT).[Bardy 2005] This research is
      supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of
      Health.

      SCD-HeFT was originally conducted from 1997 to 2003. It demonstrated unequivocally that ICD's
      save lives in patients with heart failure compared to placebo or amiodarone. More than 26
      peer-reviewed publications, including three NEJM papers, have resulted from this work.[Bardy
      2005, Poole 2008, Mark 2008] Despite the quality of SCD-HeFT and the evidence of the
      life-saving ability of ICD therapy, the role of ICD therapy in the management of patients
      with heart failure continues to be questioned. This study will provide long-term follow-up of
      the SCD-HeFT patients, which will now exceed 10 years on average.
