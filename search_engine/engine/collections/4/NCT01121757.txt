      Immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide (IMiDâ„¢)compound and a hypomethylating agent for
      epigenetic targeted therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular and marginal
      zone lymphoma. There will be two parts to the trial. Each patient will progress through each
      part of the study.

      Part 1: Sequential single agent therapy with azacitidine and lenalidomide. Each agent will be
      given for four-six 28-day cycles.

      Subjects with less than a complete response (CR) after 4 cycles of study drug in Part 1a or
      1b should proceed to the next study drug(s) after the prescribed washout period.

      Subjects with a CR may receive up to 6 cycles of study drug and will not receive the next
      study drug(s) until there is evidence of progressive disease.

      There will be a 1-6 week 'washout' period between stopping and starting each agent in Part 1,
      unless rapid progression suggests holding therapy would not be in the patient's best
      interest. There will be no washout period required between Part 1 and Part 2.

      Part 2: Combination therapy with azacitidine and lenalidomide given in 28-day cycle for up to
      13 cycles in subjects who have stable disease or better.
