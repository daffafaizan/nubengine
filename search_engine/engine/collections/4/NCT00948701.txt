      extend the research on physical activity to the community setting; community volunteers will
      deliver the intervention, thereby making physical activity interventions much more accessible
      to survivors. In partnership with the National ACS office (Atlanta, GA) and the New England
      ACS Division, researchers at the Miriam Hospital will share their skills, experience and
      resources to examine the effects of training RTR volunteers to deliver brief physical
      activity counseling to breast cancer survivors. Fifteen to twenty RTR volunteers will be
      trained to offer a 12-week telephone-based PA program as a supplement to 12-week RTR services
      (RTR Plus) vs. delivering the standard 12-week RTR services (RTR) to 108 breast cancer
      survivors. Assessments of physical activity, fatigue and other outcomes will be completed at
      baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Data on side-effects of the intervention and costs of
      intervention delivery will be tracked. If the proposed randomized trial demonstrates positive
      effects, the results will be used to design and support a dissemination trial of the effects
      of physical activity promotion to enhance cancer recovery in a community setting.
