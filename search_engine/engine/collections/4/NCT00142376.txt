      the PICU at Columbus Children's Hospital in the last two years. Patients would be included
      for review if they met the clinical criteria for ARDS. These criteria are: rapidly
      progressive respiratory failure, severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 200), and evidence of
      bilateral pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography. We estimate 40-50 patients will meet
      criteria.

      Once criteria are met, patient charts will be pulled or reviewed electronically. We will then
      compose a database that includes no patient identifiers but contains information regarding
      the cause, length, and outcome of the ARDS admission and PICU stay. Factors such as
      nutritional status, antibiotic and muscle relaxant use, and type of ventilation used will be
      examined. Other care-related variables will be included if they are felt to impact outcome
      during the review process. The database will then be analyzed and information regarding
      pediatric ARDS outcomes in our institution will be published.

      We anticipate that examining the factors that impact short term outcomes in pediatric ARDS
      will lead to research possibilities regarding ways to improve both short and long term
      outcomes in children with this illness. We propose that reviewing the disease entity as a
      whole will lead to improvements in caring for children with the disease, and eventually bring
      about a decline in mortality rates.
