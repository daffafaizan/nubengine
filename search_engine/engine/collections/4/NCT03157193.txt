      variables and the expression of biochemical inflammatory markers in the crevicular fluid of
      implants receiving perimplantitis treatment.

      A randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial was designed on 100 perimplantitis
      affected implants placed in 61 subjects. Inclusion criteria were implants with at least 1
      year of functional loading and with diagnosis of perimplantitis following the criteria from
      the Association of Dental Implantology. All implant received perimplantitis treatment. Each
      patient was randomly assigned to receive a gel containing 0.8% HA (Test group), a gel without
      HA (Placebo group) or no gel treatment (Control group). After a first gel application at
      baseline, test and placebo patients performed gel applications at home 3 times/day for 45
      days. Clinical variables of each implant were recorded at baseline, 45 and 90 days (probing
      depth, attachment loss, bleeding). Intraoral radiographs of each implants were performed to
      measure marginal bone level. Peri-implant crevicular fluid was collected from each implant at
      baseline and after 45 days of treatment, to assess IL-1β and TNFα levels by ELISA technique.
      Clustering analysis, considering multiple implants within each patient, was performed.
