      proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Persistent or recurrent VH can delay visual
      rehabilitation and give patients much trouble. There have been efforts to lower the incidence
      of postoperative VH such as using intraoperative gas tamponade and preoperative bevacizumab
      injection. Bevacizumab(Avastin) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and has been shown to
      decrease retinal and iris neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Recently
      there have been reports showing that preoperative intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection
      could reduce intraoperative bleeding from abnormal vessels and could make surgery easier and
      more successful.Our hypothesis is that preoperative bevacizumab injection could reduce
      postoperative VH by way of decreasing the amount of abnormal vessels and intraoperative
      injection could also reduce postoperative VH by inhibiting the vessel formation after
      surgery.

      To prove our hypothesis, we started the prospective randomized comparative study to determine
      the effect of pre- and intra-operative IVB injection on postoperative vitreous hemorrhage
      after diabetic vitrectomy.
