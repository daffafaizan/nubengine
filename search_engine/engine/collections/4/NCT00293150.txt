      minimum of 80 patients designed to determine the efficacy of eplerenone in subjects with
      diastolic heart failure. Prior to administration of study medication, a medical history,
      physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram, 2D echocardiogram, and cardiomyopathy
      questionnaire will be performed. Subjects will then be randomized to receive either
      eplerenone 25 mg once daily or placebo for 2 weeks. At the Week 2 visit all patients will be
      titrated up to the next dose (50 mg eplerenone once daily or placebo). Each study arm will
      have 40 subjects who will participate for 9 months. Follow-up assessments will be completed
      at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months.

      Starting at the Month 1 visit, any subjects with uncontrolled blood pressure will be
      administered add-on therapy of HCTZ (starting dose of 12.5 mg daily, that may titrate up to
      25 mg daily) and/or amlodipine (starting dose at 5 mg daily, that may titrate up to 10 mg
      daily). Any subject who receives add-on therapy must have their blood pressure checked within
      2 weeks. Uncontrolled blood pressure may be treated by either increasing the add-on therapy
      dose or increasing the add-on therapy regimen to include both add-on drugs. Changes in add-on
      therapy require blood pressure checks within 2 weeks.
