    
      This is a phase I blinded randomized study of the safety and tolerability of Lactobacillus
      reuteri DSM 17938 given daily for a period of five consecutive days. Upon enrollment subjects
      will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a ratio of treatment to placebo of 2:1.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either:

      A. Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr): 108 (100 million) organisms of Lactobacillus reuteri per dose,
      given once daily for a five-day treatment period that corresponds to a dose of the closely
      related L. reuteri ATCC 55730 strain that has shown to be therapeutic for infantile colic.
      The strain used in this study (DSM 17938) has been cured of an antibiotic resistance plasmid
      found in the original BioGaia strain (L. reuteri ATCC 55730).

      B. Placebo oil preparation, administered as 5 drops of the oil vehicle used in manufacturing
      the Lr suspension, given once daily for a five-day study period (BioGaia AB, Stockholm,
      Sweden).

      In the first 30 subjects randomized, administration of each dose of the study preparation
      drops (A or B above) will be immediately followed by offering 2 ounces of flavored PediaSure
      ® (Abbott Laboratories) nutritional supplement to each child. The second 30 subjects enrolled
      will not be offered PediaSure ® after product administration. This format will also allow us
      to assess the impact of concurrent administration of a buffering non-lactose containing
      formula with prebiotic nutritional properties on intestinal colonization with L. reuteri by
      PCR.
