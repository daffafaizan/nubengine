      conditions. This faculty is comparable to an apprenticeship adaptive during which the
      individual updates, on a trial and error basis, the correspondence between sensory inputs and
      the resulting motor commands. Once updated, these correspondences or internal models allow
      the individual to produce a behavior precise and reproducible motor. The issue of model
      acquisition and retention internal movement is therefore central to our understanding of
      motor control. Relatedly, this question constitutes a gateway to a more comprehensive
      understanding of the mechanisms of learning and procedural memory.

      The MotorMemo project therefore aims to study the formation of internal models of movement in
      the human brain, with the particularity of being interested in the correlates cerebral
      processes of acquiring and retaining an internal model of visuomotor transformation in
      healthy children (8-12 years) and adults.
