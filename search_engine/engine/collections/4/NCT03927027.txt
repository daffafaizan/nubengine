      I. To determine the occurrence of post-surgery lymphedema by conical geometric measures in
      clinical T1-3, N0-3, M0 breast cancer patients undergoing axillary surgery and randomized to
      Group 1 (no axillary reverse mapping [ARM]) versus Group II (ARM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare between the study groups the lymphedema symptom intensity and distress as
      measured by the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-Arm (LSIDS-A).

      II. To evaluate the technical success of performance of ARM procedure: Identification of ARM
      lymphatics, and the ability to spare or reapproximate ARM lymphatics.

      III. To compare the rate of regional recurrence between patients randomized to receive ARM
      versus no ARM.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the occurrence of lymphedema as a function of radiotherapy use and targets.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive isosulfan blue subcutaneously (SC) and undergo axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND).

      GROUP II: Patients undergo ARM. Patients then receive isosulfan blue and undergo ALND as in
      Group I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 years.
