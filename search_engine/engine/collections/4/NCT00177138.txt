        1. Compare the side effects of the immunosuppressive medications between both groups. This
           will include anaphylactic reactions, GI side-effects, bone marrow suppression, renal
           dysfunction, hypertension, hyperglycemic effects, and effects on lipid profile.

        2. Compare the incidence of infections between both groups.

      Comparison parameters are:

        1. Pancreas and kidney graft failure

        2. Patient death

        3. Clinical and biopsy documented rejection episodes

        4. Patient dropout (non-compliance with the study protocol)

        5. Kidney function as assessed by creatinine clearance or biopsy

        6. Need to change immunosuppression regimen

        7. Quality-adjusted Life Years
