      in eyes with diabetic macular edema.However, the pharmacokinetic profile of erythropoietin
      after intravitreal injection in humans has not yet been determined clearly. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the intraocular pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin after a single
      intravitreal injection in a prospective investigation.
