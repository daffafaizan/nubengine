      by the epidemic of obesity. High blood lipid levels after a meal may be an important risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. In this study we will investigate whether simvastatin in
      combination with ezetimibe vs. simvastatin alone, has a beneficial effect on the lipid levels
      after a meal, but more importantly, whether we can measure a difference in function of the
      endothelium. In a small pilot study we already found that the combination had a beneficial
      effect in comparison with simvastatin alone. Now we want to solidify these findings in a
      larger study.
