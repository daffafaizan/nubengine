      marrow plus incomplete differentiation. Many of this patients are elderly with age further
      than 60 years(CALGB,ECOG,EORTC) or 55 years (SWOG). Mortality rate fallowing standard therapy
      of this patients is high that can reach to 50%. One of methods to apply a remission with
      least mortality and morbidity and also significant lower cost effects compare to historical
      and conventional standard regimen is low dose cytosar and arsenic trioxide combination that
      has been reported complete remission to 34%.

      We select ten patients with age further than 60 with comorbidity and treat by low dose
      cytosar subcutaneous plus arsenic trioxide for ten days in month. We will assess overall
      response rate and overall survival in end of one year.
