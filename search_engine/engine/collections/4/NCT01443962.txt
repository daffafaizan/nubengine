      saturation of brain due to increased intracranial pressure, central venous pressure and make
      worse to respiratory parameters. Positive end expiratory pressure could improve the
      respiratory parameters include oxygenation. So applying PEEP could improve the regional
      oxygen saturation of brain during the pneumoperitoneum during the laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.
