      randomization design on five VA hospital wards to compare a mobility program (MP) to usual
      care (UC) among a cohort of Veterans age 50 years. The investigators will examine pre to
      post-hospital mobility and adverse outcomes including functional decline, nursing home
      admission, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization and death in the MP and UC
      groups in the year after hospital discharge. The primary outcome of mobility will be measured
      by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Life-Space Assessment (LSA).10-13 Secondary
      measures of mobility will include self-reported ability to walk mile and drive a car, as
      described by Gill, et al.14 The investigators will identify patient specific characteristics
      that modify the effect of the mobility intervention on post-hospital mobility and adverse
      outcomes to determine which hospitalized patients are most likely to benefit from this
      intervention.
