      sparing interscalene approach, has better safety profile than before and because of this, it
      is often the technique of choice for anaesthesia and/or analgesia during shoulder and
      proximal arm surgery. Anatomical variations at the interscalene groove are not uncommon and
      few have been described in the literature. Understanding the anatomy of the brachial plexus
      and its sheath at the interscalene groove is vital for the success of the block and to reduce
      the risk of complications during ultrasound (US) guided ISBPB. Recently, with the use of high
      definition ultrasound, using high frequency linear transducer, the principal investigator
      have identified intermuscular bridges appearing between the ventral rami of the brachial
      plexus at the interscalene groove. These intermuscular bridges may affect the spread of local
      anesthetic dispersion within the brachial plexus sheath thereby affecting the block dynamics
      of ISBPB. Therefore, this prospective observational study aim to define the intermuscular
      bridges at the interscalene groove using high definition ultrasound imaging in a group of
      healthy volunteers.
