      Studies were conducted on blood pressure and the neuroendocrine effects of noise resulting
      from the relocation of the Munich International Airport. At the former airport site the
      investigators monitored people exposed to high levels of noise and then tracked these same
      individuals as their ambient environment became normal following the shutdown of the airport.
      At the new airport site, the opposite situation occurred: Individuals living in normal, quiet
      ambient conditions became exposed to loud aircraft noise. At both sites, control groups were
      formed who were not exposed to aircraft noise. The study piggybacked onto a German sponsored
      grant. NIH funds covered the costs of cardiovascular and psycho-physiological data analysis.
      Measures included biochemical assays of chronic neuroendocrine markers of stress, resting
      blood pressure, and reactivity of blood pressure during cognitive tasks. Perceptions of
      community noise levels were also assessed as possible mediators of the stressful effects of
      chronic exposure to ambient, environmental noise.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
