    
      This registry study aims to collect data on efficacy and safety of different treatments of
      benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS).

      Clinical, patient reported and imaging data that are assessed in clinical routine will be
      prospectively collected. All patients that are treated for BPE / BPH-LUTS at our institution
      will be included if they provide written informed consent.

      This registry enables us to compare novel treatment option (e.g. prostatic artery
      embolization; PAE) to established interventions (e.g., TURP, HoLEP, open prostatectomy,
      ThuLEP, Thulium laser vaporization, TUIP) regarding safety and efficacy.
