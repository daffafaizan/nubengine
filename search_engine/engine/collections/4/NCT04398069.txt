    
      Randomized, controlled, prospective trial, including ICU patients with Sepsis or septic
      Shock, at the early phase.

      patients will be randomized in 2 groups regarding the hemodynamic management and catecholamin
      doses:

        -  Group 1: standard hemodynamic goals and cathecolamin infusion to achieve: mean arterial
           pressure > or equal to 65 mmHg and diastolic arterial pressure > ou equal to 50 mmHg
           within the first 60 minutes.

        -  Group 2: personalized hemodynamic goals and cathecolamin infusion until normal
           transcranial doppler: IP<1,2.

      For the 2 groups, standard management including: microbiological sampling, early broad
      spectrum anti infective therapy, fluid management and decreasing of blood lactate levels,
      will be aimed within the first 60 minutes.

      For the Group 2 patients: personalized hemodynamic management will be maintained during 72
      hours.
