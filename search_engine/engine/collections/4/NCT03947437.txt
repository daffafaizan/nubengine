      region endemic for leprosy. The trial will enroll both healthy participants and
      paucibacillary leprosy patients receiving standard-of-care therapy. Safety at the lower
      vaccine dose will be demonstrated in healthy participants prior to antigen dose-escalation.
      Further, safety in all healthy participants will be demonstrated prior to enrolling leprosy
      patients.

      Participants will be randomized within each Group to receive three doses of vaccine or
      placebo administered IM on Days 0, 28, and 56. Participants will be monitored for one year
      following the last study injection.
