      dose-expansion phase (part 2). In part 1, patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection
      (CSPC) at the initial starting dose until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dosages will
      be escalated by certain increments in subsequent cohorts. Once the appropriate dose has been
      established in part 1, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts in part 2.
