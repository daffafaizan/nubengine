      drop can harmful to patients with particular illnesses (trauma, stroke, post cardiac arrest),
      and the very young or old. Measuring temperature and preventing temperature drops are
      challenging in the transport setting. The temporal artery thermometer (TAT) is widely
      available, easy to use, non-invasive way to measure body temperature. TAT is believed to be a
      good tool for paramedics to measure body temperature in the transport setting. However, the
      evidence on reliability and validity of TAT-derived temperature measurements is lacking
      because the TAT has not been evaluated in the transport setting. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the reliability of the TAT device and compare measures of temperature with an
      established standard in a broad range of patients undergoing interfacility transport by land
      ambulance, and rotor- and fixed-wing aircraft.
