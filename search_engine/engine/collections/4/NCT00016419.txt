        -  Determine the response in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with
           anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the correlation between response to treatment and the in vitro assessment of
           T-lymphocyte subsets in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to myelodysplastic
      syndrome subclassification (refractory anemia [RA] vs RA with ringed sideroblasts vs RA with
      excess blasts).

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6-12 hours on
      days 1-4 and oral cyclosporine twice daily on days 5-94 followed by a taper until day 124.
      Patients who relapse after a response of at least 60 days may receive reinduction therapy
      comprising oral cyclosporine twice daily on days 1-90 followed by a taper until day 120.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients (53 with refractory anemia [RA], 33 with RA with
      ringed sideroblasts, and 44 with RA with excess blasts) will be accrued for this study within
      14-22 months.
