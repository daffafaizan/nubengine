      need for insulin and makes it more difficult to maintain normoglycemia. Fetal exposure to
      hyperglycemia induces macrosomia which increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
      Further more obesity and excess weight gain during pregnancy enhances insulin resistance and
      it's an independent risk factor for fetal macrosomia.

      Metformin is a medical treatment for type 2 diabetes (DM2) where consequential
      pathophysiology includes insulin resistance. It reduces hepatic glucose production and
      enhances the use of glucose in muscles relieving insulin resistance. Metformin has also found
      to inhibit weight gain effectively.

      Metformin has approved to be safe and effective in patients with gestational diabetes (GDM).
      It has found to reduce weight gain and improve postprandial blood glucose levels during
      pregnancy and reduce neonatal birth trauma in GDM. However, there are no previous studies
      about the use of metformin in pregnant women with DM1.

      Two hundred women with DM1 will be randomized to get placebo or metformin in addition to
      regular insulin treatment. The sample size has been estimated to demonstrate the difference
      of 15 % in the need to increase insulin dosages during the pregnancy between the study
      groups.
