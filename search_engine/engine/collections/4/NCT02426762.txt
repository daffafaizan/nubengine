    
      -  Study design: A prospective cohort study

        -  Populations: Patients who have confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer,
           gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), inflammatory bowel disease and diverticula decide
           to receive laparoscopic surgery.

        -  Surgical techniques: laparoscopic operations should be successfully performed with a 3-4
           cm minimal incision left for sample retrieval. In all, about five trocar-associated mini
           incisions and a sample-retrieval incision would be left prior to skin closure.

        -  Skin closure: A quick skin sealant would be applied to achieve a seal, without any
           suture made under the skin.

        -  Postoperative treatment: An enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) bundles would be
           applied for enrolled subjects. As for wound management, additional wound cares are not
           required. Patients can take shower at postoperative day 3 (POD3).

        -  Primary endpoint: The primary study endpoint is freedom from surgical site infection
           (SSI) within 30 days. The incidence of surgical site infection with the first 30 days
           after surgery would be explored.
