urinary excretion of i131-diodrast injected intraventricularlyin communicating hydrocephalus and aqueduct stenosisnine cases of expansive infantile hydro-cephalus were investigated by injectingsmall amounts of i131-diodrast intra-ventricularly.  urinary excretion of thetracer was determined during the first4-5 hours after injection.  the cumulativeexcretion of diodrast from the c.s.f. dif-fers in cases with communicating hydro-cephalus from those with stenosis of theaqueduct.  the investigation is rapid andeasily performed and has not produced anyside effects.
