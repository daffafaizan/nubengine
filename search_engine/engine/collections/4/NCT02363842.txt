      the effects of Skin IQâ„¢ MCM coverlet placed over commercially available pressure
      redistribution surfaces versus commercially available pressure redistribution surface (SOC)
      used by itself to manage patients at risk for tissue breakdown.

      Anticipation is that 160 Subjects will need to be screened and consented to achieve the
      desired sample size of 136 Subjects at up to 5 centers. Individual Subject, Standard Time of
      Observation: Up to 60 days for incidence of PU development; beyond 60 days, only hospital
      discharge date and disposition will be collected. The safety endpoint is the incidence of
      device-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
