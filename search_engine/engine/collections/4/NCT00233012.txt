      chance), dose comparison, multicenter study of topiramate in infants of age 1-24 months with
      refractory partial-onset seizures (POS). The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of topiramate used as additional treatment in infants with
      refractory POS. Topiramate is administered as liquid and sprinkles as adjunct (additional
      treatment) to concurrent anticonvulsant therapy. The study will consist of 4 phases: a
      pretreatment phase that includes screening (up to 7 days) and baseline (1 day), an open-label
      treatment phase (up to 6 weeks), an open-label extension phase (54 weeks), and a
      posttreatment phase (up to 4 weeks). Seizure diaries will be maintained throughout the study
      by the patients' parents, legally acceptable representatives, or caregivers. In the
      open-label treatment phase, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments:
      topiramate 3, 5, 15, or 25 mg/kg per day. Venous blood samples (four 1 milliliter [mL]
      samples) will be collected on 2 days during the study to determine plasma concentration of
      topiramate. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by monitoring adverse events and by
      results from clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, venous ammonia, hematology, and
      urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements (pulse and blood pressure),
      physical examination, neurologic examination, Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior, renal
      ultrasound, assessments for adequate food and liquid intake, hyperthermia, oligohydrosis, and
      rash, and take-home records. Liquid or sprinkles form of topiramate, 3,5,15,or 25mg/kg per
      day for 54 weeks.
