      over 1000mg /day (HbA1C over 7%).

      Before drug administration, we conduct basal lab study including CGMS. After 3 month of
      random administration of vildagliptin or glimepiride, we check CGMS, glucose levels, CV
      biomarkers, and estimate hypoglycemic index. We replace with the other drug for 3 months, and
      then conduct the same measurements. No wash-out period is necessary since result variables
      are measured after the 3 months of administration for a different drug.
