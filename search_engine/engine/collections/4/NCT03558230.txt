      random-frequency vibration to the wrist skin. The hypothesis is that improvement in upper
      extremity function will be greater for the experimental group receiving the stimulation
      during CIMT compared with the control group who will wear the device with no vibration
      (placebo). This pilot study is to assess feasibility and safety.
