    
      A total of 30 COVID-19 patients for the study will be enrolled. All the patients enrolled
      were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab
      specimens.

      For the study, serum samples of the 30 patients will be collected and will be investigated
      for the detection rate for immunoglobulin G (IgG). The first sample will be collected 2 weeks
      after the second negative RT-PCR assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens and 6 samples
      will be collected after that for 6 months later; one serum sample tested every month for 6
      months after.

      The following questions will be addressed:-

        1. What proportion of confirmed cases develops specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2?

        2. How long is the duration of detection of serum IgG antibodies and antibody titres over
           time following infection with SARS-CoV-2?
