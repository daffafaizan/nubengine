      compression stockings may be used if thigh level graduated compression stockings are not
      feasible, such as after knee surgery), started before surgery and worn until discharge and
      for a minimum of 10 days (whichever is longer), reduce symptomatic venous thromboembolism
      (proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) in the 30 days after surgery.
