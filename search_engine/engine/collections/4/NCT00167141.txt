    
      Volunteers with normal and subnormal semen parameters receive a hormonal male contraceptive
      in order to investigate whether there are differences between normal and subnormal men in
      terms of suppressibility, rate of azoospermia and reversibility of suppression of
      spermatogenesis. Twenty-five men will be recruited for each group. They will be exposed to
      hormonal male contraception for six months.
