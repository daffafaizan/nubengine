    
      This trial is a phase II, open label, multi-center trial to determine the efficacy and safety
      of tisagenlecleucel re-infusion in pediatric and adolescent young adult (AYA) patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing loss of B cell aplasia. Loss of B-cell
      aplasia is defined as: peripheral blood (PB) absolute B lymphocyte count ≥ 50/µL, OR PB B
      lymphocyte ≥ 10% of the total lymphocytes.

      The study will have the following phases for all patients: Screening, Treatment and
      Follow-up. The total duration of the study is about 12 months. After tisagenlecleucel
      re-infusion, efficacy will be assessed at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 at which time blood samples
      will be obtained to measure circulating B lymphocytes (< 50/µL) and presence of CTL019 cells
      by qPCR in the peripheral blood. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.

      The end of the study will be when all patients complete a month 12 visit unless discontinuing
      prior. The patient may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time.
      Patients who receive commercial tisagenlecleucel must be followed for up to 15 years
      post-infusion. Patients can be followed under the Center for International Blood and Marrow
      Transplant Research (CIBMTR) cellular therapy registry if consented for participation. For
      patients who do not provide consent for participation in the Center for International Blood
      and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry, AEs will need to be reported for 15 years
      or until the patient enrolls in the registry.
