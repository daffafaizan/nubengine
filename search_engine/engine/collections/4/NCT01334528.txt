      baseline/post-injury assessment models and they often fail to show enduring deficits among
      persons complaining of such problems. It may be the case that our standard approach to
      deficit measurement in mTBI has confounded our ability to elicit the actual impairment. The
      proposed study could generate an assessment paradigm shift (performance over time) and afford
      professionals the direction to better assess and ultimately serve persons with mTBI.
      Additionally, research on the impact of PTSD symptoms on throughput and cognitive performance
      has been mixed (Bremner et al., 1995; Brenner et al, 2010; Vasterling et al., 1998, 2002,
      2006) and the proposed study will yield additional data in that area.
