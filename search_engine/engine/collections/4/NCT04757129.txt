    
      About 50 acute pulmonary embolism(APE) patients treated with thrombolysis are enrolled in the
      First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University and Nanjing Drum Town Hospital from
      January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. According to the 2019 ESC guideline, the standards for
      thrombolysis in APE patients are as follows: within 2 weeks of onset; high-risk pulmonary
      embolism; medium-high-risk pulmonary embolism with symptoms of aggravation.

      Investigators dynamically monitor cardiopulmonary function of participants after
      thrombolysis, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood gas analysis,
      2-dimensional echocardiography (left and right ventricular diameter, pulmonary artery
      pressure, interventricular septum) and laboratory tests (cTnT,pro-BNP).participants are
      divided into two groups: thrombolytic success group and thrombolytic failure group according
      the previously reported criterion which is evaluated 48h after thrombolysis.

      Cardiopulmonary characteristics are analyzed to seek accurate and rapid index to reflect
      success of thrombolysis.
