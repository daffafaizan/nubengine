      capsule centration and 25 will have pupil centration. Retroillumination slitlamp photographs
      will be taken 10-30 days after surgery with dilated pupils. The amount of capsule overlapping
      the IOL will be documented. The horizontal, vertical and symmetricity of overlap will be
      calculated.

      Each group will have 20 eyes with an additional 5 eyes in each group to account for drop outs
      or poor quality images.
