    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study is to determine feasibility of
      providing pediatric cancer patients with access to personalized treatment options and
      clinical management recommendations based on ex vivo drug sensitivity testing (DST) and
      genomic profiling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: The secondary objective of the study is to compare individual outcomes
      (response and disease-free survival) in patients with pediatric cancers treated with
      DST-guided therapy as compared to non-DST guided (conventional) therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE: To explore associations between genetic abnormalities in malignancies
      and ex vivo drug response.
