      chronic illnesses such as hypertension and asthma long term abstinence remains elusive for
      many. Fortunately, the FDA has recently approved a long acting subcutaneous injectable
      formulation of buprenorphine. While this drug has proven effective in retaining patients in
      care and decreasing drug cravings as compared to placebo, this drug has not been tested in a
      real world clinic setting and no studies exist comparing it to the current formulations of
      buprenorphine. The objective of this study is to perform a randomized pilot study directly
      comparing sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone to long acting buprenorphine subdermal injection
      in a standard Office-Based Opioid Agonist Treatment (OBOT) clinic. The study team will
      compare patient retention, percentage of negative urinary drug screens, and withdrawal scores
      between the two groups. The findings will provide insight for US providers seeking more
      effective and efficient ways to treat Opioid use disorder (OUD) in the outpatient setting.
