      51% have in the lst month.

      The average American consumes 2.18 gallons of ethanol yearly. Alcohol related morbidity and
      mortality are staggering problems in the USA. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur because
      alcohol is a central nervous system depressant; abrupt withdrawal unmasks compensatory
      overactivity of certain parts of the nervous system, including sympathetic autonomic outflow.
      5% of patients who undergo alcohol suffer from Delirium Tremors (DTs), a syndrome
      characterized by hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low grade fever,
      agitation, and diaphoresis.

      DTs typically begin between 48-96 hours after the last drink and last 1 to 5 days. DTs
      requires hospitalization and vigorous activity in an ICU setting.

      The most successful drug treatment for alcohol withdrawal has been found to be the
      benzodiazepines.

      Symptom triggered treatment was found to be as effective as a fixed dose treatment to result
      in less drug being used overall, with a trend toward shorter duration of withdrawal
      treatment.

      Baclofen is used orally for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis,
      spinal cord injuries/diseases and intrathecally for spasticity related to cerebral palsy,
      spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

      Its proposed benefit in alcohol withdrawal is that it may reduce voluntary alcohol intake,
      alcohol craving, and may suppress the intensity of alcohol withdrawal treatment.
