      inflammatory conditions. There is an urgent need to describe prognostic factors and to
      discover new therapeutic pathways. Soluble CD95-L is a cleaved part of CD95-L which binds the
      CD95 Death receptor. s-CD95-L has pro-inflammatory properties for Th17 lymphocytes and
      Neutrophils, two cells implicated in ANCA associated vasculitis. It also plays a role in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (which present with the same type of renal glomerulonephritis as
      ANCA-associated vasculitis). Finally, it has already be found elevated in this group of
      diseases. The investigators hypothesized that s-CD95-L levels might be a prognostic factor in
      ANCA associated vasculitis and the study of the molecular mechanisms involved could provide
      new therapeutic targets.

      The study will recruit 50 patients with ANCA associated vasculitis followed in Bordeaux
      University Hospital. Among classical disease activity information, blood and urine samples
      will be collected at each visit to study s-CD95-L. Fundamental research will be realized on
      patients' sample to study molecular mechanisms involved.

      Clinical and biological disease activity, treatment and outcomes will be studied in
      correlation with s-CD95-L to describe their potential prognostic role. Patients will be
      followed at regular intervals, as their usual follow-up would request. No extra visit will be
      needed and blood samples will be drawn at the same time as those drawn for clinical purposes.
