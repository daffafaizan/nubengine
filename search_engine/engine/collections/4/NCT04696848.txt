    
      Dose Escalation cohort (Stage 1) With traditional 3+3 dose-escalation design, the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CKD-516 in combination with durvalumab will be
      evaluated. Three dose levels of CKD-516 (9, 11, 13 mg/m2) will be investigated in combination
      with durvalumab 1,500 mg. At each dose level, 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled. After
      completion of 1 cycle of treatment of all patients in each dose level, decision for
      enrollment of subjects for next dose level will be decided after review of safety profile by
      safety review (SRM).

      Extension cohort (Stage 2) Stage 2 is an exploratory study for the evaluation of the efficacy
      of recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CKD-516 in the combination with Durvalumab in patients
      with specific types of solid tumors (listed below).
