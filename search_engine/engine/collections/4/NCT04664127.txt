    
      This study was a comparative post-registration prospective non-interventional (observational)
      scientific study.

      This research did not include any procedures or medical interventions except those
      recommended in the local clinical guidelines and international standards of care. All
      procedures and evaluations were performed in accordance with routine clinical practice
      adopted in the Russian Federation and the instructions for the medical use of drugs that
      patients received.

      The following data was collected and analyzed after the end of treatment:

        -  demography

        -  disease severity (mild, moderate, severe, continuous relapses)

        -  data of anamnesis (hereditary and family anamnesis, duration of herpes simplex disease,
           previous illnesses, duration of treatment, previous treatment of herpes simplex and its
           efficacy, allergic anamnesis, epidemiological anamnesis, rate and duration of herpes
           relapses over the past year (with indication of the location of herpes simplex rashes),
           main diagnosis and complications, ICD-10 code, date and time of the last exacerbation,
           causes of exacerbation)

        -  verification of inclusion criteria

        -  verification of non-inclusion criteria

        -  prescribed therapy (trade name and prescription scheme, rate, method of administration)

        -  laboratory tests (4 timelines: 1 - first 6-48 hours; 2 - 6 days after starting of
           therapy; 3 - 30 days; 4 - 4 months): clinical and biochemical blood tests; serological
           diagnostics with determination of herpes virus infections's markers: IgM, IgG-HSV1,
           HSV2; hospital screening of venous blood: anti - HIV-1,2; anti-HCV-total, HBsAg, CSR;
           microbiological seeding from the tonsils, posterior pharyngeal wall with determination
           of drug sensitivity; PCR of blood, saliva and/or rash elements; immune status by laser
           flow cytometry: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, CD16+, CD19+; serum immunoglobulins: IgA,
           IgM, IgG, IgE total.

        -  medical anamnesis (4 timelines: 1 - first 6-48 hours; 2 - 6 days after starting of
           therapy; 3 - 30 days; 4 - 4 months) or clinical efficacy: the presence and rate of
           exacerbations of the disease orolabial, genital and other sites; local complaints; the
           rate of occurrence of and general symptoms; the rate of epithelialization of the rash's
           morphological elements; duration of recurrence of the herpes simplex virus and speed of
           onset of epithelialization; the rate of relapses and exacerbations of herpes simplex on
           the background of suppressive therapy

        -  taking other drugs during the study (trade name, prescription scheme)

        -  compliance with the drugs regimen

        -  timelines: data of signing the informed consent, start date of the study, date of each
           patient visit, end date of the study, start date and end date of the taking medicines,
           duration of patient follow-up)

        -  quality of life assessment at the end of the study (excellent / good / satisfactory /
           has not changed)

        -  adverse events (yes/no, data description)
