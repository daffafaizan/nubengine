    
      An 24-week maltodextrin-control cross-over experimental medicine study enrolling 40 patients
      with psychosis. Participants will receive a 12-week treatment with Bimunoâ„¢ GOS, as well as a
      12-week maltodextrin supplement. The order of supplements that participants will receive is
      randomized. A washout period was considered unnecessary as maltodextrin is an inactive
      placebo wherein negligible effects have been shown on bifidobacteria growth, and therefore,
      would present with no carryover/lasting effects to mask the prebiotic effect.

      Eligible patients will be invited to be screened for the study and assessed to ensure they
      meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the participant passes this initial screening stage and
      conditional to informed consent, he/she will then be randomized into one of the two groups.
      Once decided, the participant will be assessed by a research assistant using standard
      clinical assessments used to diagnose/evaluate cognitive deficits. A 12-week supply of
      sachets containing prebiotic or maltodextrin will be provided for the participant to allow
      participants to complete the first quarter of the study. Additional 12-week supplies of
      prebiotics or maltodextrin will be provided at the study follow-up. Since
      clozapine/olanzapine are well known antipsychotics that induce weight gain and interfere with
      the immune system an additional sub-analysis of those participants stable on
      clozapine/olanzapine will be performed, contingent on the demographics.

      The study will include five sessions in total all taking place at either University
      Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, or a location convenient to the participant
      (e.g., patient home): (1) screening session, (2) baseline cognitive and blood measurements,
      (3) study follow up, and (4) final testing session.
