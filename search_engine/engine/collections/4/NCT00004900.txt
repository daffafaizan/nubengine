      without induction chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the
      hematopoietic recovery rate in these patients after infusion of blood derived CD34+
      progenitors isolated using a CD34+ affinity device for positive purification of the
      autograft. III. Compare response rates and duration of responses between these patients
      treated in this trial to patients treated in a previous trial using the same sequential high
      dose chemotherapy with induction conventional dose chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV daily for 2 days, and etoposide IV and
      cisplatin IV daily for 3 days. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously twice daily
      beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy until the last day of apheresis. Upon
      hematopoietic recovery, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected over several days.
      Within 35 days of mobilization chemotherapy, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, thiotepa
      IV, and carboplatin IV continuously on days -7 to -4, followed by a 2 day rest period. CD34+
      selected PBSC are reinfused. Beginning 4 hours after reinfusion, patients receive G-CSF
      subcutaneously daily until hematopoietic recovery. Patients may then receive radiation
      therapy to sites of prior bulk disease at the discretion of the investigator. Within 30 days
      of hematopoietic recovery or immediately following post transplant radiation therapy,
      patients receive oral anastrazole daily until disease progression. Patients are followed
      monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4-6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
