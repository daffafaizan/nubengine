      I. Assess the safety of using a personalized adoptive T cell therapy in patients with
      advanced gastrointestinal malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the persistence of an immune response after T cell infusion. II. Determine the
      clinical benefit of adoptive T cell therapy in advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2 days prior to CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients undergo CD8+ T cell infusion IV over 2 hours on
      day 0 and receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Beginning
      on day 1 about 24 hours after CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over
      30-60 minutes on weeks 3, 6, 12, and 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 weeks.
