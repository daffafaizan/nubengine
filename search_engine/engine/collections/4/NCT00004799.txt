      participating institution.

      The first group of infants receives a vaccine composed of inactivated pertussis toxin (iPT)
      and filamentous hemagglutin (FHA).

      The second group receives a vaccine containing iPT, FHA, pertactin, agglutinogen 2, and
      agglutinogen 3.

      The third group receives a whole-cell pertussis vaccine. The fourth group receives a
      diphtheria-tetanus vaccine as the control. All vaccines are given as an intramuscular
      injection, at 2-3, 4, and 6 months of age.

      Close surveillance of infants and families continues for 2-3 years.
