      remodelling of the heart in patients with controlled essential hypertension, defined as
      having a blood pressure of equal to or less than 130/80 in diabetics and equal to or less
      than 140/90 in non-diabetics. This study will investigate if the addition of 25 milligrams of
      eplerenone daily to a subject's hypertension medication regimen will prevent the progression
      or development of diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiography will be used to measure the changes
      in heart structure of subjects receiving eplerenone versus subjects receiving placebo (a drug
      that may resemble the study drug but contains no active ingredient). Approximately 30
      subjects will take part in this study.
