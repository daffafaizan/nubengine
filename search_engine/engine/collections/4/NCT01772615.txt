      have proven to result in numerous side effects. An important causal factor for the
      development of the disease is an autoimmune cellular response against bacteria in the colon.

      As a possible treatment, manipulation of the bacterial flora has been studied using the
      probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). Studies on UC patients have shown
      that treatment with EcN is equally good at maintaining remission as the standard treatment
      with mesalazine. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin have been
      studied for treatment of UC and some, but shortlived, effect has been described.

      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment-arms: ciprofloxacin-EcN,
      ciprofloxacin-placebo, placebo-EcN or placebo-placebo.

      Disease activity are quantitated with Colitis Activity Index (CAI) and quality of life by the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Also, dietary interviews to examine the
      patients' dietary intake are completed and the patients' fecal-calprotectin-concentrations
      will be measured.

      Hundred subjects with ulcerative colitis will be recruited for the study. Standard medical
      care and therapies will be continued throughout the study
