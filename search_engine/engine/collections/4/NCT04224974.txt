      involves admission to hospital for treatment (e.g. induction chemotherapy). Additional
      support services may be delivered if requested or if a doctor thinks it is necessary.

      Little research has been done looking at the psychological and physical consequences of being
      diagnosed with and treated for acute leukemia, but our research team has found that a
      significant number of these individuals experience symptoms of traumatic stress and severe
      physical symptoms. Even less research has been done looking at ways to help alleviate this
      psychological and physical distress. Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE) is an
      integrated psychosocial and early palliative care (symptom control) intervention designed to
      reduce psychological distress and physical symptom burden in patients newly diagnosed with
      acute leukemia. The EASE intervention provides i) tailored supportive psychotherapy (called
      EASE-psy) during the initial weeks of treatment to reduce symptoms of traumatic stress, and
      ii) symptom screening during the initial inpatient treatment period with triggered referral
      to early palliative care (symptom control) to help manage moderate to severe physical
      symptoms (called EASE-phys).

      A phase II trial of EASE in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia demonstrated
      feasibility and preliminary evidence that it reduces psychological distress and physical
      symptom severity compared to usual care. This new trial is a definitive phase III, multi-site
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of EASE at reducing psychological
      distress and physical burden.
