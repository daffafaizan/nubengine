      Decitabine and/or chemotherapy pre-transplantation could reduce the blast cells in bone
      marrow and improve the complete remission rate. However, decitabine and/or chemotherapy had
      side effects and might increase treatment-related mortality. At present, the necessity of
      chemotherapy pre-transplantation for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow
      blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the
      effects of chemotherapy and no chemotherapy pre-transplantation in patients with RAEB-1,
      REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT
      are evaluated.
