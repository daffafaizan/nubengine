      site institutional practice. The preparative regimen will depend upon the subject's
      underlying disease, previous therapy, and comorbidities. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of
      standard post-transplant immunosuppression, including tacrolimus (or cyclosporine) and
      methotrexate. Vorinostat will be administered at 30, 45 or 60 mg/m2 BID (100 mg/m2 BID
      maximum) PO from 10 days prior to transplant (day -10), until day +100 post-transplant (110
      total days of dosing).
