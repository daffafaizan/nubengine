      (EPS). Second generation antipsychotics were the choices for EPS intolerant schizophrenic
      patients. But which one of second generation antipsychotic was the better choice did not have
      definitive results. We compared risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with
      acute dystonia or parkinsonism side effects and observed the incidence of needing concomitant
      anticholinergic drugs. We also collected the data of average dose of risperidone and
      olanzapine to help the dosing strategy guidelines for EPS intolerant schizophrenic patients.

      Method: This randomized, rater-blind, parallel group, flexible dose study enrolled patients
      from Taoyuan Mental Hospital from July 2000 to July 2003. Schizophrenia (DSM-IV) patients who
      met the research criteria of neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism research
      criteria of DSM-IV and greater than moderate severity (>4) of global impression of
      extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS). 70 patients were random assignment to
      risperidone or olanzapine for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to compare the incidence of
      concomitant anticholinergic drugs.
