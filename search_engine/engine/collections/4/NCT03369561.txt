      Venous Congestion, tricuspid regurgitation, And potential inhibitory effect on left
      ventricular function The most important mechanism is venous congestion, a manifestation of
      sodium avidity and fluid expansion, as Directly increasing renal venous pressure causes
      sodium retention, lowers urinary output, and decreases glomerular filtration and widely
      thought to explain AKI Venous pressure is directly associated with renal dysfunction,
      independently of ventricular function, and admission peripheral edema is associated with
      greater risk of AKI. Such awareness of a primary role of renal venous congestion reshapes our
      understanding of renal function as not simply a reflection of arterial perfusion, but rather
      a balance between arterial supply and venous drainage.
