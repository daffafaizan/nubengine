      hepatitis C: non-response to well followed prior treatment with pegylated Interferon and
      Ribavirin, infection with HCV genotype 4, and the presence of cirrhosis (in less than 50% of
      the included patients) that could diminish the chances of SVR to a standard bitherapy.

      The likelihood of SVR with standard bitherapy in this study population is thus considered
      low, around 15%.

      The principal objective of this multicentric, national, single-arm, open-labeled,
      non-randomized phase II pilot study in 60 patients, is to assess the rate of SVR 12 weeks
      after 24 weeks of quadritherapy and to determine whether this rate is significantly greater
      than 20%.

      The proportion of patients presenting with cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver
      biopsy or with hepatic impulse elastometry â‰¥ 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all patients
      included.
