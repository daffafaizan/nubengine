      licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Specimens will then be
      collected by the nurse or medical assistant who will label each specimen separately.
      Specimens will be blinded so that the pathologist will not know which specimen was
      self-collected and which provider-collected. Specimens will then be sent to our clinical
      laboratory provider (LabCorp) for analysis. Once results from the Pap smears are received,
      participants will be notified in the usual manner in our clinical practice. Finally, analysis
      will be conducted to ascertain whether or not a self-administered (by the patient) Pap smear
      is as accurate as a traditional Pap smear administered by a healthcare provider.
