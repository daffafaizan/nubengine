      problem is the identification and early screening of these patients upon admission at the
      accident and emergency department for early tracking in geriatric network. This early
      assessment could allow a shorter waiting time, a better orientation of patients and a
      decrease in the number of re-hospitalization.

      There are many screening process for fragility tests but there seem to be nonspecifically.
      The advantage of TRST is its simplicity and speed of filling.

      In 2015, Duc et al. have found that TRST may be a screening instrument for elderly subject
      and is going to require geriatric mobile team (GMT) for evaluation. Unfortunately, the
      threshold may be too sensitive and GMT solicitation is too high.
