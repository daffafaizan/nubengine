    
      This is an exploratory study of healthy children and adults who are given either standard
      trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).
      There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race. Following confirmation of written
      informed consent, baseline blood samples will be drawn from all study participants prior to
      immunization. The volunteers enrolled in any the three groups (A,B,C) cannot have been
      immunized with previous year's seasonal influenza vaccine. The identical twins in Groups A
      will be randomized to each receive a different vaccine (TIV or LAIV) than their twin. The
      non-twin children in Group B will also be randomly assigned to receive either TIV or LAIV.
      Non-twin elderly adults in Group C will be given standard TIV. All participants will receive
      a single dose of their assigned influenza vaccine, either by intramuscular (IM) injection
      (TIV) or intranasal application (LAIV).
