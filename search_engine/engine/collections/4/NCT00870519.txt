    
      The overall research questions to be addressed by this protocol are as follows:

        -  To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of (123I) MNI-168, a potential imaging
           biomarker for Î²-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT) in Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and similarly aged and gender matched
           healthy controls.

        -  To perform blood metabolite characterization of (123I) MNI-168 in healthy and AD
           subjects to determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of
           (123I) MNI-168 as a single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent.

        -  To acquire initial safety data following injection of (123I) MNI-168.

        -  Obtain test/retest reproducibility information in AD subjects with (123I) MNI-168 based
           on initial studies.
