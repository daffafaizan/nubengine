        -  The raters in group one reviewed the CT examinations numbered from one to 60 using LCD
           monitor and reviewed the remaining CT examinations numbered from 61 to 120 using iPhone
           with TeamViewer at their first visit

        -  The other group firstly reviewed the CT scans numbered from one to 60 using iPhone with
           TeamViewer and 61 to 120 with the LCD monitor.

        -  They visited twice with an interval of four weeks and reviewed the CT scans using
           revered devices at each session.

        -  The raters were instructed to rate the likelihood of the presence or absence of
           appendicitis in each case using a five-Likert scale (1 = obvious no appendicitis, 2 =
           unlikely appendicitis, 3 = unsure, 4 = likely appendicitis, 5 = obvious appendicitis).
