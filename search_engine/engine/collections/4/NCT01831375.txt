      the efficacy of the "Speak Up" intervention (N=200) relative to an attention control group
      "Connect" program (N=200), aimed at enhancing social and civic engagement. Participants will
      now obtain resource materials that include decision aids and diary logs to bring to visits
      with doctors. The investigators will implement "Speak Up" and "Connect" programs in two
      unique study populations: 1) participants in the ongoing NCI study and 2) older adults
      attending senior center programs sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Participants
      will be assessed prior to the intervention and 2 month, and 12 months post intervention. The
      investigators will have an observation window of 12 months to determine whether and when the
      older adult obtained screening. The selection of a shorter follow-up time frame will help
      reduce attrition.
