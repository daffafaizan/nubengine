      chronic stroke patients with motor deficits. After informed consent and recruitment, patients
      will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied
      during performance of bimanual activities and/or motor learning. A few
      minutes/hours/days/weeks after completing one trial's arm, the patients will enter the other
      trial's arm (double-blind cross-over design).

      Baseline and follow-up outcomes about bimanual and unimanual motor tasks will be collected.

      For a subset of subjects, motor learning and data acquisition will be performed with a
      neuro-rehabilitation robot (REA2PLAN, AXINESIS, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) .
