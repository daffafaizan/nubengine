      coronary vasoreactivity and myocardial mechanics, as indicators of subclinical cardiovascular
      disease in patients with psoriatic disease and intermediate-high CV risk. Impaired coronary
      flow reserve (CFR) is a measure of coronary vasoreactivity and a manifestation of myocardial
      ischemia which may precede clinical CV events (and visible changes in plaque morphology) in
      high-risk patients with psoriatic disease. From previous studies, it is known that
      traditional risk factors underestimate cardiovascular risk in psoriatic disease.
      Tildrakizumab, a p19 inhibitor which blocks IL-23 and Th17 mediated inflammation, is an FDA
      approved therapy for moderate-severe psoriasis and has been shown to reduce inflammation.
      Furthermore, IL-17 is associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. The
      central hypothesis is that reducing systemic inflammation using tildrakizumab will
      quantitatively improve myocardial blood flow and CFR as measured by PET over 6 months; and
      this improvement in coronary vasoreactivity, endothelial function, and tissue perfusion may
      have beneficial effects on myocardial mechanics, left ventricular function and, ultimately,
      symptoms and prognosis.

      This is a single-arm open-label mechanistic clinical study in adult subjects with
      moderate-severe psoriasis and increased cardiovascular risk. We plan to enroll approximately
      35 patients to receive Tildrakizumab over 6 months. The study will consist of 4-5 visits
      including a virtual or in person screening visit, a baseline visit in which baseline imaging
      tests will be conducted and study drug will be dispensed, two in person visits for which
      study drug will be given and monitoring of AE events and compliance, and a final visit in
      visit in which imaging tests will be repeated
