      We hypothesize that: 1) Gains in proximal arm function (shoulder, elbow) immediately after
      robotic training will be greater than after dose-matched conventional therapy; 2) Unlike in
      previous studies, gains in hand function immediately after robotic training will be greater
      than after dose-matched conventional therapy.

      Methodology:

      In the first year of the study, we will develop a robotic system with the ability to assist
      hand movement. Since many stroke survivors in the subacute and chronic recovery stages have
      residual ability to flex the fingers but severely limited finger extension, we will build a
      hand exoskeleton that can apply precise extension forces to the digits of the hand. This
      exoskeleton will be integrated with the ARMin III arm exoskeleton so that tasks such as arm
      reach, grasp of an object and release of the object can be trained. In the last 2 years of
      the project, we will perform a pilot clinical trial comparing this new training paradigm to
      dose-matched conventional therapy in chronic stroke survivors. Outcome measures will be taken
      before training and immediately after training.
