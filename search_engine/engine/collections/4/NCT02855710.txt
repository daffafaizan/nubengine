      (metronom or music) when someone is walking. It is known to improve gait in pathologies such
      as Parkinson's disease. It has also an effect on general timing abilities (e.g. tapping the
      beat of the music). This project aims at assessing the opposite relation, namely the effect
      of a training of the general timing abilities on gait in Parkinson's disease. Timing
      rehabilitation will be done by the means of a serious game. Serious games are more and more
      used to improve the compliance and the efficacy of reeducaiton programs. Overal, we propose
      to test a low-cost tool for rehabilitation.
