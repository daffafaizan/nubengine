      progression, as well as those who may benefit beyond the expected outcomes of current
      anti-retroviral therapies. Despite unapproved status, APV may prove highly efficacious in
      combatting HIV progression and may help those in need, prior to regulatory approval.

      Patients are stratified into one of the following treatment options:

      Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive:

      Option 1- APV / ABC / PI / NNRTI / +nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(s) (NRTI)
      Option 2- APV / ABC / NNRTI / NRTI(s)

      NNRTI-Experienced Patients:

      Option 1- APV / ABC / PI / +NRTI(s) Option 2- APV / ABC / +NRTI(s) To assess clinical
      efficacy, lab values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, plasma HIV-1 viral load
      determination and CD4+ cell count measurements) are collected at pre-entry and every 12 weeks
      thereafter.
