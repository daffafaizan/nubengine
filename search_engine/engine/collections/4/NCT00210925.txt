      medical, psychological, and social interventions. The main goals of alcohol-dependence
      treatment are to assist patients in avoiding alcohol, developing better strategies for
      managing stress, and improving self-esteem and quality of life. Studies have demonstrated
      that treatments for alcohol use disorders can be effective, but their effectiveness is often
      limited. Although the optimal goal of treatment should be total abstinence, even patients who
      are unable to achieve this goal may still benefit from treatments leading to a reduction in
      drinking. Medications are commonly used in other addictive disorders, such as nicotine and
      opioid dependence, suggesting that this intervention could be useful in the treatment of
      alcohol dependence. This is a randomized, double-blind, flexible dose study to determine if
      topiramate, a prescription medication approved by the Food & Drug Administration for the
      treatment of epilepsy and the prevention of migraine, administered at a dose of 300mg per day
      or the subject's maximum tolerated dose, is safe and effective compared with placebo in
      patients with alcohol dependence. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be more
      effective than placebo in reducing the percentage of heavy drinking days (5 or more standard
      drinks per day for men and 4 or more standard drinks per day for women) in patients with
      alcohol dependence. The patients will receive topiramate tablets (25mg and/or 100mg) or
      matching placebo. Study medication is taken in increasing doses starting at 25 mg/day up to
      300 mg per day (or maximum tolerated dose) during the first 6 weeks and the achieved dose is
      maintained for an additional 8 weeks.
