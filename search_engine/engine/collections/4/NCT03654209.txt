      and treatment length. Injection fluid use and clipping will also be recorded in addition to

      All randomized subjects will receive a 30-day post procedure follow-up phone call and be
      scheduled, as per the standard of care, to receive a standard follow-up colonoscopy procedure
      after the initial procedure. The investigators will measure the rate of recurrence by
      endoscopic visualization of the EMR site at the first follow-up using endoscopic
      magnification and electronic chromoendoscopy, as well as systematic biopsy of the scars.
