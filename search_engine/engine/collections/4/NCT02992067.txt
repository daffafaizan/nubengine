      ultrasound of axillary lymph nodes metastasis in breast cancer were verified by the data of
      specimen bank; to establish the evaluation system of predicting the lymph node status based
      on CK19 and CEUS, validate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive
      predictive value and ROC curve of the system model and use Youden index, negative likelihood
      ratio, positive likelihood ratio to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency.
