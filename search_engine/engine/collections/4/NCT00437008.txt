      sugars with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Diet has been recognized as an important
      exogenous source of AGEs. There is evidence for the implication of AGEs in the pathogenesis
      of diabetes-related complications, atherosclerosis, ageing processes or AlzheimerÂ´s disease.
      Although, only little information exists about their effects in humans. The hypotheses of
      this study are that a high-AGE meal leads to a more important acute vascular dysfunction
      comparing to a low-AGE meal, and that a 1050mg/day Benfotiamine therapy for 3 days has a
      protective effect on the endothelial function.

      Twenty-one people with type 2 diabetes shall be investigated in a randomized, single-blinded
      (investigator), cross-over design (please compare design description).
