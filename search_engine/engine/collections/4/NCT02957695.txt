      functions like attention, concentration, planning, impulse control and emotional stability.
      In this study the investigators would like to test, whether neurofeedback as a non-medication
      option can help to improve these cognitive functions. Neurofeedback is a method for
      optimization and stabilization of the brain activity. The brain continuously gets
      computer-based information about its state. This information is used by the brain for
      self-regulation. Because neurofeedback is a process based on learning, the positive effects
      can be integrated into the daily life and seem to persist also after the training stopped.
      From the literature, several studies have shown promising results of neurofeedback therapy in
      patients with brain injuries, but no study so far fulfills the scientific criteria which
      proves a benefit. Methods: The selection of potential study participants is made by the
      senior or chief physician. Totally, we include 20 patients with a newly acquired frontal
      brain lesion. 10 patients receive normal neurofeedback training and 10 patients receive a
      placebo-neurofeedback in a randomized, double blinded manner. In total, 20 neurofeedback
      sessions are conducted. At the beginning, after 10 sessions and at the end of the
      intervention time, a neuropsychological assessment is performed to test the main cognitive
      functions of the frontal brain. Data analysis: The performance in the neuropsychological
      testing is the primary outcome. We expect that all participants will gain performance during
      the course of the study due to natural brain recovery, so that we will focus on the
      difference of the improvements between the two groups (neurofeedback and placebo-group).
