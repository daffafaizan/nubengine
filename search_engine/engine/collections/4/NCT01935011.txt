      PD patients with STN DBS. Swallowing dysfunction is often difficult to treat
      pharmacologically and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study hence
      would have significant clinical implications in the management of swallowing dysfunction in
      these PD patients with STN DBS and could potentially decrease their morbidity and mortality.

      The investigators expect that the traditionally high frequency stimulation of 130 Hz would
      worsen while the low frequency stimulation of 60 Hz would improve the swallowing function in
