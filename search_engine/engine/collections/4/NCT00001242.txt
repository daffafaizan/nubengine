      hormone (PTH) will be admitted for diagnosis, treatment review with suggestions for
      modifications to the current or new treatment and for inclusion in other protocols. These
      states include hypocalcemia, rickets, osteomalacia, pseudohypoparathyroidism. Resistance to a
      factor is manifested by deficient bioeffect despite high levels of the factor in blood.
      Patients will be tested with multiple indices of mineral metabolism to establish the
      diagnosis and examine the spectrum of the underlying disorder. The principal therapies will
      be combinations of calcium, phosphate, and a vitamin D analog. Selected patients will have
      localization and surgery to remove a tumor that causes renal wasting of phosphate. Patients
      will also be considered for entry into other research protocols.
