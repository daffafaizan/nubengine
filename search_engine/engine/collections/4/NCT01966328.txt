      vitreomacular adhesion. The investigators propose that intravitreal injection of ResolvineÂ®
      36% will: 1)Result in release of the vitreous adhesion to the macula in subjects with
      symptomatic vitreomacular attachment (VMA). 2)The Release of the VMA will create a measurable
      and favorable retinal change. 3) The release of vitreomacular traction may also result in
      visual acuity improvement within the short time frame of this study.
