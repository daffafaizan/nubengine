      Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Ubon Ratchathani, Chonburi, and Songkhla. The research team of TRCARC
      will collect and analyze secondary and de-identified data from the hospitals' databases. In
      each site, clients who agree to receive Same-Day ART service will go through standard of care
      procedures at each hospital, which include: post-test counseling and psychosocial support,
      baseline lab test, clinical screening, and physical examination. The drug regimen prescribed
      for clients will mirror the first line ART regimen in Thailand's national guideline, which is
      tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and efavirenz (EFV). Retention of the clients will
      reflect that of the hospital's protocol, and CD4 and viral load will be tested according to
      the national guideline.
