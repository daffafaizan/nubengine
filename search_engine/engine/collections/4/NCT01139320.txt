        -  To analyze candidate-coding polymorphisms in CD33 of DNA samples from children with
           newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin on
           COG-AAML03P1.

        -  To determine the association between these polymorphisms and clinical response of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for candidate polymorphisms in CD33 by PCR-based
      sequencing.
