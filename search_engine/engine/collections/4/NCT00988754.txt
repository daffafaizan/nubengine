      regular exercise, such as improved cardiovascular fitness, skeletal health and prevention of
      overweight and obesity. The children obtained weekly health education lessons from their
      teachers to increase the physical activity in and outside of school and to improve health
      behavior (healthy food, no drugs) as well as the general well-being of children.

      Monthly training for teachers and regular training (2-3x/year) for the parents complete the
      intervention.
