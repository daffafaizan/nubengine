    
      Study Groups:

      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This
      is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other
      group.

        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will receive spine radiosurgery in a single large
           dose.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, they will receive spine radiosurgery over 3 smaller doses,
           which is standard.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant may continue taking part in the study as the doctor thinks it is in their best
      interest. Participant will no longer be able to take part if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after participant's last follow-up visit.

      Radiosurgery:

      Participant will have spine radiosurgery in either 1 or 3 treatments as described above.

      Participant will sign a separate consent for the surgery that explains the procedure and the
      risks.

      Study Visits:

      After surgery, at Months 3,6,9,12,18, and 24 and then every 6 months after that:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam (tests to check the
           functioning of their nerves, including tests of their strength and sensation.

        -  Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the beginning of the
           study.

        -  Participant will have an MRI.

      This is an investigational study. Delivering spine radiosurgery in a single large dose rather
      than over three smaller doses is considered investigational.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
