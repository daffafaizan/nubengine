    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor response rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma to topical halofuginone (halofuginone hydrobromide) versus vehicle control.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical halofuginone and vehicle in patients
      with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of topical halofuginone to inhibit expression of matrix
      metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) and Collagen type I in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      II. To explore the relationship between baseline cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 and CD8
      counts, HIV viral load and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) viral load and response to
      halofuginone.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of halofuginone.

      OUTLINE: Twelve treatable Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are selected on each patient, and these 12
      lesions are randomized equally to 1 of 2 treatment arms (6 lesions receive study treatment
      and 6 lesions receive placebo); each patient serves as his/her own control.

      ARM I: Patients apply topical halofuginone hydrobromide ointment to each of 6 lesions twice a
      day for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients apply topical placebo ointment to each of 6 lesions twice a day for 12
      weeks.

      Patients with stable or responding disease in either or both groups of treated lesions
      (halofuginone hydrobromide ointment or placebo ointment) may receive open-label treatment
      with topical halofuginone hydrobromide ointment to all 12 lesions for an additional 12 weeks
      as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 1 month.
