      AGB101 low dose of levetiracetam extended release formulation, in healthy adults with the
      Apolipoprotein e4 gene (APOE 4) can reduce abnormal hippocampal network activity. The
      investigators also want to study whether this low dose of LEV can improve memory function.

      Generic levetiracetam is a type of drug called an anti-epileptic or anti-seizure medication.
      It is FDA approved worldwide for adults and children as young as one month with seizures. It
      is a generic drug used in long-term epilepsy treatment. It is relatively safe and has an
      acceptable side-effect profile.

      AGB101 has been developed as a novel extended release formulation of low dose levetiracetam
      (below clinically marketed doses for epilepsy) for slowing the progression of amnestic mild
      cognitive impairment.

      It is known that age and the APOE 4 gene are important risk factors for late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease. Further studies have shown that cognitively normal, older adults with
      the APOE 4 gene have more hyperfunctional brain network activity, increased alpha beta
      accumulation, decreased memory function, and decreased brain volume, which is consistent with
      Alzheimer's disease patterns.
