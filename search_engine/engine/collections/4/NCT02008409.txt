      laparoscopic surgery has become the preferred approach for a number of intra-abdominal
      procedures such as cholecystectomy, gastric bypass, etc.[1] One of the key components of
      laparoscopic surgery, of any surgery for that matter, is the ability to achieve and maintain
      adequate visualization of the surgical target throughout the procedure. During certain MIS
      procedures the patient's internal organs, such as the liver, can block or obscure the
      surgical view. A number of surgical instruments (retractors) have been developed to help
      retract abdominal organs "out of the way" during MIS procedures, but all of these devices
      require an additional abdominal wall puncture/incision to adequately position the device.

      Virtual Ports, Ltd. has developed a new laparoscopic liver retractor device, the EndoLift
      Liver Retractor. This new device does not require additional skin incisions and is placed
      internally (inside the abdomen) during laparoscopic surgery. The device has 2 ends that
      "grab" tissue. The body of the device is a smooth, cylindrical steel bar that has minimal
      risk of traumatizing tissues/organs. The ends of the device are positioned on to peritoneal
      surfaces (e.g., anterior abdominal wall and/or the right crus of the diaphragm) and the body
      of the device (smooth cylindrical bar) "pushes" the liver away from the surgical field.
