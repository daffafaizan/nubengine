    
      This will be an open-label study to determine the safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics of CPX-POM in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent, untreated or
      intravesical treatment completed >6 months before the current diagnosis, resectable tumors.
      Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled and treated with 900 mg/m2 CPX-POM administered IV
      over 20 minutes once per day for 5 days followed by TURBT on Day 5 after the fifth dose.
      TURBT will be performed 2 to 6 hours following drug administration on Day 5.

      Pretreatment bladder tumor tissues will be obtained at the time of in-office cystoscopy by
      cold cup biopsy within 4 weeks of TURBT. Posttreatment bladder tumor tissues will be obtained
      at TURBT. Bladder tumor tissues will undergo pathological evaluation at each site.

      Prior to administration of the first CPX-POM dose on Day 1, pre-dose blood (plasma) and urine
      (clean catch) samples will be collected. At the time of TURBT on Day 5, one 3-mL blood
      (plasma) sample and a urine specimen will be collected for measurement of CPX-POM
      concentrations.

      Patients will be followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of CPX-POM for safety
