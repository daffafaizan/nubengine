      intervention for anxiety and/or depression, as recommended by the United Kingdom's National
      Institute for Clinical Excellence's pathways framework (http://pathways.nice.org.uk/).

      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an emerging therapy that has been shown to help
      patients with mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression in therapist-led individual and
      group treatments. However, few studies have shown how effective ACT is in the form of a
      low-intensity, guided self-help intervention.

      This study seeks to find out whether an ACT-based manual, sent to patients with anxiety
      and/or depression, increases their ability to effectively manage their difficulties and
      improve their quality of life. Participants on a primary care mental health waiting list will
      be invited to take part in this study.

      Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: the ACT intervention
      or waiting list as usual. Participants receiving the ACT intervention will be posted a manual
      and will be asked to read a chapter each week for six weeks. A member of the research team
      will also phone them on two occasions to support their use of the manual, trouble shoot any
      difficulties and provide encouragement. All participants will be asked to complete nine,
      short questionnaires sent through the post prior to and after six weeks of self-help.

      By comparing the results the study will demonstrate whether the ACT intervention is effective
      compared to wait list as usual.
