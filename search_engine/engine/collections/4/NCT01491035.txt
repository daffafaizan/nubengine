      diagnosed with depressive or anxiety disorders of two age populations; children aged 7-11
      years and adolescents of the age 12-17 years. It is an open study to allow pharmacokinetic
      (PK) sampling of all patients and four dose levels will be tested. Following lower initial
      doses for 2 to 6 days, the patients will be treated once daily at the assigned dose levels
      for 14 days, and it is expected that patients may benefit from treatment during this period.
      As the treatment duration is not sufficient according to treatment guidelines, if judged or
      indicated by the investigator, the patients are offered to continue in an extension treatment
      of up to six months to allow possibility for therapeutic satisfaction.

      Preferably, the cohorts will be dosed in the following order: AC1, AC2, CC1, AC3, CC2, AC4,
      CC3, and CC4. An external data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established to evaluate
      safety, tolerability and preliminary PK data from the dosed cohort(s) prior to any dosing of
      subsequent cohort (s). The dose regimen may be adjusted based on the recommendation of the
      DSMB. Adolescents will be exposed to a certain dose of vortioxetine before children receive
      the same dose.
