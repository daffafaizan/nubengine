    
      Between July 2016 and December 2017, 670 consecutive patients older than 18 years who are
      scheduled to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at the Anhui Provincial Hospital will be
      recruited for the study. Patients were randomized using opaque, sealed envelopes containing
      random numbers assigning them to undergo a spray of epinephrine (epinephrine group) or saline
      (control group) on the major papilla. A two proportion equality test will be conducted to
      explore whether incidence rates are different. Descriptive statistics including number (N),
      mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, will be produced for all continuous
      variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and percentage of subjects will be produced for all
      categorical variables.
