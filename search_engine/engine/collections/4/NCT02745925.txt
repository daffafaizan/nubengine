      and recycling of iron (through macrophages) is reduced. The extent to which non-heme iron is
      absorbed from the diet is influenced by the composition of the diet. Ascorbic acid is a
      potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption. It's mechanism of action is luminal reduction of
      dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to more soluble ferrous iron (Fe2+). A study in the inestigator's
      laboratory showed that the enhancing effect of ascorbic acid on non-heme iron absorption is
      reduced in overweight and obese individuals. Possible explanations for this fact are the
      different sites of action of ascorbic acid and serum hepcidin on the enterocytes in dietary
      iron absorption. Increased hepcidin reduces iron efflux into the circulation at the
      basolateral membrane of the enterocyte. Therefore the improved iron transport into
      enterocytes through ascorbic acid at the luminal side (via the divalent metal transporter
      (DMT)-1), by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+ seems to be less successful. To improve iron absorption in
      obese subjects, an intervention at the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte would be
      needed.
