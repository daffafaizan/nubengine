      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of topical bexarotene 1% (weight by weight
      [w/w]) gel for evaluation in healthy women. (Dose Escalation Group) II. Conduct an
      intervention of topical 1% bexarotene gel to an unaffected breast of healthy women at high
      risk for breast cancer for 4 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined during
      the dose escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue.
      (Dose Expansion Group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To detect bexarotene concentration in the serum at baseline and at 4 weeks of treatment.

      II. To detect bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue at 4 weeks of treatment in the
      dose escalation group.

      III. To investigate the effects of topical bexarotene on serum biomarkers, we will determine
      the change from baseline in i) lipid biomarkers (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low
      density lipoprotein [LDL], high density lipoprotein [HDL]), ii) thyroid function biomarkers
      (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], T4, T3), iii) calcium.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine changes in gene expression associated with retinoid action. (Dose Expansion
      Group)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Group 1 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 4 weeks;
      Group 2 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week
      and then daily for 3 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an acceptable range; Group
      3 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week, then
      daily for 1 week, and then 20mg daily for 2 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an
      acceptable range.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
