      delivery of the ED-SAFE intervention components with strong fidelity and with responsiveness
      to the conditions and barriers present in most EDs. This will include an integrated approach
      to delivering components usually completed during the ED visit, such as personalized safety
      planning, as well as those completed after the visit, such as coaching to foster mental
      health treatment engagement. This R34 addresses both patient and implementation outcomes.

      Aim 1 will use persona development, an innovative human computer interaction approach, to
      ensure the TASCS is intimately informed by end users.

      Aim 2 will optimize the TASCS in a small field test in the ED.

      Aim 3, modeled after a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation design, will gather data on
      usability, acceptability, and implementation of the TASCS ED App using a randomized
      experiment (n=45) of three modalities: (1) On site (n=15), (2) Telehealth (n=15), and (3)
      Self-administered (n=15). For 3 months post-discharge, all participants will receive coaching
      calls, facilitated by the Post-ED Clinician App, and will have access to the Post-ED Patient
      and Family App. The intervention is intended to decrease suicidal ideation and behavior by
      improving perceived social support, increasing behavioral activation, and improving
      suicide-related impulse control.

      Building a comprehensive suite of integrated enabling technologies to address ED-SAFE
      translation barriers will not only improve ED-SAFE intervention adoption, it will provide a
      road map for how to do the same for other suicide interventions, both existing and those yet
      to be developed, maximizing impact on the field.
