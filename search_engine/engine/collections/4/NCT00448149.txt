      is estimated that over 35, 000 people in the United States will be diagnosed and
      approximately 12, 000 have died from this disease in 2005. Renal cell carcinoma presently
      ranks tenth as the leading cause of cancer death and constitutes 3% of all solid neoplasms.

      In contrast to many other malignancies, treatment for RCC is limited. Treatment remains a
      highly difficult and perplexing challenge due to its resistance to both chemotherapy and
      hormone therapy and limited response to cytokines. Despite recent advances in our fundamental
      knowledge of RCC biology and development of molecular therapeutics, more clinical research
      will be required to best guide our use of these exciting new agents in combination regimens.

      The combination of RAD001 and NexavarÂ®, in current clinical trials with minimal toxicity,
      represents a treatment regimen which should be investigated for tolerance and toxicity as
      well as initial phase II efficacy. The study is designed to evaluate the MTD. Following the
      completion of the phase I, utilizing the MTD, Phase II study is designed to evaluate the
      anti-tumor activity.
