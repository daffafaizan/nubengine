      villages, 4,000 residents, and are served by a single primary school. Eighty kebeles will be
      randomized to one of four arms: 1) annual mass azithromycin distribution per WHO guidelines
      (Annual); 2) annual mass azithromycin distribution plus quarterly targeted treatment of all
      children aged 0-9 years (Core Group-Age); 3) annual mass azithromycin distribution plus
      quarterly targeted treatment of all children aged 0-9 years with a positive chlamydial PCR
      test (Core Group-PCR); or 4) annual mass azithromycin distribution plus quarterly targeted
      treatment of all children aged 0-9 years positive for conjunctival inflammation as assessed
      from annual photography (Core Group-TI). The primary outcome for the trial will be the ocular
      chlamydia prevalence at 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary outcomes will include bacterial load
      of ocular chlamydia via quantitative PCR, the prevalence of clinically active trachoma
      assessed at 12, 24, and 36 months, and serology via dried blood spot at baseline and 36
      months.
