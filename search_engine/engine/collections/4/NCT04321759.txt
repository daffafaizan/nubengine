      improvements than SST in both the primary outcome: community functioning (SAS, QLS), and the
      secondary outcomes of neuro- and social cognition (BACS and MSCEIT) and social skills (SSPA).
      . For study Aim 1,the investigators hypothesized that CET will be associated with greater
      improvements than SST in both the primary outcome: community functioning (SAS, QLS), and the
      secondary outcomes of neuro- and social cognition (NIH Toolbox and MSCEIT) and social skills
      (SSPA). Aim 2: The investigators will explore differential effectiveness of the two
      interventions by baseline cognitive functioning and age. For Aim 2, the investigators
      hypothesize that patients with less impairment in cognitive functioning at baseline will
      demonstrate relatively larger treatment gains in SST compared to those in CET than those who
      are initially more cognitively impaired, and that younger patients will benefit more from CET
      compared to those in SST than those who are older. The results of this study will address a
      key knowledge gap in the field and a decisional dilemma for clinicians.
