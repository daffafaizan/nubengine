      of the wrist and elbow, that may occur after stroke when a person is doing something
      effortful such as walking.

      The objectives are:

        -  To provide an insight into the learning strategies used by physiotherapists during the
           re-education of walking, including the verbal dialogue that takes place and any
           preferences (overt or subconscious) adopted for one type of learning strategy.

        -  To develop and refine a description of what is meant by the term "gait re-education"

        -  To provide an insight into how therapists currently manage associated reactions

      This phase of the study will explore these objectives using direct non-participation
      observation of a number of physiotherapy treatment sessions. This will provide an insight
      into the nature of the therapy that takes place for retraining walking(e.g. the types of
      exercises commonly used) and the nature of the learning strategies frequently adopted,
      including the amount and content of explicit verbal instruction and feedback that is provided
      to patients.
