      standard and is controversy. Glutamate NMDA-receptors may mediate the effects of long term
      alcohol related depression and thus the NMDA-receptor modulator memantine could have effects
      on it.

      depression of alcoholics and compare the efficacy of escitalopram and memantine in co-morbid
      depression of alcoholism.

      Design and setting Double-blind, randomized, naturalistic study, 26-week trial on alcohol
      dependent outpatients.
