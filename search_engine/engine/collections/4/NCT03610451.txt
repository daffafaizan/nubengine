      input by systematically attenuating signals from the visual, auditory, thermal, tactile,
      vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. Previous research has shown that this heightens
      interoceptive awareness and reduces anxiety in clinically anxious populations. Anorexia
      nervosa (AN) is characterized by elevated anxiety, distorted body image, and disrupted
      interoception, raising the question of whether floatation therapy might positively impact
      these symptoms. A recent safety study found that Floatation-REST was well tolerated by
      individuals weight-restored outpatients with current or prior AN. Additionally, participants
      reported improvements in affective state and body image disturbance following floating,
      raising the possibility that this intervention might be investigated for clinical benefit in
      more acutely ill cases.

      The primary aim of this study is to begin to examine the effect of Floatation-REST on body
      image disturbance in inpatients with AN. Secondary aims including determining whether
      Floatation-REST has an impact on anxiety, emotional distress, eating disorder severity,
      functional ability, and interoception.
