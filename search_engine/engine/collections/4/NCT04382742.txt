      A sample size of 34 participants 17 male and 17 female of aged between 20-40 years with
      class-I obesity were selected and recruited in this study. All the participants were
      initially screened using a physical activity and readiness questionnaire to determine if they
      are fit to perform exercises afterwards intervention based on dynamic exercises were given to
      the patient for 12 weeks based on the guidelines of American College of Sports Medicine and
      the quantification of exercises was done using a Frequency, Intensity, Time and Type (FITT)
      protocol. The training session was based on Warm up 5 to 10 minutes followed by conditioning
      phase of 20 minutes and a cool down phase of 5 to 10 minutes. The detailed description of
      each of the phase is as under:

      Warm up Phase Dynamic light aerobic warm up exercises were performed by the participants for
      5 to 10 minutes before the start of the conditioning. Two different exercises that were
      performed included i) High Knee in which the knees will be lifted as high as possible in such
      a manner that both feet should be at one time be above the ground ii) Jumping Jack Exercise
      in which a simultaneous movement of upper and lower limb will be performed in a manner that
      every time during a jump the arms were thrusted over the head while the foot moved out to the
      side and than returning back to the original position 10 repetitions of both the exercises
      were performed.

      Dynamic Resistance Exercise Modified Wingate protocol that incorporates 20 minutes of
      training on a cycle ergometer; included one minute of cycling with resistance to be performed
      at 85% to 90% of Maximal Heart Rate (MHR) followed by one minute of cycling with no
      resistance. The protocol will be performed for 10 times for a duration of 20 minute of
      workout.

      Cool Down The process of cool down last for 5-10 minutes. During this low intensity, long
      hold stretching were performed of lower limb and upper limb that included shoulder, calf and
      hamstring stretch
