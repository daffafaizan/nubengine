      (OLV) for thoracic surgery. Continuous positive airway pressure or positive end-expiratory
      pressure are usually applied to improve this disorder including hypoxia, but these methods
      are not enough. The inverse-ratio ventilation (IRV), which prolongs the inspiratory time
      greater than expiratory time, can be applied for adult respiratory distress syndrome. The
      effect of IRV is to improve gas-exchange status by increasing mean airway pressure and
      alveolar recruitment. The application of IRV during OLV has not been performed to our
      knowledge, and there is a possibility of IRV to improve oxygenation during OLV. There is a
      possibility of increase of auto-PEEP, or air trapping in subjects with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, but this kind of auto-PEEP can be overcome by external PEEP. Therefore, we
      tried to evaluate the effect of IRV during OLV with lung protective strategy.
