      abandoned for the assessment of intravascular volume status because of its unreliability. The
      static preload indices have been replaced with dynamic preload indices, such as stroke volume
      variation or pulse pressure variation because the dynamic preload indices reliably predict
      fluid responsiveness and perform better than the static preload indices. However, the
      periodic component of central venous pressure, which goes with cardiac cycles, has not been
      investigated. The power corresponding to heart rate from spectral analysis of central venous
      pressure waveform represents the extent of the dynamic fluctuation of central venous pressure
      and is assumed to reflect intravascular volume status. It is hypothesized that the spectral
      power of central venous pressure corresponding to heart rate represents intravascular volume
      status.
