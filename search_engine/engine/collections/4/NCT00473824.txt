    
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading single cause of liver transplantation (LT)
      in the US and Europe. Recurrence of HCV infection following LT is almost universal. There is
      currently no effective way to prevent post-transplantation HCV infection of the liver graft
      and related progression of HCV-related liver disease. This study is designed to evaluate a
      polyclonal human hepatitis C immune globulin (Civacir) given during and post liver
      transplantation for preventing or reducing the impact of recurrent HCV infection.

      In this open-label trial, 2 subjects will be randomized to receive Civacir (standard of care
      treatment plus Civacir) for every 1 Control subject (standard of care treatment alone).
      Civacir recipients will receive 18 intravenous infusions over 24 weeks beginning at the time
      of liver transplantation.

      Viral loads, liver enzyme assessments and liver biopsy assessments will be made at scheduled
      intervals during the study which will last for 48 weeks.
