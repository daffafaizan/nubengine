      will switch smokers from their usual brand to VLN cigarettes. Periodically during the study
      the investigators will collect blood and measure nicotine exposure and also other biomarkers
      to see what effect switching has. The participants will also use a diary to record number of
      cigarettes smoked. Cigarette butts will also be collected.
