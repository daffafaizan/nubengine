the influence of methemoglobinemia on the lethality of some toxicanions, 1. azide .the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced byintraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have beencharacterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) isachieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline morerapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemiaafford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodiumazide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was notpossible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death fromfluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although someprolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation ofthe azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intactmouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identifiedin vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that theprotective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to dateonly against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase .
