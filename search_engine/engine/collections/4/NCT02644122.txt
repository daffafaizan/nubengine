      treat patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. SF1126 is a conjugate that contains two
      components: SF1101 (the active drug) and SF1174 (an inactive tetrapeptide RGD targeting
      moiety)

      Both components of SF1126 play key roles in the activity of the drug. SF1101 is a selective
      inhibitor of certain members of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI-3) family and SF1174
      binds selectively to receptors known to be present on neovasculature supporting tumors and on
      some tumor cells themselves. These components result in a drug designed to be both selective
      in its activity and targeted in its delivery.

      This is an open label Phase II study of SF1126 in adult patients with recurrent or refractory
      advanced SCCHN with PIK3CA mutation. Treatment cycles (28 days) will consist of SF1126 1110
      mg/m2 administered intravenously (IV) twice per week (separated by at least three days) for
      the first four cycles and then once weekly for subsequent cycles.
