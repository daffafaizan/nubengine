      symptomatic bradycardia and AV block, a pacemaker with modes such as VVR and DDDR designed
      for pacing only when the pulse decreases can be implanted. At the same time, pacemakers can
      be implanted in VR-ICD, DR-ICD modes, which have the ability to recognize fatal rhythm
      problems such as Ventricular tachycardia (VT) / Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and perform
      intracardiac defibrillation (ICD).

      Pacemakers are positioned by opening a pocket under the patient's left pectoral muscle.Cables
      coming out of the battery (leads) are placed in the right ventricle, right atrium or coronary
      sinuses via active or passive fixation through the left subclavian vein. In the early period
      after pacemaker implantation, patients are warned to avoid movements that force the extremity
      on that side so that the leads and battery are affected by extremity movements and their
      positions and functions are not impaired.

      Many pacemaker patients prolong this period too much (> 3 months), causing them to develop
      left extremity muscle-joint dysfunction. This situation can also affect the functional
      capacity of the patients.ICD pacemakers are larger in size than conventional pacemakers due
      to their functions, so they are placed in a larger pocket in the pectoral area.These patients
      are warned more strictly about coercive movements.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of arm ergometer endurance training on
      functional capacity and upper extremity function in heart failure patients with ICD included
      in cardiac rehabilitation program, and to examine the effect on battery and leads as safety
      parameters.
