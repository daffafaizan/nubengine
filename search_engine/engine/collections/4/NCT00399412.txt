      populations together with signals from 4 non-standard surface positions when these patients
      attend the outpatient department for follow-up. The non-standard electrode positions mimic
      the positions of the subcutaneous electrodes of the subcutaneous implantable defibrillator
      (S-ICD) system in development by Cameron Health.

      The collection of these signals will allow bench testing of the algorithms proposed for the
      S-ICD system. Additionally, it will allow a comparison of the response of different
      defibrillators to these same signals to asses how each would treat a particular rhythm.
