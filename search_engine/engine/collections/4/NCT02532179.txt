    
      The primary objective of the study is to assess if treatment with mouse subcutaneous
      immunotherapy (SCIT), using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, is safe. This will be
      done by determining the rate of related adverse events and serious adverse events in the
      course of treatment.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce a 3-fold increase in mouse-specific serum
           immunoglobulin E (IgE)

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce changes in the serum levels of mouse-specific
           immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin subclass 4 (IgG4).
