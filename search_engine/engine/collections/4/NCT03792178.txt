      total-etch adhesive system were evaluated; there was no statistically significant difference
      between the two composite types after 1 day, 1 week as well as 1 month.

      When the two adhesive systems were compared using Bulk Fill composite & incremental Nano
      resin composite there was no statistically significant difference between the two adhesive
      systems after 1 day, 1 week as well as 1 month.

      Using Bulk Fill composite with self-etch adhesive; there was a statistically significant
      decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week. There were no cases with
      hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as 1 month. Using Bulk Fill composite with Total etch
      adhesive; there was a statistically significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity
      after 1 week as well as from 1 week to 1 month.

      Using Incremental Nano resin composite with self-etch adhesive; there was a statistically
      significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as from 1 week to
      1 month. Using Incremental Nano resin composite with Total etch adhesive; there was a
      statistically significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as
      from 1 week to 1 month.
