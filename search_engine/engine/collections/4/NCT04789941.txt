      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ib2-III include primary surgery, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT). In many countries, CCRT is accepted as
      the standard therapy for such tumors. However, each of these therapies has both advantages
      and disadvantages, however, more recently it has been given using neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      with intravenous irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) and cisplatin. DNA topoisomerases are
      enzymes that regulate and control DNA topology. Topoisomerase 1 catalyzes the transient
      cutting of a single DNA strand, the passage of another DNA strand through the break and then
      resealing of the DNA break. Camptothecin (CPT), an antitumor alkaloid isolated from
      Camptotheca acuminata, interferes with DNA topoisomerase 1 function. Cisplatin
      (cis-dichlorodiammineplatinums II) is a first generation platinum compound. Platinum-based
      NACT followed by radical hysterectomy has been proposed as an alternative approach to
      radiotherapy or CCRT in locally advanced cervical cancer, especially of squamous cell
      histology, with objective response rates ranging from 69.4% to 90.2%, pathological optimal
      response rates ranging from 21.3% to 48.3%, 5-year disease free survival (DFS) rates ranging
      from 55.4% to 71% and 5-year overall survival(OS) rates ranging from 58.9% to 81%,
      respectively.
