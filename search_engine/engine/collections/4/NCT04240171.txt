    
      Method and proposal steps:

        1. Approval will be obtained from Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Pharmacy,
           Damanhour University.

        2. All participant agreed to take part in this clinical study and provide informed consent.

        3. 60 Patients with type 2 DM will be enrolled Internal Medicine Department, Tanta
           University Hospital.

        4. Serum samples will be collected for measuring the biomarkers.

        5. All enrolled 60 patients will be mentioned as two groups; Group 1(n=30): are the
           patients who are prescribed dapagliflozin to control their blood sugar level. Group 2
           (n=30): are the patients who are prescribed glimepiride

        6. All patients will be followed up during 3 months' period.

        7. At the end of 3 months, step 4 will be repeated.

        8. Statistical tests appropriate to the study design will be conducted to evaluate the
           significance of the results.

        9. Measuring outcomes: the primary outcome is the change from baseline to post-treatment
           insulin sensitivity reflected by change of serum level of measured marker after 3
           months.

       10. Results, discussion, conclusion, and recommendations will be given.

      Methodology:

        1. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) 2 hrs. post prandial blood glucose(2hPPBG) will be measured
           by glucometer.

        2. HbA1c %, Fasting plasma insulin (FPI), Interleukin-34 (IL-34), and extracellular domain
           of insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAPe) will be assayed by Enzyme-Linked
           Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).

        3. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated.
