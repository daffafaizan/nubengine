    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-06873600 administered as a
      single agent in sequential dose levels and then in combination with endocrine therapy. In
      Part 1A and Part 1C, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      PF-06873600 and then in dose finding (Part 1B) with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine
      therapy (ET). This study contains 2 parts, dose escalation with single agent (Part 1A and 1C)
      and then dose finding with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part 1B)
      followed by dose expansion arms of PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part
      2).
