      Hernia repair is the most frequent operation in general surgery worldwide, but about 25 years
      after the advent of minimal invasive surgical techniques the effectiveness of laparoscopic
      inguinal hernia repair still remains unclear.

      Methods:

      All patients admitted to the hospital for surgery of an inguinal hernia during a one year
      period were prospectively documented and included in a follow-up study. The follow-up was
      performed at least 5 years after surgery and consisted of a clinical examination, ultrasound
      investigation and a questionnaire.
