    
      In this phase II trial, the previously described IL-2 schedule (daily IL-2 for 5 days (per
      week) every 3 weeks) will be tested in a larger cohort of patients with melanoma to attempt
      to determine the response rate, median duration of response, and median survival. The dose
      intensity of this schedule would allow a patient treated on this regimen to achieve the
      target threshold (> 1440 million IU/m2/year).
