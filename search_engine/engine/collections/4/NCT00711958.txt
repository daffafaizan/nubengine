      ERYPO) in a 2:1 ratio. Patients received double-blind treatment for a period of 12 weeks.
      Following randomization the patients were treated subcutaneously with a dose of 150 IU/kg
      body weight of study drug three times per week. Dose adjustments to 300 IU/kg body weight
      three times per week were to be done if hemoglobin (Hb) increased <1.0 g/dL or the
      reticulocyte count increased <40,000 /Î¼l after 4 weeks or if Hb increased <2.0 g/dL after 8
      weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was the Hb response in the EPO HEXAL group during
      weeks 5-12 of the study defined as absolute increase in Hb value of 2.0 g/dL from the mean
      value of the screening/baseline period in the absence of red blood cell transfusion during
      the preceding 4 weeks. For that purpose, Hb levels were measured at the weekly study visits
      by a central laboratory. Further parameters of treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability
      were recorded.
