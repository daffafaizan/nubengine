      will commence concurrently with chemotherapy. All patients will be treated to a minimum of 48
      Gy in 20 daily fractions over 4 weeks [2.4 Gy per fraction (fx)], to the planning target
      volume (PTV) defined by pre chemotherapy CT with PET imaging. This is approximately
      biologically equivalent to a dose of 54 Gy in 27# (5 fractions/week). A differential boosting
      will then be selected from one of 5 dose escalation schemes. The total individual
      radiotherapy dose will be prescribed according to the highest dose level that can satisfy all
      of the set radiotherapy planning constraints for the individual's anatomy. The trial will
      proceed in 2 phases. In the first phase only the first 3 dose escalation schedules will be
      used. Once all of these 3 schedules have been deemed safe then dose levels 4 and 5 will be
      opened up to participation.
