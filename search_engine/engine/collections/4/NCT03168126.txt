      Standard general anesthesia with intubation and administration of sufentanil, propofol and
      esmeron relaxant was performed in all patients undergoing primary free flap reconstruction in
      course of a head and neck tumor reconstruction. Hemodynamic monitoring measurement of cardiac
      index and the parameter stroke volume variation as surrogate for cardiac pre-load was
      performed using a Pro-AQT Monitor. Using an arterial catheter previously set by the Seldinger
      technique as part of the standard equipment, the mean, diastolic and systolic arterial
      pressure was measured as part of the standard monitoring as presented. This tube was
      previously deaerated and flushed with 2% NaCl and connected in series with a sensor, which
      passes over electric line signals to the Pro-AQT-Monitor®. Based on previously entered
      patient data and an analysis of the arterial pulse curve characteristics, a cardiac index
      (CI) start-value is determined by the system. The sampling of the arterial pressure
      characteristics is affected by a signal having a frequency of 250 Hz. The start value is the
      basis for the further determination of HI trend values. The arterial pulse contour is
      continuously tapped and analyzed and offset against the determined start value. To calculate
      the cardiac index, the PICCO®-pulse contour algorithm is applied. Every 12 seconds, a new
      measurement is performed and documented by the system.

      From the read logs ProAQT Monitor® the values of the CI, MAP, HR, stroke volume index (SVI),
      the stroke volume variation (SVV) and the systemic resistance index (SRI) were recorded at
      different measurement intervals throughout the operation. All parameters were evaluated for
      volume control in the course of the study.
