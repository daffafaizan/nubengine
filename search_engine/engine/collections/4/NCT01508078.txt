      a resource for recruitment of asthmatic subjects and healthy controls in clinical studies and
      clinical trials in the UCSF Airway Clinical Research Center. The UCSF Airway Clinical
      Research Center (ACRC) conducts multiple clinical research studies in asthma funded by the
      NIH, foundations, and industry. We have a broad range of research interests, but we have
      specific interests in mechanism-oriented clinical studies and specific expertise in
      biospecimen collection, biobanking, and biospecimen analysis. Our model is to have multiple
      studies recruiting simultaneously, and this means that we need well-organized recruitment and
      database systems.

      Additionally, we aim to characterize asthmatic subjects in multiple domains, including
      disease severity, airway inflammation subtypes, and mucus subtypes. Asthma is a heterogeneous
      disease in its clinical presentation and in its underlying cellular and molecular phenotypes.
      To explore cellular and molecular phenotypes of asthma, we will analyze induced sputum for
      cell types and gene expression, with a focus on Th2 inflammation pathways and innate and
      adaptive immune cells that drive Th2 inflammation. Detailed cellular analysis of sputum is
      possible but requires that multiple sputum samples be collected for processing in multiple
      different ways, including by cytocentrifugation, FACS analysis, and by formalin fixation and
      paraffin embedding of sputum cell pellets. We are also studying mucus phenotypes of asthma
      using methods of rheology, which needs to be done on fresh sputum.
