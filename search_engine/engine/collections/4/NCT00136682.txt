      of intraoperative and postoperative thoracic patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA)
      compared to postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative
      recovery parameters, such as time to potential discharge and resumption of intestinal
      function after major open gynecologic surgery. The population included in this study will be
      women undergoing a laparotomy for major abdominal or pelvic surgery by the gynecology
      service. There will be a total of 240 women recruited for this study, with an accrual rate of
      5 to 10 patients per month. This study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial.
      Subjects will be randomized to either general anesthesia with postoperative intravenous
      patient controlled analgesia (control group) or general anesthesia with intraoperative
      thoracic epidural anesthesia and postoperative thoracic patient-controlled epidural analgesia
      (treatment group). This study will not be blinded because of the ethical issues with placing
      a "sham" epidural catheter in half of the study participants. These patients will be followed
      prospectively and relevant postoperative parameters will be measured in both groups and
      compared. This study will address the potential benefits of epidural analgesia on multiple
      measurements of postoperative recovery. This study will address the potential benefits of
      epidural analgesia on multiple measurements of postoperative recovery. The primary outcome of
      interest in this study is pain at rest and when coughing. The secondary outcome is the time
      to potential discharge.
