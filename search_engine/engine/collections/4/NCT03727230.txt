      commonly regarded as RhD negative (D-). In the East and Southeast Asian populations, 9-30% D-
      individuals are "Asia type" DEL. Nowadays, "Asia type" DEL patients are conventionally
      transfused with D- RBC, which are difficult to organize based on the rarity of D- donors in
      our regions (0.3%).

      However, our previous study demonstrated that "Asia type" DEL pregnant women with D+ fetus
      did not develop alloanti-D during the pregnancy. Latter, this phenomenon was confirmed by
      different medical centers in China. Accordingly, "Asia type" DEL patients may also not be
      able to produce alloanti-D after transfusion with D+ RBC and consequently the use of D- RBC
      for the transfusion management of these patients may superfluous. However, this hypothesis
      needs to be carefully proved.

      In this study, we were able to verify this assumption. From October 2016 to October 2019,
      blood samples from 1264 Chinese patients with a primary D- phenotype from the hospitals in
      China were typed for "Asia type" DEL blood group in the Guangzhou Blood Center. DEL
      phenotyping was performed by the serological adsorption/elution antibody testing and
      genotyping for the "Asia type" DEL specific allele (RHD*1227A) using a new developed
      high-resolution melting (HRM) approach. Then, transfusions of D+ RBC were prepared for the
      cohort of "Asia type" DEL patients. After "Asia type" DEL patients received D+ blood
      transfusion, the follow-up antibody screening test was conducted to evaluate the alloanti-D
      immunization.
