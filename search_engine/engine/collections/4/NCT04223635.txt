    
      Pexidartinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently approved in the
      US for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT)
      associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement
      with surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      pexidartinib after a single oral dose of 200 mg in participants with moderate hepatic
      impairment (HI) as defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group
      (NCI-ODWG) criteria compared to the healthy controls participants with normal hepatic
      function.
