      hand surgery. Patients who require operative treatment of hand and wrist fractures are
      randomly assigned to a group that receives a postoperative phone call or the control group
      that receives the standard postoperative care. Patient reported and medical outcomes are
      observed starting at 1 month postoperatively.
