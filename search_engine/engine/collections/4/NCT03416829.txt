      smartphone-based ambulatory voice biofeedback systems aimed at improving the carryover of
      newly established vocal behaviors into daily life. This first study will determine which of
      three types of ambulatory feedback results in better learning/retention (100% frequency, 25%
      frequency, or delayed summary feedback every 2 minutes of voicing) of a new vocal behavior
      (reduced vocal intensity) in three groups of 15 patients with vocal fold nodules. Hypothesis:
      Patients receiving lower frequency or summary feedback will produce lower initial performance
      but higher short- and long-term retention than patients receiving feedback 100% of the time.
