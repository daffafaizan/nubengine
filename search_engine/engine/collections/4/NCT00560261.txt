      diffusing capacity, using the NO-CO method, in children with SCD aged of at least 6 years. We
      will compare lung function and measurement of Qc and Dm in 2 groups of 120 subjects, one
      group of SCD children, and the other of normal children matched on age and ethnic origin.
      Measurement of lung capillary blood will be measured twice, to assess short term
      reproducibility. The measurement will be done in sitting position and lying down for one part
      of subjects, and at rest and during a moderate rectangular exercise for the other part of
      subjects. These different tests are designed to assess the physiological adaptation of
      pulmonary circulation in these two populations of children. Combined with complete lung
      function measurements, echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary hemodynamics, and
      measurement of exhaled nitric oxide, these evaluations will lead to a better understanding of
      pathophysiology of lung injury in SCD. The study will be completes at Robert Debr√© Hospital,
      in close collaboration with Sickle Cell Disease Center and Physiology Department. Children
      will be included after informed consent signed, as legally prescribed.
