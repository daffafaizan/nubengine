      high amount of coliform bacteria is present in the small bowel and results in premature
      anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates before reaching the colon. Commonly recognized causes
      include gastric achlorhydria (i.e. due to longstanding proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use),
      post-surgical bowel stasis, and gastrointestinal motility disorders leading to bowel stasis.
      Although SIBO is commonly suspected, a major limitation in the field is the lack of a highly
      accurate test for SIBO. The current gold standard relies on the demonstration of an early
      rise in breath hydrogen concentration in response to an orally ingested carbohydrate
      (commonly, lactulose) but its accuracy is about 50%. This may be because it is a one-time
      snapshot with an artificial substrate. Further, it has to be performed in a clinic, takes up
      to 5 hours and is relatively expensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      utility of a portable medical device called AIRE, which is a validated and commercially
      available handheld breathalyzer that measures hydrogen content in the breath and connects via
      Bluetooth to an associated smartphone application to provide immediate results and visual
      feedback after use. H2 concentrations determined by the AIRE device showed significant
      correlation with those measured by LHBT. The AIRE device therefore provides an alternative
      way to measure exhaled H2 that has the potential for addressing many of the limitations of
      the standard breath test.
