    
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by the presence of motor symptoms, but in recent years
      there has been increasing recognition of non-motor manifestations, including anxiety,
      depression, and cognitive symptoms. In addition, PD medications have been shown to cause
      impulse control disorders, cognitive changes, and non-motor withdrawal symptoms (dopamine
      agonist withdrawal syndrome) when they are discontinued. The goals of this study are to test
      the hypothesis that the presence of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are associated with
      greater self-perceived disability (out of proportion to objective deficits), increased
      utilization of healthcare resources, and decreased quality of life. In addition, we will
      examine the clinical correlates of these psychiatric symptoms. To test these hypotheses, we
      will screen PD patients for anxiety, depression, impulse control disorders, and dopamine
      agonist withdrawal syndrome, and compare cases and controls with regard to demographic
      characteristics, motor features of PD, disability, healthcare utilization, and quality of
      life.
