    
      In the first part of this trial different diagnostic techniques to detect arrythmogenic
      substrates of atrial fibrillation will be tested. If suitable parameters can be identified, a
      follow up trial to identify patients at risk for AF will be conducted before a stroke
      happens.

      Parameters tested are

        1. Electrophysiological differences between patients with paroxysmal AF and no history of
           AF

        2. "Vascular Stiffness" detected by an iPhone app

      All patients will undergo a cardiogoniometrie and a pulse wave analysis with an iPhone. Each
      exam takes 5 minutes.
