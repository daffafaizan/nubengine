      patients, hospitalizations, and economic costs. The etiology of heart failure is coronary
      artery disease in approximately two-thirds of cases, and the majority of these patients have
      experienced prior myocardial infarction. As a consequence of the myocardial infarction, the
      ventricle undergoes changes in volume and shape, a process referred to as "ventricular
      remodeling". As the left ventricle enlarges, global systolic function worsens, resulting in
      heart failure. There are a number of treatment options available to minimize symptoms and
      somewhat slow disease progression. Unfortunately, even with best conventional drug and device
      therapies, heart failure patients continue to have high morbidity and mortality rates. The
      experimental therapy investigated in this study uses a surgical device which employs
      radiofrequency energy to heat epicardial tissue. The application of heat to a myocardial
      infarction scar causes it to shrink in size, and correspondingly reduces ventricular volume.
      The volume reduction may "reverse remodel" the enlarged and dysfunctioning left ventricle to
      a more normal size and shape. The intent of this clinical study is to evaluate whether
      radiofrequency heating of the myocardial infarct scar is safe, and determine if the resulting
      ventricular volume reduction translates into improved clinical and functional outcomes in
      patients suffering from ischemic heart failure.
