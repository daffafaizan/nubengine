      relatively unexplored area of clinical research. In particular, the effectiveness of adjunct
      sedatives such as diphenhydramine and promethazine during ERCP/EUS procedures has not been
      studied. Achieving a moderate sedation level may be ideal for ERCP/EUS procedures in order to
      provide adequate patient comfort, amnesia, and completion of intended endoscopic procedures.
      The relevance of further studies in this area is apparent. In terms of clinical practice;
      over-sedation can lead to decreased airway protection, longer post-procedural recovery times,
      and unnecessary drug cost; under-sedation can lead to patient anxiety, agitation, recall, and
      longer procedural time.
