      in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE). Approximately 80 participants (20 healthy
      participants and 60 patients with LE) will be enrolled. This will include 30 with Discoid
      Lupus Erythematosus/Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (DLE/SCLE) without Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE), and 30 with DLE/SCLE with SLE. All patients with LE will continue to be
      managed by their personal physicians per their standard-of-care. Study participants will
      undergo interventional procedures that include collection of urine, blood samples and skin
      biopsy. There will be a single sample collection timepoint for healthy participants and two
      sample collection timepoints for LE patients, separated by approximately 12 weeks. A blood
      sample for genomic analysis will be collected for research purposes from patients who provide
      consent and where local regulations permit. The data obtained in this study will be used in
      the evaluation of new therapies for lupus and may help in developing new treatments. Safety
      evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and physical examinations. The total duration of study participation will be
      approximately 11 days for healthy participants and 95 days for patients with LE.
