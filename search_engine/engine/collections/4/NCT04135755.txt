      group), and young adults (NY group). The Biodex balance system was employed to calculate the
      balance score and the LOS of participants. An inertia motion system was used to record
      kinematic data. The center of pressure (COP) signals of postural stability and LOS were used
      to calculate the frequency power spectrum for interpreting the sensory component.
