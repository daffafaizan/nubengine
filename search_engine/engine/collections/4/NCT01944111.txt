      banding versus standard adjustable gastric banding. All enrolled patients will choose to
      either standard (control group) banding or plication (study group) banding. Each patient will
      complete a standardized survey rating their satisfaction from surgery, their satiety levels
      and Green Zone Patient Questionnaire at each visit.
