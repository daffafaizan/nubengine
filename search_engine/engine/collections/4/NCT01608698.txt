      The various type of progestins in OCP give various effects either benefit (non-contraceptive
      benefit) and side effect. These effects depend on pharmacological activity of each progestin.
      Many studies showed causes of discontinuation use of OCP, such as increase body
      weight,androgenic effect and vaginal spotting. OCP in combination of 30 mcg
      ethinylestradiol/2 mg chlormadinone acetate (Belara®) and 30 mcg ethinylestradiol/3 mg
      drospirenone (Yasmin®)are the common used in practice. The each type of progestin
      (chlormadinone and drospirenone) might effect different outcomes in women especially in body
      weight change during use. Chlormadinone is a C-21 progestin which has glucocorticoid and
      antiandrogenic effect. Drospirenone is a progestin in spironolactone derivative which has
      antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic effect. Both progestins might has less effect in
      body weight change and provide other non-contraceptive benefits. So investigator want to
      study the different effects from these progestin in two type of OCP. The result from this
      study could give information to choose the proper OCP for each reproductive woman.
