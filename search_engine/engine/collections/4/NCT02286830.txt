      be treated with zoledronic acid monthly. At year 2 they will be randomized to A continue
      treatment for 2 more years or B stop treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be time
      to progressive bone disease from year 2 and onward.

      Serum bone markers will be measured throughout the study. In patients who experience
      progressive bone disease, development of bone markers prior to the radiological progression
      will be investigated to see the if it could have been predicted with the use of serum markers

      During the four year period patients will have low-dose CT superior and conventional
      radiography made at predefined time points. The secondary outcome of the study is to compare
      the sensitivity of the two modalities
