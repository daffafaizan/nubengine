      inexpensive treatment option, carpal tunnel release provides fertile ground for testing
      whether societal costs can influence patient decision-making in hand surgery. Such work would
      inform future efforts to reduce societal healthcare costs by elucidating whether appeals to
      societal cost are effective at driving stewardship of limited healthcare resources at the
      patient level. In this study, the investigators aimed to answer this question by presenting
      participants with a hypothetical scenario in which the participants had to choose between
      surgery and wrist bracing for carpal tunnel syndrome. Participants were randomized into two
      cohorts and societal cost information was presented to the intervention group. The effect of
      societal cost information on treatment choice is assessed, along with participants'
      healthcare attitudes.
