      intensive care unit of China Medical University Hospital. After diagnosis by surgeon, these
      patients will be assigned to receive the conventional drug alone or the conventional drug
      combined electroacupuncture treatment. All participants receive intravenous injection the
      conventional drug, Metoclopramide, every 12 hours in the trial. Electroacupuncture, twice
      daily for three days, is administered 48-72 hours after abdominal surgery. Visual analogue
      scale, feeding volume, gastric residual volume and assessment of adverse events will be done
      for every visit. Laboratory biochemistry analysis and other assessments including Visual
      Analogue Scale, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and Sequential Organ
      Failure Assessment score will be completed at baseline and the end of intervention(3 days
      after initation of the intervention). Physiological and operative severity scores for the
      enumeration of mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) score will be done at the baseline.
      Instrumental examinations including heart rate variability and traditional Chinese medicine
      four examinations will be given before and after intervention. We expect that the efficacy of
      combined electroacupuncture with conventional drug is superior to conventional drug only in
      alleviation of gastrointestinal distension or/and improvement of motility in patients who
      underwent abdominal surgery. Moreover, we will further speculate the mechanism by analyzing
      laboratory data.
