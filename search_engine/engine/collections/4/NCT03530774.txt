      strength, and physical function in older adults with low muscle mass or function. Older
      adults will be recruited from San Antonio, Texas, the least food secure metropolitan area for
      older adults. The project will be conducted entirely at community locations such as
      congregate meal sites, senior activity centers, and housing communities. Researchers will
      conduct recruitment, distribution of supplements and pre and post assessments entirely at
      these sites, which will alleviate the travel of participants to research sites and provide a
      unique opportunity to assess this underserved population. One hundred older adults (â‰¥60yrs
      old) will be randomly assigned to consume a daily supplement of egg white protein or
      isoenergetic carbohydrate for 6 months. Changes in skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and
      physical function will be assessed.
