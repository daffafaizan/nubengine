    
      Following a formative phase I, we propose in phase II to implement a three-group
      cluster-randomized study to test the effectiveness of short message service (SMS) reminders
      and notifications, [mobile health or mhealth] (group 1) and the combined effectiveness of SMS
      reminders/notifications and cash transfers (group 2) compared to the standard prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (of HIV)/maternal, neonatal and child health, (PMTCT/MNCH)
      practices (group 3).
