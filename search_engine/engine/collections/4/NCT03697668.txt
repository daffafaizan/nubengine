      the Greater Mekong Region as a delayed parasite clearance following a standard treatment by
      artemisinin combined therapy (ACT). Artemisinin resistance is often accompanied by the
      resistance to the partner drugs such as piperaquine (PPQ), mefloquine (MEF), amodiaquine (AQ)
      and lumefantrine (LF).

      The slow and incomplete clearance of parasites following ACT treatment is considered to
      permit the selection of resistant parasites.

      The availability of new, more efficient treatments accelerating the clearance of parasites is
      therefore needed to counteract the selection of ART resistant strains.

      Imatinib (IMA) has been demonstrated to increase the efficacy of ART in a synergic fashion.
      This positive effect is further potentiated by low concentrations of PPQ.

      IMA is active both on the intra-erythrocyte asexual forms and on gametocytes. It is therefore
      expected that the combination DHA-PPQ-IMA should lead to faster and radical clearance of the
      parasites, therefore reducing the frequency of healthy carriers and transmission.
