    
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      isolating the PVs with either the cryoballoon or a RF ablation technique with a ThermoCool
      catheter, a system which can be regarded as standard for ablation. In total 762 patients with
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been randomized for either radiofrequency (RF) or
      cryoballoon. With both techniques, PV isolation will be performed. Primary end point of the
      trial is the time to first recurrence of atrial arrhythmias or prescription of
      anti-arrhythmic drugs after a blanking period of three months. Treatment success will be
      evaluated by using weekly electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring (transtelephonic
      transmission/Tele-ECG) and using Holter electrocardiograms.
