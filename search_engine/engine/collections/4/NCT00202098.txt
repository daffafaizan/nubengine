      patients with ARDS. Patients will be mechanically ventilated with Variable Ventilation (3
      step with increased level of variability) and "traditional" CMV, for a total of 4 step. Each
      step lasts in 60 minutes. During this period we will record the gas exchange parameters and
      the mechanics of the respiratory system.
