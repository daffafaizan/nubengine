      using a standard ultrasound equipment and hand-held ultrasound (Trademark: VScan,
      Manufacturer: General Electric, USA). All images and video are blindly evaluated by a
      radiologist in order to establish the concordance in the interpretation of images between
      general practitioners and radiologist. Kappa index will be used to study the agreement on the
      presence or absence of AAA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to
      determine the factors that influence the presence of AAA.
