      a carbohydrate-based sports drink.

      Cohorts Women in early labor who have not received pain medication will be enrolled in the
      study. This will be called the 'unmedicated' group. A second cohort of women who have
      received an epidural in early labor will be enrolled and studied using identical methods.
      This will be the 'epidural' group.

      Study Intervention Subjects in each group will drink one of two drinks: water or sports
      drink. The changing volume in the stomach will be measured using ultrasound over the next 60
      minutes. Subjects will be asked their degree of hunger on a 10-centimeter visual analogue
      scale prior to drinking, and for the next two hours at regular intervals. Subjects will be
      free to consume as per obstetric protocols. The study will be finished once the patient
      consumes food or drink, feels hunger â‰¥4/10, or two hours after the sports drink.

      Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that water will empty faster than the sports drink. A
      second hypothesis is that women with epidural pain relief will have similar gastric halftimes
      as women without pain medications.
