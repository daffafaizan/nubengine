    
      the aim to compare the proportion of peripheral (blood) 4 BL cells but also 4-BL cells in
      cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) in MS compared to healthy controls and to other inflammatory
      neurological disease but also non inflammatory neurological disease.

      For all groups of patients and controls it will collect blood and CSF only once (at diagnosis
      time for patients).

      Blood collect from healthy controls will come from transfusion volunteers and we won't have
      CSF from them.

      For patients from the MS group, the blood collect will be sequential at diagnosis, 3, 6, 12
      and 24 months after during the follow up.

      In the blood and CSF we will evaluate:

        -  percentage of 4 BL cells. 4 BL cells are found using cytometric parameters

        -  capacity of 4 BL cells to induce inflammatory response in vitro: percentage of induced
           activated TCD8 proliferation after cell culture using extracellular and intracellular
           cytometric parameters
