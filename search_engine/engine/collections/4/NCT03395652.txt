      impact on delivery and pregnancy complications as well as on neonatal complications will be
      evaluated. From the first visit at maternal care center, the information on socioeconomical
      and maternal characteristics will be collected. During pregnancy, fetal growth will be
      estimated by ultrasound. Physical activity will be measured using free app for measuring
      steps that mothers make during pregnancy. Using logistic regression, the impact of physical
      activity on pregnancy outcomes will be evaluated.
