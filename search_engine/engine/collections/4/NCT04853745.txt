      air polishing on enamel and exposed root surface. Forty eight single root extracted teeth
      were included into the study. The teeth were divided into three groups, the crown and exposed
      root surface were air polished using three powders at instrumentation time of 5s,
      combinations of medium and maximum power and medium water settings, distance of 5mm and
      angulation of 60 degree. Samples were scanned in a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at
      baseline and then after powder treatment and the defect depth, defect volume,
      demineralization depth and mineral density values were estimated.
