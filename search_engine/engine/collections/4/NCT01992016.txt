      because prostate cancer cells do not take up glucose well so the signals are very weak. The
      ability of PET imaging to detect cancers requires that the cancer cells take up glucose into
      the cells. Different methods are being tested to see if we can improve the detection of
      prostate cancers using PET scans.

      Ranolazine is a drug that is already approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic chest pain
      in people with heart disease. Ranolazine has been studied in the laboratories at the
      University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus. Ranolazine has been added to prostate
      cancer cells and grown in petri dishes and in animals in the laboratory. It has been shown to
      increase the glucose uptake of prostate cancer cells. The goal of this study is to see if
      patients taking ranolazine will have better PET imaging of their prostate cancers.
