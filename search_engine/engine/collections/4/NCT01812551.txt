    
      The study included 2 phases.

      Phase 1 (1-year open-label observational study): following baseline evaluation, bone mass
      changes have been studied with a simple therapy of adequate calcium intake and 25-OH vitamin
      D supplements in all eligible subjects (N=171).

      Phase 2 (1-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study): the 128
      subjects showing an insufficient response to calcium + 25-OH vitamin D alone (bone mass
      increase <5%) at the end of Phase 1, were randomized into 2 groups and assigned to
      alendronate treatment (N=65) or placebo (N=63) (in addition to calcium and 25-OH vitamin D as
      during Phase 1).

      The study has been carried out by the Coordinator's Institution (Istituto Auxologico
      Italiano)in collaboration with most Regional Reference Centers for CF in Italy.
