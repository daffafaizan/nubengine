      yet not clear if one sealer is superior to other in terms of healing of apical periodontitis.

      Three different groups of sealers will be used- a zinc oxide based sealer, an epoxy resin
      based sealer and a bioactive silicone based sealer. Mature mandibular permanent molar with
      the diagnosis of apical periodontitis (as confirmed clinically & by periapical radiograph)
      will be chosen for the study. Primary non surgical root canal treatment will be performed.
      The sealer will be randomly selected just before obturation of root canals. The patient will
      be allotted to one of the three groups.

        -  Group I: Zinc oxide eugenol sealer group. The material will be mixed according to
           manufacturer instructions and applied to canals using a lentulospiral and the obturation
           will be performed.

        -  Group II: Epoxy resin based sealer group. The material will be mixed according to the
           manufacturer's instructions and obturation will be done.

        -  Group III: Bioactive silicone based sealer: The material will be used according to the
           manufacturer's instruction and obturation will be performed
