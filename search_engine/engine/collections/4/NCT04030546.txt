      There are drugs which may protect against cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines
      (renin-angiotensin inhibitors and beta blockers), but they are not tolerated due to
      hypotension. Ivabradine is heart rate lowering drug without effect on blood pressure which
      was approved for treatment of angina pectoris and heart failure. The aim of this study is to
      investigate protective effects of ivabradine in cancer patients undergoing
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

      Ivabradine selectively inhibits If currents in the sinus node and prolongs the duration of
      spontaneous depolarization. That controls the heart's contractions and regulates the heart
      rate. Additionally, ivabradine might preserve myocardial function and contractility without
      effect on blood pressure. Ivabradine was approved for symptomatic treatment of chronic stable
      angina pectoris and chronic heart failure.

      The aim of this study is to investigate protective effects of ivabradine in adult cancer
      patients undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
