      activities. Neutrophils are found in large numbers in HS. The expression of the inflammatory
      cytokines IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α were enhanced in lesional skin of HS patients.

      Prior studies have demonstrated improvement in HS with biologic medications such as the tumor
      necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab. Studies have shown conflicting data
      regarding the efficacy of etanercept for HS and success with anakinra.

      This is an initial pilot study of secukinumab for the purpose of studying how it may alter HS
      disease symptoms. This study is not intended to alter indications for drug use but may inform
      the design of an efficacy study that may alter FDA labeling changes in the future. There are
      limitations of this study that arise from it being a single-arm clinical trial with a small
      number of subjects. These limitations include the limited generalizability knowledge of this
      study due to the lack of an active comparator. However, the data obtained from this study
      will potentially be used to support the design of larger future randomized placebo controlled
      studies.
