    
      Background

      The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put healthcare systems under the extreme pressure, with
      intensive care units being faced with a previously unseen number of patients with severe
      respiratory failure requiring admission for endotracheal intubation and mechanical
      ventilation.

      Methods

      The study describes how the critical care resources adapted to the sudden surge of severe
      Covid-19 in the province of Madrid, which developed at the beginning of March 2020. The
      response consisted of a swift increase in ICU capacity and the relocation of patients. ICU
      beds were mounted outside the usual intensive care areas. Transfer of critically ill
      intubated patients with COVID-19 was managed in an instant messenger service group composed
      of representatives of 53 intensive care units and performed by the Madrid Emergency Medical
      Systems (EMS). The investigators will compare transferred with non-transferred patients
      matched for risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory complications.
