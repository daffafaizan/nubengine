      with exercise only in university students with chronic idiopathic neck pain.

      University students with chronic neck pain were randomly allocated to receive pain
      neuroscience education and exercise or exercise only and assessed at baseline, after the
      intervention and at 3 months follow up. Outcome variables were pain intensity (primary
      outcome), disability, fear of movement, catastrophizing, knowledge of pain neurophysiology,
      pressure pain thresholds and neck and scapular muscle endurance.
