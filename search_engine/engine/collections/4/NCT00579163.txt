      tubes of blood (approximately 20 cc) will be drawn from the patient, utilizing a sterile
      technique. The tubes will be rocked so as to mix the blood with the additive (EDTA) in the
      tubes. For saliva samples, approximately 2-4 ml of saliva will be collected in specialized
      Oragene DNA Self-Collection Kit tubes. The sample(s) may also be used to detect new genes or
      changes in genes that may tell us who is at risk for certain types of cancer and/or other
      diseases.
