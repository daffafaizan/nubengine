      the cervix is favorable, labor augmentation attempts are more likely to be successful.
      Augmentation is these women is traditionally undertaken with intravenous oxytocin and
      amniotomy, either alone or in combination.

      In our previous trial, it has been proven that the method of titrated oral misoprostol is
      associated with a lower incidence of uterine hyperstimulation and a lower cesarean delivery
      rate than vaginal misoprostol for labor induction in patients with unfavorable cervix.
      Because administering Misoprostol solution is easy and cost saving, it is worth to develop
      this novel method in labor augmentation.
