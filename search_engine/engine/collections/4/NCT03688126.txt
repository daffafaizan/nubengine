      intellectual challenges may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to protect brain
      health. The recent results of the population-based 2-year clinical trial, Finnish Geriatric
      Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), indicated that a
      multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training,
      social activities, and management of heart health risk factors protected cognitive function
      in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. As yet, there are no
      pharmacological treatment options that can rival this effect. Thus, there is an urgent need
      to expand this work to test the generalizability, adaptability and sustainability of its
      findings in diverse and global populations. This pivotal U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health
      through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) will test whether a similar
      2-year intensive lifestyle intervention, adapted to American culture and delivered within the
      community, can protect cognitive function in older adults in the U.S. who are at increased
      risk for cognitive decline and dementia. If successful, the results of this study will have
      large-scale implications for public policy regarding standard of clinical care and
      prescriptive practices for a fast-growing and vulnerable population of older adults.
