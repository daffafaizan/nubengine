      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of same day yttrium-90 radioembolization planning
      and treatment angiography.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the patient costs associated with same diagnostic and treatment compared when
      compared to the standard two session methodology.

      II. To determine the time required to perform the mandatory in-room technetium Tc-99m albumin
      aggregated (99mTc-MAA) imaging and the associated calculations for the lung shunt fraction
      and treatment 90Y-microsphere activity.

      III. To determine the time for delivery of the therapy 90Y-microsphere radioactivity to the
      angiography suite after the therapy written directive by the authorized user.

      OUTLINE:

      The first 2 patients enrolled receive standard of care diagnostic and treatment during 2
      visits for approximately 6 hours each within 2-4 weeks. During the first visit, patients
      undergo diagnostic angiography with embolization of potential hepatoenteric collaterals,
      receive technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated as a surrogate to the therapy microspheres via
      catheter, and undergo planar imaging. During the second visit, patients undergo a second
      angiography and receive yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres via arterial microcatheter. Patients
      then undergo single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT)
      Bremsstrahlung imaging.

      All subsequent patients enrolled undergo the same previously described diagnostic and
      treatment during 1 visit over about 8 hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
