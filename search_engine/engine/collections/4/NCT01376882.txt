      explore the behavioural effects of 2-weeks caffeine abstinence as well as establishing the
      role of abstinence in the effects of caffeine administration by administering caffeine or
      placebo to those in a state of chronic and acute abstinence. This research also aims to
      explore, in a subset of participants, the cerebral blood flow effects of caffeine abstinence
      and caffeine administration using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Cerebral blood flow will
      be measured both at rest and during performance of cognitive tasks.
