    
      Open-label, multi-center, controlled, randomized, parallel-group phase II trial in patients
      with metastatic esophagogastric cancer having received induction chemotherapy.

      Patients will be registered before or after application of a three-months induction
      chemotherapy . This 12-week induction therapy will consist of one of the following regimens:
      FLO/mod. Folfox-6, Cisplatin/5-FU, Cisplatin/S-1, FLOT, EOX/EOF or XP. Regarding dose
      adjustments, Investigators should refer to Section 6.3 and to the summary of product
      characteristics of the chemotherapeutical agents. Patients having finished the preplanned
      induction therapy without tumor progression (i.e. with complete remission (CR), partial
      remission (PR), stable disease (SD) or non-CR/non-PD in patients with non-measurable disease
      only according to RECIST Criteria Version 1.1) at week 12, being able to swallow capsules and
      having Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-1 will be randomized
      in a 2:1 ratio to receive Arm A or B.

      In Arm A patients will continue with S-1 de-escalation phase starting at week 13 until
      disease progression, toxicities requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, pregnancy,
      death or lost to follow up whichever occurs first. In patients with drug-related severe
      toxicity S-1 dose will be adjusted or study treatment will be terminated.

      In Arm B patients will continue to receive the same polychemotherapy as during induction
      therapy until tumor progression, toxicities requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent,
      pregnancy, death or loss to follow up whichever occurs first.
