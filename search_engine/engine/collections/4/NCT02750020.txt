      tobacco control. The surveys gathered information such as second hand smoking (SHS) exposure
      at home, in the workplace, and in various public places (e.g. bars/restaurants, door way of
      the buildings, streets, and bus stops), use of smoking cessation services, knowledge of
      smoking and quitting, and smoking prevalence; measured the impact of tobacco control policies
      such as tax increase in 2011 and 2014, expansion of smoke-free areas in 2009 and 2010, and
      pictorial health warnings on behavioral change of smokers and ex-smokers; collected the
      opinions on current policies such as smoke-free areas, pictorial health warnings and point of
      sale displays, and the opinions towards future policies such as tax increase, plain
      packaging, and tobacco endgame. The results of the three waves have been used by the Hong
      Kong Council On Smoking and Health (COSH) to advocate plain packaging, banning on point of
      sale displays, and increasing tobacco tax by 100% in the past 3 years.

      In order to collect further information on issues related to tobacco control which should be
      addressed in future tobacco control measures in Hong Kong, COSH commissioned School of Public
      Health, HKU to conduct a fourth wave of the survey (2015/16). The current survey sought to
      use the Hong Kong data to update information on the prevalence of SHS and active smoking and
      its health effects, use of E-cigarettes, awareness of smoking cessation services and to
      identify the level of public support for current and future tobacco control measures as well
      as estimating the impact of existing policies.
