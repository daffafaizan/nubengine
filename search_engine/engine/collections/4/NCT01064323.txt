      technique for preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and for treating venous stasis.

      Four categories of discoveries suggest that there may be potential of IPC to have global
      vascular benefits:

        1. IPC of the arms prevents DVT in legs;

        2. Nitric oxide released by vascular endothelial cells exerts protective effects on blood
           vessels;

        3. IPC increases nitric oxide availability locally in the lower extremity;

        4. Nitric oxide may be transported in blood and released at distant sites, particularly in
           a hypoxic setting. Therefore, we propose to test the effects of lower extremity IPC on
           global nitric oxide availability.

      We will enroll 4 categories of subjects.

      The first 3 categories will have only 1 hour of leg compression. Baseline cholesterol will be
      drawn for screening labs Brachial ultrasound and NO measurements will be done before and
      after 1 hr of IPC. No MRI will be done on these groups.

      Category 4 will have baseline labs and testing to include:

      Brachial ultrasound,NO measurements and MRI will be done before and after 4 weeks of daily
      IPC therapy.

      Category 1, 21-40 yrs healthy male or female

      Category 2, 50 yrs plus healthy males or females

      Category 3, 50 yrs plus aged matched controls with known heart disease

      Category 4, 50 yrs plus12 patients with coronary artery disease.
