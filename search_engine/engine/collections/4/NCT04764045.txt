      post-surgery pain has been shown in our pain clinic, all patients have persistent pain for
      more than 3 month and different sensory disturbances.

      Examinations with trigger point injections of local anesthetics have been used to determine
      the influence of peripheral changes and the significance of afferent input on persistent
      post-surgery neuropathic pain.

      In the present study the investigators will document the influence of cutaneous trigger point
      injections for both subjective pain experience and objective findings in the area such as
      allodynia, hyperalgesia and thermal sensitivity. The investigators expect reduction in
      spontaneous pain intensity and de-crease in peripheral sensory disturbances and will
      determine the significance of peripheral input in persistent neuropathic pain.

      The investigators aim to investigate whether injection of local anesthesia into trigger
      points compared with placebo (saline) injection will attenuate pain and normalize abnormal
      sensations, such as hyperalgesia and allodynia. The investigators believe this to be an
      important investigation to understand the mechanisms behind chronic post-surgery pain.
