      physical function. Older adults with symptomatic knee pain spend the majority of their waking
      hours engaging in sedentary behaviors. To reduce the risk of disability, improve quality of
      life, and prevent deterioration in physical function, it is imperative the investigators
      develop ways to reduce sedentary time. Smartphone ownership among older adults is increasing
      and may provide a scalable opportunity to disseminate a sedentary reduction intervention.
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate and compare changes in sedentary behavior and physical
      function between an mHealth sedentary reduction, mHealth intervention plus coaching, and
      delayed mHealth group. Sedentary behavior and physical function will be assessed at baseline,
      1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after randomization.
