      receive chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from coming back. Many women will also
      receive radiotherapy to the whole breast/chest area and the surrounding lymph glands (called
      regional radiotherapy). No one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need
      to receive regional radiotherapy. Some women may be getting regional radiotherapy who do not
      need it. These women may be exposed to the side effects of their treatment without benefit.
