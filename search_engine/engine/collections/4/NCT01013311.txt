      sarcoidosis involving the heart are at risk of sudden death related to ventricular
      arrythmias. However, we currently do not have a clinical test which can predict sudden
      cardiac death in these patients. While implantable cardioverter defibrillators(ICDs) can
      prevent sudden cardiac death in high risk patients, we do not know which patients will
      benefit from implantation of these devices. This clinical problem is important because we
      would like to identify patients at risk for sudden death who will benefit from ICD
      implantation. Additionally, we would like to avoid the risks to patients and financial
      expenses of inserting ICDs in patients who will not benefit from them.
