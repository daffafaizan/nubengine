      high immune compatibility, simple structure and easy access. In this study, microparticles
      released from erythrocytes are used as the carrier of chemotherapy drugs and effectively kill
      tumor cells in malignant ascites. These microparticles can easily reach the tumor site and
      bring the drug into tumor cells, which can overcome the two main problems in normal
      chemotherapy: damage to normal cells and drug resistance of tumor cells.
