    
      A stepped wedge cluster randomized study, with 8 clusters and 5 periods of 3 months each.
      Each cluster is composed of about ten general practitioners. The InPAct intervention will not
      be presented to the first patients recruited by each general practitioner, whereas it will be
      presented to all their last patients. The period of intervention introduction by each general
      practitioner will be randomized amongst the 5 periods.
