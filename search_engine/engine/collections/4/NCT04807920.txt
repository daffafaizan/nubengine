      surgery will be screened for bothersome overactive bladder symptoms. Those that qualify and
      choose to enroll will be randomized to receive either bladder BOTOX® or a placebo at the time
      of their surgery. Neither the patient nor the investigators will know if the patient receives
      BOTOX® or a placebo. Subjects will complete questionnaires and bladder diaries both before
      and after surgery to determine efficacy and patient satisfaction. Potential adverse events,
      such as urinary tract infections and urinary retention, will be monitored throughout the
      study.
