      A. To evaluate the relationship between the angle of flexion of the knee in DDPD and the
      average pressure throughout the heel area (Pmean).

      B. To evaluate the relationship between the angle of flexion of the knee in DDPD and the
      contact surface of the heel area (Stal) where the pressure is greater than 60 mm Hg.

      C. To evaluate the inter-operator concordance for the knee flexion angle measurement in DDPD
      via photos.

      D. To evaluate the inter-operator concordance for skin marks used to measure knee flexion
      angles in DDPD via photos (only one knee for 30 patients).

      E. To evaluate the inta-operator concordance (measures on 2 consecutive days) for skin marks
      used to measure knee flexion angles in DDPD via photos (for 30 patients).
