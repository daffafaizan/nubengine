      OMS302 in young children ages birth through three years undergoing unilateral cataract
      extraction. Administration of test irrigation solutions will take place in a double-masked
      fashion.

      Intraoperative pupil size will be determined by measurement of pupil diameter from still
      photos captured from video recordings of the procedure. Pupil diameter measurements will be
      performed immediately prior to the initial incision and at one-minute intervals until the end
      of the procedure (wound closure). Pain will be assessed by the Alder Hey Triage Pain Score.
