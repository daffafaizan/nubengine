      as constituent of bread on glycaemic response (GR) in healthy human volunteers. Glycaemic
      response will be measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of blood glucose after
      consumption of barley bread(s), and compared with AUC for white bread. Measurements will be
      done in line with recommendations. In line with recommendations ten healthy human volunteers
      will be tested to obtain a sufficient statistical power. GR measurement will be based on
      available carbohydrates. Amount of bread will be standardised to contain 50 g of available
      carbohydrates. Subjects will consume bread sample with 250 mL of water, within 10-15 minutes.
      Blood sampling times will be at 0 min (baseline sample), followed by 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and
      120 min after starting to eat the test meal. Glucose levels will be measured in capillary
      blood. For reference and test meals, the investigators will do at least 2 AUC measurements
      per subject. AUC calculation will be based on incremental AUC, ignoring area under the
      baseline. Comparison will be done as the mean of the individual ratios.

      The differences between the different products ingested will be analyzed with the statistical
      test of analysis of variance. In case of failure to find homogeneity in the variances the
      nonparametric ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis test, will be used. The results will be expressed as
      mean Â± standard deviation for each with a significance level of 0.05 for all the statistical
      tests.
