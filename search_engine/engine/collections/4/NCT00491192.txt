      brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage.Fever also represent an important issue occurring in
      78% of patients with acute cerebral damage admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). For those
      patients, normothermia is actually recommended in order to reduce secondary cerebral damage
      and to control intracranial pressure, that are known to worsen long term prognosis. Our
      primary endpoint is to maintain normothermia in patients with acute cerebral damage (axillary
      temperature < 38°C or internal temperature < 38,8°C) administering diclofenac. We will also
      investigate the corresponding behaviour of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion
      pressure.

      Comparison(s): We will compare two different doses of subcutaneous diclofenac (0,35 mg/kg -
      1/3 a vial - vs 0,5 mg/Kg - 1/2 vial) to continuous intravenous of 0,48 mg/kg diclofenac for
      12 hours.
