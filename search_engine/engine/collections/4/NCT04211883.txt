      adapted to suit workflow demands of a busy inner-city clinic: (1) identify patients who could
      most benefit from improvements in adherence to evidence-based preventive care, (2) use a
      validated mathematical model that was published in Annals of Internal Medicine to quantify
      and rank the estimated amount of health benefit that would arise from improved adherence to
      each USPSTF preventive care guideline, with estimates personalized based on that patient's
      risk factors and medical history, (3) communicate this information in a manner informed by
      risk communication studies relevant to patients from disparate cultural groups and with low
      literacy and numeracy, (4) engage the patient in a shared decision making process in which
      the patient identified which preventive health goals patient aimed to achieve, and (5) set
      particular action steps for the next visit that were congruent with these goals. The program
      supplements rather than substitutes for normally scheduled primary care visits, and is
      coordinated with these visits whenever possible.
