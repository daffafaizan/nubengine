    
      This is a prospective interventional randomized control trial. Infants born between 23+0 and
      32+6 estimated gestational age will be randomized using a computer generate allocation
      sequence stratified by gestational age. Randomization cards will be placed in opaque
      envelopes. For the intervention group, the care team will use the Panda iRes Warmer with
      ResusView Bed during resuscitation interventions in the first 10 minutes of life. During use
      of the iRes-warmer, standard nursing care of an infant on a radiant warmer will be followed.
      Participants assigned to the control group will receive interventions using the same model
      Panda bed without ResusView. There is no minimum time for monitoring, and the maximum time
      depends on clinical determination for use of heart rate feature for each resuscitation event.
      Data including the infant's gestational age, Electrocardiogram lead type and activities that
      occurred during resuscitation will be recorded for the first 10 minutes of life.
