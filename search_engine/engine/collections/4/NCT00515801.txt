      be monitored in 10 C-peptide positive and 10 C-Peptide negative patients with type 1 DM
      following the application of glibenclamide and placebo in a randomized, single-blind,
      cross-over study.

      Cognitive function during hypoglycemia with and without glibenclamide pretreatment will be a
      secondary outcome.
