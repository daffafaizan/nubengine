      resulting in declines in health and function. Objective: The purpose of this study was to
      perform a phase I feasibility study to understand if an integrated occupational therapy
      intervention could help people with chronic health conditions improve their adherence to
      medications. Method: Using a small-N design, we report single-subject analyses of the
      medication adherence, behavior counts, and perceptions of medication adherence of
      participants before and after either an occupational therapy intervention or standard of care
      intervention. We used a multiple baseline approach with inter-subject replication, and
      blinding.
