      their appearance in the mid-1970's. Since that time, there have been many improvements in the
      performance of these devices. Specifically, when making changes to the algorithms that
      control these devices, the goals are: to improve accuracy and precision in the blood pressure
      (BP) estimates, to reduce the time needed to determine the BP estimates, to increase comfort
      for the patient, and to work through artifacts and arrhythmias that are often present in the
      clinical environment.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate equivalency of the GE Healthcare B40 Patient
      Monitor noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) parameter compared to the reference device.
