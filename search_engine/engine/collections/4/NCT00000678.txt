      mortality and to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS or
      advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy, the effectiveness tends to diminish and patients
      progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. This may be due to
      the emergence of AZT resistant virus isolated from some patients who have been on long-term
      AZT therapy. These isolates were still sensitive to ddC. A study of long-term effectiveness
      of ddC in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have been on long-term AZT therapy is
      warranted because (1) ddC has antiviral activity, (2) there is no blood toxicity associated
      with taking ddC, and (3) the effectiveness of ddC in test tube studies does not seem to be
      diminished by decreased effectiveness of AZT.

      AMENDED: AZT will be administered orally every 4 or 5 hours. Patients in the second arm
      discontinue AZT and take ddC as two tablets every 8 hours. Duration of the study is 1 year
      with interim analysis done at 6 months after 75 percent enrollment and at end of the study.
      Original design: Patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have been receiving at least 500
      mg/day of AZT for at least 48 weeks are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients in the
      first treatment arm continue their current dose of AZT.
