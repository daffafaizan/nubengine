      laparoscopic surgery has been substantially performed worldwide. The creation of
      pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery, however, can have significant effects on the
      respiratory system including decreased respiratory system compliance, decreased vital
      capacity and functional residual capacity and atelectasis formation. These pathophysiologic
      changes may put patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Therefore,
      intraoperative mechanical ventilation, especially setting of positive end-expiratory pressure
      (PEEP) has an important role in respiratory management during laparoscopic surgery.
      Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the optimal PEEP level and the best method to set PEEP
      during laparoscopic surgery. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, PEEP set
      according to pleural pressure measured by using esophageal balloon catheter significantly has
      beneficial effects in terms of oxygenation, compliance and possible mortality. The aim of
      this study is to determine whether setting of PEEP guided by measurement of pleural pressure
      would improve oxygenation and respiratory system compliance during laparoscopic surgery.
