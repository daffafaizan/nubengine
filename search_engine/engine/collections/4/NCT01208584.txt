      models. Promising therapies for promoting spinal axonal regeneration in man will be available
      in the near future. Most research in the field is focussed on the lesion itself and the
      perilesional spinal cord. The recovery of motor and sensory function is,however, not
      permitted by local processes at the spinal level only. The whole central nervous system (CNS)
      reacts to such a condition. Therefore the modulation of motor and sensory function in spinal
      cord lesioned patients should be reflected in characteristic changes of cortical brain
      activity, which are accessible to new non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques such as
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Changes of white matter due to axonal damage
      can also be measured qualitatively and quantitatively using MR diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI). Those measures may provide a basis to better understand the pathophysiology underlying
      spinal cord lesions in man, including changes in brain function over time (during
      rehabilitation) or related to specific treatment. However, there are no studies available yet
      addressing those topics or providing mechanism-based approaches for determining the time
      interval of application of novel neuroregenerative drugs. By investigation of brain
      activation and white matter changes in patients with congenital(myelomeningocele (MMC)),
      acute and chronic spinal cord lesions (ASIA A) first and fundamental work in this field will
      be conducted in this study.
