      I. Estimate the early death rate in patients discharged after completion of intensive
      induction or salvage chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the costs incurred by patients discharged early after induction or salvage
      chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

      II. Compare resource utilization (transfusions, etc.) in patients discharged early after
      induction or salvage chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after blood
      count recovery.

      III. Compare the quality of life in patients discharged early after induction or salvage
      chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are discharged within 72 hours after completion of chemotherapy and undergo standard
      outpatient care by a registered nurse (RN), physician assistant (PA), or resident/fellow at a
      local facility or the study center approximately 3 times per week, as clinically indicated
      for up to 45 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 month.
