      death worldwide. It accounts for 90% of all liver cancers. More than 80% of patients present
      with advanced or unresectable disease.

      For patients with vascular invasion and/or metastases, the only approved therapy that offers
      a survival advantage is Sorafenib (NexavarÂ®). While palliative systemic chemotherapy other
      than Sorafenib is sometimes offered for HCC, there is no evidence that any chemotherapy has
      any meaningful therapeutic benefit, especially in overall survival. Subjects in the current
      study will either have completed at least 90 days of sorafenib treatment or are not able to
      receive sorafenib due to intolerability or unable to afford. Subjects will continue sorafenib
      as tolerated while receiving experimental therapy. The experimental dosing schedule has four
      segments: (1) priming, which consists of intradermal AlloStim alone; (2) vaccination, which
      consists of intradermal dosing of AlloStim+CRCL; (3) activation, which consists of an
      intravenous infusion of AlloStim; and (4) booster, which consists of monthly intradermal
      injections of CRCL alone
