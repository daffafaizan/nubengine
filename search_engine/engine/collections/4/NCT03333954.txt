      integrated in the external components of the implant captures visual information of the
      environment, this information is processed by a pocket processor and then transmitted via
      projected IR light onto the implant. The implant received the projected IR light and
      stimulates the nerve cells of the retina. Interim analysis will be performed at 6 months
      after implantation.
