    
      This study will test if Cannabidiol (CBD) therapy is safe in humans and reduces the number
      and/or severity of seizures in patients with drug resistant epilepsy when taken in addition
      to current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).

      To be eligible, subjects must:

        -  have drug-resistant epilepsy

        -  be between 1 and 60 years of age

      Subjects may participate for up to 2 years and may continue to receive the drug as available,
      until the compassionate use is terminated or the drug becomes approved by the FDA.

      The study includes:

        -  Baseline, Screening and 2 phone calls

        -  12 week drug titration (6 visits) and 5 phone calls

        -  Approximately 1 year and 9 month Treatment period (7 visits)

      Subjects will come in for visits approximately every two weeks for the first three months and
      then quarterly for the remainder of the study. Subjects' antiepileptic drug levels will be
      tested to monitor for drug interactions. Lab assessments (CBC, CMP, urinalysis) will be
      performed to monitor for changes in bone marrow, liver, and kidney function to ensure safe
      use.

      Cannabidiol will be in the form of 100 mg/ml oral solution. Subjects will be given CBD to
      take in addition to their current anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimen.
