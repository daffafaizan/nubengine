    
      To participate in this study, you will be asked to come to the University of Florida for one
      testing day. For your convenience, arrangements will be made by the study coordinator.

      If you have a movement disorder, you will be tested in an "off" medication condition. We do
      not expect concerns or unwanted consequences arising from discontinuing medications for this
      duration.

      We will review the informed consent and you will have the opportunity to ask questions before
      signing the informed consent. During the experiment, you may be asked to complete the
      following: (1) questionnaires about quality of life and depression; (2) tests to measure your
      strength and motor function; (3) tests to measure your cognition; (4) functional and
      structural MRI scan of your brain while performing a precision gripping task; (5) intravenous
      blood draw; (6) urine pregnancy test (if applicable); (7) trial of anticholinergic therapy
      drug trihexyphenidyl (if applicable - cervical dystonia only).

      Participants with DYT 1 dystonia and healthy controls are not eligible to receive the trial
      drug. All women of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test. The
      questionnaire about depression will not be given to subjects under the age of 18.

      If you have any metal in your eye or eyes, the researchers may require additional screening
      to ensure that it is safe for you to enter the MRI environment. If additional screening is
      determined to be necessary, you will be referred to Radiology at Shands UF for an
      orbitofrontal x-ray.

      Blood will be collected for all subjects, including healthy control subjects. The blood may
      be analyzed, at the University of Florida, to assess potential biomarkers for cervical
      dystonia and DYT 1 dystonia. Biomarker testing is another way to say genetic testing.
