      causes of this phenomenon are currently unknown. However research into steroid resistance in
      severe asthma and the smoking related condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      points to a number of possible causes. We will characterise a group of smokers with asthma
      and perform a number of investigations and compare the results to ex-smokers and never
      smokers with asthma with the aim of establishing which previously published steroid
      resistance phenomena are related to the steroid resistance displayed by smokers with asthma.
      Results produced from this trial will provide hypothesis generating information leading to
      future pharmaceutical trials.
