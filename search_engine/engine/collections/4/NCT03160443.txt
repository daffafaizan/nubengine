      university hospital of Montpellier.

        -  Participation consists of a one-day visit with a multidisciplinary assessment. No action
           is specific to research. This is the usual management of patients with eating disorders
           addressed to our department.

        -  An ancillary study will be proposed, if the patient is addressed by his general
           practitioner for an annual evaluation. This second visit will be exactly the same as the
           initial visit.
