      States (US) is on the rise. The Cu-IUD is considered one of the most effective contraception
      methods, being as effective as permanent sterilization but having the convenience of being
      reversible should a woman decide to conceive.2 The Copper 380A (TCu380A) is the only Cu-IUD
      available in the US; of all Cu-IUDs, the TCu380A is considered the most effective. Despite
      its increasing popularity in the US, studies indicate that bleeding irregularities and
      dysmenorrhea are common reasons for method discontinuation. Some evidence suggests that
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can help improve bleeding during Cu-IUD
      use. However, these studies did not examine NSAID use with the TCu380A specifically, nor did
      they evaluate readily available NSAIDs such as over-the-counter naproxen. For this reason,
      the investigators propose a pilot trial in which new TCu380A users complaining of heavy or
      prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting after 1 month of use are randomized to naproxen or
      placebo to be taken the first 7 days of menstruation for three consecutive cycles, and then
      observed for one cycle without treatment. The number of bleeding/spotting days will be
      compared using Student t-test. In addition to assessing how well naproxen reduces incidence
      and amount of bleeding, the investigators will also assess the use of naproxen and TCu380A on
      quality of life, sexual function, method satisfaction, menstrual pain, and adverse events. By
      measuring these variables, the investigators will assess both positive and negative
      consequences of TCu380A use, ensuring that harm does not outweigh benefits.
