      incidence and mortality. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and is
      in high demand in China. However, recurrence of HCC among liver transplantation recipients is
      still a great challenge and threat to the survival of recipients. So it is of great
      significance to establish a non-invasive way to filter high liver transplantation recipient
      population before transplantation. Based on large scales of pre-treatment MR images, the
      investigator's study aims to establish a non-invasive radiomics method to filter high
      recurrent-risk liver transplantation recipient population. This study will contribute to the
      precise selection of HCC-related liver transplantation recipients.
