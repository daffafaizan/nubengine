      with idiopathic uveitis may also have the activity of pathogens in the eye. However, due to
      the limitation of the amount of ocular samples, it is difficult to make a rapid and effective
      diagnosis of infection.

      The study is to explore the infective cause of uveitis in China by using a broad diagnostic
      approach of detection, including multiple molecular bio-techniques. We also plan to explore
      the distribution of pathogens in infectious uveitis.
