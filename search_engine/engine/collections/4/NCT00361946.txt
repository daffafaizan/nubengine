      the incidence of T2DM in children is on the rise. Consequently, complications may occur at an
      earlier age, underscoring the importance of improving glycemic control in the pediatric
      population. Postprandial hyperglycemia contributes significantly to poor glycemic control in
      T2DM. We now understand that in addition to insulin other hormones (glucagon, amylin and
      GLP-1) may play a role in the postprandial glucose metabolism. The role of gastric emptying
      has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in regulating glucose appearance into
      the circulation. Abnormalities in the pancreatic hormone amylin and the incretin GLP-1 have
      emerged as contributors to the alterations in gastric emptying and postprandial hyperglycemia
      in T2DM. Although much is know about the abnormalities related to postprandial hyperglycemia
      in adults with T2DM, little information is available in the pediatric population. This
      protocol will examine gastric emptying, glucagon, GLP-1 and amylin secretions in healthy
      lean, obese children with and without diabetes post-ingestion of a mixed meal. The subject
      will be age and Tanner stage matched. The goal of this project is to better understand the
      metabolic adaptations of postprandial glucose homeostasis in T2DM by comparing our study
      group to obese (normal glucose tolerance) and healthy (lean) controls. The long-term goal for
      the PI is to use the data gathered with this protocol to develop a K-23 proposal
      incorporating new therapeutic options through the use of amylin and GLP-1 analogs in children
      with T2DM to improve postprandial hyperglycemia.
