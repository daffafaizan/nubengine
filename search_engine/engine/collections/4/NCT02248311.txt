      1) To examine whether the extension and degree of microangiopathy is an independent risk
      factor for silent myocardial and brain ischemia. 2) To evaluate whether the degree and
      extension of microangiopathy is a predictor of CV events and poor outcome. 3) To evaluate
      whether a new score based on the extension and the degree of microangiopathy will permit us
      to improve the current methods used to identify patients at risk of CVD and its outcomes. 4)
      To determine whether the presence and the degree of NAFLD is an independent Cardiovascular
      disease risk factor and represent and extra-value to the score based on the extension and the
      degree of microangiopathy.

      Secondary objectives:

      1) To examine the usefulness of selected serum biomarkers in identifying diabetic patients at
      risk of Cardiovascular disease 2) To evaluate whether these selected biomarkers are related
      to the degree and extension of microangiopathy and the outcome of cardiovascular events. 3)
      To better define the meaning of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic population (glomerular
      involvement vs. index of generalized endothelial dysfunction)
