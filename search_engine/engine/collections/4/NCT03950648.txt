      impairment will be offered cognitive training. The intervention will consist of a
      well-validated cognitive training protocol that specifically targets spatial navigation
      skills. The protocol was developed by Willis et al. for the Adult Development and Enrichment
      Trial (ADEPT) trial, which trains map reading and route-learning skills through mental
      rotation training tasks over the course of 5 weeks. Patients will be assessed by study staff
      pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention using
      spatial cognitive outcomes, quality of life measures, and gait and balance outcomes.
