      level for needle insertion in spinal/epidural anesthetics, however this is not commonly used.
      A novel automated ultrasound software system has been developed by the UBC Department of
      Engineering which identifies for the practitioner the intervertebral spaces in the lumbar
      area. This study aim to investigate whether this new technology has a greater accuracy of
      identifying intervertebral spaces that manual palpation.
