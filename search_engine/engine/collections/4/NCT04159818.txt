    
      In the first stage, 13 evaluable patients will be accrued per cohort. Evaluable is defined
      as: at least one administration of nivolumab and availability of paired biopsies for
      immunohistochemistry (for induction treatment cohorts pre-induction and pre-nivolumab
      biopsies).

      If there are 1 or no responses observed in these 13 patients, the cohort will be stopped.
      Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 34.
