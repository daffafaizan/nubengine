      devastating outcomes including irreversible joint damage. The management of a patient with
      PsA is extremely challenging due to the high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. The ultimate
      goal of this proposal is to prepare pragmatic trials in PsA trials that will encompass all
      relevant subgroups of patients. The aims of this study specifically focus on responses to
      biologic therapy among patients with PsA and determining the optimal set of outcome measures
      for PsA trials.
