    
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to surgery.

      Randomized subjects will receive a dental nerve block with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine
      1:100,000 before undergoing bilateral third molar extraction under local anesthesia. In
      addition to the lidocaine nerve block, the Investigator may choose to add topical benzocaine
      or intraoperative nitrous oxide.

      At the end of surgery, and at least 20 minutes after the lidocaine administration, blinded
      study drug will be infiltrated to provide postsurgical analgesia. Subjects will be required
      to remain in the research facility for 96 hours after study drug administration.

      Postsurgical efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be conducted.

      All subjects will return for a follow-up visits on Days 7 and 10. A phone call will be made
      to each subject on Day 30 for an adverse event (AE) assessment and to inquire as to whether
      the subject made any unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain.
