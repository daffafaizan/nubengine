    
      Approximately 30 subjects across approximately 5 United States (US) sites will be enrolled in
      the Phase 1 portion of the study and approximately 69-84 subjects across approximately 15 US
      sites will be enrolled in the Phase 2A portion of the study.

      The Phase 1 portion of the study will follow a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design to evaluate
      twice-daily (BID) administration of LYC-55716 for DLTs and to determine the MTD and the RP2D
      for further assessment in Phase 2A. A treatment cycle will consist of 28 days of treatment
      and subjects may continue to receive subsequent cycles of therapy as long as they do not have
      clinically significant progressive disease.

      In the Phase 2A portion of the study, 69-84 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors considered most likely to be responsive to a RORγ agonist will be enrolled and
      treated at the MTD or RP2D.

      Six cohorts of subjects with advanced cancer will be enrolled. Cohorts 1 to 3 will enroll 14
      to 19 subjects per cohort. Tumor types include NSCLC (Cohort 1); gastric, esophageal and G-E
      junction adenocarcinoma (Cohort 2); and SCCHN (Cohort 3). Cohorts 4 to 6 will enroll up to 9
      subjects per cohort. Tumor types include ovarian carcinoma (Cohort 4), renal cell carcinoma
      (Cohort 5), and urothelial carcinoma (Cohort 6).

      Primary Study Objectives

      Phase 1

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of LYC-55716

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)

      Phase 2A

      • Determine the objective response rate according to response evaluation criteria in solid
      tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

      Secondary Study Objectives

      Phase 1

        -  Evaluate the activity of LYC-55716 by objective response according to RECIST v1.1.

        -  Determine the durability of any observed objective response

      Phase 2A

        -  Determine the duration of response

        -  Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        -  Determine suitability of the RP2D for further study

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LYC-55716
