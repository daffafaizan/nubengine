      the practice of injecting the hip joint with local anesthetics at the end of the procedure
      and the use of intraoperative opioids. These patients usually receive a spinal anesthetic as
      well. The ideal analgesic technique that provides adequate pain relief following this
      procedure has not been established yet.

      The femoral articular branch block (FAB) has recently been proposed to collectively block the
      terminal femoral and accessory obturator nerve branches to the hip joint with a single
      injection, theoretically blocking most of the innervation relevant to hip arthroscopy while
      sparing the main femoral nerve branches to the quadriceps muscle. The investigators aim to
      demonstrate the analgesic benefits of FAB.
