      is evaluating the effect of food on how febuxostat-XR moves throughout the body. This study
      will also look at the side effects and all safety results in people who took the study drug.

      This 3-way crossover study will enroll approximately 36 participants. Eligible participants
      will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of the 3 treatment sequences at 1:1:1 ratio.
      Sequence defines the order in which participants receive Regimens A (febuxostat XR 80 mg
      after a high fat meal), B (febuxostat XR 40 mg after fasting) and C (febuxostat XR 80 mg
      after fasting):

      Sequence 1: A, B, C

      Sequence 2: B, C, A

      Sequence 3: C, A, B The dose in a period and the dose in the subsequent period will be
      separated by a minimum 7-day washout interval. This single-centre trial will be conducted in
      the United States.

      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including three 4-day periods of
      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.
