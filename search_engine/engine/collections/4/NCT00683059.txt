      regimen, no widely accepted standard second line therapy currently exists. Taxanes including
      paclitaxel have exhibited clinical activity in this disease and are sometimes given off
      study. However, toxicities including neurotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions often limit
      the use of paclitaxel. ABRAXANE may allow delivery of a greater dose of paclitaxel to those
      with bladder cancer with an easier method of administration and with less toxicity.
