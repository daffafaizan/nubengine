      of excess weight is greater among racial/ethnic minority populations. For NHs and PPs 70 to
      80% of adults are estimated to be overweight or obese. Obesity-related disparities such as
      diabetes and heart disease (CVD) are also increasing among NHs and PPs. To address obesity
      and related disparities, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership was
      formed entitled, the Partnership for Improving Lifestyle Interventions (PILI) 'Ohana Program
      (Pili meaning relationship and 'Ohana meaning family). The PILI 'Ohana Program (POP) consists
      of 5 community organizations and the Department of Native Hawaiian Health (DNHH) at the John
      A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) of the University of Hawai'i (UH). With a 3-year CBPR
      planning grant from the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD),
      the POP was successful at establishing this community-academic partnership aimed at
      obesity-related disparities in Hawai'i and in implementing a pilot intervention to address
      weight loss maintenance (the PILI 'Ohana Intervention) in NHs and PPs, which serves as
      preliminary data for this application. The specific aims are as follow: 1) To identify the
      aspects of the PILI 'Ohana (family + community focused) Intervention deemed effective by
      former participants and community-peer educators of the pilot intervention. 2) To test
      whether a face-to-face or DVD delivery method of the PILI 'Ohana intervention is effective in
      improving weight loss maintenance versus a control group in NHs and PPs. 3) To identify the
      strengths of the PILI 'Ohana Program that supports a co-learning and co-equal environment.
