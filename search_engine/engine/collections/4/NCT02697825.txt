      hysterectomy, radical prostatectomy etc. Both Intraocular Pressure and Optic Nerve Sheath
      Diameter are found to get increased while in this position.

      Intraocular Pressure will be measured by schiotz tonometer over an hourly interval whereas
      Optic nerve sheath diameter will be measured with use of ultrasound using a probe of 7.5 Mega
      hertz. Both values will be measured in both the eyes and will be compared statistically to
      find any correlation which may exist between the two.
