      subjects (US) with no site representing more than 30% of the implanted subjects. The subjects
      will include those subjects who have previously undergone placement of a conduit between the
      right ventricle and pulmonary artery and now present with a dysfunctional RVOT conduit
      requiring treatment for moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation and/or RVOT conduit
      obstruction.
