      individual symptoms experienced) through the ASyMS-Can patient phones. If the incoming
      symptom reports are of clinical concern, the server software will generate two levels of
      alerts (amber& red) that will be sent to the designated nurse, who will receive alerts on a
      dedicated ASyMS-Can nurse handset (mobile phone). The nurse will view the patient's symptom
      reports on a secure web page, and contact the patient directly at home by telephone, guided
      through a decision-support algorithm on the web-based platform to systematize the triage
      based on the COSTARS guideline, facilitating the initiation of "real-time" clinical
      interventions. An "amber alert", which requires response within 4 hours, indicates that the
      symptom(s) are not severe or life-threatening but early intervention might prevent further
      symptom progression. The second level of the triage alert, 'red alert', will be sent to the
      nurse for severe symptoms and will require response within 30 minutes of receipt of the alert
