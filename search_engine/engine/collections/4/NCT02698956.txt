      patients that will be treated with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve and
      delivery devices for severe, symptomatic calcific aortic stenosis. In addition, the
      information collected will serve post market safety and surveillance regulatory obligations.

      Consecutive patient data will be collected at baseline, procedure, discharge, after discharge
      (at approx. 30 days post-index procedure), 12 months post-index procedure and annually
      thereafter up to 5 years post-implant according to usual practice at site.
