      I. To compare standard white light examination to multimodal imaging for detection of high
      grade dysplasia and carcinoma during follow-up examinations of patients with oral potentially
      malignant disorders (OPMD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine qualitative and quantitative diagnostic assessment of patients who agree to
      undergo imaging and have images of sufficient quality.

      II. To compare expression of molecular biomarkers to results from white light examination,
      multimodal imaging and pathologic assessment in a subset of patients who have invasive
      biopsies or resection.

      III. To compare cytologic results from brush biopsy specimens to white light examination and
      multimodal imaging results.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo PS2.1/PS3 imaging and high-resolution microendoscope imaging with
      proflavine hemisulfate applied to the mucosa. Patients also undergo brush biopsy and
      incisional biopsy. Procedures are repeated every 3-4 months for 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
