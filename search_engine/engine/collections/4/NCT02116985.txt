      that electroencephalographic(EEG)activity can provide a reliable basis for a surrogate
      measurement of hypnosis.An EEG monitor,the Narcotrend Index(NI),has proven useful to titrate
      hypnotic drugs.Because it is a single composite measure monitored continuously,it has been
      used in controlled studies to automatically guide propofol
      administration.Conversely,automated delivery systems for opioids have seldom been described
      using EEG activity There are no specific measures to quantify analgesia
      directly.Nevertheless,in the interaction between opioid-hypnotic synergy and loss of
      consciousness,when the dose of analgesic administered is sufficient to inhibit autonomic
      response to noxious stimuli,then the required hypnotic concentration is only that needed to
      achieve loss of consciousness.Moreover,a noxious stimulus such as laryngoscopy or periosteal
      pressure to the tibia may cause electrocortical activation with an increase in Narcotrend
      index,which indirectly reflects the analgesic state or the level of
      antinociception.Finally,an excitatory EEG arousal reaction resulting from nociceptive
      stimulation can provide a rational basis for analgesia administration.It can then be
      hypothesized that Narcotrend index could also be the controlled variable for opioid
      administration.
