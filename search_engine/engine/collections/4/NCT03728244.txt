    
      Interventions:

        1. Hyaluronic acid gel 0.2%

        2. MEBO ointment

      Procedure:

      The palatal sites will be anaesthetized with 0.3 ml of a solution of 4% Articaine and 0.001%
      Adrenalin. Graft harvesting will be performed by basic surgical techniques previously
      described by Miller (1982). A rectangular shaped piece of mucosa will be harvested from the
      area of the hard palate by a split-thickness dissection.

      The graft will then be used as it on the recipient bed.

      The graft dimensions will be recorded (width and length).

      Denuded palatal area will then be protected using one of the following options:

        1. Periodontal pack only (control group)

        2. HA gel 0.2% covered with a periodontal pack (test group I)

        3. MEBO ointment covered with a periodontal pack (test group II)

      Postoperative instructions:

      Postoperative instructions will include discontinuing toothbrushing and flossing around the
      surgical sites until the day of periodontal dressing removal (day 7).

      Patients will be directed to consume only soft foods during the first week and to avoid any
      mechanical trauma.

      Patients will be scheduled to be seen on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 42.

      Periodontal pack will be first removed on day 3, and donor sites will be evaluated using
      selected parameters in both groups.

      After evaluation, HA gels together with periodontal pack will be reapplied in test group I,
      MEBO ointment with periodontal pack will be reapplied in test group II whereas periodontal
      pack only will be reapplied in control group

      On day 7, the periodontal packs will be removed for reevaluation of the wound area in all
      groups. Thereafter, all patients will be followed up on days 14, 21 and 42 for further
      evaluation.
