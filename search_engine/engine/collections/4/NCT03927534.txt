    
      This study is a multi-centre, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT), with
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 1-year follow-up measures, and a 1:1 allocation rate
      between groups. Patients from four mental health units in Zaragoza (Spain) will be randomly
      assigned to two different parallel conditions, with one psychological intervention group ('ME
      + TAU') and usual treatment ('TAU alone') managed by their general practitioner (GP), to test
      the superiority of 'ME + TAU' provision compared with 'TAU alone' provision. For ethical
      reasons, those patients allocated to 'TAU alone' will be offered the ME programme after
      finishing the trial at 1-year follow-up.
