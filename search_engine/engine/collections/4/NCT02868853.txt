      through the final 6 months of the study. Participants will attend one 1-hour orientation
      meeting at the beginning of the study and a 2-hour baseline assessment and training meeting.
      A final assessment will be conducted at the end of 6 weeks with a follow-up assessment at 6
      months. Everyone in the study will be asked to listen to 2 podcasts per week. Each of the
      podcasts will take about 15-20 minutes to listen to and so participants should expect to
      spend 30-40 minutes each week listening to podcasts. Participants also will be randomized to
      track diet with one of the two mobile dietary tracking applications that will be used in the
      study. Participants will be encouraged to monitor their exercise and body weight.
