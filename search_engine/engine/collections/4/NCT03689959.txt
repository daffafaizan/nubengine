      knee biomechanics, quadriceps function, energy expenditure during gait and the overall
      ability to ambulate. These deformities occur secondary to a number of different etiologies
      including; congenital, traumatic, inflammatory and neuromuscular disorders with cerebral
      palsy (CP) being on the top of the list.

      The main aim of correction of sagittal plane deformities of the knee is to restore the range
      of motion. Surgical options available for correction of knee flexion contractures include
      soft tissue modification, acute correction by osteotomies, gradual correction by external
      fixators and growth modulation by hemiephysiodesis.Extensive soft tissue surgery may be
      needed for correction of knee deformities with potential risk of neurovascular damage and
      wound complications. Supracondylar extension osteotomies have been widely used, however
      prolonged immobilization and associated neurovascular insults have always been major
      concerns. External fixators are cumbersome and may produce muscle tethering and pin tract
      infections.

      There are few studies in the literature reporting the use of anterior hemiepiphysiodesis for
      correction of knee flexion contracture.

      Our study question can be summarized as follows; Is hemiepiphysiodesis by eight plates
      effective for correction of fixed knee flexion deformities in children ?
