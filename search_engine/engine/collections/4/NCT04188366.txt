    
      FAMES involves three distinct and revolving components - early, continuous, and motivational
      contact - that incorporate motivational techniques and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders 5TH Edition (DSM-5) Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI).

      The overarching objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      brief provider-led FAmily Engagement Motivational Strategy (FAMES) and its accompanying
      implementation toolkit. The investigators will also preliminary examine whether FAMES
      improves family engagement and retention in treatment, and motivation.

      A total of 50 participants with a loved one enrolled in CSC program for FEP will be recruited
      from five CSC programs in Washington State to take part in a non-randomized stepped-wedge
      pilot trial. Each CSC program will represent a cluster and serve as its own control. A
      two-month implementation transition period will occur at each CSC program and during which
      providers will be introduced to the intervention using the implementation toolkits and
      trained to conduct FAMES. A 12-month open cohort design will be utilized to recruit
      approximately 50 family members during the study period.
