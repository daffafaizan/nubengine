      enhance gut motility, will improve the incidence of GER and GER-associated apnea,
      bradycardiac and/or hypoxic events. The investigators have two aims: 1) to examine the
      relationship between GER and apnea, bradycardia, and/or desaturation (ABD) events by
      simultaneously employing a unique computer algorithm developed at the University of Virginia
      to measure ABD events and an Multi-channel Intra-luminal Impedance (MII) pH monitoring to
      measure GER episodes. 2) In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will
      study whether erythromycin decreases GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardia and/or hypoxia
      in premature infants.
