      HPV vaccine coverage rates in the United States remain substantially lower than other
      vaccines and Healthy People 2020 targets. HPV vaccine initiation can be improved through
      targeted reminders that motivate parents. Our long-term goal is to maximize HPV vaccination
      rates among girls and boys within the United States using efficient and sustainable
      strategies. The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the usefulness of a tiered strategy
      of a parent-targeted strategies in improving care seeking and receptiveness to vaccine
      recommendations. Strategies include HPV vaccine reminders via postcard or text message and
      phone-based Motivational Interview sessions. The central hypothesis is addressing key health
      beliefs (e.g., perceived benefits and barriers) will increase parental acceptance and, thus,
      HPV vaccine initiation.
