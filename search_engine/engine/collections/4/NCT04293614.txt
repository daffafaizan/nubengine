      have recognized a well-functioning Arterio-Venous Fistula (AVF) as the best modality for
      access in patients with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis.

      A mature AVF has lower incidence of thrombosis and stenosis compared to the other two
      available modalities of the Arterio-Venous Graft (AVG) and Central Venous Catheter (CVC).
      This translates into prolonged patency rates and lower risk of infection. The use of AVF's
      are also associated with lower mortality, and costs.

      However, significant numbers of AVFs [20% to 60 %] are known to fail to mature into
      functioning fistulas. Issues such as impaired vein remodelling, intimal hyperplasia,
      technical problems, unrecognized stenosis within the outflow vein, inflow problems, or steal
      syndromes can all lead to failure of achieving a mature AVF.

      The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between the pressure gradient within the
      surgically formed AVF and its' maturation and functioning status.
