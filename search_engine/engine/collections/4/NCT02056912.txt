      associating diffuse leukoencephalopathy and partial lipoD. The investigators have analyzed
      numerous known genetic causes of leukodystrophies and lipoD but the investigators failed to
      identify a known cause for this syndrome which has never been previously reported. The
      investigators then switched their effort to analyses of exome using next generation
      sequencing in both affected sisters and their unaffected relatives (one sister and two
      parents). The investigators identified an excellent candidate gene with a homozygous missense
      mutation in both affected sisters. The investigators now aim to prove the involvement of this
      candidate gene in lipoD's determinism by a search of additional mutations in the candidate
      gene in a series of patients affected with lipoD (collaboration with Pr Capeau's Team)
      (LIPOGENE study) and by functional analyses performed in the two index patients on blood and
      skin samples (LIPOGENE sub-study).
