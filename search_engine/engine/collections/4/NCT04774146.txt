      be achieved with active suction followed by triple air-fluid exchange or prolonged lavage of
      the vitreous chamber to remove emulsification. Purpose of the study is to compare the amount
      of silicone oil emulsification droplets within the lavage fluid in case of air exchange and
      simple lavage to compare which technique removed the highest percentage of emulsion. This is
      achieved by comparing consecutive samples of lavage fluid.

      Therefore consecutive patients scheduled to SiO removal with triple air exchange or vitreous
      chamber lavage are enrolled and 3 samples of intraocular fluid aspirated during the fluid
      exchange procedure sent to the lab for SiO emulsion count and quantification.
