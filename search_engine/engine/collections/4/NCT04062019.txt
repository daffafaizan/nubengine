      IIM will be enrolled. IIM is defined as Dermatomyositis (DM) or Polymyositis (PM), meeting
      the Bohan & Peter (1975) diagnostic criteria for definite or probable DM or PM. One million
      units of Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was administered subcutaneously every other
      day for 3 months. All patients were followed up for 3 months after withdraw of IL-2.
