      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      pomalidomide, in children from >= 3 years to < 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or
      refractory central nervous system (CNS) tumors when given once daily for 21 consecutive days
      of a 28-day course.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicities of pomalidomide in children
      from >= 3 years to < 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide when administered orally in
      children from >= 3 years old to < 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory
      CNS tumors and study the association of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with age and steroid
      use.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the preliminary efficacy of pomalidomide in this patient population as defined
      by radiographic response rate, duration of response, and event-free survival (EFS) within the
      confines of a Phase 1 study. *For the purposes of this study, long-term stable disease will
      be considered a response (defined as stable disease for >= 6 courses).

      II. To investigate a relationship between pomalidomide dose and exposure with radiographic
      response and changes in immune function (for example, T-cell subsets, natural killer [NK]
      cell activity, granzyme B and circulating levels of IL-12, IL-2, IL-15, GM-CSF).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
