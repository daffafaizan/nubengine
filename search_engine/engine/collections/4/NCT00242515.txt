        1. Define the role of preemptive and specific DLI in preserving the GVL effect in the
           setting of NMT. The ability of selecting components of T cells for transplant and DLI
           will allow us to test the hypothesis of distinctive roles in subsets of T cells. It was
           found that CD8-depleted DLI was administered to prevent relapse after TCD (T-cell
           depleted) BMT (bone marrow as the stem cell source) or CD34-selected PBSC.

           Whether preemptive CD8-depleted DLI can perform this function after nonmyeloablative
           transplantation (NMT) needs to be established, as proposed in our study. If there turns
           out to be a role for DLI in these circumstances, a CD8-depleted lymphocyte product that
           can limit GVHD would be a very attractive option. We would also define the relationship
           of the level of donor chimerism and disease control.

        2. Investigate the impact of CD8-depleted DLI in NMT at specific doses and time points for
           the reduction of GVHD. The GVHD pattern may vary between different ethnic populations as
           suggested by our earlier NMT study. Our current proposed study will further shed light
           on the optimal GVHD prophylaxis regimen in the Singapore patient population.
