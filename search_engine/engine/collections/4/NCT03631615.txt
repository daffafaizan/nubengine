      SHR-1210 is a PD-1 antibody developed by Jiangsu Heng Rui Medicine Co. Nowadays, fifteen
      clinical trials of this drug have been conducted in patients with different types of advanced
      malignant tumor, including one combined with radiotherapy and three combined with
      chemotherapy. Until now, SHR-1210 has exhibited favorable safety in recruited patients.
      Incidence rate of SAE is only 1%.

      Several big scale clinical research like POET, RTOG 9904 and TOPGEAR have proofed the
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in treating locally advanced GEJ cancer or
      gastric cancer.

      Study design:

      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage
      needs 15 participants, if â‰¥1 participants acquire remission, then the study will move on to
      the second stage and enroll the rest 21 participants. The total sample size will be 36
      patients.

      We will shut down the study in advance, if situations below happens: 1) 1 treatment related
      death, >3 disease progression or >2 hyper-progressive disease happen during the first stage;
      2) 2 treatment related death, >6 disease progression or >4 hyper-progressive disease happen
      during the whole study.

      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.

      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)
      tumor volume increase >50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.
