      weeks unless 100% epithelialization of the index wound and two subsequent healing
      confirmation visits have been achieved prior to week 12. Each subject will receive a weekly
      application of the EpiFix plus standard of care until 100% epithelialization is achieved. The
      subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety during the course of the trial.
