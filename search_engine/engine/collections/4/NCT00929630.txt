      faecal incontinence but its acceptance by coloproctologists is still poor because clear data
      in literature are lacking. We will run a prospective randomised trial comparing commercial
      fibrin glue treatment with classical seton treatment, taking into account the healing rate,
      hospital stay, healing time, faecal incontinence and postoperative pain.

      Patients and Methods: 130 homogeneous patients with trans-sphincteric anal fistulas referred
      to 7 Colorectal Units will be randomised to undergo fibrin glue or seton treatment. permanent
      healing of the fistula will be defined as absence on any discharge from the fistula and
      healing of the secondary fistula orifice after at least 1 year of follow up.

      Post operative pain (on a VAS scale) and hospital stay will be recorded and compared in the
      two groups
