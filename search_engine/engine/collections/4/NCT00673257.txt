    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride in pediatric patients with
           malignancy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the relationship between body composition (percent body fat) and the
           pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride with gender, age, or ethnic
           background in these patients.

        -  Explore, in a preliminary fashion, possible relationships between pharmacokinetic
           results and toxicity.

        -  Explore, in a preliminary fashion, possible relationships between pharmacokinetic
           results and renal and hepatic function and complete blood count.

        -  Explore, in a preliminary fashion, possible genetic polymorphisms that may influence
           daunorubicin hydrochloride disposition.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood collection prior to, periodically during, and after treatment with
      daunorubicin hydrochloride for pharmacokinetic analysis.

      Patients also undergo body composition testing within 7 days before or after the
      administration of daunorubicin hydrochloride using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
