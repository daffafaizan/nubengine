      through detailed medical history and record review. For patients who undergo surgical
      treatment for pain, the registry will capture standardized outcomes measures to assess key
      factors such as post-operative pain, pain medication usage, quality of life outcomes, and
      functional outcome of associated nerves as compared to pre-operative levels.
