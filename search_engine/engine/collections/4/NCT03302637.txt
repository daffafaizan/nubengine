      pathogens have been associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer; however, direct
      relationships of oral microbes with pancreatic cancer have not been evaluated in prospective
      studies. Investigators examine the relationship of oral microbiota with subsequent risk of
      pancreatic cancer in a large nested case-control study.
