      echocardiography, aerobic capacity measured as peak oxygen uptake, quality of life, and the
      level of physical activity by questionnaires. Assessments will be made before and after the
      training program and at one year follow-up. Safety of HIIT will be assessed as incidence of
      adverse effects during the training program. Clinical events will be recorded as worsening of
      heart failure requiring intensified drug therapy (diuretics), ventricular arrhythmia,
      hospitalization due to cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality at one year follow-up.
      The core study has been initiated and endorsed by the European Association for Cardiovascular
      Prevention and Rehabilitation, Section for Basic and Translational Research, under the
      European Society of Cardiology, and allows for sub-studies involving one or more of the
      participating centers. Preliminary calculations suggest that a total number of 200 patients
      randomized 1:1:1 to the three intervention groups is needed to detect larger beneficial
      effects with HIIT with a p-value of 0.05 and statistical power of 0.90 (primary endpoint is
      reverse remodeling, assessed by comparison between groups of change in left ventricular
      end-diastolic dimension from baseline to 12 weeks).
