      relatively few programs focus on preventing prescription drug abuse. Furthermore, due to
      growing constraints on classroom time, new evidence-based prevention programs are needed that
      flexibly incorporate the use of online digital technology and classroom/small-group
      components. The present study is developing and testing an adaptation of the evidence-based
      substance abuse and violence prevention approach called Life Skills Training (LST). The
      proposed preventive intervention for middle school PDA will (1) utilize both online digital
      and face-to-face intervention modalities to address PDA and concurrent ATOD use; (2)
      positively change social norms and challenge positive expectancies regarding PDA and ATOD
      use; (3) discourage diversion of prescription medications; and (4) enhance protective factors
      by building social and self-regulation skills through interactive learning and behavioral
      rehearsal scenarios. Middle schools will be randomized into either an intervention group that
      will receive the new intervention or a treatment-as-usual control group that will receive
      existing health education programming. At the end of the intervention period, and at a
      12-month follow-up assessments, we will compare both groups with respect to changes in
      behaviors, norms, attitudes, and knowledge regarding PDA and substance use.
