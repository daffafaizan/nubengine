      and psychological status has not been well investigated in the lung transplant candidates.
      Therefore, in the present study, we aim to examine (1) contributive factors to their health
      status based on baseline data, (2) whether patient reported measurements would predict
      patients' prognosis and (3) how they would change for 5 years as compared to physiological
      measurements.
