      the patient's wrist/hand and connected to the device. Next, the stimulating electrodes and
      vibration sensor of the QTOF device will be placed over the contralateral ulnar nerve and
      thenar eminence. The devices will be placed prior to the induction of anesthesia - but no
      electrical stimuli will be delivered until AFTER the patient is asleep (as per routine).
      After induction, both devices will be started. The TwitchView automatically selects the
      appropriate stimulus current (takes about 10 seconds) - and when that is complete, the QTOF
      stimulus current will be set to the same value. The stimulus interval for both devices will
      be 20 seconds. Paired measurements of twitch count and TOF ratios will be gathered for the
      entirety of the surgical procedure, and cross checked with Epic regarding the administration
      of neuromuscular blocking drugs (time, dose) and reversal agents (time, dose). RAs will be
      present to verify the correct function of both devices. Note that information from the
      TwitchView monitor will be continuous available to the providers (it is a standard device
      available for use in our ORs). Information from the QTOF will NOT be made available to
      providers.
