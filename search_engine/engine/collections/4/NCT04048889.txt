      randomly allocated to two groups: continuous femoral nerve block alone or continuous femoral
      nerve block with addition of a popliteal plexus block.

      The continuous femoral nerve block will be performed by the anesthesiologist with 15 mLs of
      ropivacaine 0.5%, under ultrasound guidance before the beginning of the general anesthesia.
      The popliteal plexus block will be done by the anesthesiology, under ultrasound guidance,
      before the beginning of the surgery, under general anesthesia.

      Postoperative analgesia will include acetaminophen (4 x 1000 mg), ibuprofen (3 x 400 mg) and
      a continuous infusion of Ropivacaine 0.2%.
