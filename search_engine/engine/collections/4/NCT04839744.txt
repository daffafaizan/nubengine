    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles, safety, and immunogenicity of TG103
      injection produced by two different manufacturing processes in Chinese healthy male subjects.
      Approximately 24 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose
      of TG103 produced by the modified manufacturing process or TG103 produced by the original
      manufacturing process via subcutaneous (SC) injection.
