    
      The primary objective is to determine if Carbamazepine therapy in patients with severe liver
      disease due to Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the hepatic
      accumulation of ATZ.

      The other objectives are:

      To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment reduces hepatic fibrosis in alpha-1-antitrypsin
      deficient patients with severe liver disease. To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment
      reduces portal pressure in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient patients with severe liver disease.
      To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment is safe and tolerated by patients with severe
      liver disease caused by alpha-1-deficiency. To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment
      leads to stabilization in disease severity as measured by the MELD scores.
