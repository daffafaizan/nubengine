      treatments, SOF/DCV (71/92) or SOF/SMV (15/92) or SOF/pegylated interferon/RBV (2/92) or
      SOF/RBV (4/92) were enrolled in the current study.

      In the present study, the regimen used was designed by the combination of triple DAAs with
      different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles, SOF/SMV/DCV, plus
      RBV.
