      cases/year in France), associated with high risk of local relapse, functional impairment and
      pain. AF can occur at any age, but most commonly between 25 and 40 with a significant female
      predominance. AF is most frequently (about 85%) sporadic and then associated with a somatic
      mutation of the CTNNB1 gene. AF is associated with heredity condition, as complication of
      familial adenomatous polyposis (with germinal mutation of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
      gene). Most of AF arises on lims or abdominal wall. Nevertheless, some particular locations
      are life-threatening (mesenteric or cervical locations). The natural course of AF is
      unpredictable. One third of tumors are spontaneously stable. One third of tumor spontaneously
      decreases. One third of tumor is progressive, with a non-linear tumor growth dynamic. As the
      consequence the decision making for starting curative intent treatment is difficult, since
      some treatment could be mutilating (large en bloc surgery) or associated with late and severe
      complications (radiotherapy) and since these treatments could fail to control this benign
      tumor. Therapeutic options are: wait-and-see policy, surgery (sometimes mutilating),
      radiotherapy or systemic treatment (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonotherapy,
      imatinib, chemotherapy). Level of evidence associated these options is very low, based on
      retrospective studies and rare non-randomized phase II clinical trials.

      Regarding these uncertainties, physicians can hardly answer to patient questions.

      Prospective data provided by a large multi-center cohort is needed. The objective of the
      present study is to create a large cohort of incident cases of AF associated with tumor bank
      and collection of blood samples.
