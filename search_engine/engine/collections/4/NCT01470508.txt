      is scarce. This study is comparing individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) versus CBT
      with a family adjunctive intervention for eating disorders in Latina adults. All treatment
      will be conducted by trained professionals from either the UNC Eating Disorders Program (in
      Chapel Hill) or from El Futuro, Inc. (in Carrboro or Durham, NC) who have been trained in the
      treatment of eating disorders.

      Participants will participate in 25, 50 minute-long, face-to-face CBT sessions over 27 weeks.
      Participants will be randomly placed in one of two groups: CBT or CBT with family
      enhancement. Those participants who are randomly placed into the CBT group will participate
      in 25 individual therapy sessions, 3 sessions with a dietitian, and psychiatry and/or medical
      assessments as needed. Those participants who have been randomly placed into the CBT with
      family enhancement group will participate in 19 individual therapy sessions, 6 family therapy
      sessions, 3 sessions with a dietitian, and psychiatry and/or medical assessments as needed.
      All participants will also be expected to participate in baseline, week 6 (mid-treatment),
      end of treatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments.
