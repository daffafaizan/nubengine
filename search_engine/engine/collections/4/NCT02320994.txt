      flexibility (therefore complexity) of patient access and mobility between multiple care
      providers in the community setting. The investigators believe this aftercare could be better
      coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated
      multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and
      rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study
      the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to
      the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. "long-term management" as opposed
      to "early supported discharge") for disabled patients with stroke living in the community.
