      accuracy by a combination of stress testing with sensitive and specific biomarkers in
      detecting coronary artery disease or its progress. The main subjects are all patients with
      CAD or suspicion of CAD sent to the University Heart Center Hamburg. In these patients, ECG,
      laboratory examination, symptoms or transthoracic echocardiography in rest could not rule out
      CAD or progress of known CAD. The hypothesis of the study is that detection of CAD can be
      improved by adding biomarkers to stress testing for the diagnostic workup of patients with
      suspected CAD or progress of already known CAD.
