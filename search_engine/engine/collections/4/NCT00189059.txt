      amitriptyline, compared to placebo, after single (Day 1, acute effects) and repeated (Day 15,
      subchronic effects) administration on driving performance in neuropathic pain patients. In
      addition to the on-the-road driving test, laboratory tests measuring driving-related skills
      were administered. Moreover, effects of amitriptlyine on an attentional capacity task were
      tested using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). It was hypothesized that nocturnally
      administered 25 mg amitriptyline might affect driving performance negatively after acute, but
      not after subchronic treatment.
