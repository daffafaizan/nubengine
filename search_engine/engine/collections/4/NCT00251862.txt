      commonly diagnosed cancer among men and women in the United States. Screening has been shown
      to be a cost-effective strategy for reducing both CRC mortality through early detection and
      incidence through the detection and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps (adenomas).
      Despite a compelling rationale and widespread endorsement by authoritative groups, screening
      rates remain far below those necessary to achieve significant reductions in CRC mortality or
      incidence. Poor patient acceptance and non-adherence to screening recommendations are partly
      responsible for low screening rates. Shared decision-making has been advocated as a
      potentially effective yet unproven strategy for addressing this problem. Implicit in this
      approach is the need for an unbiased decision aid that not only educates patients about the
      pros and cons of the different strategies so as to enable them to identify a preferred
      strategy but also empowers patients to take a proactive role in the decision-making process,
      thereby increasing satisfaction and promoting adherence. From a logistical standpoint, the
      decision aid must also be easy to implement in the ambulatory setting so as to maximize use
      but minimize demands on physician time and office resources. To address this need, we have
      developed an interactive, web-based decision aid and implementation strategy for use in
      routine clinical practice.
