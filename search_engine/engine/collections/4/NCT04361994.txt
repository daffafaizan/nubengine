      Takotsubo syndrome during the index hospitalization and follow-up. Furthermore, long-term
      outcome data are acquired with structured telephone interviews, in case patients do not
      undergo regular outpatient visits in the participating study centers. The GEIST registry
      retrospectively includes data, which have already been collected, and prospectively continues
      to enroll patients with newly diagnosed Takotsubo syndrome.
