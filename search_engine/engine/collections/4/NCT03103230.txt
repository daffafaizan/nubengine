      disorders occur in 35% of cases, resulting in left brain damages. Aphasia is the main cause
      of these disorders. It is a sign of poor prognosis in the functional recovery after stroke.
      Recent studies have attempted to establish early clinical prognostic criteria to establish a
      predictive model of aphasia recovery. The issue of the possibility of prediction is important
      and can influence the rehabilitation treatment decided in the early days after stroke, with
      adequate guidance in rehabilitation structures.

      There are close links between motor system and language, either at production or
      comprehension, and more particularly concerning the motricity of the hand or lips. The
      cortical excitability of motor areas of the right upper limb is thus modified by the language
      in healthy subjects, but also in the aphasic person.

        -  Purpose : The main: to study, among the aphasic person, if Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP)
           performed within the first 14 days after a stroke can predict a good recovery from
           aphasia 6 months of the initial episode.

        -  Detailed description: All aphasic stroke patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic damages
           will be proposed for inclusion. All patients will benefit in the acute phase of an
           aphasia evaluation, and a clinical evaluation. All patients will have a study of motor
           evoked potentials (abductor pollicis brevis and orbicularis oris) less than 14 days from
           stroke. The investigators will evaluate the aphasia 3 and 6 months after stroke, to
           determinate if MEP can predict a good recovery of aphasia.
