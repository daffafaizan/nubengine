      of baseline BSA, if change of body weight is within 10% of baseline body weight. But, if
      there is a change of body weight more than 10% that of baseline, BSA should be recalculated.
      It will be repeated every 21 days. But the change of starting date of subsequent cycle and
      laboratory or radiologic tests may be allowed within 4 days from the scheduled date or delay
      due to toxicities. The RD-RCHOP treatment will be continued up to 6-8 cycles (or 3 cycles in
      case of stable disease(SD) or progressive disease(PD) after the first 3cycles) with duration
      of 21 days. Visit windows Â± 4days in Treatment period.
