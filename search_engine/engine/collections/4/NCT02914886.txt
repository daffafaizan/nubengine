      included in the study, subjects are getting an extensive dermatological examination by a
      pediatric dermatologist familiar with cutaneous complications of T1D, additionally
      pathological results will be documented by photography and, if necessary, videodermoscopy.
      Additionally, an evaluation of their lipoatrophic areas using imaging methods like ultrasound
      (USG) and MRI will be performed. After randomization, half of the included children switch
      their pump insulin into insulin glulisine (intervention group) for 6 months. The others
      continue their current treatment (control group) and switch to insulin glulisine 6 months
      later. Both groups are followed-up until month 12. Hence, after the 4th visit at 6 months,
      all enrolled patients are on insulin glulisine pumps for a further period of 6 months.
