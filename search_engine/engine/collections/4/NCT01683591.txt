      clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients. By using
      of stroke registry of our hospital, we assessed feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia
      screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry in patients with acute
      stroke.

      The registry had the contents of two evaluation steps; the first step was the process to
      identify the patients with risk of possible aspiration and the second step was for detection
      of silent aspirators.

      Firstly, the patient was interviewed regarding difficulties with food intake, chewing and
      swallowing, and the neurological signs were confirmed by two independent neurologists. After
      then, the patients were stratified into three aspiration risk group and controlled by proper
      diet program. Finally the emergence of aspiration pneumonia was observed.
