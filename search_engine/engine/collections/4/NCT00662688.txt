      Primary

        -  To demonstrate that preventive anticoagulation with dalteparin reduces the number of
           thromboembolic events.

        -  To determine the number of thromboembolic events occurring with preventive
           anticoagulation.

      Secondary

        -  To determine survival without thrombotic event.

        -  To determine progression-free and overall survival.

        -  To determine time to response of tumor.

        -  To assess tolerance of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center and WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive chemotherapy at investigator's discretion

        -  Arm B Patients receive chemotherapy at investigator's discretion and dalteparin In all
           arms, treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and plasma samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study. Blood is
      examined for biomarkers, resistance to activated protein C, and mutations (Leiden V factor,
      mutation G20210A, and the factor II gene). Thrombin generation and factors VIIa and VIII are
      assessed in plasma.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
