      high-intensity and resistance exercise performance. Until now the major limitation to NaHCO3
      supplementation has been the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Therefore, this study aims
      to examine the effect of chronic, progressive-dose NaHCO3 ingestion on physical capacity and
      specific performance capacity, and concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers
      in trained combat sports athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
