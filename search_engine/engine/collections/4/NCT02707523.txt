    
      Eligible participants include all children admitted to the PICU at Children's of Alabama with
      a diagnosis of RSV infection and requiring positive pressure ventilation, invasive or
      noninvasive, including bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or high flow nasal cannula
      (HFNC) oxygen (ie, >1 L/kg/min of flow, with 5 L/min flow for children weighing <5 kg).
      During hospitalization, all patients will be treated according to the American Academy of
      Pediatrics guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis, primarily supportive care.
      Participants will then be randomized according to a permuted-block design to receive either
      placebo (saline) or AZM (Fresenius Kabi) at 10mg/kg/d (ie, standard dose) or 20mg/kg/d (ie,
      high dose) intravenously every 24 hours for 3 days. All biologic samples collected will be
      analyzed in the PI's lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Drug pharmacokinetics
      will be performed at the Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Institute of Samford University,
      Birmingham, AL.
