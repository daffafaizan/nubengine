        1. characterize the significance of the variant form of EZH2 identified in this family.
           They will characterize the degree of methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 in subjects
           with the variant and members of the same family who have the wild type gene. The
           functional methyltransferase activity of the variant and wild type genes will be
           measured.

        2. characterize the current status of B-cell maturation and function in subjects with
           either the variant gene and the wild type gene.

        3. characterize B-cell function (antibody production) and the quality of antibody produced
           after immunizations in subjects with the wild type gene or the variant gene.
