        -  Compare the efficacy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP),
           and filgrastim (G-CSF) with or without rituximab on event-free survival of elderly
           patients with intermediate or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Compare the complete remission rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, WHO classification, and International Prognostic Index score. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day
           1; oral prednisone on days 1-5; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 1-14.
           Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and
           G-CSF as in arm I. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 3 of courses 1-2 and on day
           1 of courses 3-6 for a total of 6 doses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
