      in which the prevalence of students of TMD will be reported. The association between TMD and
      other variables will be also studied. Gender, Age, Psychological stress, non-nutritional oral
      habits as nail biting, lip biting, object biting and grinding of teeth (bruxism & clenching),
      Para-functional habits, such as intensive gum chewing, leaning of the chin on the hand and
      mouth breathing , previous dental treatment and previous jaw trauma will be all studied.

      Data sources and management Data sources, the answered questionnaires and subsequent spread
      sheets will only be shared by the team members.

      ddressing potential sources of bias Selection bias: Sampling will be convenient sampling,
      Questionnaires will be handed to the students, otherwise an email will be sent to all the
      students through their university email addresses if COVID-19 situation prevails.

      Statistical methods Statistical methods

      All confounders, effect modifiers and exposures will be controlled for by crude and adjusted
      regression analyses, where the primary analysis will be the adjusted one. Failure to do so as
      a result of violating principles of a regression model will call for a subgroup analysis,
      where a student t test will be used for the comparison between the subgroups.

      It is also planned to study the interactions between the variables via ANOVA test if the data
      show normal distribution.

      Participants with missing data will be excluded.

      - Cross-sectional study-Since the planned sampling method is cluster sampling, where the
      design effect factor becomes greater than 1.

      Sensitivity of the results to adjusted and crude analysis will be done.
