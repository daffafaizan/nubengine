      China, and remarkable variations of resources available and health system performance have
      been noted. Acute myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of mortality and
      morbidity, both in rural and urban area.

      This study aims to investigate and evaluate clinical performance and quality measures for
      adults with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in China. Further more, the
      investigates like to develop quality improvement strategies and relevant tools focusing on
      treatment and clinical outcome in patients with STEMI.

      This is a annually survey , through consecutively recruiting all eligible inpatients and
      collecting relevant medical information, the performance of all participating hospitals.
      Demographic characteristics, clinical features, diagnostic tests, medications, procedures,
      and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be obtained and then, the treatment pattern and
      outcomes will be evaluated. Further, quality improvement strategies including summary of
      clinical performance and quality measures, clinical pathways and professional training will
      be organized for the purpose of quality improvement. All hospitals will consecutively recruit
      qualified patients in the same method adopted in baseline period. Then the reperfusion rates
      and other performance measures will be compared annually.

      New knowledge will be generated about STEMI management in China, to improve STEMI patients
      prognosis in future.
