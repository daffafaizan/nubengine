      resulting in significant hip pain and potential long term disability. The cause of LCP is
      still unknown, but tends to occur predominantly in boys from ages 4-12. For the majority of
      those affected, observation and symptomatic treatment with oral antiinflammatories, such as
      ibuprofen, is indicated. This study represents a single center, randomized, prospective,
      controlled study comparing the treatment of LCP with an intraarticular corticosteroid
      (triamcinolone hexacetonide) injection with traditional nonoperative treatment. The
      investigators will test for improved outcomes by measuring functional outcomes (PODCI and
      ASKp questionnaires, StepWatch activity monitor), hip range of motion and visual-analog pain
      scales. The investigators hypothesize that injections of corticosteroids (potent, injectable
      antiinflammatories) will result in improved overall function through decreased pain and
      increased hip range of motion in this patient population.Additional biological research will
      be performed. There is no human information on the inflammatory response that occurs in the
      hip joint of children with Perthes disease, and there are no true animal models of Perthes
      disease. To better understand the pathobiology of Perthes disease, the collection of joint
      fluid from both hips may provide insight into the treatment of a disease for which we
      currently have no explanation of cause, and consequently no therapies
