      intervention tailored to readiness to quit smoking; or (2) the control condition (referral to
      the Smokefree.gov website). The intervention will include 12 weeks of Facebook-based messages
      and activities tailored to participants' stage of change.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking patterns and thoughts about abstinence. All participants who report no
      past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification of smoking status with
      saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
