      symptoms sometimes found in treated depression will respond as a group to psychostimulant
      therapy. This cluster includes apathy, reduced drive, fatigue, impaired executive function
      and other cognitive measures, and low positive affect. We propose to measure this cluster of
      symptoms in a population of residually depressed subjects demonstrating them, and then to
      measure the effect of stimulant therapy on this cluster, and each constituent symptom, as
      well as to measure its effect on subjects' overall functional impairment, and to document
      treatment emergent adverse effects. The goal is to gather data about the response of these
      residual symptoms to stimulant therapy. Since each subject will be exposed to active
      treatment and matched placebo, a benefit to individual participants will be to learn if their
      specific symptom burden is ameliorated by stimulant therapy, and what adverse effects may
      emerge for them. We hope to develop an understanding of the specific symptoms in this
      clinical population that are likely to improve with stimulant therapy. We also hope to be
      able to characterize the side effect burden of stimulant therapy in this clinical population.
