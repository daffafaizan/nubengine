      high-intensity, partially supervised exercise program on cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak)
      in children and adolescents who have completed acute cancer treatment. This randomized
      controlled trial will include n=56 patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to the
      intervention or the control group. Patients in the intervention group will perform two
      supervised exercise sessions per week, one personal training session and one group-based
      training session. During an initial consultation, both groups receive recommendations for
      individual physical activity goals and a brochure with exercise recommendations as well as a
      fitness tracker to monitor their daily physical activity. Only the intervention group will
      receive daily activity targets, which will be adjusted on a regular basis. The study starts 6
      weeks after completion of the patient's acute cancer treatment.

      Secondary aims of this interventional study are to evaluate additional performance markers,
      including muscle strength, functional mobility, balance, body composition and
      patient-reported outcomes including QoL, fatigue, and cognitive function as well as blood
      markers to evaluate changes in metabolic, immune, and heart health.
