      combined with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Despite aggressive therapy, however,
      nearly 50% of patients will relapse within 24 months of diagnosis. Furthermore, the
      application of high-dose methotrexate-based regimen is complex, needing be hydrated,
      alkalified and detoxified, and treatment-related toxicity mortality is severe. In an attempt
      to improve upon these poor results and reduce treatment-related side effects, we will treat
      about 15-20 relapsed PCNSL patients who was fail in high-dose methotrexate-based
      chemotherapy. Our objective is to assess our treatment strategies' availability based on
      response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.
