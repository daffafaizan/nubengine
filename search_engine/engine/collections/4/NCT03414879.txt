      compounded when the patient is treated while awake. The additional burden is to complete this
      procedure comfortably thus ensuring patient cooperation which is a vital part of successful
      performance. Several methods have been tried in literature to facilitate awake intubation by
      fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB)

      This randomized double-blinded study is performed to compare ketamine versus lidocaine for
      nebulization for awake nasal fiberoptic intubation as regard efficacy and side effects.
