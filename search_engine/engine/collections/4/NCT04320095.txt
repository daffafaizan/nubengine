    
      It is a prospective, interventional, single-center study on the performance of Bizact
      tonsillectomy device on children undergoing tonsillectomy.The required parameters concerning
      operative time and intra operative blood loss will be obtained during the procedure.There
      will be no extra clinical visits for the participants.

      Operative time will be assessed in 2 ways: 1). By using blade-tipped electrocautery on one
      tonsil and the BiZact device on the other tonsil for same patient; and 2). using
      electrocautery for removal of both tonsils and comparing the operative time to an equal
      number of cases wherein the BiZact device was used for removal of both tonsils.

      With regard to intra operative bleeding, it will be quantified into one of 3 groups: 1). No
      blood in suction tubing, 2). blood in suction tubing but not in the suction canister, and 3).
      blood in the suction canister.
