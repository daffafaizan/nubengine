    
      Subjects with Stage III resectable melanoma will receive one dose of nivolumab 480 mg IV,
      then undergo standard definitive surgery approximately 4 weeks after the initial dose of
      nivolumab. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of
      adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks or ipilimumab plus nivolumab, as determined by
      pathologic response at the time of resection. Subjects with pathologic complete response or
      near pathologic complete response (PathCR/nearCR) (Arm A) receive adjuvant nivolumab for up
      to one year. Subjects with <PathCR/nearCR are randomized 1:2 to either adjuvant nivolumab
      (480 mg) for up to one year (Arm B) or adjuvant ipilimumab (1mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3mg/kg)
      for 4 doses and then nivolumab (480 mg) alone for a total of one year (Arm C).
