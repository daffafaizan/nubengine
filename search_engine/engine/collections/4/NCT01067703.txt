      myocardial, neurological and renal dysfunction. This significant morbidity and mortality is
      at least partly due to perioperative ischaemia. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a
      novel, simple, non-invasive and inexpensive intervention by which ischaemia of non-vital
      tissue (skeletal muscles) protects remote organs (heart, brain and kidney) from a subsequent
      sustained episode of ischaemia. The investigators perform a multicenter randomized controlled
      study to evaluate that RIPC reduces teh severity of perioperative ischaemic injury in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and results in about 1/3 risk reduction in the occurence
      of major adverse events.
