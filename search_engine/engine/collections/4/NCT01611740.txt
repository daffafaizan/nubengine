      diagnosis of infection is difficult mainly due to the poor performance of clinical signs and
      to the need for invasive procedure to get blood tests. However, early administration of
      antibiotics lowers the risk of septic shock and improves long term outcome in the infected
      newborns who survive. Many clinical features have been described, associated with an ongoing
      infection but they are inconsistent, variable and nonspecific. Similarly, many invasive
      laboratory tests have been proposed for the diagnosis of infection in the newborn but they
      all need blood sampling and none has a good predictive value.

      The combined analysis of the heart rate and respiratory characteristics appears to be a
      promising tool for the diagnosis of infection in the preterm infants. These signals are
      non-invasively recorded and their computerized real time analyses would allow for a
      continuous assessment of the risk of infection.

      The main objective is to test the hypothesis that the analyses of the variability of the
      cardiac cycle duration, the variability of the respiratory cycle amplitude and duration, and
      their relationships, can significantly improve the performance of the diagnosis of late onset
      infection in the preterm infant at the bedside in neonatal units.
