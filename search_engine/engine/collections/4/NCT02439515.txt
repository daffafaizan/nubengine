      The cycling training is performed on a motorized cycle-ergometer (MOTOmed, Reck GmbH)
      equipped with force sensors mounted at the base of the cranks (PowerForce system, Radlabor
      GmbH). The acquired force signals are displayed to the subjects who are asked to achieve a
      symmetrical involvement of the two legs. To deliver FES, a current-controlled 8-channel
      stimulator (RehaStim; Hasomed GmbH) is used and surface electrodes are applied in a bipolar
      configuration on the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius lateralis, and tibialis anterior
      of both legs. Rectangular biphasic pulses with a pulse width of 400 μs and a stimulation
      frequency of 20 Hz are adopted. The stimulus intensity is set on each muscle the first day of
      training: for the paretic muscles values well tolerated by the subject and able to produce
      visibly good muscle contractions are identified, whereas for the healthy side lower values
      just above the sensory threshold are used. The stimulation timing is synchronized to the
      cycling movement according to physiological stereotyped activation patterns.

      The balance training is performed during upright stance using a balance board (Balance board
      basic™, NeuroCom® International, Inc.). Subjects are asked to keep still or move their center
      of pressure following a target displayed on a screen in front of them.
