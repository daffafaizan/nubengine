    
      This is a study of the commercially available Tetra-NIRS device to compare the results
      collected against conventional urodynamics. The study will evaluate male patients with lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as well as female subjects with over-active bladder (OAB).

      The Tetra-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in
      haemoglobin and cytochrome from the detrusor muscle from the human bladder wall. This process
      is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.g., pulse
      oximetry). Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified the correlation between the
      changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome of the bladder, and bladder pressure values obtained
      during urodynamics procedures and uroflow procedures.

      For this study the Tetra-NIRS results will not be used by the urologist/nurse to guide in
      patient management and treatment decisions, but rather will only be used to collect
      measurements from the patient for the purposes of this study. The Tetra-NIRS sensor patch
      will be adhered externally to the skin surface where the bladder is located.

      For this study, a minimum of 30 male subjects with LUTS and 30 female subjects with OAB
      scheduled to undergo a urodynamics procedure are to be enrolled. Up to 20 female subjects
      with OAB will be enrolled. The investigators will attempt to equally enrol male subjects into
      each of the two categories including obstructed and non-obstructed groups according to
      prostate hyperplasia (equivocal subjects will be determined by the investigator).
