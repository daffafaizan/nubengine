    
      Study 101-MS-322 (NCT00306592) was conducted to evaluate the safety of natalizumab
      monotherapy following re-exposure to natalizumab in former clinical trial participants in
      Studies C-1801 (NCT00027300), C-1802 (NCT00030966), and C-1803 (NCT00097760) and included
      subjects in North America. In parallel with the conduct of that study, this study (101-MS-321
      [NCT00297232]) was initiated for participants in Europe and the rest of the world. In
      addition, after 48 weeks, participants from 101-MS-322 (NCT00306592) could enter study
      101-MS-321 (NCT 00297232), which was considered the Long-Term Treatment Period of 101-MS-322
      (NCT00306592).

      The primary purpose and primary outcome for both studies are identical; therefore, the
      combined long-term data from both studies are presented. (Combined Week 48 data from both
      studies are presented in the 101-MS-322 [NCT00306592] record.)
