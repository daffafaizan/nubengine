    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the extent to which the Prosigna test
      results affect the medical oncologist's treatment recommendations regarding adjuvant
      chemotherapy and actual treatments received for patients with early stage breast cancer
      conventionally considered candidates for genomic testing based on current treatment
      guidelines. The oncologist's initial recommendations will be based on the utilization of
      tools or algorithms based on clinical and pathologic factors. No genomic tools will be used
      in the initial assessment. Changes in recommendation after availability of Prosigna test
      results will include (1) hormonal therapy alone or (2) hormonal therapy plus chemotherapy,
      and (3) changes in types of chemotherapy if chemotherapy was recommended before and after the
      test.
