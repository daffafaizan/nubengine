      section delivery (CS) among contemporary population.

      Although cesarean hysterectomy, without trying to separate placenta (placenta in-situ), is
      the standard management of PAS, uterine preservation may be routinely offered to women who
      are concerned about preserving their uteri and may be considered the primary approach in many
      institutes all over the world.

      The "Placenta Accreta Spectrum International Database (PAS-ID)" is an international database
      that was launched by Middle-East Obstetrics and Gynaecology Graduate Education (MOGGE)
      Foundation to conduct the current study.

      Eligible patients ,with criteria mentioned in following sections, will be counseled on
      participation by one of the research team. They will be added to study database by an
      independent investigator(observing investigator) who will collect baseline data and calculate
      MOGGE PAR-A score using MOGGE PAR score 1.0 software (available at:
      https://www.mogge-obgyn.com/clinical-studies). The observing investigator will continue to
      collect clinical data in subsequent visits, through delivery and postpartum visit to
      calculate MOGGE PAR-P score at the end of follow-up. If patient management involves a uterus
      preserving procedure, MOGGE CON-PAS score will be calculated as well(it will be available at:
      https://www.mogge-obgyn.com/clinical-studies). The observing investigator should not be a
      part of patients'clinical care team, which should be blinded to the calculated scores. data
      will be collected using an excel spreadsheet designed for this study. Concerned data include
      patient age, parity, body mass index,smoking, ethnicity, previous gynecologic surgeries,
      obstetric complications, gestational age at diagnosis and delivery(in weeks), method of
      diagnosis, administration of antenatal steroids, indication of delivery, pre-delivery and
      post-delivery hemoglobin (g/dl), operative management, placental site, degree of placental
      invasion, type of cesarean incision and its relation to the placenta, intra-operative and
      postoperative complications, intra-operative blood loss in ml, and transfusion of blood
