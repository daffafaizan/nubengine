    
      This randomized comparative clinical trial was carried out in Zagazig university hospitals,
      general surgery department, between March 2018 and February 2020, on 78 patients with
      transsphincteric anal fistula.

      All patients were informed and signed a written consent for participation in this study, the
      study was approved by the local ethical committee of our university the sample size was
      calculated by the statistical unit of the local institutional review board participant
      selection; participant included in this study are those above 18 years old, suffering
      transsphincteric anal fistula diagnosed by clinical examination and magnetic resonant imaging
      (MRI) in doubtful cases, We excluded all patients with;

        -  Anorectal malignancy.

        -  Patient with previous radiotherapy to the region.

        -  Those with fistula due to specific disease as Crohn's disease.

        -  Patients with anal incontinence.

        -  Patients with perianal collections.

        -  Patients on cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy. Randomization; According to
           intervention,participants were randomly allocated using computer generated random
           numbers into two groups, group A (39 patients): Patients underwent intersphincteric
           ligation of fistulous track (LIFT) and group B (39 patients): Patients underwent
           fistulectomy.

      Procedures ; All participants were subjected to full clinical examination including detailed
      history, formal digital rectal examination for assessment of anal sphincter integrity,
      identification of internal and external openings of the fistula, MRI was performed in those
      with doubtful clinical examination. Preoperative investigations performed according to
      American society of anesthesia (ASA) guidelines, all patients received 1 gm third generation
      cephalosporin with induction of anesthesia and continued for 24 hours postoperative, fleet
      enema was performed 12 hours and 2 hours before operation.

      Surgical technique;

      Under spinal anesthesia, participants under went digital rectal examination for
      identification of the internal and external openings and the fistulous track course, after
      identification of the external opening it was propped by 14 g cannula through which 2ml
      hydrogen peroxide was injected and traced through anoscope inside anal canal to identify the
      internal opening, after that the fistulous track was propped by malleable metal probe, the
      definitive procedure was then performed according to patient allocation:

      in group A; a curvilinear incision was taken in the groove between internal and external anal
      sphincters over the track course, it was deepened by sharp and blunt dissection between both
      sphincters till reaching the propped fistulous track, using monopolar diathermy when needed,
      the track was dissected all around at this point, we used Vicryl 3\0 suture to ligate the
      fistulous track at two points the medial one as near as possible to the internal sphincter
      the lateral one is close as possible to the external sphincter, the track was cut in between
      both ligatures, the lateral part of the track was curetted and the skin around the internal
      opening was trimmed.

      In group B; after identification and probing of the track fistulectomy was carried out by
      carrying out elliptical incision including internal and external openings, the fistulous
      track was excised severing the related part of the anal sphincters.

      Hemostasis was achieved as needed, wounds was dressed using non adherent dressing, patients
      received non-steroidal analgesia as per need, patients was discharged after tolerating oral
      intake.

      Follow up; It was achieved via outpatient clinics by the attending surgeon,participants were
      instructed to attend the clinic every week till complete wound healing , 3 and 6 months after
      wound healing, later on patients were contacted by phone after 1 year of the procedure, data
      to be collected throughout follow up included postoperative pain measured by visual analogue
      scale (VAS) , state of wound healing, state of continence measured by Vaizey score patient's
      questionnaire, recurrence or persistence of the fistula measured by history and clinical
      examination.

      Statistical analysis; Operative and hospital stay time together with follow up data were
      collected and statistically analyzed using paired t test and Z test in SPSS program package
