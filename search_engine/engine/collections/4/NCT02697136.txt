      Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive CER-001 or placebo
      (2:1 randomization scheme). Randomized subjects will return weekly for a total of 9 infusions
      and then biweekly for an additional 20 infusions. 3TMRI imaging of the carotid and femoral
      arteries will be performed at Week 8, Week 24 (primary endpoint) and Week 48. The total study
      duration from randomization can range from 50 to 54 weeks for patients completing the study
      as designed.
