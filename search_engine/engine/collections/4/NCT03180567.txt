      types in warfarin resistance genomes. (2) To determine whether other polymorphisms in
      noncoding regions or their unique haplotype combinations contribute to the variability in the
      maintenance dose of warfarin, and (3)personalization of the drug and deciding the correct
      dose from the start.
