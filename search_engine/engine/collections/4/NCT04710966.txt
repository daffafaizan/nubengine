      arthroscopic debridement and arthroscopic repair for Ellman grade II BPTRCTs. Participants
      were recruited from September 2017 to April 2019. Before initiating the trial, an
      investigator who was not involved in the study generated a computer-generated randomization
      list (block length 10, ratio 1:1). Allocation concealment was achieved by using opaque,
      sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes containing details of group assignment. Assignment
      occurred after baseline information was recorded. Whereas participants and surgeons were
      aware of the group assignments, the outcome assessors and data analysts were remained blinded
      during the study period. Operations were performed by the same team of sports medicine
      surgeons under general anesthesia. For the debridement group, only stump refreshing and
      surrounding soft tissue cleaning were performed. For the repair group, partial tears were
      converted into full-thickness tears and sutured. The sample size calculation was based on
      data from previous studies, where the difference in Constant-Murray Shoulder (CMS) score
      between patients with arthroscopic repair and arthroscopic debridement was 8.81 points (93.90
      vs. 85.09) with standard deviations of 5.4 and 21. Accepting an α risk of 0.05 and a β risk
      of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, the minimum sample size required for each group was 35. To
      compensate for an estimated 15% loss to follow up, at least 82 patients would be included.
