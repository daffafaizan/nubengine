    
      This is a phase Ⅰ, first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-102 injection
      in subjects with CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors.

      Dose Escalation Traditional '3+3' escalation design will be used. Dose escalation consists of
      five ascending dose levels of LM-102 (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg).
      All subjects will be administered every 3 weeks (1 cycle=21 days) with a dose of LM-102 as a
      2 h (120±10 min) intravenous (IV) infusion until the disease progression, intolerance,
      subject discontinuation/informed consent withdrawal, or at the discretion of the investigator
      in consultation with sponsor.

      After all the subjects in each cohort complete the DLT assessment, the safety monitor
      committee (SMC) will make decisions for dose escalations, exploring intermediate/higher doses
      or terminating dose escalations according to the safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity
      data. The SMC may also adjust the dosage, frequency of administration, PK sample collection
      plan, etc.

      Based upon safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity, the MTD or OBD will be determined by
      SMC. And the RP2D will be determined based on DLTs, MTD or OBD, and the totality of the
      safety data throughout the study, including dose modifications and delays, PK, and
      immunogenicity data, etc.

      The study will consist of 3 periods:

        1. Screening period (up to 28 days before the first dose);

        2. Treatment period;

        3. Follow-up period [28 (±3) days after end of treatment (EOT)/early withdrawal or before
           other anti-tumor treatments (whichever occurs earlier)].

      Safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity evaluation of LM-102 will be conducted
      throughout the study.
