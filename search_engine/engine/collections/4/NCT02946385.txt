    
      Naive subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive MenABCWY or rMenB+OMV at Day 1. No
      randomization to treatment arm for follow-on subjects is required as vaccine groups remain
      the same as in the parent study V102_15 (NCT02212457).

      Response to a booster dose of MenABCWY vaccine will also be assessed in follow-on subjects
      who received 2 or 3 doses of MenABCWY (at 0.2-, 0,.6- or 0,.2,.6-month schedules) in the
      parent study, and will be compared with responses to a single dose of MenABCWY in naive
      subjects (subjects who are meningococcal vaccine-naive and of similar age to subjects
      enrolled from the parent study).

      Response to a booster dose of GSK Meningococcal B Recombinant vaccine (rMenB+OMV) will be
      assessed in subjects who received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV (at 0, 2-month schedule) in the parent
      study, and will be compared with responses to a single dose of rMenB+OMV in naive subjects.
