      The study involves program development, implementation, and evaluation of resilience training
      by a randomized controlled research design. The participant will be randomized to the
      intervention group to receive the resilience training program "Engaged and Resilient" or a
      wait-list control group to receive the resilience training conducted by internal educated
      trainers following the post-intervention measures.

      Pre- and post measures include mental health, flourishing, perceived stress, resilience (two
      scales), and work-related performance. The training effects will be measured after each
      training session on a 4-point scale to create knowledge about the specific resilience
      promoting factors and the implementation process.

      The intervention project will consist of a didactic component, including an internal trainer
      education for the Management/HR and more specific for the participants (leaders):
      Psychoeducation, psychological skill-building training, and ongoing homework exercises to
      support the implementation of resilience strategies within the organizational context.

      Operational objectives:

        -  To develop a flexible (co-customized, co-implemented) resilience training program for
           leaders in organizations structured as thee general resilience factors with specific
           training sessions within each

        -  To implement a resilience intervention for leaders in public and private Danish
           organizational environments

        -  To demonstrate outcome effects on human health and performance. Primary in terms of
           mental health and well-being, and secondary in perceived stress, resilience,
           work-related performance, and sick-leave

        -  To provide evidence of specific resilience factors promoting positive mental health and
           well-being longitudinally (20 weeks)

        -  To create knowledge about the implementation and change process by ongoing participant
           evaluation of the specific training sessions
