      insufficiency and results in a dramatic deterioration of the quality of life. We developed a
      new therapeutic strategy for stress urinary incontinence based on the implantation myofibers
      with their satellite cells. The principle of this procedure relies on the activation in vivo
      of the satellite cells present around each myofibers. Satellite cell activation is
      concomitant with myofiber death that occurs after their implantation. Activated satellite
      proliferate and fuse to form myotubes replacing the parental myofibers thus leading to the
      reconstitution of the muscle mass that was initially implanted. Preliminary studies in the
      pig showed the regenerated muscle tissue in the urethra was innervated by urethral nerves and
      developed tonic contractions acting like a new sphincter. This procedure does not include a
      phase of satellite cell amplification ex vivo, as standard methods of satellite cell
      transfer, and rather relies on the natural myogenic capacities of these cells. Thus, the
      procedure of cell transfer into the urethra is considerably simplified and can be performed
      in one step in the operating room.This therapeutic strategy could represent an alternative to
      the artificial urinary sphincter.
