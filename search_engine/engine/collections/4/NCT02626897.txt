      GT3X) in 12 patients with sarcoidosis. Participants wear one device for 7 days before
      returning the device, and wear the second device to wear for a further 7 day period. Each
      participant will wear the devices for 24 hours throughout the measurement period. The devices
      will be worn in a random order, randomised using sealed envelopes. They will be advised not
      to remove the devices during the 7 day monitoring period, with the exception of the GT3X
      which should be removed if the participant is bathing or swimming (they are able to shower).
      When each device is returned the participants will be asked to complete an exit questionnaire
      on their experience with the device. Before the participants wear the devices they will be
      asked to complete a short question regarding how tired/fatigued they feel.

      The devices will be worn on the participant's non-dominant wrist. They will wear both devices
      in a random order (determined by randomisation at the start of the trial with regards to
      which device will be worn first). Six participants will start with the GENEActiv device and
      six will begin with the Actigraph GT3X device. The device order will be chosen randomly based
      upon a random number sequence generated in Microsoft Excel and placed in envelopes numbered 1
      to 12.
