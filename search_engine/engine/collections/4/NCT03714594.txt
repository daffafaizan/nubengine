      inhibits SGLT2, promote the excretion of 80-90 grams of glucose per day in the urine, and
      lower the plasma glucose concentration. This class of drugs has been shown to effectively
      reduce the HbA1c at all stages of T2DM and can be used in combination of all other
      anti-diabetic agents including insulin.

      Saxagliptin is a highly potent DPP4 inhibitor.In patients with type 2 diabetes,
      administration of saxagliptin led to inhibition of DPP4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour
      period.After an oral glucose load,this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in
      circulating levels of active incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), decreased glucagon concentrations and
      increased glucose-dependent beta-cell responsiveness, which resulted in higher insulin and
      C-peptide concentrations.The rise in insulin from pancreatic beta-cells and the decrease in
      glucagon from pancreatic alpha-cells were associated with lower fasting glucose
      concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a
      meal.Saxagliptin improves glycaemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose
      concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes.
