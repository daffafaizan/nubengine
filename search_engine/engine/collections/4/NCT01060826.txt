      bolus before starting the ERCP procedure followed by a continuous infusion for 4 hours after
      endoscopic proof could prevent acute post-ERCP pancreatitis. Patients submitted to ERCP will
      be randomized in two groups of treatment, one will receive somatostatin and another placebo.
      The main aim of this study will be the incidence of acute post-ERCP pancreatitis and
      secondary objectives will be identify sub-groups of patient with high risk to develop
      post-ERCP pancreatitis, who could benefit of pharmacologic prophylaxis before the
      exploration. The study will include 510 patients submitted to an ERCP during a period of 3
      years.
