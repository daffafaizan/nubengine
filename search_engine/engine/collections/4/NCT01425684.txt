      cross-sectional study design that measures brain imaging, smoking, clinical diagnosis and
      symptoms, cognitive functional assessments, distress tolerance, and genetic information,
      which is also the baseline for the longitudinal study; and (2) a longitudinal study design
      for smoking cessation option for 1 year in some smokers and a longitudinal follow-up for all
      available subjects.

      During the baseline portion of the study, subjects are expected to complete clinical symptom
      assessments, a computer challenge task to measure distress tolerance, MRI scan, role-play
      test to measure cognitive and functional abilities, and blood draw. Subjects who are eligible
      will participate in the longitudinal follow-up study where the research team will call
      subjects regularly regarding smoking related information (smoking risk and treatment
      options).
