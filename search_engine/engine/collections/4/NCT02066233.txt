      tandem design. The E.G. Scan II is a transnasal endoscope system to capture and transmit
      images of the esophagus. Captured images can be reviewed via the E.G. View for diagnosis of
      diseases related to the esophagus. Generally, the commercial esophagoscope system has
      reusable probes, but E.G. Scanâ„¢ II has a single use probe because reusable probes have the
      risk of infection and pollution.

      Prior to the E.G.Scan, subjects received a standard prep for the procedure. The two
      procedures were performed by two different experienced endoscopists who were blinded to the
      indication of the procedure. At both procedures a note was made of any abnormality of the
      esophagus. Every subject with an endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus had clinical
      biopsies taken to confirm diagnosis. Subject tolerability was measured with a 10-point visual
      analog scale (VAS) where 0 represented the "worst experience" and 10 the "best experience."
