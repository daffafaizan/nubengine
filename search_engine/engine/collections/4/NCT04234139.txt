      transplantation for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The goal of this research is
      twofold:

        1. Establish a knowledge base necessary for appropriate liver transplant candidate
           selection by quantifying post-ELT mortality for SAH and compare to outcomes to liver
           transplantation for other indications

        2. Develop an ethical framework for implementation of these transplants for SAH based on
           the opinions of healthcare providers and the general public.
