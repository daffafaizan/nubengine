    
      Phase 1a will employ an adaptive model guided with overdose control principle to make dose
      recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PEN-866 (single agent).

      Phase 1b will employ a standard 3 + 3 design to make dose recommendations and estimate the
      MTD of PEN-866 in combination therapy.

      Phase 2a (single agent) will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamics profile of PEN-866 (single agent) at the recommended Phase 2 dose determined
      at the conclusion of Phase 1a in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
