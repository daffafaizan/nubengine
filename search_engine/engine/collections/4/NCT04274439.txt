      third of the adult population worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with higher prevalence
      rates reported for low-income countries. Internet-based self-management programs have grown
      with the development of new technologies and have been extensively used for delivering
      healthcare in many areas. However, there is still little research on the development and
      testing of remotely-delivered programs for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain,
      especially in low and mid-income countries. The aim of this clinical trial is to develop and
      test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet-based self-management program
      based on pain education and exercise for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
