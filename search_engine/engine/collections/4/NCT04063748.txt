      To determine an optimal, personalized AR scheme (considering age, degree of HI) and possible
      interacting factors (e.g., training time, type of errors)

      To investigate transfer of auditory and auditory-cognitive training to listening skills in
      everyday life

      To develop evidence-based guidelines for clinical AR

      The study will start with baseline assessment (speech in noise understanding, LIST sentences
      and cognitive tests (executive functioning, important for listening skills). This will be
      followed by 8 weeks of training, an intermediate assessment moment, again 8 weeks of
      training, and final evaluation moment. After 6 month follow-up evaluation to investigate
      retention.
