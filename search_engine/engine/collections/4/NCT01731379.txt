    
      The aim of this pilot study is to prove that an investigational optical spectroscopy system
      can provide accurate identification of nerve tissue during surgery.

      Primary Objective:

      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether optical spectroscopy is able to
      differentiate between nerve tissue and surrounding tissue.

      Secondary Objective:

      During the measurement procedure, possible improvements of the measurement hardware will be
      recorded and the handling of the optical spectroscopy system during surgery will be
      evaluated.
