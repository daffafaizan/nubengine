    
      Prospective population-based study of specimens from patients that underwent surgical
      resection for rectal cancer in VÃ¤stmanland County, Sweden. Specimens were divided in 3
      sections (A-C) and the total amount of lymph nodes and the location of lymph node metastases
      were analysed.

      Multivariate analysis was used to explore the relationship between lymph node counts and age,
      gender, BMI, preoperative oncological treatment, type of surgery, tumour stage, vessel and
      specimen length.
