      Findings from conditioning studies indicate that fear reduction following a fear extinction
      procedure can generalize from the extinction stimulus to other conceptually and perceptually
      related stimuli. This study is aimed at translating these findings to a clinical application
      and will hence examine whether the basic principles of extinction generalization are
      applicable to exposure.

      Patients with spider phobia will either receive two sessions of in-vivo exposure with spiders
      or no treatment. Prior to as well as after treatment, patient's fear of spiders will be
      assessed using the Behavioral Approach Test (BATs) and self-report questionnaires. In
      addition, BATs with cockroaches will be conducted to examine the effects of exposure therapy
      on extinction generalization.
