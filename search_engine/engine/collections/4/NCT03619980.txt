    
      This is a retrospective analysis of Prostate Cancer patients from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC,
      m1CRPC followed in the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe) database. The patient
      population consists of men recorded in Patient-overview Prostate Cancer (PPC) between 1
      January 2014 until death or 31 December 2016. Patient history to 2006 was collected by
      retrospective charted review.

      Data will be extracted from PPC for the different Prostate Cancer (PCa) disease stages, from
      m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death. The prostate cancer disease
      progression from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death has not been
      recorded in a systematic way. Given the complexity of this disease, the aim of this study is
      to have a comprehensive understanding about the disease progression in prostate cancer, from
      m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death.

      In addition, the following will be collected: co-morbidities, co-medication, health care
      resource utilization and costs, as well as other health economic variables such as sick leave
      and early retirement at the different disease stages.
