      This study will measure the mucosal response to daily intravaginal applications of 1%
      tenofovir gel versus placebo in two groups of women at low risk for HIV infection.

      The duration of this study for each participant is 21 days. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 participants will apply 1% tenofovir
      gel daily for 14 consecutive days between menses. Group 2 participants will apply placebo gel
      for 14 consecutive days between menses.

      Study visits will occur on Days 3, 7, 14, and 21. Study entry will occur 2 to 6 days
      following the menses and within 30 days of screening. Medical and sexual history, a pelvic
      exam, cervicovaginal lavage sample collection, blood collection, vaginal pH testing, STI
      testing, and adverse effect reporting will occur at all visits. All participants will be
      asked to complete a diary throughout the study; this diary will be reviewed at all study
      visits. A Pap smear will be obtained at screening if documentation of a negative Pap smear
      result within the last year is not available.
