      RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly work on the cardiomyocyte and restored the
      normal structure and function of it. Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail
      have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively enhance the heart function, reverse the remodeling of
      left ventricular, and reduce all-cause mortality in heart failure animals and humans. In this
      phase III study, the investigators will further confirm the efficacy of rhNRG-1 in reducing
      the death rate of heart failure.
