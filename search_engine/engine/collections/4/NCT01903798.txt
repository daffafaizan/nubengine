    
      This is a prospective, randomized trial of two experimental treatments, prednisolone +
      mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone + rilonacept, in comparison with standard of care, in
      patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Patients will start therapy with prednisolone. At Day 8
      response to prednisolone will be determined using the Lille score. Patients with a Lille
      score â‰¥ 0.45 will be randomized to standard of care (continue prednisolone, stop all therapy
      and/or offer palliative care) or to have prednisolone continued and mycophenolate added for
      the next three weeks. Patients with a Lille score <0.45 will be randomized to continue
      prednisolone alone (standard of care) or to have rilonacept added to their treatment regimen
      (experimental group) for the next three weeks. Patients will complete follow-up visits at
      Week 12 and Week 24.
