      these patients signaling via the ER induces proliferation and cell survival of malignant
      cells. Fulvestrant can inhibit this signaling route by blocking the receptor and decreasing
      ER-expression by increasing its turn-over rate.

      The historical standard dose of fulvestrant was 250mg every 28 days i.m.; however studies
      performing serial biopsies showed that ER-downregulation was suboptimal. Recently the
      standard dose has been set to 500mg i.m. on day 1; 14; 28 and every 28 days thereafter.
      Although slightly more effective than the 250mg dose, still questions remain with respect to
      the required dose to establish maximal downregulation of ER-signaling.

      Immunohistochemistry only provides static information, i.e. the level of ER-expression.
      However, dynamic information evaluating the effects of fulvestrant on occupancy of ERs, may
      also be valuable.

      Whole-body imaging of the availability of ER binding sites using FES-PET may prove valuable
      to evaluate the effects of fulvestrant on the ER non-invasively in individual patients. This
      potentially allows adjustment of dosing in individual patients to aid therapy efficacy.

      In this pilot-study we will evaluate 15 metastatic breast cancer patients. All patients will
      undergo FES-PET/CT at baseline, FES-PET after 1 month, and FES-PET/CT after three months.
      Hormone- and fulvestrant levels will be measured in all patients. Whenever possible, tumor
      biopsies will be performed to correlate to FES-PET results.
