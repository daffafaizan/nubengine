      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics of Indomethacin in pregnant
      patients with the hypothesis that that estradiol levels during pregnancy (12-32 weeks of
      gestation) and CYP2C9 polymorphisms affect the PK of indomethacin, and subsequently, the
      response to indomethacin therapy in patients at risk of Preterm birth (PTB). This hypothesis
      will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) Determine the PK of indomethacin in
      pregnant women at risk of PTB and its PD effects on reducing the rate of PTB before 34 weeks
      of gestation, as well as any associations between the PK and secondary maternal/neonatal
      clinical outcomes; (2) Determine the effects of maternal levels of estradiol in mid-pregnancy
      and CYP2C9 polymorphisms on indomethacin biotransformation to O-desmethylindomethacin in
      pregnant patients; (3) Construct a population PK/PD model of indomethacin in patients at risk
      of PTB (12-32 weeks of gestation) in order to optimize the dose and the dosing frequency for
      indomethacin prescribed to each individual based on covariates such as race/ethnicity, CYP2C9
      genotype, gestational age, estradiol levels, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI). The
      investigators will enroll 300 subjects with spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL) or shortened
      cervix in a prospective opportunistic PK study designed to correlate the PK of indomethacin,
      patient genotype, and clinical outcomes. The investigators will merge dosing, sampling,
      demographic, and clinical information with the drug concentration data and use population PK
      methodologies to analyze the data using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. Quantification of
      the differences within and between individuals allows for identification of covariates (e.g.,
      CYP2C9 genotype, estradiol levels, BMI, etc.) that can explain variability and affect drug
      exposure. These covariates, if significant, can then be used in the future to optimize dosing
      in individual patients at risk for PTB. Achieving this goal of individualized indomethacin
      therapy could have a significant impact on clinical practice and improve maternal and
      neonatal outcomes.
