      demonstrating a directional preference upon physical examination during their initial
      evaluation will be recruited. Patients will be queried as to interest and those interested
      will be consented. Patients will then be randomized utilizing a computer generated
      randomization chart to receive either MDT or MT delivered in a pragmatic manner. Outcomes
      will include: Pain (PEG), Quality of Life (PROMIS Global Health Survey (GHS)), psychosocial
      questions and Self Efficacy (2 Question). Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks and
      8 weeks post baseline.
