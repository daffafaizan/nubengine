      study (inclusion period: 12 months). These patients will be randomly divided into two groups:
      one treated with MTA®, and the other one with calcium hydroxide. For each patient, the total
      duration of the study will be 12 months. Recalls will be performed at 15 and 21 days and then
      at 3, 6 and 12 months to assess by clinical and X-ray exams the main success criterion:
      presence of a calcified apical barrier or not. Additional criterions such as presence of
      clinical symptoms or not, apical morphology and depth of this apical barrier will be
      observed. This randomised prospective therapeutic study will allow to assess the ability of
      MTA® inducing apexification of a non vital immature tooth. Furthermore, it will be possible
      to compare for both materials the kinetics of clinical symptoms disappearance and the
      morphology and depth of apices.
