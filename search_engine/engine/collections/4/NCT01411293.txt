      for ~830,000 deaths annually. Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are fundamental
      mechanisms leading to vascular endothelial dysfunction because of their role in reducing
      nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Greater intakes of dairy foods have been associated with a
      lower incidence of CVD-related morbidity. Although the mechanisms by which dairy protects
      against CVD remain unclear, epidemiological and experimental evidence suggest that the
      concerted actions of bioactive milk-derived peptides and micronutrients may protect against
      hypertension and future CVD risk by improving vascular endothelial function. Therefore, the
      objective of this study is to define the mechanisms by which the acute consumption of low-fat
      milk protects against postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction by reducing oxidative
      stress responses that limit NO bioavailability to the vascular endothelium. In this study,
      participants having the metabolic syndrome will ingest low-fat milk or rice milk on a single
      occasion. Then, vascular function and biomarkers of oxidative stress and NO metabolism will
      be monitored at 30 min intervals throughout a 180 min postprandial period. Collectively,
      these studies will help identify how postprandial vascular function is regulated in
      individuals at high-risk for CVD, and whether low-fat dairy consumption can be used as a
      strategy to better improve vascular function.
