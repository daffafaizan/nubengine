      unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of
      approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may
      provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells
      can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly
      reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the
      ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance
      pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those
      with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders,
      hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety
      concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior
      to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an
      evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial
      is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy
      in this vulnerable population.
