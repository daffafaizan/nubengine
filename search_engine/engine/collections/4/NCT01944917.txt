      during their weekly visits to the Department for Complementary Medicine at Sheba Medical
      Center. Patient will be exposed to 20 minutes of weak intensity and low frequency
      electromagnetic field while seated, during which heart rate variability measures will be
      recorded. In addition, patient tolerability to the exposed electromagnetic field will be
      investigated, including VAS score (pain score). This is a double blind placebo-control study
      by which neither the patients nor the physicians know which treatment is given to the
      patients. The study code will be open only at the end of the trial.
