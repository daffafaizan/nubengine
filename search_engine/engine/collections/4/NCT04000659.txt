    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of
      the Episealer Knee System (Episealer Trochlea Solo, Episealer Femoral Twin, and Episealer
      Condyle Solo) compared to microfracture (with or without debridement) in a group of subjects
      that require repair of a focal femoral chondral or osteochondral lesion in the knee.

      Clinical success will be analyzed via subject reported outcomes to measure function and pain
      improvements as compared to baseline, incidence of secondary surgical interventions for the
      treated knee, absence of subsidence or migration through radiographic assessment, and
      assessment of weight-bearing status.
