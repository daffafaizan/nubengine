    
      Our overall research goal for this project is to create a wearable device and mobile
      application, appealing to patients with COPD, which provides them with appropriate
      self-management tools and detects Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) early to permit
      prompt treatment and prevent severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Currently, the
      investigators are developing a second version of this app, WearCOPDv2. This app will
      incorporate features identified as being desirable from our patient interviews: 1) new sensor
      that was requested by patients - oxygen saturation, and 2) the app will incorporate a
      patient-facing interface as patients requested a method to view their data as well as access
      to information to learn how to manage their condition better.

      Research questions:

      Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve
      self-management of COPD?

      What is the accuracy of our sensor data (heart rate, activity, respiratory rate, oxygen
      saturation, coughing, and other sounds of interest) in detecting early AECOPDs?
