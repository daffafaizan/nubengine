      improvement initiatives involving both patients and physicians may be more effective than
      physician-directed approaches alone.

      In a large urban primary care internal medicine practice, this study seeks to test if a
      patient-directed intervention is more effective than computerized clinician reminders alone
      for improving the appropriate use of aspirin in adults with diabetes.

      The study design is a cluster-randomized trial by physician. The frequency of self-reported
      regular aspirin use will be compared between patients cared for by physicians in the
      computerized reminder alone group and the computerized reminder plus physician-supervised,
      nurse practitioner intervention group.
