      an uncommon but devastating complication. One of the risk factors that has been reported is
      increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which may decrease perfusion pressure to the optic
      nerve. Intraocular pressure in anesthetized, prone spine patients has been studied with the
      head in neutral position. The prone position and duration of the procedure did increase the
      IOP. Our hypothesis is that adjusting the position of the head in space will alter the
      intraocular pressure, with an extended position decreasing IOP. This study is a, randomized,
      controlled design: neutral head position (standard care) or extended head position
      (intervention group). Patients who qualify for spinal fusion surgery and meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to either the neutral (standard practice) or the intervention
      group.Randomization of patients will be computer generated.
