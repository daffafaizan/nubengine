    
      Randomized Quantitative Clinical Trial. There will be 48 participants randomly assigned codes
      numbers and placed into a treatment group or non treatment group with 24 candidates in each.
      The control group will not be receiving treatments whereas the experimental group will be
      receiving four global osteopathic treatment over a six week period. All participants in both
      groups will have a baseline blood work provided by Dr. Peltekian a month before commencement
      of treatment. These patients have routine blood work every three months to begin with so they
      will get their second bloodwork done after the treatment sessions.

      Each group will also fill out the Chronic liver disease questionnaire to measure quality of
      life and the URICA to measure their readiness to change a week before the first treatment,
      and a week after the last treatment session.

      The study objectives is to observe a difference between blood work pre and post treatment
      that osteopathy has influenced and improved liver function based on liver enzyme count. Also
      to observe an improvement in the patients quality of life after receiving treatment and in
      their readiness to change. The researcher hopes to validate osteopathy as another treatment
      option to give NAFLD patients.
