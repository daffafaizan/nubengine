    
      For the clinical trial being described in this registration, participants will be observed to
      collect data for baseline assessment of disease and patient characteristics. This will be
      done before proton therapy on other trials followed by serial standard-of-care clinical
      assessments to evaluate acute and late complications, disease control, treatment-related
      mortality, and overall survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the incidence of radiation associated grade 3 and grade 4 non-hematologic
           toxicities at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years in a radiated region specific manner after the
           initiation of proton therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the incidence of necrosis, vasculopathy, and symptomatic and permanent
           neurologic deficits at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after the initiation of proton therapy in
           children treated for central nervous system (CNS) tumors in an irradiated region
           directed manner.

        -  To estimate the incidence of treatment-related mortality at 5 and 10 years after the
           initiation of proton therapy.

        -  To estimate the incidence of subsequent malignancies at 5 and 10 years after the
           initiation of proton therapy in an irradiated region directed manner.

        -  To estimate the incidence of fracture and osteonecrosis at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after
           the initiation of proton therapy in children treated for musculoskeletal tumors in an
           irradiated region directed manner.
