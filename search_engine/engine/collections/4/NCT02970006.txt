      neuropathic pain. The mechanisms underlying the efficacy of SCS are unknown. Recent advances
      in cognitive neuroprosthetics using virtual reality allow for modulation of body perception
      and bodily experience, which has also been shown to modulate pain perception. The present
      research proposal plans to merge expertise in cognitive neuroprosthetics with neuromodulation
      techniques in order to test the analgesic properties of the combination of epidural spinal
      cord stimulation with a new system of multisensory stimulation based on virtual and enhanced
      reality (i.e., neuro-visual stimulation). The investigators propose to study this hypothesis
      prospectively in 25 patients with implanted SCS systems for the treatment of chronic
      neuropathic pain. Primary outcomes will be pain reduction (based on subjective, functional
      and physiological measures) and changes in body perception (based on subjective and objective
      measures). The present study will generate a proof-of-concept for the application of
      neuro-visual stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain and will form the basis for future
      NIH funding application.
