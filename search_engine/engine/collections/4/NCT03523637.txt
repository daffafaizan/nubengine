      treatment of variety of problems where body sensations are experienced as threatening. The
      application of IE is expected to reduce the threat value of pain and subsequently promote
      recovery. This study will evaluate the effects of IE and will briefly comprises of: education
      session explaining the rationale behind IE practice, teaching of the technique, supervised IE
      practice and self-monitored home practice twice daily for the period of two weeks. Depending
      on the length of baseline (i.e. observation period before the start of intervention) the
      study will last between 6 and 8 weeks. Daily Diary, a short nine item instrument was designed
      to measure the pain experience (intensity and interference) and fear of pain on a daily
      basis. Other, standard outcome measures include: pain related anxiety, pain catastrophising,
      pain related disability, knowledge about pain and general anxiety and depression. Study
      participants will be recruited during routine psychology screening assessment at the Pain
      Clinic at St James' Hospital. This study will recruit from clinical psychology waiting list
      patients.
