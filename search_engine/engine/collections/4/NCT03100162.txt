      cardiometabolic risk, intestinal epithelial permeability, metabolic activity and intestinal
      flora composition, mineral content, and lifestyle in obese women with metabolic syndrome.

      Probiotics are a group of non-pathogenic microbes that bring health benefits to the host.
      Their use enables the variety and proper functioning of intestinal microflora. The use of
      probiotics increases the amount of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, what directly affects the
      reduction of endotoxemia by sealing the intestinal wall, as well as the improvement of fat,
      carbohydrate and insulin metabolism.

      The project is due to evaluate the effect of supplementation with selected probiotics in
      patients with metabolic syndrome on:

        -  lipid metabolism- total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides,

        -  blood glucose concentration,

        -  blood pressure values,

        -  anthropometric parameters,

        -  quality of life,

        -  the contentl of minerals,
