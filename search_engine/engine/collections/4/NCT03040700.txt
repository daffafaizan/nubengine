      associated with impairment in quality of life, and with a high risk for cardiovascular events
      including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Because of the anatomical and/or
      functional extension of the disease, combined with high-risk clinical features (left
      ventricular dysfunction, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease to name a few), many patients
      must undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. In the USA, 400,000 CABG
      surgeries are performed annually.

      Although the benefits of CABG for those high-risk patients have been well established in the
      long-term, the best follow-up strategy after surgery is still controversial. Current
      guidelines generally recommend that the follow-up of patients after CABG should be based on
      the same strategies proposed for patients with stable angina. The investigators hypothesized
      that the early identification of myocardial ischemia or progression of coronary
      atherosclerosis, even in asymptomatic patients, may be superior to clinical follow-up alone
      for the prevention of cardiovascular events.
