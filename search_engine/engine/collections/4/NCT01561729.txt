    
      Primary objective:

      To assess the level of accuracy of the RightSpot pH Indicator in determining correct
      placement of NG/OG tubes as compared to the gold standard of CXR in Emergency Department &
      ICU patients.

      Hypothesis 1: In greater than 90% of the cases, RightSpot pH Indicator will be successful in
      confirming the placement of NG/OG tubes by demonstrating a pH of 4.5 or less in patients with
      CXR proven tube placement.

      Hypothesis 2: The time to confirmation of NG/OG tube placement will be significantly less
      using the RightSpot pH Indicator than using CXR. The time will be calculated by the start
      time consisting of the time that the NG/OG tube was placed until the end time, which will be
      when the device pH Indicator testing is performed. The time to confirmation using the gold
      standard of a CXR will begin when the NG/OG tube is placed and end when the CXR is available
      on PACS (picture archiving and communication system).

      Secondary objective:

      To determine via subgroup analysis whether gross blood in the stomach, presence of
      acid-reducing medications, or trauma affects the accuracy of NG/OG placement determination by
      the RightSpot pH Indicator.
