      to taste different commonly consumed substances, including the bitter compound
      phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) as a model. Individuals will be tested to identify those who can
      and cannot taste PTC, as well as for their ability to taste a variety of sweet, sour, salty,
      and savory substances. Individuals will have 20 cc of blood drawn to obtain DNA. These DNA
      samples will then be analyzed for variation in genes whose products are known to be involved
      in taste perception pathways. Information about individuals DNA sequence variation will then
      be correlated with their taste phenotype to identify the specific genetic variation that
      causes phenotypic variation, providing molecular structure-function information in taste
      sensory pathways.
