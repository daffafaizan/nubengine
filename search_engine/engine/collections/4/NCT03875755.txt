    
      Prospective, multicenter, superiority, randomised, double blind study with two arms.

        1. In the 11 participating centers (9 in France and 2 in Belgium): selection of women with
           GDM between 12 and 34 weeks of gestation

        2. Explanation of protocol, with signature of consent in case of acceptation.

        3. Randomization

             -  Experimental group: The women will receive 2 caps of MI with acid folic a day,
                until delivery

             -  Control group: The women will receive 2 caps of placebo (containing only acid
                folic) a day, until delivery

           In both arms, the participants will be routinely followed up during pregnancy:

             -  diet education,

             -  self-monitoring of blood glucose before and after meals

             -  and during follow-up insulin therapy if glucose value targets are unmet

        4. Routine monitoring of the women with GDM in both arms, up to delivery, without use of
           other oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.

           At delivery:

             -  MI (or placebo) will be stopped

             -  Maternal blood samples will be collected at the same time as the sample routinely
                collected just before delivery for irregular agglutinin test measurement, when the
                women are perfused and cord fluid will be collected at the same as cord fluid pH is
                routinely measured just after delivery. The aliquots will be transported to the
                "Centre de Ressources Biologiques"(CRB) of the Jean Verdier Hospital

             -  Events during pregnancy will be collected

        5. Last visit three months after delivery. Oral glucose tolerance test, anthropometric
           measures for women and their child.
