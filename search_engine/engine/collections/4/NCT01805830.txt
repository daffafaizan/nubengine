           50% of treated Type 2 diabetic subjects do not reach currently accepted goals for
           HbA1c(Oral communication, American Diabetic Association, 2008)

        -  Subjects are frequently prescribed agents which can cause hypoglycemia, and/or weight
           gain. Metformin does not usually have these unwanted effects, and it is the standard
           first line therapy in treating type 2 diabetic mellitus in European union.

        -  Nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies revealed that MP-513 effectively improves glucose
           tolerance in animal models of type 2 diabetes, whilst the compound has very little
           potential to cause hypoglycaemia, the most commonly reported adverse event with many
           currently marketed products.

        -  The nonclinical studies also suggested that the inhibitory effect of MP-513 on DPP-Ⅳ is
           more potent and durable than other DPP-Ⅳ inhibitors in development. The result in safety
           pharmacology and toxicology also revealed that MP-513 has a relatively wide margin for
           safety.

        -  Thus, MP-513 is expected to have good efficacy and tolerability in subjects with type 2
           diabetes mellitus by once-daily administration.
