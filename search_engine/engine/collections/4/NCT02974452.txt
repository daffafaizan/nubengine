      Twenty young adults (20-42), 20 middle-aged adults (43-67) and 20older adults (>68) were
      recruited. A comparative electromyography (EMG) study was performed on the upper and lower
      trapezius, middle deltoid, infraspinatus and serratus anterior. The EMG measurement (root
      mean square (RMS)) and onset time of isometric contractions were analyzed. Body mass index
      and strength were also tested.
