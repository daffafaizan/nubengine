      I. Validation of the 15-gene prognostic and predictive messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      signature on Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE)-Bio formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
      tissue (FFPE) tumor samples.

      II. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of known potential
      oncogenic mutations using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples.

      III. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of gene copy variations
      using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples.

      IV. Exploratory identification and evaluation of prognostic and predictive value of novel
      genomic aberrations discovered by Next Generation Sequencing on LACE-Bio tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived RNA and DNA samples are analyzed for gene expression, mutations, and variations by
      reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), mass spectrometry (MassARRAY),
      molecular inversion probe assay, and microarray assays. Results are then compared with
      patients' clinical outcomes.
