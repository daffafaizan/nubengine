    
      This is a prospective study evaluating the activity and the safety of toremifene in patients
      with primary or recurrent sporadic DTs.

      Patients will be enrolled after the histological confirmation of DTs on biopsy performed at
      the investigators institution or after the pathological review of tissue specimen obtained
      via needle biopsy or surgical excision (in case of recurrence) performed elsewhere. A new
      biopsy will be performed if the amount of tissue will not be sufficient for
      immunohistochemical analysis. Patients will start at 60 mg daily and dose-escalate to 180 mg
      upon progression. Disease assessment will be performed by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan,
      pain evaluation by a visual analog scale (VAS) every 3 months for the first and second year,
      twice yearly thereafter. Response will be evaluated either by RECIST and/or symptomatic
      relief.
