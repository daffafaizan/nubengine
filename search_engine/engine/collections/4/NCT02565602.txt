      to study calcium metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women. Calcium metabolism will be
      studied after a single oral administration of a calcium tracer (Ca-41) and by following the
      excretion of the tracer in urine over 6 months. Obtained data will be used to assess
      parameters of calcium metabolism (flux rates and sizes of body calcium compartments) by
      kinetic modelling. A strontium tracer (Sr-84) will be administered in parallel and its
      urinary excretion pattern compared to Ca-41 excretion to determine if strontium tracers can
      be used to assess calcium metabolism qualitatively. Subjects will be supplemented with Vit D
      throughout the study. Vit D supplementation will commence 1 month before isotope
      administration.
