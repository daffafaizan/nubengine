      patients with sickle cell disease. Conventional HSCT therapy has been limited to extremely
      high-risk hemoglobinopathy patients. Those patients who may be difficult to identify before
      end-organ damage develops.

      Also, conventional HSCT is only available to the minority of candidates who have
      Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) identical siblings to donate bone marrow or
      mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.

      This study proposes two important improvements over conventional HSCT:

        -  Donor peripheral blood or bone marrow will be processed via a new technology, which will
           deplete mature immune cells while enriching hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and graft
           facilitating cells (FC).

        -  A reduced intensity recipient conditioning regimen will be used to promote mixed
           allogeneic chimerism, as opposed to full donor chimerism, following HSCT.

      These two elements may significantly improve the benefit:risk ratio of HSCT for patients with
      hemoglobinopathies. Stem cell transplantation may become a more feasible option for patients
      that do not have HLA-identical siblings that can donate stem cells. Also, transplantation may
      be offered to patients earlier in the disease progression, before end-organ damage occurs.
