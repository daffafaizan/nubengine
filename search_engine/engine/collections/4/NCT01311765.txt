    
      This is a prospective randomized study involving 25 centers. Our goal is to demonstrate in
      the course of postoperative peritonitis that a short antibiotic therapy (8 days) compared to
      conventional antibiotic treatment (15 days) decreases the duration of exposure to antibiotics
      over a 28 days period . Patients admitted in ICU, operated for postoperative peritonitis and
      receiving an adequate antibiotic therapy will be identified and after informed consent is
      obtained will be randomized to receive a short course of antibiotic therapy (8 days) or a
      long course of antibiotic therapy (15 days). The primary endpoint is the number of
      antibiotic-free days at D28 after inclusion (analysis of superiority) . Secondary endpoints
      include mortality at D45 after inclusion (analysis of equivalence), the occurrence of relapse
      of infection, success rate of clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients, and
      emergence of multidrug resistant microorganisms in clinical isolates or hygiene samples.
      Patient data through day 45 following the initial intervention or until hospital discharge
      will be tracked.
