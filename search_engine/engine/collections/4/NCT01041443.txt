      dose of THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), once daily on days 1-10 of a 21-day treatment cycle. II. To describe the toxicities of
      FdCyd/THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS). III. To document all clinical responses and hematologic improvement in patients
      treated with FdCyd/THU. IV. To obtain preliminary information regarding the effect of
      FdCyd/THU on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and bone marrow aspirates, including malignant myeloid cells; the ratio of gamma- to
      beta-globin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in blood cells; and serum cytokines. OUTLINE:
      This is a dose-escalation study of FdCyd. Patients receive FdCyd intravenously (IV) over 3
      hours and THU IV over 3 hours on days 1-10. Courses repeat every 21days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for 4 weeks.
