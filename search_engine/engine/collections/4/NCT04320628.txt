      ability of NaOCl to NSS in the reduction of bacterial burden in nonhealing acute and chronic
      wounds. Using the generally accepted surrogate endpoint of surface area reduction at 4 weeks,
      the study will also compare the healing of subjects utilizing NaOCl vs. NSS.

      After consenting, the ulcers of eligible subjects are measured, photographed and undergo the
      MolecuLight imaging procedure (MiX). The subject is then randomized to one of two arms:
      target ulcer cleansed with NaOCl or NSS. After cleansing the wound a second MiX is performed.
      The subject is given a four-week supply of either NaOCl or NSS.
