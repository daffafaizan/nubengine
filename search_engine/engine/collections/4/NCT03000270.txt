    
      A multi-center, prospective, randomized, two-arm feasibility trial to assess the potential
      role of unloading with the Impella CP prior to revascularization in reducing infarct size.
      The study design includes 1:1 randomization between: 1) Delay Arm: 30 minutes of unloading
      with Impella CP prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI); and 2) Immediate
      Arm: initiation of Impella CP unloading followed immediately by PPCI.

      Study Hypothesis: Direct active unloading of the left ventricle with the Impella CP System
      prior to PPCI in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is safe and
      feasible
