      condition occurs in different ethnic groups worldwide with varying prevalence.

      There are notable differences in psoriasis presentation in skin of color groups. Black
      patients with psoriasis tend to have less erythema, increased risk of pigmentation, thicker
      plaques, more scaling, and greater body involvement as compared to white patients. The
      resolution of psoriasis lesions in darker skin types is associated with a higher rate of
      dyspigmentation (both hyper- and hypo-pigmentation), which may be more bothersome to patients
      than the psoriasis itself. Further, several studies have shown that psoriasis is associated
      with greater psychological impact and worse quality of life in non-whites with psoriasis
      compared to whites.

      Unique issues in skin of color populations make studies dedicated to darker skin types
      essential for the treatment of psoriasis in these populations. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of Enstilar® foam, a combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate
      0.005%/0.064%, in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in darker skin types. This study will
      also evaluate the degree of erythema versus hyperpigmentation in psoriasis plaques as well as
      the effect of Enstilar ® on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and quality of life in skin
      of color.
