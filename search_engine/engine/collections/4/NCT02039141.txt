      disproportionally impacted. Pediatric obesity is associated with several chronic health
      conditions including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, very few interventions
      specifically targeting diabetes prevention for obese Latino adolescents have been developed.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects a culturally-grounded,
      community-based lifestyle intervention on psychosocial and health outcomes among obese Latino
      adolescents. Eligible participants of this study will be randomly selected to the
      intervention group or the delayed-intervention group (control group) after an initial health
      screening for eligibility.

      Participants selected to the intervention group will attend weekly healthy lifestyle
      education sessions with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and three physical activity sessions /
      week with other youth. After which, participants will attend monthly booster group meetings
      for three months.

      All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for insulin
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance, quality of life, fitness, and nutrition and physical activity
      behaviors.
