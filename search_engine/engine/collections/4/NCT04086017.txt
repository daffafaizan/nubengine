      filled with emotion. Patients may turn inward and be filled with peace, or they may be
      bothered by symptoms. Caregivers often experience feelings of helplessness and anticipatory
      grief. Learning and providing a skill such as Reiki may give caregivers a way to help the
      patient with symptoms while at the same time feeling useful. Patient and caregiver closeness
      may be enhanced. Reiki has been shown to be helpful with symptoms such as pain, anxiety,
      depression, fatigue, and others. However, teaching caregivers of terminal hospice patients,
      Reiki has not been studied. The knowledge gained from this feasibility study will guide
      future interventions aimed at the comfort of hospice patients and FCGs.

      Approximately 1.49 million Medicare beneficiaries received hospice care during 2017, and most
      had a FCG. During the final days or weeks, FCGs are unsure of what do or how to best help the
      patient when everyday caregiving actives such as physical care or nutrition are not required
      or no longer desired by the patient. Caregiver symptoms of depression, anxiety, or
      anticipatory grief increase toward the end of life along with increased patient symptoms.
      Having a specific skill to help the patient with symptoms or simply to show care and provide
      touch may empower FCGs and improve the quality of life for both caregivers and patients.
