      surveillance study. The Surveillance will consecutively register patients with moderate to
      severe and severe mitral regurgitation (3+ and 4+ MR) in whom a MitraClip implant was
      attempted. Patients registered in the AVJ-514 clinical trial who received additional
      MitraClip procedures will be excluded from the Surveillance.

      Patients will be evaluated at Baseline, Procedure, Discharge, 30 days, 1 year, 2 years and 3
      years in Japanese medical centers.
