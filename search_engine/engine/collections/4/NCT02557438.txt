      gastrectomy (VSG) in adolescents with morbid obesity will lead to a reduction in areal and
      volumetric BMD, and deterioration in bone structure and estimated bone strength, and an
      increase in marrow adiposity. We further hypothesize that these effects will be due in part
      to a decrease in lean mass, changes in enteric peptide hormones and reduced estrogen levels.

      We will enroll 120 participants 13-21 years old for this two-year longitudinal study (36 in
      each of the surgical groups and 48 non-surgical controls with obesity). We will screen up to
      240 subjects to find these 120 eligibile subjects. Areal bone mineral density (BMD) will be
      assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), volumetric BMD by quantitative computed
      tomography (QCT), bone structure and strength using high resolution peripheral QCT and finite
      element analysis, and marrow fat using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Body composition will
      also be assessed.

      Adolescence is a critical time for bone accrual and the use of bariatric procedures is
      increasing in teenagers. This study will provide novel data needed to establish effects of
      RYGB vs. VSG on bone in adolescents and will begin to delineate underlying mechanisms.
      Clarifying these mechanisms will identify therapeutic targets to optimize bone accrual in
      adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery.
