      control of diabetes. The experimental group consisted of 124 patients who joined the ASMART
      program, while the control group consisted of 60 patients who continued to receive
      traditional care. Statistical analysis involved comparing pretest & posttest HbA1c levels for
      the experimental group and the control group.
