    
      This is a phase II, prospective, pharmacodynamic study of BKM120 in high-risk, localized
      prostate cancer. After informed consent and central pathology review of the core prostate
      biopsy, eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy
      of the prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect tissue for molecular analysis. Two
      weeks after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given
      at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University
      of California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last
      dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy.

      Up to 24 patients, or 21 evaluable patients, will be enrolled through the Department of
      Urology or Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the University of California, San Francisco for
      this pharmacodynamic study. Toxicity will be assessed during BKM120 administration, and will
      involve a clinic visit on Day 14 ± 2 (i.e. before surgery). Follow-up with safety evaluations
      will be at 90 ± 7 days post-operatively and involve a toxicity questionnaire, blood tests,
      and clinic visit. Toxicity will be monitored and reported using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
      version 4.0 guidelines.

      A patient symptom diary will be distributed to each patient at baseline for symptom
      self-recording and BKM120 dose self-administration. In addition, a patient identifier card
      (wallet-sized) will be distributed to each patient after informed consent and registration.
      This information will contain the patient's age, study name and number, investigator and
      study coordinator contact information, and expected adverse events that may be present as a
      result of BKM120 administration.
