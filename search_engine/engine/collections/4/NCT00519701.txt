      improves laboratory parameters and ameliorates the clinical severity of disease. Little is
      known, however, about the effects of hydroxyurea on the chronic organ damage that occurs in
      patients with SCA and leads to significant morbidity and mortality in young adults. The
      objectives of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of HU in young children with
      SCA and to determine whether HU preserves renal function, reduces transcranial doppler
      ultrasound (TCD) values, and prevents development of brain ischemia as evidenced by MRI/MRA
      imaging. In addition, we will evaluate the effects of hydroxyurea on quality of life
