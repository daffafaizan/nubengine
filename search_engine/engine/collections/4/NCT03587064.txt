      mortality. Current devices for cardiac resynchronization (CRT-D) normally provide
      atrio-ventricular (AV) sequential pacing modes during resynchronization, but the best pacing
      programming strategy is not clear.

      On the one hand a basic rate of 50 to 70 bpm (optionally with some rate-responsive function)
      could be considered for therapy up-titration, specifically betablockers; on the other hand,
      increasing pacing rates may partially reduce benefits from resynchronization, reducing
      filling time and contractility reservoir.

      The Pegasus investigation is the only large randomized investigation comparing DDD with 70
      bpm basic rate to DDD(R) @40 bpm. Results showed no difference in investigation endpoints,
      including mortality and HF-hospitalization.

      These results may support the use of a device implementing both a CRT function and a right
      ventricular single-lead with and an atrial sensing dipole (CRT-DX system). This system can
      track ventricular pacing and resynchronization following atrial sensing, even if it cannot
      provide atrial pacing support. It should be assessed whether such limitation is
      counterbalanced by the advantages related to the reduced number of necessary leads, with
      simplified implantation and less complications.

      The objective of the investigation is to assess whether atrial pacing support is really
      necessary in the subset of patients with indication to CRT-D and no evidence of sinus
      dysfunction on optimal therapy. The investigation will test the hypothesis that a CRT-DX
      system is not inferior to a conventional CRT-D system in this class of subjects.
