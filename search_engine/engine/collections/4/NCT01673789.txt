    
      A 16-gauge IV needle is placed in the left (or right) median cubital vein, and the patient's
      blood is passed through a Blood Cell Separator MCS+ (HaemoneticsÂ®, Braintree, MA) at 35
      mL/min for 6 to 7 hours to isolate lymphocytes in accordance with the manufacturer's
      recommended protocol. The collected lymphocytes are transferred into the device for exposure
      to allogeneic CB-SCs (or process control without CB-SCs), and other blood components are
      returned to the patient. After 2 to 3 hours in the device, lymphocytes are returned to the
      patient's circulation via a dorsal vein in the hand under gravity flow control (2 to 3
      mL/min) with physiological saline. Approximately 10,000 mL of blood is processed during the
      procedure resulting in approximately two repeated educations for the lymphocyte fraction.
      Patients are hospitalized for two days to monitor temperature and conduct routine laboratory
      blood tests for adverse reactions following treatment. Follow-up visits are scheduled 4, 12,
      24, 40, and 54 weeks after treatment for clinical assessments and laboratory tests
