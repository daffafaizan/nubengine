      absence of functional enzymes that contribute to the degradation of glycosaminoglycans
      (GAGs). The progressive systemic deposition of GAGs results in multi-organ system dysfunction
      that varies with the particular GAG deposited and the specific enzyme mutation(s) present.

      Cardiac involvement has been reported in all MPS syndromes and is a common and early feature,
      particularly for those with MPS I, II, and VI. Cardiac valve thickening, dysfunction (more
      severe for left-sided than for right-sided valves), and hypertrophy are commonly present;
      conduction abnormalities, coronary artery and other vascular involvement may also occur.
      Cardiac disease emerges silently and contributes significantly to early mortality. The
      clinical examination of individuals with MPS is often difficult due to physical and,
      sometimes, intellectual patient limitations. The absence of precordial murmurs does not
      exclude the presence of cardiac disease. Echocardiography and electrocardiography are key
      diagnostic techniques for evaluation of valves, ventricular dimensions and function.
