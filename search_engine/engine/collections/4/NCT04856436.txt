      malformations in a real-world setting is still uncertain. We aimed to assess the association
      between benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations. We
      will conduct a retrospective nationwide cohort study using the Health Insurance Review and
      Assessment (HIRA) database of South Korea, which covers the entire South Korean population.
