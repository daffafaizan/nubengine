      health, independent of how physically active a person is. Many occupations are now sedentary,
      and are characterised by long periods spent sitting at a desk. Brief education on the
      benefits of standing regularly and breaking up prolonged sitting will be provided to
      participants, working at a Scottish University. One intervention group will additionally have
      software installed on their work computer which placed a prompt window in the centre of their
      screen for 1 minute every 30 minutes. The prompt will remind participants to stand-up and
      take a break, and the window cannot be removed or minimised.
