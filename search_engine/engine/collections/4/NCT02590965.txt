    
      Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized to Fruquintinib plus best supportive care or
      placebo plus best supportive care at a 2:1 ratio.

      Randomization will be stratified by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene status:
      mutant vs. wild type vs. unknown.

      All subjects will receive Fruquintinib/placebo for consecutive 3 weeks, followed by one-week
      rest. A treatment cycle consists of 4 weeks. Tumor assessment will be performed every 4 weeks
      in the first 3 cycles, and every 8 weeks since the 4th cycle, until disease progression.
      Further treatment and survival follow-up after progression will be recorded.
