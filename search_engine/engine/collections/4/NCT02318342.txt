      imaging and transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate structural and functional integrity of
      the aortic valves. The imaging studies will be performed at least 48-hours after
      bioprosthetic valve replacement. Patients with prosthetic valve abnormalities suggestive of
      thrombus will be administered anticoagulation therapy, followed by repeat contrast CT of the
      chest and transthoracic imaging. Repeat imaging following 3 months of anticoagulation therapy
      is performed to evaluate the response to anticoagulation therapy. I
