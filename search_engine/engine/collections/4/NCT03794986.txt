      peer leaders to competently deliver both versions of MI and conduct a randomized controlled
      trial comparing the two versions of MI to enhance treatment engagement in SGM male survivors
      with mental health problems. All SGM male survivors who meet inclusion criteria, including
      significant emotional distress, will complete pre-test measures and be randomized to 6-week
      MI delivered by peers in online groups or 6-week MI with trauma-informed, SGM affirmative
      care delivered by peers in online groups. Randomization will be counterbalanced by treatment
      status: treatment naive versus treatment-experienced (prior treatment but not within the past
      60 days).
