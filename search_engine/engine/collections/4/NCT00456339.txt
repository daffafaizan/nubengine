      them with 5 days of prednisolone and 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. We will obtain a
      questionnaire pre and post treatment and ask the parents to tell us if they think the child
      has improved enough after treatment to forego surgery. If not, they will undergo an
      adenotonsillectomy to relieve their sleep apnea and if yes, we will repeat the sleep study to
      make sure that the apnea has resolved.
