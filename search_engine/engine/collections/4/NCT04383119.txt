      patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis or who recur after initial treatment have a
      dismal prognosis and, except for a subset of selected patients with completely resectable
      disease, the median survival is less than two years.

      At the advanced-disease stage, the main aim of treatment is to improve patient's quality of
      life, possibly survival, with the best compromise between toxicity and symptoms. Trabectedin
      (T) is a marine-derived cytotoxic approved by European MEdicine Agency (EMEA) and FDA.

      It is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after
      failure of anthracyclines-based chemotherapy or who are unsuitable to receive these agents.

      Among Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS), activity has been mainly detected in synovial sarcoma,
      liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Although the response rate did not exceed 10%, T was
      demonstrated to provide disease control, with progression arrest rates exceeding 50% and
      progression-free survival rates exceeding 20% at 6 months. So far no phase II or III studies
      have been addressed to test the activity of T in leiomyosarcoma specifically (without
      differentiation between site of primary localization) in comparison with Gemcitabine.

      This study is aimed at evaluating the activity of Trabectedin (arm A) in advanced
      leiomyosarcomas, having Gemcitabine (arm B) as the comparator. In parallel an optional
      translational study will be performed to identify factors predictive of the activity of
      Trabectedin or Gemcitabine in this specific histotype.
