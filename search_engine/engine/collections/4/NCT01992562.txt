      ziconotide will temporarily reduce pain in these patients. In the proposed study, patients
      will receive two injections, one of which is the ziconotide and one which is a placebo. They
      will be blinded and not know which order they receive the treatment versus placebo. The
      results of this clinical trial will provide a focused examination of ziconotide efficacy and
      safety in patients with painful neuropathies or myelopathies that have not been effectively
      treated with other pain medications. Moreover, the use of a single shot trial (SST) IT
      injection in the outpatient setting will provide evidence for application of this technique
      in outpatient neurological clinical practice, thereby improving access to this specific
      patient population. Ziconotide is currently FDA approved for this indication and route of
      administration. Therefore, a study design that improves the feasibility of ziconotide
      trialing specifically in the neurology clinic (that is, single shot administration) is being
      used in order to ensure its broader use by neurologists who routinely care for neuropathy and
      myelopathy patients. Information from this study will also inform future studies of
      predictors for long term efficacy after pump placement.
