      prostate cancer with a pharmacokinetics component. The first six patients enrolled will be
      treated with a single 750 mg dose of oral NDGA on day -7 with measurement of pharmacokinetic
      parameters over eight hours after the dose, then begin treatment with 2000 mg of oral NDGA
      daily. Every four weeks, measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state will be
      done for all patients. All patients will continue dosing with NDGA and will be followed for
      PSA response and for safety. Measurement of pharmacokinetics for a 750 mg dose has been
      chosen to evaluate levels with the dosage that patients will be taking at one time point
      during the day (this is roughly one-third of the daily dose, which is administered in three
      divided doses).
