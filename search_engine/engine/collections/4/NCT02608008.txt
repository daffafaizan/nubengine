    
      EchoNavigator System Release II is a CE certified innovative periinterventional imaging
      modality used in our clinic of cardiology, pulmonology and angiology during structural heart
      interventions like transfemoral aortic valve Implantation (TAVI), MitraClip implantation,
      patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD) and left atrial appendage (LAA).
      During this interventions EchoNavigator is able to combine live X-ray Images and 3D Echo
      guidance to enhance the efficiency of the procedure.

      Specific periprocedural data parameter, e.g. procedure duration, radiation time, radiation
      dose, transseptal punction time (e.g.LAA) and contrast agent amount will be collected and
      analysed. The same data characteristics from the same procedures but without the
      periinterventional use of the EchoNavigator System Release II will be collected, analysed and
      compared with the data described above. A retrospective data collection between 2013 - 2017
      of n=500 patients will be conducted.
