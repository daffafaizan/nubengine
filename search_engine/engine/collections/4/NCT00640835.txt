      Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets and was evaluated for both
      sublingual and buccal administration. The soluble film dosage is expected to provide the
      following enhancements and potential advantages over the current Suboxone (buprenorphine and
      naloxone) product:

        -  mitigation against unintentional pediatric exposure by providing child-resistant
           packaging in unit dose format.

        -  improvement in subject convenience and compliance by ensuring rapid disintegration.

        -  protection against diversion by providing a dosage form that is very difficult for the
           subject to remove from the sublingual or buccal mucosa after administration. This
           provides assurance to the caregiver that the dose has actually been taken appropriately
           in a supervised setting.

        -  provision of a unit dose product format for hospital and institutional use.

        -  decreased product damage during shipping as compared to Suboxone tablets.
