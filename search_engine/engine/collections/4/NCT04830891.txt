    
      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, prospective study involving up to 100 participants.
      The data collected in this study will augment the data collected in ML2018_AG_01,
      ML2018_AG_02, IU2019_AG_03, and IU2020_AG_04.

      Phase I Collect data from participants for each indicated block area. This set will be used
      to develop and verify models for the identification and highlighting of target anatomical
      structures on ultrasound images.

      Phase II Validation will proceed by feeding the videos into the ScanNav AnatomyGuide system
      and recording the output anatomy highlighting, overlaid on the original ultrasound image. The
      overlaid video will be examined by experts to identify safety and performance issues.
