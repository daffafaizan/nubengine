      largely reported. The addition of Zevalin® to a fludarabine-based Reduced Intensity
      Conditioning regimen has been already evaluated in the setting of allo-SCT and the results
      reported so far seem to be promising without an overwhelming toxicity neither a delayed
      hematologic recovery. The assumption that the addition of Zevalin® to the conditioning
      regimen might improve lymphoma control and the demonstration that nucleoside analogs such as
      fludarabine synergize optimally with RIT led us to conduct this trial using the following
      preparative regimen: rituximab 250 mg/m² on days -21 and -14, Zevalin® 0,4 mCi/Kg body weight
      on day -14, fludarabine 30 mg/m² intravenously from days -6 to -2, Busulfan orally (4 mg/Kg
      body weight) or intravenously (0,8 mg/Kg body weight) on days -5 and -4 and ATG
      (Thymoglobulin®) 2,5 mg/Kg body weight intravenously on day -1. Cyclosporine A is
      administered at 2 or 3 mg/Kg body weight from day -1 to day 28 than followed by a dose
      reduction.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zevalin® in a Reduced
      Intensity Conditioning regimen followed by allogenic stem cell support in patients with
      aggressive lymphomas who are responsive to a salvage chemotherapy regimen

      Patients are followed from the beginning of the RIC regimen until day 365 for primary and
      secondary objectives of the study than on a regular basis depending on the practice of each
      centre. The evaluation includes physical examination (performance status, hematologic
      assessment, acute and chronic GVH disease), biologic tests (blood screening for blood count,
      renal and hepatic function, B and T-cell recovery, chimerism analysis, response assessment)
      and complementary examinations (marrow biopsies, tomography scan, positron emission
      tomography, …).
