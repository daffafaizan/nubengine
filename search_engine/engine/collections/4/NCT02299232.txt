      effects, allow fast induction and recovery. The administration route is also important and
      should be minimally invasive. In this study the investigators aimed to compare two different
      doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine applied to children for MRI sedation.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients aged between 1-10 years, ASA I-II scheduled for MRI were
      allocated in this randomized double-blinded study. Group 1 received 3 mcg/kg, Group 2
      received 4 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine before imaging. From the beginning on every 10
      minutes HR, SpO2 and RSS were recorded. Induction time was time interval to receive RSS 5.
      MRI began and separation-score was noted. If intranasal sedation failed, an intravenous
      canula was placed and propofol was applied. Imaging quality was evaluated. Recovery time was
      time interval to receive Aldrete-score 9. Parents' satisfaction was questioned before patient
      was discharged.
