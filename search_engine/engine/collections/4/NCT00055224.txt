      a vulnerability marker for these disorders. One characteristic of patients with anxiety
      disorders and high trait-anxious individuals is inappropriate expectancies of aversive
      events. The overall aim of the present protocol is to investigate mechanisms that may promote
      the development of these aversive expectancies using expectancy-based, associative-learning
      models.

      During aversive conditioning in which a phasic explicit-cue (e.g., a light) is repeatedly
      associated with an aversive unconditioned-stimulus (e.g., a shock), the organism develops
      fear to the explicit cue as well as to the environmental context in which the experiment took
      place. We have obtained preliminary evidence suggesting that contextual fear represents
      aspects of aversive states that are central to anxiety disorders. In this protocol, we seek
      further evidence for the relevance of contextual fear to mood anxiety disorders.

      One important determinant of contextual fear in both humans and animals is predictability:
      contextual fear increases when aversive events (e.g., electric shock) are unpredictable, as
      opposed to when they are predictable. The present protocol will examine the role of
      predictability of aversive states and of conditioning on threat appraisal in individuals with
      mood and anxiety disorders.

      A second aim is to examine the interaction between experimentally-induced anxiety and
      cognitive processes, more specifically working memory, in mood and anxiety disorders.
