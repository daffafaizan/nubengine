      the 2006 Census, 43% of older adults in Ontario identified as being a Canadian immigrant, a
      statistic which continues to grow in the context of an aging population. Aging is commonly
      associated with declines in physical and cognitive capacity, which is significantly
      accelerated by chronic perceived stress. Lower income older adults are particularly
      vulnerable to accelerated aging and disease onset due to the stress of economic insecurity.
      In 2012,4 the highest chronic low-income rates in Canada were reported among immigrants 65
      years of age and older. Accordingly, it is important to investigate programs that can support
      the wellbeing of aging Canadian immigrants.

      Within the one-year tenure of the RBC grant, the principal investigator (PI) and her research
      team will conduct a one-factor between-subjects design with two conditions - a
      mindfulness-based intervention and a waitlist control - to examine the benefits of
      mindfulness training on indices of wellbeing, including perceived stress, social engagement,
      quality of life, and self-reported emotional health. It is hypothesized that mindfulness
      training will enhance indices of wellbeing compared with wait-list control. Employing a
      mixed-methods approach, participants will also engage in a qualitative interviews to provide
      insight into the lived experience and how mindfulness may serve Canadian immigrants living
      with economic insecurity.
