      bone. Enthesitis related arthritis is a sub-form of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and
      primarily lower extremities, spine, and sacroiliac joints. In the literature, exercise
      therapy is found beneficial to improve bone density, muscle strength and functionality
      without leading adverse effects in these children.

      Recently yoga has emerged as a new exercise approach which consist of both physical an mental
      components to improve self-awareness and mindfulness. However, the effects of yoga did not
      investigated in JIA patients. The only evidence is a case study which reports improvements in
      pain and stiffness in a child with JIA.
