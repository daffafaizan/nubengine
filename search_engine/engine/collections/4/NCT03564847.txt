      mainly on mothers. However, studies suggest that the relationship between parental depression
      and child outcome is not necessarily limited to mothers.

      The study has two phases quantitative and qualitative:

      Purpose of this quantitative phase is to determine if the LTP plus programme delivered by
      non-specialists and community health workers reduces symptoms of paternal depression and
      improves child development compared to treatment as usual.

      In the qualitative part of the study focus groups and in-depth digitally recorded interviews
      will be conducted with participants by trained research staff at two-time points both before
      and after the intervention. These focus groups and in-depth interviews will continue till the
      data saturation is achieved. In addition, Participants who refused to participate in the
      trial will be asked if they would be willing to be contacted by a researcher to discuss their
      reasons for not taking part. Moreover, in-depth digitally-recorded interviews with
      stakeholders (grandparents, therapists, health professionals, etc) will also be conducted by
      trained researchers.
