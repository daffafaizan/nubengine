      the unit of randomization. This trial was funded by the Craig H. Neilsen Allied Health
      Professional Development Award of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). This
      research was conducted at a 32-bed spinal cord injury and multi-trauma rehabilitation unit in
      an urban center. Participants were recruited from an inpatient spinal cord injury
      rehabilitation unit. Eligible participants were 18 years or older and undergoing acute
      rehabilitation after a cervical spinal cord injury with hand function impairment, and the
      primary occupational therapist deemed splinting intervention was required. Each eligible
      extremity was randomized to receive a custom or pre-fabricated resting hand splint for night
      use.
