      based on pre-implant clinical variables to predict response to CRT-D therapy. Second, the
      study aims to determine in patients implanted with CRT-D if the combined use of cTnT and BNP
      can further predict and risk-stratify HF improvement and all-cause mortality. Additionally,
      novel biochemical markers defining cardiac mortality in high risk patients detected by plasma
      proteomic analysis in the CRT-D patients will be evaluated.

      This study represents a combination of previous CRT studies that evaluated these variables
      independently. Data from this study will be pooled with data from previous studies to build a
      more complete picture of CRT therapy.
