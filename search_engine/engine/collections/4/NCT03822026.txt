      pressure-monitoring, brain tissue oxygen tension and/or microdialysis probes
      hyperventilation-tests are performed in the acute phase after trauma. Data are collected and
      TCCD measurements are performed at baseline, at the beginning of moderate hyperventilation,
      after prolonged moderate hyperventilation (for 50 minutes) and after return to baseline.

      The present study aims to quantify potential adverse effects of moderate short-term
      hyperventilation during the acute phase of the severe TBI on cerebral hemodynamics,
      oxygenation, and metabolism.
