    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, parallel-arm,
      placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial of 1-3 doses of siltuximab 11 mg/kg IV over 1 hour
      plus SOC vs. matched-volume normal saline (NS) IV over 1 hour plus SOC in 555 patients with
      SARS CoV-2 previously treated with corticosteroids or another respiratory virus infection
      with elevated CRP levels who have developed serious respiratory complications.

      The randomization will be stratified by age (<65, â‰¥65 years), respiratory virus infection
      (confirmed SARS-CoV-2, other), and MIV status (yes, no). Crossover between treatment arms
      will not be allowed.

      All patients will receive ARDS SOC following the official American Thoracic Society/European
      Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice
      guideline13 and/or the World Health Organization's (WHO's) clinical management of severe
      acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 disease is suspected (WHO Interim Guidance 202014
      or other local guidance). Patients may continue receiving their corticosteroid (up to a
      cumulative maximum dexamethasone or equivalent dose of 60 mg [except to treat
      treatment-emergent reactions or comorbid conditions]) or antiviral therapy (except
      aminoquinoline compounds and convalescent plasma) at the same or lower doses if started at
      least 4 days (corticosteroid therapy) or at least 2 days (antiviral therapy) prior to
      randomization. Patients randomized to Arm A will additionally receive siltuximab 11 mg/kg IV
      administered over 1 hour, while patients randomized to Arm B will additionally receive IV NS
      administered over 1 hour, with opportunity to repeat their assigned study treatment once or
      twice at least 2 days apart on or after Day 3 as their clinical condition and/or laboratory
      testing dictate.
