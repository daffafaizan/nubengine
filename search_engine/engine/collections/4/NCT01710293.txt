      interventions. The first phase of the project determines the effectiveness of computerized
      queries the investigators develop to accurately identify which patients are at risk for
      delays in cancer diagnosis. Patients the investigators identify will have abnormal test
      results or symptoms that have not been followed up by their providers. In Phase 2 of the
      study, the research team will use interviewing and other participatory techniques to
      determine the best way to convey information about such at-risk patients to providers in an
      automated fashion. In Phase 3 of the project, the investigators will evaluate the effects of
      an automated surveillance intervention on the timeliness of the diagnostic process of five
      cancers.

      This project will improve communication and coordination of cancer-related diagnostic
      information to improve quality and safety.
