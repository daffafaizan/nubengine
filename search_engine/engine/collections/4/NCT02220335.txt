      accepted the optimal medical therapies,including diuretics, Nitrate esters, β-blockers, ACE
      inhibitors or receptor blocker aldosterone antagonists and/or digoxin).The patients of
      pulmonary hypertension are defined into two groups: "passive" pulmonary hypertension(mPAP≥25
      mmHg, PCWP>15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance<3 woods unit) increase due to backward
      transmission of increased left ventricular filling pressure, "reactive" pulmonary
      hypertension (mPAP≥25 mmHg, PCWP>15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance >3 woods unit)
      increase in resistance due to either pulmonary vasoconstriction or structural changes in the
      pulmonary vasculature.

      All the "reactive" pulmonary hypertension patients are eligible for the randomized study in
      PADN group or control group according to the computer generated random table.
