      made of a hardware and of a software part: (i) an imager (light source and sensors) for
      simultaneous and colocalized visualisation of the bladder using white light and blue light
      for fluorescence excitation and (ii) a mosaicing software for automatic building of
      high-resolution panoramic images of the bladder inner wall. The medical device's qualitative
      (human engineering, images qualitty) and quantitative (medical examination and panoramic
      images building durations) specifications will be evaluated during the clinical trial in
      comparison with a reference medical device already on the market. The main goals are to
      achieve (i) better sensitivity of bladder cancers' cystocopic diagnosis and shorter medical
      examination durations thanks to the simultaneous visualization of the bladder inner wall with
      white and blue lights and (ii) better patients' follow up thanks to the high resolved
      panoramic images.
