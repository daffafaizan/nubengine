      healing of the herpes zoster rash. Symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia may include a complex
      combination of symptoms, including a deep aching, shooting or burning pain, sensory deficits,
      hyperalgesia, allodynia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia. Postherpetic neuralgia is more common
      in the elderly, and it can have a debilitating effect on a patient. The most commonly
      prescribed treatments are tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, however these
      treatments are effective in approximately half of subjects and may also have undesirable side
      effects (eg, dizziness and somnolence).

      TAK-583 is a synthetic compound under development by Takeda Global Research & Development
      Center, Inc. as a treatment for neuropathic pain and for delaying the progression of diabetic
      neuropathy.
