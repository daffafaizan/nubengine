      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with genistein, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency of objective tumor response rate in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of baseline expression of pAKT and activation of NF-kappaB on
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall time to disease progression in these patients.

        -  Estimate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral genistein twice daily on days -7 to 28 in course 1 and on days 1-28 in
      all other courses. Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
