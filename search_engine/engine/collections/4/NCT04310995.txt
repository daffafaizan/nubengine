    
      After having signed informed consent (Day 1-3), eligible subjects who have successfully
      received first RA-CABG surgery (Day 0) will be screened for enrollment. All subjects (about
      100 patients) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 groups. Group A will receive oral
      Nicorandil (5mg tid) monotherapy; Group B will receive oral Diltiazem (180mg qd) monotherapy;
      and Group C will receive Isosorbide Mononitrate (50mg qd) monotherapy. Three groups will
      continue intervention treatment for 168 days (24 weeks) after RA-CABG surgery. All subjects
      will receive follow-up visits (clinic visit or phone visit) at Day 7, 28, 84, and 168.

      All subjects will receive first CCTA (or CAG) to evaluate the graft outcome at Day 7 and
      second CCTA (or CAG) to evaluate the graft outcome at Day 168 after RA-CABG surgery. And all
      subjects will be evaluated angina relief based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
      angina grading and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. And the time to first major adverse
      cardiovascular event (MACE), which include all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke
      and unplanned revascularization, will be collected. And other safety outcomes will be
      evaluated, including the rate of hypotension, the proportion of concomitant medications with
      ACEI/ARB/ARNI drugs and proportion of SAEs and concerned AEs.
