      Intensive Care patients and is highly prevalent in the critically ill cirrhotic patient. This
      study compares two strategies in minimizing intra-abdominal pressure and optimizing abdominal
      perfusion pressure in the prevention and treatment of intra-abdominal hypertension associated
      morbidity and mortality. Critically ill cirrhotic patients will be allocated into a
      standard-of-care large-volume paracentesis group (control) and a continuous passive
      paracentesis (intervention) group using randomization. Results will assess renal function and
      multi-organ function using standard clinical scales and vital outcomes.
