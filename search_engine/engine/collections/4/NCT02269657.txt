      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treatment and surgical planning.The three-dimensional (3D) shape
      of the spine is impacted by the patients' posture particularly in adolescents with flexible
      spinal curves. The latter highlights the importance of the patients' positioning during X-ray
      acquisition in order to avoid any misleading measurements that may adversely impact
      monitoring and surgical curve correction in AIS.

      Participating subjects will undergo two bi-planar X-rays in different positions. The
      positions will be instructed by the means of graphical presentation and verbal explanation by
      the radiology technician. The first standing position in the EOS速 imaging system for full
      spinal X-ray acquisition will consist of putting both hands and forearms in front of the
      subject on the wall vertically. In the second position, knuckles are loosely placed on
      ipsi-lateral clavicles. Bi-planar X-rays will be taken in the EOS速 imaging system for both
      positions.

      Moreover to compare the postural balance of the patient in the two described positions, a
      pressure mat will be placed in the EOS速 system. The pressure mat will be calibrated with the
      EOS速 system and permits to identify the position of the center of pressure (COP) with respect
      to the anatomical landmarks. The magnitude of pressure under the patients' feet will be
      measured during each X-ray and compared.
