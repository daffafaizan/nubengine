      analgesic effects of nitrous oxide. Our hypothesis is that analgesic doses of nitrous oxide
      increase network efficiency and disrupt normal pain processingOur approach is to administer
      subanesthetic nitrous oxide during the acquisition of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
      imaging) and EEG (electroencephalogram).
