      observational, multi-site study. Enrollment into the DT PAS will be comprised of newly
      enrolled, commercial use DT patients with the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device System
      (HVAD System). Patients enrolled in DT PAS will be followed for 5 years post-implant or until
      study closure, patient death, patient exit from the PAS (i.e., withdrawal of consent), or
      patient has HVAD device removed without replacement (i.e., transplant, recovery) or device is
      exchanged for non-HVAD. The total estimated study duration is approximately 7 years.
