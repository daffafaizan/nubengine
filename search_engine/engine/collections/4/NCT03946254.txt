      During the week 0 the initial evaluation will be developed. Between weeks 1-20, the training
      program will be addressed. In week 21, all the changes made in all the measured variables
      will be evaluated.

      Finally, in week 33 the variables will be measured again to see if the possible improvements
      given in the training program last over time.

      The experimental group will perform a planned and individualized training with guided
      machines and training loads will be adjusted at the beginning of each week.

      The control group will perform breathing and relaxation exercises to avoid a sample death.

      After the intervention, there will be a follow-up phase for 3 months.
