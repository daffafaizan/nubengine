    
      The study is a randomized, controlled trial of targeted inpatient diabetes management versus
      usual care in 70 general medical and surgical inpatients over age 18 with type 2 diabetes and
      hemoglobin A1c levels greater than 8% who are followed in Partners-affiliated primary care
      practices. In addition, we will enroll a prospective chart review cohort matched for age,
      sex, and HbA1c level whose course we will follow for one year after discharge to determine
      the patter of glycemia among patients who are not enrolled in a clinical trial.
