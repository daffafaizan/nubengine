      profiles in Czech population. Initially, there will be 1000 healthy volunteers, with the
      planned expansion to 10.000 participants (healthy volunteers and patients with different
      types of disease). Formation of the reference database of healthy volunteers and their
      parameters will allow a correct interpretation of the potential pathological findings in
      patients. It is very important to obtain healthy controls from the region of the Czech
      Republic, Central Europe respectively; since it is not possible to reliably compere
      ethnically and geographically diverse populations, which have generated in a different
      context and where the diseases manifest with other etiology ad phenotype. Although, in the
      limited measure, the similar molecular data exist in foreign databases, these are not
      compiled from the inhabitants of the Czech Republic, Central Europe not even from Slavic
      population. Study participants may volunteer for archiving of remaining biological materials
      for future studies.
