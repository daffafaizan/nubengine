    
      A target of 16 evaluable participants will be recruited to this study. Participants will
      have[18F]D4-FCH PET/CT imaging on each of 2 visits Scan 1: Baseline scan to be conducted
      prior to initiating standard of care CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapy drug therapy.

      Scan2: Early post-treatment scan to be conducted at 4-6 weeks after initiating therapy.

      Each participant will provide written consent to take part in the study before they undergo
      screening assessments to confirm eligibility. On the day of imaging the participants will
      have a blood sample taken for circulating tumour DNA prior to the scan.

      A single dose of [18F]D4-FCH IV will be administered to the participant followed by dynamic/
      whole body imaging.

      Optional tumour biopsies at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment will
      be obtained, or if there is a suitable archival pre-treatment biopsy that has been taken
      within 18 months, this can be retrieved for baseline analysis.

      Clinical data for progression/ survival followed up for up to 24 months.
