      Please), 82 patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) were recruited from a total of 7
      institutions, and the enrolled subjects were 1: 1 through randomization. The ratio was
      assigned to the test group and the control group, and each of the test or control devices was
      assigned to receive the procedure.

      Drug release "stents" for cardiovascular procedures usually follow 9 months or 12 months, but
      the medical device for this clinical trial has a drug coated "balloon catheter" and the
      mechanism of action is different from the stent and the duration of follow up was set to 6
      months.
