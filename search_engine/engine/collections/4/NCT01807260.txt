      Shock wave lithotripsy was performed by using a Dornier Compact Delta instrument.
      Localizations of radiopaque and non-opaque stones were estimated by using flouroscopy and
      ultrasonography, respectively. Treatment energy was set on 13 kV in the conventional group.
      In the stepwise group, treatment energy was initially set on 10 kV and gradually increased up
      to 13 kV per 250 shocks. The maximum numbers of shocks in both groups were limited to 3000.
      Patients were followed up with 15 days interval. In each visit, patients were respectively
      questioned for pain, hematuria and history of stone passage. In case of treatment failure,
      shock wave lithotripsy was repeated.
