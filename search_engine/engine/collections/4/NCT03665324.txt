      athlete to predict which ones are at risk of developing supraventricular arrhythmias.

      However, the identification of predictive factors would make it possible to identify at-risk
      athletes and thus provide them with adapted sporting practice advice and personalized
      follow-up.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between atrial remodeling assessed by
      ECG and ETT with the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmia by comparing an athlete group
      with supraventricular arrhythmia with a control group of healthy athletes.
