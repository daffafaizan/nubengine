    
      Children with cirrhosis listed for invasive procedures and with deranged INR between 1.5-2,5
      and/or deranged platelet count between 20,000/mm3-50,000/mm3 will be included in the study
      and will be block randomized into two groups. To prevent bleeding during the procedure, one
      group will receive prophylactic transfusion of either fresh frozen plasma (FFP),Platelet or
      Cryoprecipitate based on the values of INR, platelet and fibrinogen.The second group will
      undergo ROTEM based correction.

      Following correction, the procedure will be done in both the groups. Patients randomized in
      the ROTEM group will undergo repeat ROTEM and INR, Platelet, Fibrinogen testing (depending on
      the component transfused), post the procedure, to look at the correction achieved. Similarly,
      patients randomized in the conventional group will undergo repeat INR, Platelet, fibrinogen
      testing depending on the component transfused.

      Patients will be followed for 24 hours indoors for any evidence of bleeding or transfusion
      reaction.
