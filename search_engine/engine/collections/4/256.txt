soluble tissue antigens in human brain tumor and cerebrospinal fluid .an a-2 globulin antigen present in human glioblastomas andimmunologically identical with antigens present in human brain, liver,spleen, and metastatic carcinoma cyst fluid has been described . thisprotein antigen is not present in plasma, wbc, or normal csf . it hasbeen demonstrated in the csf of three of 27 patients with tumors of thecentral nervous system . when present, it may represent a specifictissue protein fraction contributed by either the tumor itself or theadjacent cns tissue . the major protein components of normal andabnormal csf are derived from, or, at least, antigenically identical to,the plasma proteins .
