    
      This is a prospective, long-term, comprehensive growth and development study of the pediatric
      craniofacial skeleton following fracture.

      This study will encompass two specific aims:

        1. To compare the growth and development of the pediatric craniofacial skeleton after
           fracture to publish standardized means of dentofacial growth in the Bolton-Brush Growth
           Study. Patients will be matched according to age, gender, and ethnicity. The status of
           dental eruption will be recorded as well as the vertical and anteroposterior
           classification of occlusion. The effect of trauma on the eruption and vitality of
           permanent teeth will be recorded. We will further assess the popularly held theories of
           craniofacial growth and effects of injury to various facial growth sites (i.e.
           mandibular condyles, nasal septum).

        2. Attempt to evaluate the effects of various treatment modalities of facial fracture on
           skeletal growth and development (i.e. open reduction and internal fixation versus closed
           reduction and external fixation), (open reduction and internal fixation with metallic
           vs. absorbable fixation). We will evaluate the effect of metallic internal fixation on
           subsequent craniofacial skeletal growth and development, as well as the routine needed
           for its removal.
