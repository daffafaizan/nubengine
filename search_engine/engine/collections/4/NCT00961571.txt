      adjuvant therapy and ECOG performance status at study entry.

      In this study, we propose to obtain PET scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 24 weeks from
      the initiation of treatment. Response at 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 24 weeks will be correlated to
      progression-free survival, overall survival and response according to RECIST criteria.

      We will collect plasma and urine samples from enrolled patients before and four weeks after
      sunitinib treatment. The samples will be analyzed and results correlated with patient
      clinical outcomes in order to explore the underlying mechanism of sunitinib induced
      hypertension.
