      fibrillation (AF) or atrial tachycardias (AT) which may be reentrant or focal. Each patient
      will undergo careful data collection, including electrogram data and sites of ablation
      lesions. Ablation will proceed in operator-dependent fashion, and will not be modified in any
      way for this study. The research question is whether algorithms based on data such as
      electrograms and details of the ablation performed can predict which patients will have a
      successful case. Primary endpoints are measures of clinical success defined by (a) acute
      termination of atrial arrhythmia during the case; (b) long-term reduction in arrhythmia
      burden; (c) long-term freedom from arrhythmia. Secondary endpoints include (a) identification
      of sites of arrhythmia termination; (b) improved clinical status.
