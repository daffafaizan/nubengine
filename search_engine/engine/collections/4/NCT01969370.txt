      next-generation sequencing (in particular, whole exome sequencing, or WES) in clinical care.
      Participants are patients who were either seen in the University of North Carolina Cancer and
      Adult Genetics Clinic or referred to the study by their physician. They will be approached by
      their physician or a genetic counselor for recruitment. Once enrolled, a clinical geneticist
      or genetic counselor will obtain consent and collect blood samples to be analyzed using WES.
      Results may include information related to a diagnosis and incidental information. Medically
      actionable incidental findings will be CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement
      Amendments)-certified and returned to participants in a routine genetic counseling session,
      along with diagnostic findings. Eligible adult participants will be randomized to have the
      opportunity to choose to get certain types of non-medically actionable incidental findings,
      as well. Their decisions will be investigated, as will psychosocial and behavioral responses
      to sequencing and receiving sequencing information. This is a longitudinal, mixed methods
      study (i.e., multiple assessments pre- and post-return of results, with both quantitative and
      qualitative methods used to gather data). Because only the quantitative component of the
      study uses randomization, only measures and procedures associated with that component are
      described here.
