      sandwiched between the gluteus maximus and biceps femoris muscle at the level of the greater
      trochanter and ischial tuberosity rather than circumferentially around the nerve. The bone
      landmarks are particularly easier to identify because of the high acoustic mismatch and
      attenuation of bone. The end point of this technique is the distention of the subgluteal
      space to injection through the block needle. This new approach may translate in benefits
      including reducing block procedure time, reducing number of needle passes, reducing side
      effects (vascular complications), and ultimately block success.

      The philosophy of injecting local anesthetics in designated anatomic spaces or between the
      fascial planes where nerves travel, as in the fascia iliaca block for example, is a time
      tested approach and has become more popular with the introduction of ultrasound because of
      the ease of visualizing fascia and bone in comparison to nerves under ultrasound. The call
      for injecting between planes and to stay away from nerves being blocked has found supporting
      evidence in trials involving ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block at the interscalene
      level.

      One important potential advantage of the subgluteal space approach may be an increased safety
      margin created when distance is maintained between injecting needles and target nerves, an
      advantage that seems to make these injection techniques progressively more popular and to
      expand into a variety of single and continuous nerve blocks.

      The investigators aim to compare the newly described ultrasound-guided subgluteal space block
      technique of the sciatic nerve to the currently practiced ultrasound-guided infragluteal
      sciatic nerve block with circumferential perineural spread in patients undergoing unilateral
      TKA surgery.
