      median survival of these children does not exceed 9 months. Radiation therapy may result in
      early and transient amelioration of symptoms, but have not contributed to increase or prolong
      survival. Moreover, chemotherapy has not increased this outcome to date.Prados et al.
      reported encouraging results from a phase I study of TarcevaTM/OSI-774 alone or with
      temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with malignant gliomas. Of 25 evaluated patients, 6
      experienced PR: 4 GBM (glioblastoma multiforme) and 1 grade 3 astrocytoma treated with
      TarcevaTM alone, 1 GBM treated with TarcevaTM/TMZ; 2 had minor responses, and 3 stable
      diseases. These results in malignant glioma and the lack of efficacy in brain stem glioma
      with current treatment suggests the evaluation of this new therapeutic agent in children with
      relapsed brain tumors and upfront at diagnosis in brain stem glioma in combination with
      radiation therapy.
