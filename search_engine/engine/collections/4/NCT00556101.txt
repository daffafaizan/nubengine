    
      WB-MRA is performed in patients referred for conventional x-ray based angiography. The WB-MRA
      is performed first in all patients.

      After both examinations are completed the patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire
      containing questions about their experience of the 2 procedures.

      We will then compare the results for the procedures.
