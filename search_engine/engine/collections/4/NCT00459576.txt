      airways, and airways that are very sensitive to stimulation (hyper-responsiveness). Symptoms
      of asthma frequently begin in early childhood; however, it has been difficult to identify
      pre-symptomatic, at-risk infants and toddlers. Family history of asthma and allergy is
      strongly associated with the early onset and persistence of asthma symptoms, and children
      with early onset persistent asthma are more likely to demonstrate allergies. The development
      of allergic disease results from complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and
      environmental factors; however, infants with atopic dermatitis have a 50% chance of
      developing asthma by 6 years of age. Airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness are
      characteristics of asthmatic children. We plan to evaluate whether infants with allergic
      dermatitis have evidence of airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness, and whether cells
      from the blood and the nose are also hyper-responsive to stimulation prior to the onset of
      clinical symptoms of asthma. In addition we will evaluate whether certain genetic profiles
      are associated with allergic disease in infants.
