      non-specific low back pain and a sedentary lifestyle. The partcipants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the three groups. The first group is the control group, the participants
      will be asked to not change their daily routine. In the first intervention group sedentary
      behaviour will be reduced. The participants will be asked to download an app on their
      smartphone and computer. This app will ask the participants to stand up and walk during 2
      minutes to interrupt their sedentary behaviour during working hours. In the second
      intervention group participants will be asked to increase their physical activity. More
      specifically the participants will be asked to be active for a period of 150min/week. The
      intervention takes place over a period of 6 weeks. During these 6 weeks the participants
      needs to wear an accelerometer the first and the last week of the intervention. The week
      before the intervention a pre-measurement will take place, this means that the participant
      needs to wear an accelerometer during a week, fill out a questionnaire (BPI and SF-36) and
      the pressure pain threshold will be measured. After the intervention (6 weeks) the pressure
      pain threshold will be measured, average steps will be measured (accelerometer) and a
      questionnaire needs to be filled out. These results will be compared to the results before
      the intervention and to the results of the other groups. With this study the investigators
      will investigate whether less sedentary behavior or more physical activity are beneficial for
      chronic low-back pain.
