      take most of the day. Each visit will include a series of evaluations to determine how the
      person is affected by myotonic dystrophy. The results from the initial study visit will be
      compared to the second study visit after 3 months and the third study visit after 1 year. A
      small needle biopsy of a leg muscle will be performed at the first and second study visits
      (but not at the third visit). After the second study visit, participants will be asked to
      make a phone call every day for 30 days to report their symptoms and muscle strength (grip
      strength).
