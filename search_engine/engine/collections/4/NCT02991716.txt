      positions of Implantable Subcutaneous String Defibrillator (ISSD) sense electrodes. reference
      ECG electrodes are also attached (in most cases). Approved ECG recording devices are used to
      record the signal continuously: During an EP session (different types) a bedside recorder,
      and a holter monitor is used during holter recordings. Ep session recordings are performed in
      order to capture different types of arrhythmia, and holter recordings are performed to
      observe changes in ECG morphology due to activity, position changes, circadian cycles etc.
      The data is saved and used in the development of the ISSD.
