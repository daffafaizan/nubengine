      subcutaneous injections of C144-LS and C135-LS at 4ml (approximately 100mg of each antibody
      administered separately) or 8ml (approximately 200mg of each antibody administered
      separately), or sequential intravenous infusions of C144-LS and C135-LS, at one of three
      increasing dose levels (1.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg of each antibody).
