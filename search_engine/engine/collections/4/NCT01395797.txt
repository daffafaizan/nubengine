      universally effective as many patients are unable to stop using or relapse rapidly,
      suggesting that treatment with a single agent alone is insufficient to facilitate cessation
      of use in many patients. Targeting additional pathways that may contribute to the maintenance
      of drug-taking behaviors or relapse may be a more effective strategy to treat individuals
      resistant to first-line approaches.
