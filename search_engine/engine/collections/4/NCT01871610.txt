      A-PET. This is a novel study for linking mTBI and AD by solid, reliable methods, in terms of
      A-PET and cognitive function tests. In addition, we will figure out the importance of APOE
      genotypes for amyloid accumulation and cognitive impairment. These results should shed light
      on the further clinical studies and amyloid-cleaning therapy for prevention and treatment for
      dementia after mTBI.
