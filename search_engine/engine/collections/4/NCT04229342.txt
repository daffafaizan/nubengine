      techniques as follows. In the first technique, a conventional posterior POEM will be
      performed where the sling or oblique fibers will not be spared during POEM. Sling or oblique
      fibers will be recognized using the configuration of fibers below the gastroesophaeal
      junction and by identifying the border between the sling fibers and the circular fibers which
      is formed by the penetrating vessels. In the second group (Oblique fiber group), the sling
      fibers will be selectively spared and only the circular fibers will be spared.

      The other steps of the POEM procedure will be the same as described in the standard technique
      of POEM. These include submucosal injection of saline mixed with indigo carmine dye, mucosal
      incision, submucosal tunneling using triangular knife in spray coagulation mode (Effect 2,
      Watts 50), myotomy extending upto 2-4 cm below the gastroesophageal junction and the closure
      of mucosal incision using endoclips.

      Post POEM management: All the patients will be kept nil per oral for about 24-hours after the
      procedure. A timed barium swallow will be performed the next day and oral liquids will be
      started. A soft puried diet will be started from day 3 onwards.

      Oral proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) equivalent to 40 mg of Pantoprazole per day will be
      prescribed to all the patients unless a contraindication exists.

      Follow-up: The first evaluation will be performed at 2-months after POEM. During this
      evaluation, the following parameters will be recorded: symptom relief, reflux symptoms, and
      esophageal acid exposure. PPIs will be stopped for 1-2 weeks prior to the evaluation of GERD.

      Subsequent evaluation will be at 6-months for reflux symptoms and symptoms of achalasia using
      Eckardt scores.
