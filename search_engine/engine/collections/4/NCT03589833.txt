    
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of YISAIPU plus Tripterygium wilfordii (T2w) for
      the treatment of RA patients. YISAIPU is a recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor
      fusion protein, and tripterygium wilfordii is a chloroform/methanol extract of Tripterygium
      wilfordii Hook F.

      Objectives:

        1. To compare the efficacy of YISAIPU plus T2w versus MTX monotherapy for the treatment of
           signs and symptoms of RA.

        2. To evaluate the safety of YISAIPU plus T2w in patients with RA for 24 weeks.

      Design:

      This is a Phase 2, randomized, 24-week, double-blind, parallel group study, and 506 patients
      with active RA will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following four parallel
      treatment arms:

        1. Methotrexate monotherapy

        2. T2w monotherapy

        3. YISAIPU plus methotrexate

        4. YISAIPU plus T2w

      Escape:

      On week 12, all participants with inadequate response, defined as a <30% improvement of
      swollen and tender joint counts from baseline, will switch to YISAIPU plus T2w treatment
      throughout the study.

      Endpoints :

        1. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

        2. DAS 28 (CRP) and DAS 28 (ESR) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

        3. EULAR response rates at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

        4. Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

        5. Patient assessment of arthritis pain at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.

        6. Patient and physician global assessment of arthritis at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.
