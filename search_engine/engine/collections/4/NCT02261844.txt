      pathway proteins will be measured using western blot analysis for protein expression and
      polymerase chain reaction for gene expression. Activation of signaling pathways in both
      native hepatocytes and carcinoma will be analyzed by multi-plex signal array. The effect on
      transcription factors that may be important in gene expression will be analyzed by
      transcription factor array. The effect of resveratrol in altering hepatocyte and cancer cell
      metabolism will be analyzed by proteomic analysis.
