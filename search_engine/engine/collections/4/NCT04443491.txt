      unit with the diagnosis of respiratory failure monitored with a dedicated nasogastric
      catheter and a central venous catheter for measuring Pes and CVP, respectively.
      Electrocardiogram trace, Pes, CVP and airway pressure (Paw) will be recorded at the end of
      inspiratory and expiratory pauses. The CVP waveforms will be analyzed off-line using a
      dedicated low-pass digital filter to obtain the low-frequency component of CVP (filtered CVP,
      fCVP). Paw, Pes and fCVP will be used to calculate PL using transpulmonary driving pressure
      formula (PL-Pes and PL-fCVP, respectively). The PL values obtained with fCVP and Pes will be
      compared to assess the correlation of the two methods.
