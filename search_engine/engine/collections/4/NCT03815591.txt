    
      For this project, the CVS Pharmacy Health Foundation has identified after-school, school, and
      youth programs nationwide with whom to partner. For this project, the play2PREVENT Lab will
      provide these programs access to the tobacco use reduction/prevention game that the lab has
      created (smokeSCREEN). Program and school staff will enroll participants between the ages of
      10-16 to play smokeSCREEN during their after school, school, and youth program. Before and
      after gameplay, participants will answer assessment questions related to their attitudes,
      beliefs, knowledge, intentions, and behaviors around smoking and tobacco product use. The
      data will be transmitted electronically via the LimeSurvey data collection platform to the
      Lab, for further analysis. None of the Lab staff will have contact with participants or
      after-school/school/youth program coordinators or staff.
