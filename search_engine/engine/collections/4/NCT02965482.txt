      randomized, two-way crossover study. Two testing methodologies will be performed, the
      volumetric method with the Aerogen Solo nebulizer and the two-minute tidal breathing method
      with the Wright nebulizer.

      Participants will undergo four methacholine challenges plus a screening methacholine
      challenge. However, screening is omitted with participants who have completed a methacholine
      challenge in the last six months. Of the four study challenges, two will utilize the Wright
      nebulizer with the two-minute tidal breathing method outlined in the 1999 American Thoracic
      Society Guidelines for Methacholine Challenge Testing. The remaining two challenges will
      utilize the Aerogen Solo nebulizer with the volumetric method. The timing of the spirometric
      manoeuvers and the duration of each inhalation cycle will be consistent with both testing
      methods. Each challenge will be stopped when the participant's forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) drops by at least 20%. This allows determination of aPC20 (provocative
      concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1), which will be converted to aPD20
      (provocative dose). A minimum 24-hour washout period between challenges will be used.
