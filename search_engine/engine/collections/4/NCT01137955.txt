      Patients will undergo a breath test which involves drinking a sugar (lactulose) solution and
      breathing into a machine. This technique will identify the presence of bacteria in the small
      intestine. They will be randomly selected to receive either an antibiotic (rifaximin) or
      placebo three times a day for 10 days to treat their bacterial overgrowth.
