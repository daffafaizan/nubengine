      effect of BEPREVE compared to a placebo eye drop on the measurement of tear film osmolarity
      and tear film lipid layer in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

      Subjects will be screened for this study on day one of dosing with the test article. Subjects
      who sign the informed consent form and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      eligible for participation in this study. They will be assigned sequentially, according to a
      computer generated randomization list, in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either BEPREVE™
      (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution) 1.5% or REFRESH TEARS® Lubricant Eye Drops (1:1).
      Subjects will instill one drop of test article either BEPREVE™ or REFRESH TEARS® into the
      study eyes twice daily for a maximum of 60 days. Subjects will be seen for evaluation on Days
      0, 28±3, and 56±3 following randomization.
