      progressive expansions of lymphocytes of B-cell lineage. These small, mature-appearing
      lymphocytes accumulate in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. CLL is a common
      leukemia in the wester world and accounts for 25% to 30% of adult leukemias. CD19,an integral
      membrane protein, is expressed by pro-B cells and functions as a co-stimulatory molecule that
      regulates mature B-cell activation and enhances B-cell proliferation. MDX-1342, a fully human
      monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated to specifically bind to human CD19 antigen with high
      affinity. Therefore, it is theorized that MDX-1342 will block activation of B cell
      stimulation, decreasing the number of cancerous B cell clones.
