      resorbable TephaFLEX sling implanted via a retropubic procedure to treat SUI.

      Prospective, observational single-center study with a follow-up of 24 months post-surgery. Up
      to 25 patients will be recruited at Groote Schuur Hospital Urogynecology Out-Patient
      Department. Eligible patients will receive a retropubic surgical producedure where a
      TephaFLEX sling, composed of the resorbable material P4HB, is placed. After the surgical
      procedure, follow-up visits are scheduled at 4-6 weeks, 3 months (+/- 2 weeks), 6 months (+/-
      2 weeks), 12 months (+/- 1 month), and 24 months (+/- 1 month) post-procedure. TephaFLEX
      sling, manufactured by Tepha, Inc., will be implanted via a retropubic mid-urethral sling
      procedure for treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence. The product is supplied as
      a sterile, single-use device. One device will be utilized per patient. TephaFLEX sling,
      developed specifically for treatment of stress urinary incontinence, is a single layer,
      bioresorbable, mesh made from poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) monofilament fiber. The mesh is
      constructed as a 11mm x 60cm tape with an open pore structure, and is enclosed in a
      polyethylene sleeve to ease insertion. The mesh was designed specifically to provide strength
      over the three-month critical wound healing period in soft tissue repair and reinforcement,
      and to encourage the proliferation of healthy tissue at the repair site. The product
      undergoes a gradual loss of strength after implantation and is essentially resorbed by 18 -
      24 months.
