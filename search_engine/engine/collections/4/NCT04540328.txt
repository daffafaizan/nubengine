      chronic periodontitis and 40 periodontally health subjects were included into the present
      study. The probing depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index, gingival index and blood
      samples were collected at baseline and at the 3rd months after treatment and the serum levels
      of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), homocysteine
      (Hcy), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined with enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
