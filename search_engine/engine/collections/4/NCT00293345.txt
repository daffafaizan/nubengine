    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of 3-AP administered as a 24 hour infusion
      in combination with and fixed-dose gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors or lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of the 3-AP/GEM combination in
      regard to organ specificity, time course, predictability, and reversibility.

      II. To document the therapeutic response of this combination in those patients when possible.

      III. To measure deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) before and after treatment at specified times and try to correlate findings to
      activity and toxicity of 3-AP.

      IV. To perform limited pharmacokinetic analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine®).Patients receive 3-AP
      (Triapine®) IV over 24 hours followed by gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100-125 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy beyond
      documented CR.Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine®) until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
