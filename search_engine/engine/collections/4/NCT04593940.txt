      moderately or severely ill hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. Trial participants
      will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the participants are discharged from the
      hospital prior to Day 29, they will have follow-up study visits at Days 8, 11, 15, 22, and
      29. For discharged participants, it is preferred that the Day 8, 11, 15, and 29 visits are in
      person to obtain safety laboratory tests and blood (serum/plasma) samples for secondary
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions
      may limit the ability of the participant to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits
      may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not
      have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The Day 60
      assessment will be conducted by phone.

      The effectiveness of each therapeutic agent as add-on therapy to SoC plus remdesivir
      (provided) will be evaluated based on the primary endpoint of time to recovery by Day 29. The
      sample size requirements are based on the ability to detect a moderate improvement in time to
      recovery (3-4 fewer days) for each agent. A total of 788 recoveries are required for each
      comparison to provide approximately 85% power to detect a recovery rate ratio of 1.25.
      Assuming 73% of participants achieve recovery in 28 days, consistent with the ACTT-1 results,
      the total sample size to evaluate 1, 2, and 3 agents in ACTIV-1 IM is approximately 1080,
      1620, and 2160, respectively. Because each agent is being compared to SoC with no
      between-agent comparisons, no multiplicity adjustments for multiple agents are planned.
