    
      Study design: This phase IIa study consists of 2 parts performed sequentially: a preliminary
      safety assessment followed by the core study with a double-blind, randomized, dose-ranged
      cohort of patients receiving Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and an open-label cohort of
      patients not receiving ERT.

      Preliminary safety assessment (N=2): open-label, escalating dose (2 doses) study. If
      acceptable safety profile is achieved, patients will be then included in the open-label arm
      of the core study.

      Core study

      Core study will be conducted on 2 populations in parallel:

        -  A first cohort (N=18): MPS VI patients receiving ERT assigned in 3 arms:

             -  Placebo (N=6)

             -  Odiparcil 500 mg per day (250 mg BID) (N=6)

             -  Odiparcil 1000 mg per day (500 mg BID) (N=6).

        -  A second cohort (N=6): MPS VI patient not receiving ERT (odiparcil 1000 mg per day (500
           mg BID)).

      Study duration: The overall study duration will be 20 months, including the 10-month
      enrolment period.

      For each patient, the study duration will be:

        -  Preliminary safety assessment: 6 weeks including a 4-week run-in period followed by
           2-week treatment period. Then, patients will go on treatment period in core study.

        -  Core study: 34 weeks including a 4-week run-in period followed by 26-week treatment
           period and 4-week of follow-up.
