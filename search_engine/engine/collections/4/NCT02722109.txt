      therapy planning, calculated based on single energy CT and dual energy CT images.

      The calculation methods for proton stopping power ratios differs for the two types of CT
      images, and researchers want to investigate if the proton stopping power ratio can be
      estimated more accurately by using dual energy CT. A more accurate stopping power ratio
      calculation gives a more accurate proton range determination in the patient tissue, which
      again will lead to a better knowledge of the dose distribution in the patient undergoing
      cancer treatment with proton beam irradiation.

      Knowing the accurate dose distribution allows for an uncertainty margin reduction around the
      tumor, which will result in less normal tissue being irradiated and thereby the risk of side
      effects is reduced without risking an under-dosage of the tumor.
