      Term Follow-up Phase of the study.

      In keeping with the recently released Guidance on Monitoring For Delayed Adverse Events, that
      states that for the first 5 years all subjects should undergo monitoring of vector sequences
      every 6 months, subjects will visit the clinic at a maximum of 6 months intervals for a blood
      test evaluating persistence of vector sequences.

      Therefore for the first 5 years, subjects will have 6 months visits for safety assessment.
      For years 6 to 15, subjects will be contacted by phone or mail. At these contacts, subjects
      will be asked about their health status.
