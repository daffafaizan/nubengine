      ERM (epiretinal membrane). However, despite successful surgery, approximately 10-30% of
      patients may not experience any improvement in visual acuity (ref. 1-7). Macular causes of
      unsatisfactory visual outcome following vitrectomy include persistent macular edema and
      reoccurrence of epiretinal membrane (ref. 1-7). Concomitant administration of intravitreal
      corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide) after pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling
      for epiretinal membrane has been reported to speed up and improve the anatomic and functional
      outcome (ref 8). Given that intravitreal triamcinolone has been reported to last
      approximately 113 days ina post-vitrectomy eye (ref. 9); the investigators postulate that a
      longer-acting corticosteroid such as Ozurdex could not only have the benefits of improved
      anatomic and functional outcomes, but also a longer sustained effect.
