      study to determine the efficacy and safety of two different dose schedules of PRM-151 in
      participants with PMF and post ET/PV MF. There were two treatment cohorts, each assigned to
      one of two dose schedules receiving either single-agent PRM-151 or PRM-151 in combination
      with ruxolitinib. Participants were assigned to a weekly or every four week dosing schedule
      by the investigator.

      Stage 2 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      three different doses of PRM-151 in participants with PMF and post ET/PV MF. Participants
      will be randomized to one of three doses: 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of PRM-151. This
      is the second stage of an adaptive design study as defined in FDA Draft Guidance for
      Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, February 2010.
      Modifications to dose levels, schedule, and regimen have been made in Stage 2 based on data
      from Stage 1.
