    
      This study is an open label, single-centre, randomized investigation of sonothrombolysis in
      60 adult patients presenting with STEMI within 6 hours of the onset of clinical symptoms and
      receiving perfusion therapy with fibrinolysis as part of a pharmacoinvasive strategy.

      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either adjunct treatment with sonothrombolysis or standard
      therapy alone according to the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart
      Association (ACC/AHA) or European Society of Cardiology (ESC) STEMI and PCI guidelines. All
      patients will receive serial echocardiography assessments during and after reperfusion with
      the final ECHO assessment at 90 days (+/- 7d) post reperfusion. Patient outcomes (medical
      records review) will be followed for 1 year after reperfusion.
