      available for use of BCH provider through the library portal. It is offered along other
      resources on that webpage (UpToDate, Micromedex, and VisualDx). See addendum 1.

      Recently, a pediatric rheumatology arm was added to the expertise of SimulConsult, guided by
      our co-PI, Dr. Robert Sundel. As this tool is being offered and used, the investigators would
      like to assess metric of performance of this tool in enhancing study participants (trainees)
      knowledge about the work up of patients with a potential rheumatologic disorder. See also
      www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pubmed/27964737 The investigators are conducting a clinical research to
      assess improvement in the clinical performance of trainees evaluating patients with a
      potential rheumatologic disorder. The intervention involved in using a computerized decision
      support tool already available in the Boston Children's Hospital domain. The outcome will be
      comparing this performance to that of an attending physician as the gold standard. The
      investigators will assess the study participants performance across two locations: Emergency
      Department and Rheumatology clinic. Care to patients remains unchanged, as the workup plan
      and care is provided by an attending across both domains.

      Our main hypothesis is that using a decision support tool will result in a higher agreement
      rate between study participants' differential diagnosis and work up plan compared with the
      gold standard (attending differential diagnosis and research plan).
