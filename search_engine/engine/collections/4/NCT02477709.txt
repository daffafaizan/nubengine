      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

      This will be the first experience of administering gefapixant in patients with IPF. P2X3
      receptors are found on the chemosensory afferents of the carotid body and can influence
      sympathetic autonomic discharge, especially in sensitized subjects; accordingly, by blocking
      these P2X3 receptors, gefapixant may have an effect of reducing sympathetic activity.
      Therefore in order to determine whether P2X3 antagonism would have an effect on the
      hemodynamic measures such as blood pressure in patients with IPF, study AF219-019 is being
      performed. These patients will be closely monitored in order to determine any such effect.
