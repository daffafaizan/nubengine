      different ratios of amylose and amylopectin and different amounts of soluble and insoluble
      fibre with an appropriate control during acute phase testing in healthy volunteers. Possible
      relationships between composition of the barley tortillas and the degree of physiological
      response will also be investigated as the secondary objective.
