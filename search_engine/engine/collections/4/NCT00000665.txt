      currently the only drug approved for treatment of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised
      patients. Ganciclovir suppresses CMV infections, and relapse occurs in virtually all AIDS
      patients when ganciclovir is discontinued. Because of their similar hematologic (blood)
      toxicities, the simultaneous use of ganciclovir and zidovudine (AZT) is not recommended. More
      recently the drug foscarnet has become available for investigational use. Studies so far
      indicate that remission of CMV retinitis occurs in 36 to 77 percent of patients, and that
      relapse occurs in virtually all patients when the drug is discontinued. The relative
      effectiveness of foscarnet compared with ganciclovir for the immediate control of CMV
      infections is unknown. Further, the long-term effects of foscarnet or ganciclovir on CMV
      retinitis, survival, and morbidity are unknown. There is also no definitive information on
      the relative effectiveness and safety of deferred versus immediate treatment for CMV
      retinitis confined to zones 2 and 3.

      Patients are assigned to one of two groups: (1) Patients with any retinitis in zone 1 or
      patients with retinitis involving 25 percent or more of zones 2 and 3; and (2) Patients in
      whom retinitis is confined to less than 25 percent of zones 2 and 3 of the retina. Half the
      patients in group 1 get immediate treatment with ganciclovir; the other half receive
      immediate treatment with foscarnet. Patients in group 2 are treated with foscarnet or
      ganciclovir either immediately or treatment is deferred. If patients in group 2 have strong
      preferences regarding when therapy is instituted, they may elect immediate treatment or
      deferral of treatment.
