    
      This is a randomized (patients are assigned to different treatments based on chance), double
      blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether medication or placebo [an inactive
      substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect
      in a clinical study] is being taken, or at what dosage), parallel-group (each group of
      patients are treated at the same time), multicenter study to determine the effectiveness and
      safety of two different doses of ustekinumab administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as
      compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (the most
      common type of psoriasis). 766 patients will be randomized to Group 1 (ustekinumab 45 mg),
      Group 2 (ustekinumab 90 mg) and Group 3 (placebo) at Week 0. The study was designed to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 2 dose regimens of ustekinumab: (1) 45 mg at Weeks 0
      and 4 followed by 45 mg every 12 weeks maintenance therapy (treatment designed to help the
      original primary treatment succeed) and (2) 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by 90 mg every 12
      weeks maintenance therapy. The study will consist of 4 periods: (1) Placebo-controlled
      portion of study [Week 0 to Week 12] during which the safety and effectiveness of 2 doses
      (45mg and 90mg) of ustekinumab will be compared to placebo; (2) Placebo crossover and active
      treatment portion of study [Week 12 to Week 40] during which patients randomized to receive
      placebo at Week 0 will crossover to receive ustekinumab, and all patients will receive active
      treatment; (3) Randomized withdrawal portion of study [beginning at Week 40] during which
      patients who received ustekinumab [45mg or 90mg every 12 weeks] at Week 0 and are responding
      to it, will be randomized either to placebo or continued maintenance therapy with
      ustekinumab; and (4) Long-term extension [from Week 52 to Week 264 (ie, 5 years)] period
      during which the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab long-term use will be evaluated in
      patients.
