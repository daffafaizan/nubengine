      adults and is widely recognized as a major stress factor. Several studies have shown that the
      first years after the diagnosis are distressing in terms of adjustment to the disease and
      that MS negatively affects patients' psychological wellbeing, quality of life (QoL), and
      social functioning (Kern et al., 2013; Moss-Morris et al., 2013; Pagnini et al., 2014).
      Nevertheless, up to know, the link between disease-specific variables at diagnosis,
      resilience, and psychological adjustment of MS patients remains largely unexplored,
      especially in adolescents and young adults.

      This study aims to fill the gap of knowledge on the biopsychosocial (BPS) characteristics and
      resilience of young adults newly diagnosed with MS, to evaluate the relationship among these
      variables, and to develop a BPS model of resilience.

      Biological and clinical characteristics of young adults newly diagnosed with MS in the
      University Hospital of Verona will be investigated by collecting clinical information,
      performing neurological examinations, brain and cervical spinal cord magnet resonance imaging
      (MRI), and analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers (i.e. measures of inflammation,
      axonal damage, oxidative stress and microRNAs (miRNAs) expression), body composition, gut
      microbiota, and movement/perceptual markers. Psychosocial characteristics (e.g.,
      psychological distress, illness perception, mindfulness trait, and coping strategies), QoL,
      psychological wellbeing and resilience will be assessed by self-report questionnaires.
      Comparative statistics (i.e., ANOVA or unpaired samples t-test, correlation and regression
      analyses) will be applied to evaluate the relationship among biological, psychological and
      social factors.

      The results of this study are expected not only to allow a comprehensive and new
      understanding of the determinants of resilience and adjustment in MS patients at this crucial
      stage of life but also to inform resilience interventions, tailored to adolescents' and young
      patients' specific needs, aiming to reduce the risk of maladaptive reactions to the disease
      and to improve the psychological well-being and their quality of life.
