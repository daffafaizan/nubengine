      Exosomes will be isolated from spot urine by ultracentrifugation and tested using western
      blotting. In-house developed antibodies against different parts of the ENaC gamma subunit as
      well as commercial antibodies will be used. A marker for exosomes will validate the presence
      of exosomes in the urine.

      Power considerations:

      In this cross over salt-intervention study with quantification of ENaC the investigators
      refer to a published study regarding the sodium-chloride co-transporter (NCC) in the kidney,
      were rats where given aldosterone infusion or a low salt diet. In this study n=6 was
      sufficient to detect a 2-3 fold change in NCC in urinary exosomes. Furthermore 5 patients
      with primary aldosteronism had a significant increase in NCC in urinary exosomes (N. Lubbe et
      al, Hypertension 2012).

      On the basis of this the investigators choose to test 10 persons, but are not able to make a
      regular power calculation.
