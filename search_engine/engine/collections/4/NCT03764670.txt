    
      Tacrolimus (TAC) is the most important immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy after
      kidney transplantation. Many genetic and clinical factors had been found to have effect on
      TAC pharmacokinetics (PK). Whether these factors affect clinical outcomes is still
      controversial.

      In this retrospective study, investigators will review records of kidney transplant patients
      with TAC based immunosuppression recruited from a previous study (IRB approval number:
      201512005RINC) to understand the influence of clinical and genetic factors on their 3-years
      clinical outcomes, including biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient survival, graft survival
      and safety issues of kidney transplant patients.
