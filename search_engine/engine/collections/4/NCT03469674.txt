      prognostic factors to prevent overtreatment and select those women for adjuvant treatment who
      will have a clinically relevant reduction of the risk of relapse by the adjuvant treatment.
      Risk profiles have traditionally been based on clinicopathological factors such as age,
      stage, grade, LVSI and depth of invasion. Newer, both molecular-genetic (the cancer genome
      atlas subgroups) or immunohistochemistry-based (L1-CAM) risk factors have become available
      which are strongly related to outcomes and risk of cancer spread. In a comprehensive analysis
      of the PORTEC-1 and-2 biobank an integrated clinicopathological and molecular risk profile
      was determined which separated the current high-intermediate risk group of endometrial cancer
      in 3 separate groups (favourable, intermediate or unfavourable) with clearly separated
      outcomes, which is now prospectively tested in the clinic to determine adjuvant treatment.
      This is the first randomised trial using the molecular risk factors to assign adjuvant
      treatment for women with stage I-II high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer.
