      bone,periodontal ligament cementum and gingiva. The most common form is plaque-induced
      gingivitis . Bleeding on gingival probing is one of the hallmarks of gingival
      inflammation.The removal of dental plaque is the most crucial action for preventing and
      treating gingival inflammation. Toothbrush along with toothpaste are still the most reliable
      means of plaque control. However, cleaning should be thorough and performed at regular
      intervals.

      Toothbrush has a limited ability to reach all the areas around the tooth. Inter-dental areas
      are prone for plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Dental floss is one of the most
      effective tool in addition to tooth brush to remove inter-dental plaque. The sequence of
      using toothbrush and dental floss may influence the removal of dental plaque and consequently
      reducing the bleeding on probing of gingiva. There is conflicting evidence in the literature.
      The hypothesis of this study is that the sequence of brushing and flossing will not influence
      control of plaque control and gingival inflammation.
