      psychotropic medications has become widespread as a means of implementing "precision
      medicine", with some insurers electing to cover the cost of testing. These developments have
      put increasing pressure on the Veterans Health Administration to implement a mental health
      focused PGxs program, especially for treating depression, but without sufficient scientific
      study to support the utility of clinical application.

      Objectives: The investigators propose a program of research to evaluate the utility of PGx
      testing in treating Major Depressive Disorder.

      Methods: The investigators plan a multi-site RCT (n=2000), patient/provider dyads will be
      randomly assigned to receive results of the PGx battery right after randomization (i.e.
      intervention group) or after 6 months of treatment as usual (i.e. delayed results group)The
      study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. Veterans with MDD whose care is guided by the results of the PGx battery (the
           intervention group) will have a higher rate of remission of depression than the delayed
           results group. (Primary Hypothesis)

        2. Provider/patient dyads in the intervention group will use fewer medications that have
           potential gene-drug interactions based on commercial PGx test results than dyads in the
           delayed results group (Primary Hypothesis).
