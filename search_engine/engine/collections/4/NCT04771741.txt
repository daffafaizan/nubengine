      orthopedic surgeons frequently prescribe and over-prescribe narcotic pain medications during
      the postoperative period. In an effort to minimize narcotic analgesia and its potential side
      effects, opioid-free multimodal pathways have been developed in many orthopaedic
      sub-specialties with promising results. There have been early studies reporting the results
      of non-narcotic protocols during the intra-operative period. Likewise, there have been
      several studies reporting the results of inpatient non-narcotic pain protocols in select foot
      and ankle surgeries. However, there remains a lack of published literature evaluating
      opiate-free multimodal pain protocols for elective outpatient foot and ankle surgeries.
      Currently, our practice utilizes an opioid-free post-operative pain protocol for patients
      undergoing elective outpatient foot and ankle surgery. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      post-operative pain using this opioid-free multimodal pain protocol at days 1,3, and 8
      following elective outpatient foot and ankle surgery.
