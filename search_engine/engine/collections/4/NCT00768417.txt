      at least one week. During each day of the three study periods, participants were required to
      consume 55g of almonds split up into 5 g portions. They were required to chew the almonds 10,
      25, or 40 times before swallowing, depending on the treatment. During each treatment period,
      all participants followed the same procedures over the four days. On day one after an
      overnight fast, participants reported to the laboratory and were presented with 11, 5 gram
      portions of almonds to chew 10, 25, or 40 times, depending on treatment arm. The participant
      remained in the laboratory for 4 hours post-almond consumption for measurements of blood and
      appetite. For the remainder of the 4 days, participants consumed all meals in the laboratory
      and collected all stools passed. On a separate occasion, recovered particle sizes of
      masticated almonds were measured by a mechanical sieving process. Individuals chewed almond
      samples either 10, 25 or 40 times and expectorated them into sieves.
