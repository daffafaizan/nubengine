    
      This is a prospective, repeated measures cohort study, which is able to make within-subject
      (pre and post boxing tournament) comparisons on measures of physiologic and behavioral
      function.

      We plan to enroll boxing athletes who are participating in a boxing tournament. Each
      individual will be assessed on the following tests: balance (dynamic and static balance),
      vestibular-ocular motor function, neuropsychological function, and symptoms. Additionally,
      each boxing match will be video recorded and the total number of head impacts they sustain
      will be documented.

        -  In order to prospectively assess how a boxing tournament affects balance,
           neuropsychological, and visual functions from pre-tournament assessments to
           post-tournament assessments (Specific Aim 1), we plan to test all athletes before
           competition at the Pan-American games begins (pre-test) and after they have been
           eliminated from the tournament (post-test).

        -  In order to measure the associations between the number of head blows sustained during a
           boxing tournament with balance, neuropsychological, visual, and symptom deficits, we
           will also use a video camera to record each match and count the total number of hits to
           the head.
