    
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery
      remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year
      survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease
      at the time of diagnosis.

      Regarding the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, proper tool with high diagnostic yield is very
      important. The investigators investigated the technical feasibility and diagnostic yield of
      recent-developed new 20-gauge Procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in pancreatic
      solid lesions.

      The investigators applied the 20-gauge procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in
      the diagnosis of pancreatic solid mass. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled for the
      present pilot study.
