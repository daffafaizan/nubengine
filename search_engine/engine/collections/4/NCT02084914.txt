      investigations, including semen analysis, tests of ovulation and tubal patency, have failed
      to detect any gross abnormality (Crosignani et al., 1993). It is a diagnosis of exclusion,
      almost 30-40% of infertile couples would suffer from this type of subfertility (Simth et al.,
      2003). A diversity of causes had been hypothesized to explain the condition. Cervical,
      uterine, ovulatory, peritoneal, immunological, endocrinological, genetic defects and
      reproductive physiology disturbances had been continuously suggested as potential causative
      factors (Rov et al., 2005; Shveiky et al., 2006; Bellver et al., 2008; Golubovsky, 2008;
      Woodson, 2008). Empirically, interventions for managing unexplained infertility had been
      widely practiced. These interventions include expectant management, intrauterine insemination
      (IUI) with ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization (El-Toukhy & Khalaf, 2008;
      Bhattachary et al., 2010).

      In humans, the uterus becomes receptive during the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle
      (days 19-23), commonly known as the window of implantation (WOI). It is assumed that
      inadequate uterine receptivity is responsible for approximately two-thirds of implantation
      failures (Simon et al., 1998). Since an impairment of endometrial receptivity may be a cause
      of subfertility in a group of couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility (Jasper et al.,
      2006; Boroujerdnia & Nikbakht, 2008; Konac et al., 2009). Endometrial scratching may help a
      group of couples with unexplained infertility.
