      electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) will be included in this randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      Following (partial) response to ECT treatment (at least a 25% reduction of clinical
      symptoms), participants will be randomly assigned to a computer based CCT or active placebo
      control. A first aim of this RCT is to assess the effects of CCT compared to an active
      placebo condition on depression symptomatology, cognitive complaints, and quality of life.
      Secondly, participants will be monitored every two weeks for a period of six months following
      CCT/active placebo, allowing the detection of potential relapse of depression. Thirdly, the
      investigators will assess participant evaluation of the addition of cognitive remediation to
      ECT using qualitative interview methods (satisfaction, acceptability and appropriateness).
      Finally, in order to further advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying effects
      of CCT, exploratory analyses may be conducted using facial video footage collected during the
      CCT/active control phase of the study.
