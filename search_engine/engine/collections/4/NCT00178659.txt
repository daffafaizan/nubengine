      (ICP). Currently, there are no effective ways to predict if the ICP of a patient will reach
      uncontrollable levels. Various cytokines (balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory) and
      other factors are thought to underlie increases in ICP. The specific aim of this research is
      to determine if the blood from brain-injured patients contains reproducible protein markers
      that appear prior to elevations in ICP. We propose to employ mass spectrometry, antibody
      array and ELISA to profile proteins in the serum of patients suffering from traumatic brain
      injury. These protein profiles will be compiled by a pattern recognition program that has the
      capacity to learn and make predictions based on the spectra and associated patient
      information. Each time a sample is analyzed, it is added to the database allowing the program
      to make increasingly accurate predictions. Protein profiles of patients with known ICP values
      will be analyzed. Our hypothesis is that alterations in serum protein composition will
      precede changes in intracranial pressure giving rise to predictable patterns that can be
      detected using large-scale proteomic analysis. After approximately 90 non-brain trauma and 90
      brain-trauma patients are analyzed, if markers are found, the predictability of elevated ICP
      will be tested. If successful, this may aid the neurosurgeon in determining future courses of
      treatment.
