    
      The Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System is a next-generation modular system for endovascular
      repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The system was designed with the following
      enhancements: a suprarenal wire frame to provide migration resistance, and improved
      flexibility designed to treat difficult anatomies.

      Medtronic Vascular submitted a Pre-Market Application (PMA) to the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) on October 17, 2007, and received market approval for the Talent
      Abdominal Stent Graft System on April 15th, 2008. As a condition of approval, the FDA has
      requested a post-approval study. Medtronic has therefore designed a post-approval study, in
      collaboration with FDA, to document the performance of the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft
      System under market conditions.
