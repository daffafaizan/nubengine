      study, bevacizumab will be added to the pre-operative chemotherapy and radiation, and then
      bevacizumab will also be administered for a year after surgery. Bevacizumab is a humanized
      monoclonal antibody (a type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help
      defend the body from infection and cancer) produced by Genentech, Inc. using recombinant DNA
      technology. Bevacizumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Bevacizumab is experimental in the
      treatment of esophageal cancer and has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      esophageal cancer. Bevacizumab is an antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth
      factor, or VEGF. VEGF is a growth factor with a well defined role in normal and abnormal
      blood vessel formation. It is present in a wide variety of normal tissues, but is produced in
      excess by most solid cancers (tumors). In the setting of cancer, VEGF promotes the growth of
      blood vessels that bring nutrients to tumor cells. In studies with laboratory animals,
      bevacizumab inhibits the growth of several different types of human cancer cells, including
      colon cancer cells, by blocking the effects of VEGF. By blocking VEGF, your doctors hope that
      bevacizumab may decrease blood supply to the tumor, and therefore decrease the ability of the
      tumor to grow and come back after chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
