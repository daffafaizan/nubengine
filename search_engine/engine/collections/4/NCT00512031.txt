      PAI-1 alters the migratory properties of human myeloid and endothelial cells sufficiently
      enough to regulate entry and exit from the vascular space. Human monocyte become the key
      cellular orchestrators of human atherosclerotic plaque. We believe that a "loss" of PAI-1
      activity may promote a pro-atherogenic effect in human vasculature thereby defining a novel
      atheroprotective effect for PAI-1 when expressed at normal levels in humans. By using RNA
      interference to achieve PAI-1 gene, we hope to elucidate the mechanistic basis of how PAI-1
      regulation may affect human migration within the vasculature.
