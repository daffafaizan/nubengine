      basis to a traditional farming environment will show increased beneficial bacteria in the gut
      microbiome and enhanced emotional well-being. Secondary hypotheses are that 1) increased
      presence of farm-derived immunoregulatory micro-organisms in the nose (indicating exposure)
      will be associated with measures of emotional well-being and prosocial behavior. To test
      these hypotheses, 40 urban children ages 7-13 years will be studied prior to and following a
      1, 2, or 3-week camp experience at the Heartland Farm Sanctuary summer camp program in
      Verona, WI. Assessments for behavior (via questionnaires), gut microbiota composition and
      function (via stool) and presence in the body of farm-derived immunoregulatory
      micro-organisms (via nasal swab) will be assessed at baseline (2 weeks before the start of
      camp and the weekend before camp starts), immediately following the child's 1, 2, or 3-week
      camp experience and at 1 month following completion of the camp experience. Importantly, this
      assessment schedule will allow the investigators to assess the longevity of any observed
      physical or behavioral changes induced by exposure to the farming environment.
