      functional improvement in people with hemiparesis. This is a randomized, double-blinded,
      sham-controlled rTMS study in conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for
      2 weeks to improve motor function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for
      at least 12 weeks after rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will
      be offered an open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment.
