    
      The present study is designed as a prospective collection of information potentially useful
      to predict the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with non-follicular low grade B-cell
      lymphoma.

      The study is aimed to verify whether a prognostic collection of data would allow the
      development of a more accurate prognostic assessment for non-follicular low grade B-cell
      lymphomas.
