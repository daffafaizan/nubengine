      after brachytherapy, patients undergo catheter-based ultrasound hyperthermia therapy over 60
      minutes. Treatment with HDR brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy repeats within 1-3 weeks.
      Patients may then undergo 2 additional standard HDR brachytherapy sessions.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.
