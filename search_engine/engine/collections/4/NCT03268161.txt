    
      This is a retrospective observational study in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Mutational
      analysis will be performed for patients with a medullary or blood sample stored in a bio-bank
      during lymphocyte phenotyping. This phenotyping was carried out most often in search of a
      malignant haemopathy associated with the monoclonal peak. No new samples were taken from the
      patient (blood or spinal cord).

      Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement of the clonal B cells are also assessed.
