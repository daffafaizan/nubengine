      first-episode psychosis.

      Aim 1: Assess whether individuals with first-episode psychosis have differences in mean
      temperature and diurnal temperature variation as compared to individuals without psychosis.

      Aim 2: Examine whether mean temperature and temperature variation during periods of rest and
      activity are different between individuals with first-episode psychosis versus people without
      psychosis.

      Aim 3: Explore the association between current core body temperature and current ratings of
      psychotic symptomatology among individuals with first-episode psychosis.

      Study participants will complete baseline assessments (e.g., symptoms, functioning, and
      sleep) and then complete a 24-36 hour ambulatory assessment period in which core temperature,
      activity, sleep, and heart rate variability will be tracked continuously and symptom severity
      will be assessed sporadically using a symptom rating app on their smart phone. .Then they
      will complete a second study visit to repeat baseline assessments.
