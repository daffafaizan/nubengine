      the CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS who meet the selection criteria will be approach to participate
      in this prospective single-center observational study. Using the visual analog scale and
      anesthesia scale, the pain and the satisfaction of the patient will be evaluated respectively
      2 weeks postoperatively. At the second visit, 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively, the participant
      will complete the QuickDASH questionnaire to evaluate his functional recovery and the
      participant's pain will be reassessed with the visual analogue scale. Finally, 12 weeks
      postoperatively, the wrist-joint range of motion and grip-strength test results will be
      recorded. The participant will also be asked to complete the QuickDASH and PRWE
      (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) questionnaires to reevaluate his functional recovery.
