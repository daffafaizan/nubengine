      effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct,
      readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental multiclade HIV vaccine,
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a similarly structured adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost,
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, in HIV uninfected adults. The DNA plasmids in both the vaccines code for
      proteins from HIV subtypes A, B, and C, which together represent 90% of new HIV infections in
      the world. Participants in this study will be recruited in North America, South America, and
      Africa.

      Each volunteer will participate in the study for 36 months. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 participants will receive the DNA HIV vaccine at study
      entry and at Months 1 and 2. At Month 6, Group 1 participants will receive an injection of
      the adenoviral vector HIV vaccine. Group 2 participants will receive placebo at study entry
      and Months 1, 2, and 6. There will be 17 study visits, which will occur at study entry and
      every 2 weeks thereafter until Day 70; at Month 6 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Day 210;
      and Months 9.5, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. A physical exam, adverse events reporting, HIV and
      pregnancy prevention counseling, and medication history will occur at each visit. Blood and
      urine collection will occur at selected visits.
