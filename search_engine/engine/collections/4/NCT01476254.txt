      respiratory complications after laparoscopic surgery.

      The investigators will include 60 women scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy or
      cholecystectomy. The investigators will measure the pulmonary function by different methods
      during and for 2 hours after surgery. Moreover, the incidence of respiratory complications
      including pneumonia, respiratory failure and radiologically verified atelectasis will be
      registered.
