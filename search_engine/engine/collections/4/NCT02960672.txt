      center, 336 person-times in study enrollment totally. The patients with interstitial lung
      disease had significantly higher serum baseline KL-6 and MMP-7 levels compared with healthy
      control.They divided into progressive group and non-progressive group according to disease
      change. Serum KL-6 and MMP-7 levels were elevated in patients if disease progression, but
      baseline level of biomarkers in progressive group were not significant higher compare with
      non-progressive group .Binary logistic regression showed △KL-6 and △MMP-7 were significant
      predictors for disease progression. Multivariate Cox analysis showed KL-6 and MMP-7 were
      significantly associated with survival along with other variables.

      The serum levels of KL-6 and MMP-7 were elevated in the individuals with interstitial lung
      disease compared with healthy controls. The rate of poor prognosis and mortality more
      associated with the variability increased biomarker concentrations，rather than the baseline
      concentration.Therefore，Serial measurements of biomarkers contribute to the disease
      monitoring in clinical management.
