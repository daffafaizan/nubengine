           from 2000 and 2010 will be identified. These patients systematically underwent
           neurological, cardiac and respiratory investigations.

        2. Baseline medical and genetic information will be entered in a dedicated database,
           including cardiac and respiratory investigations.

        3. The occurence of severe cardiac and respiratory adverse events will also be collected.

        4. Statistical analysis will be performed to look for correlations between baseline patient
           characteristics and cardiac or respiratory adverse events during follow up.
