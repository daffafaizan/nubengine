      (low, medium, high dose level of VLP per strain), 2 adjuvanted dose levels (low or high dose
      level of VLP per strain) and a placebo-controlled group divided in 3 cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Approximately one hundred and thirty-eight (138) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: seventy-five (75) subjects with the lowest non-adjuvanted dose of
           the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the medium non-adjuvanted dose
           of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the lowest adjuvanted dose
           of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty-five (25) subjects with a placebo. The 7-day
           safety data after the immunization will be collected by the clinical staff and will be
           reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB consisting of the PIs,
           the Sponsor's Medical Officer and 3 external medical advisors (voting members); the
           members will determine if the clinical sites are allowed to continue with the
           immunization of the second cohort.

        -  Cohort 2: Approximately one hundred and seventy-five (175) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: fifty-six (56) subjects with the medium non-adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, fifty-six (56) subjects with the lowest adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the highest adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the highest non-adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty-five (25) subjects with a placebo. The 7-day safety
           data after the immunization will be collected by the clinical staff and reviewed by the
           DSMB prior to allowing immunization of the third cohort.

        -  Cohort 3: Approximately one hundred and thirty-seven (137) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: fifty-six (56) subjects with the highest adjuvanted dose,
           fifty-six (56) subjects with the highest non-adjuvanted dose and twenty-five (25)
           subjects with a placebo.
