      surgery depend on many factors based on the stage, the type of cancer and patient
      acceptability, in terms of her long term peace of mind and survival prospects. Typically,
      breast reconstruction takes place during or soon after mastectomy, to avoid psychological
      distress for the patient, and in some cases, also after lumpectomy or quadrantectomy;
      furthermore breast reconstruction can be done many months or even years after surgery too.

      Today, breast cancer rehabilitation can help survivors to obtain and maintain the highest
      possible physical, social, psychological and vocational functioning, within the limits
      created by cancer and its treatments. After BC surgery, is common to detect disorders as
      shoulder dysfunction, postmastectomy syndrome, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,
      axillary cording, lymphedema and a host of others as postural imbalance.

      Also, alterations in muscle activation and restricted shoulder mobility, which are common in
      BC patients, have been found to affect upper limb function and alterations in muscle activity
      patterns differed by breast surgery and reconstruction type: rehabilitation and in particular
      mobilization stretches and shoulder and scapula exercises after breast surgery are an
      effective resource to improve upper limb range of motion and decrease chest tightness and
      pain.

      This study was prompted by the lack of literature about the quadrantectomy versus mastectomy
      intervention, considering the disability of the upper limb from the operated side, especially
      if in relation to the rehabilitation pathway, currently recommended in BC care.
