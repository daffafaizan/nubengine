        1. establish baseline expectations for Event Free Survival (EFS), Overall Survival (OS),
           MRD responses and quality of life measures for older patients of all ages and pre-morbid
           states;

        2. disclose how best to use knowledge of pre-morbid characteristics to apply the
           appropriate intensity of therapy in order to balance the best disease related outcomes
           against quality of life;

        3. establish national standards of care for this patient group;

        4. provide the essential platform for careful design of future randomised advanced phase
           studies of new therapeutic approaches and agents.
