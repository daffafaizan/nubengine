      participants were divided into two groups based on their genotype. The groups include a
      genotype with an EGT alle and a group of genotype without an EGT alle. All subjects first
      took a low dose of DCA 2.5ug/kg for 5 days then wait 30 days and take a therapeutic dose of
      DCA 25mg/kg for 5 days On the first day and on the 5th day of taking DCA kinetics were be
      done. A total of 16 blood samples were obtained through an intravenous catheter. Urine
      collection will also occur.

      Population pharmacogenetic analysis of MAI allelic frequencies and the GC or LC-MS/MS
      techniques for blood or urinary metabolites were used in this investigation. Pharmacokinetic
      data was used to determine metabolism rate of DCA for each allele
