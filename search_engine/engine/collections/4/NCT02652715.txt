      I. Assess if dietary supplementation with the functional food Salvia hispanica (SH) seed
      improves serum omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FA) levels in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) who have recently completed chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of patients taking 16 grams (g) (approximately 1
      United States [US] tablespoon) of SH per day.

      II. Evaluate the compliance of stool sample collection in lymphoma patients who have
      completed therapy and are in remission.

      III. Evaluate if SH can exert measurable changes of the stool microbiome. IV. Evaluate if
      changes in n-3 levels and stool microbiome persist or resolve after participants are no
      longer taking SH.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Salvia hispanica seed orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
