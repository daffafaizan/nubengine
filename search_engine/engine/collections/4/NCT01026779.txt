    
      The goals of this study, conducted after the introduction of RV5 (RotaTeq) vaccine in the
      community, are: 1) to use a case-control study to estimate rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in
      preventing rotavirus-associated hospitalizations under field conditions, 2) to assess
      rotavirus vaccine coverage and to examine whether and to what extent rotavirus vaccine was
      used outside the recommended age limits (off label) during the first 2 years of its
      implementation in Rhode Island and 3) to investigate risk factors for non-receipt of
      rotavirus vaccine to inform educational efforts for parents and providers, and 4) to
      characterize the strains of rotavirus circulating in the community both prior to and after
      introduction of vaccine to determine if serotype replacement is occurring.
