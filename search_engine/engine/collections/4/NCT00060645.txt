      AP23573, when administered once daily for 5 days to be repeated every 2 weeks (two 2-week
      courses equals 1 cycle). The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the
      pharmacokinetic profile of AP23573, to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of AP23573,
      and to obtain preliminary information on the antineoplastic activity of AP23573.

      Protocol Outline: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive AP23573 over 30 minutes
      by intravenous infusion once daily for 5 days to be repeated every 2 weeks. If tolerated, a
      total of at least 2 cycles will be administered (8-week treatment period). Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
