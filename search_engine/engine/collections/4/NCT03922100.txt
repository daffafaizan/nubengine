    
      This is an open-label Phase I/II, first-in-human, multi-center clinical study in sequential
      cohorts of patients with relapsed or refractory AML or CMML who have exhausted standard
      treatment options or for whom standard therapy is considered unsuitable. The study is
      designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics
      (PD) and to explore anticancer activity of NMS-03592088, a FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3),
      KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) and CSF1R (Colony
      stimulating factor-1 receptor) inhibitor. The study drug will be administered orally once
      daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest (each cycle is 28 days, schedule A)
      or once daily for 28 consecutive days (each cycle is 28 days, schedule B). The study will be
      conducted in two parts: a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion part including patients
      with AML and CMML and a single-stage Phase II exploratory study comprising two parallel
      cohorts of selected patients that are more likely to respond to the drug: a cohort of AML
      FLT3 mutated patients and a second one of patients with CMML. Patients previously treated
      with FLT3 inhibitors are allowed to participate.
