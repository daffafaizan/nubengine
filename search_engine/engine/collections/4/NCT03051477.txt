    
      This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an
      expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity
      of Helixor® M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to
      determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about
      Helixor® M.
