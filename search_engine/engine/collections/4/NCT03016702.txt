      cognitive resilience for use in identification of early Alzheimer's Disease. The
      investigators hypothesize that exposure to the controlled stressor of increased cognitive
      task demand will evoke measurable phenotypes of poor resilience, which will be associated
      with Alzheimer's Disease risk. The study will include 30 volunteer participants from the Duke
      Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Registry (ADPR). The ADPR cohort has been characterized
      according to genetic risk based on genotype at loci associated with Alzheimer's Disease. The
      investigators will recruit a sample from the ADPR that includes 15 people in the "genetic
      high risk" group and 15 people, matched by age, in the "genetic low risk" group.
      Investigators and experimenters are masked to the genetic profile of all participants. All
      participants will undergo two cognitive stress test protocols. Both protocols include memory
      and executive function components, one done during functional MRI and one while ambulating on
      a force sensor mat. Both cognitive stress tests are minimal risk; the primary risk of this
      study is loss of confidentiality. Genetic testing is not performed as part of this protocol;
      the sampling strategy will make use of prior genetic testing results, which are not revealed
      to the primary investigators. In addition to determining whether scores on the two novel
      tests statistically differ by AD risk groups, the project will establish the tests'
      feasibility and characteristics for use in future study.
