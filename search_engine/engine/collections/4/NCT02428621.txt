      designs, fixed or removable, are used in Class II malocclusion correction; one of the largest
      means being used is the Herbst. These appliances can be individualized, made to measure by
      the prosthetist or standardised (on market). A new medical device, EC marked and marketed
      since 2011, the Twicare®, can be used as positioner, growth activator, but also for lingual
      re-education.

      There are numerous publications comparing the activators' effects or the appliance effects on
      mandibular growth, but none have studied the Twicare®. The aim of this study is to assess the
      efficacy of this specific removable appliance in mandibular advancement in Class II skeletal
      in children aged from 7 to 12 years old. The appliance will be compared with the Herbst and
      one untreated group will be included to control the internal validity of the study as
      recommend in noninferiority trials.

      Patients will have a follow-up every two months during 6 to 12 months until the Class I
      occlusion is achieved. A lateral cephalogram and a dental silicon impression will be
      performed at the beginning (T0) and at the end of the treatment (T1) in order to evaluate
      cephalometric measurement changes, ANB, overjet and canine and molar class evolutions. The
      data collected at the beginning and at the end of the treatment will be analyzed and compared
      aware from patient, treatment and time, in order to assess the Twicare® noninferiority
      compared to the Herbst and to confirm the superiority of these two appliances versus
      observation. We will study, in parallel, the nasal ventilator function as well as comfort,
      compliance, tolerance and acceptability of the device via an auto-questionnaire.
