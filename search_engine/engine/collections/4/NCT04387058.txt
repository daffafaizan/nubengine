      glucose dysregulation after TIPS. A better knowledge of the metabolic disorders related to
      the TIPS could allow to prevent the deleterious effects of the TIPS on the disease (decrease
      of the insulin-sensitivity, fat gain ...), by simple interventions on diet or physical
      activity. We will assess the incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, and the influence of
      TIPS on nutritional status and sarcopenia. Patients will be follow-up 6 months after TIPS. We
      will explore the hormonal mechanisms that explain these changes.
