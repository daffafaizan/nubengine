      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
      malignant mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. It is mostly given in combination
      with other chemotherapeutic drugs, but it can also be given as single agent.

      Since carboplatin is highly eliminated by the kidneys, the dose needs to be adjusted for
      renal dysfunction. Furthermore, as there is clear correlation between the area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of carboplatin and haematological toxicity and response rate,
      carboplatin is dosed per target AUC. For this, the standard pharmacokinetic formula [dose =
      clearance carboplatin x target AUC] is used.

      the clearance is typically calculated using the cockcroft and gault (C-G) formula. In
      patients with high weight, or very low serum creatinine values the C-G-formula may
      overestimate the renal function, resulting in a potential overdose of carboplatin. the new
      developed dosing algorithm to be studied adjusts for high BMI and low serum creatinine
      values, in order to provide a more safe dose of carboplatin
