    
      Patients seen at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Wound Clinic with a diabetic foot
      wound will be identified, consented, and screened for the study. Upon signing consent,
      patients will be assigned a unique screening number. The screening number given to the first
      patient will be 01 and increasing sequentially with each subject screened. Screened subjects
      will be entered onto a screening log. Once a number is assigned it cannot be re-assigned to
      another subject.

      At Day 0, a vascular evaluation including ABI, Sensilase, Transcutaneous oxygen measurements,
      and hyperspectral imaging will be performed. Monofilament Sensory Test and Vibration
      Perception Threshold(VPT) test will also be performed at day 0.Patients will undergo standard
      of care wound debridement. Tissue samples will be taken routinely as standard of care. A
      wound assessment will be performed, including the debridement as standard of care, wound
      measurements, and digital photos. Gene expression and bacterial analysis will be performed on
      tissue samples. After tests are performed, patient will receive topical oxygen therapy using
      the Transcutaneous O2 device with moist wound dressings. Moist wound dressings are used as
      standard of care. Patient will receive instructions to continue treatment at home.

      Patient will return for an appointment at days 7, 14, and 21, where vascular assessment
      (Sensilase, Transcutaneous oxygen measurements, Hyperspectral imaging) ,wound assessment
      (wound measurements, digital photos and acetate tracings) and tissue sampling will be
      performed following standard of care debridement, Patient will cease topical oxygen treatment
      at day 21, and study will be concluded.
