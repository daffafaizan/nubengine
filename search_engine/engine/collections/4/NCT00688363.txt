      duration will be 5 years with patient recruitment over 4 years and an individual observation
      period of 1 year. 300 participants from 43 study centres, hospitals and private practices
      were recruited. The study will run for one year and aims to determine, whether there is an
      advantage with regard to HbA1c levels when (a) a regular three-monthly HbA1c or (b) a weekly
      4-point glucose profile is taken and reported.

      After screening, patients will be assigned at random to one of the following study arms:

        1. no regular blood-glucose self-monitoring, no regular HbA1c

        2. regular blood glucose self monitoring, no regular HbA1c

        3. no regular blood glucose self monitoring, regular HbA1c

        4. regular blood glucose self monitoring, regular HbA1c

      The control for all participants is that urinary glucose should be monitored at least once a
      day, preferably in the late morning, as the highest increase in plasma glucose level occurs
      after breakfast.
