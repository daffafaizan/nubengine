      often injures the patients themselves and requires the medical staff to restrain and calm
      them. The predisposing factors for emergence agitation include anesthesia, operation, and
      patient. Sevoflurane anesthesia results in higher incidence of emergence agitation than
      halothane, because of the rapid emergence, and its effects on central nervous system inducing
      convulsion and post-operative behavioral changes. The otorhinolaryngologic and ophthalmologic
      surgeries, post-operative pain, young age, pre-operative anxiety, no past surgical history,
      and adjustment disorder of patients are risk factors.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α (2)-adrenoreceptor agonist. Intravenous DEX used after
      induction of anesthesia reduced sevoflurane-associated EA and postoperative pain in pediatric
      ambulatory surgery.

      The investigators designed this study to prove the efficacy of oral dexmedetomidine a
      selective α (2)-adrenoreceptor agonist, on emergence agitation (EA), recovery profiles, and
      parents' satisfaction after sevoflurane anesthesia in tonsillectomy.
