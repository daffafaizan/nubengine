    
      Children with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) -syndrome
      diagnosis will be randomised either to tonsillotomy (partial tonsillectomy) or 3 months
      follow up.

      In both groups the symptoms are monitored with symptom diaries. At follow up visit 3 months
      after randomisation the children from either groups with ongoing symptoms will be sent to
      tonsillectomy (total remove of palatine tonsil).

      The design is sequential trial. From the previous trials we know that the effect of
      tonsillectomy is about 90% and that during follow up for six months as much as 50% of the
      patients will recover. Because the syndrome is rare and because the rescue operations of the
      tonsils (tonsillectomy in a person who has gone through tonsillotomy), the sample size has to
      be as low as possible. That is the reason why we chose sequential design, with assessments
      after every 8 patient.

      Randomization is made in blocks of four. In sequential design we use the following
      assumptions:

        -  We are looking for a 40% absolute difference in cure rate between tonsillotomy (90%) and
           follow up (50%) groups.

        -  Two sided Whitehead design

        -  Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

        -  Five assessments (sample size 4+4, 8+8. 12+12, 16+16 and 19+19)

        -  type 1 error 5 % and power 80%

        -  The sample size will be from 8 to 38 patients depending on when the trial can be stopped
           along assessments.
