      patients as detected by continuous pulse oximetry 2) Estimate the incidence of postoperative
      respiratory depression in high risk patients as detected by continuous respiratory volume
      monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron) 3) Assess the agreement between the continuous pulse oximetry and
      continuous respiratory volume monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron) in detection of postoperative
      respiratory depression in high risk patients
