    
      SOCLE II is the pilot phase (Phase II) of a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) of a complex oral health care (OHC) intervention versus usual OHC.

      SOCLE II aims to evaluate the feasibility of a full scale pragmatic trial of the clinical and
      cost effectiveness of a complex OHC package of care versus usual care for people in stroke
      care settings. Ward level cluster randomisation will progress in a stepped wedge manner where
      after a period of baseline data collection each ward in a randomly allocated order will
      'convert' from usual care to an enhanced oral health care intervention.

      This pilot trial will assess the feasibility of delivering this enhanced OHC intervention
      across four sites and will inform the trial design of a full scale phase III trial including
      refining the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence,
      record linkage, sampling methodologies, sample size calculations and pilot our health
      economic evaluation. Investigators also aim to establish the relationship between SAP and
      plaque and any diversity between sites. Our proposed pilot work will support an application
      for a planned Phase III definitive trial.

      Principal Research Questions:

      (i) Are the SOCLE intervention and data collection process viable across multiple sites? (ii)
      Can sample size calculations and estimates of recruitment and retention be refined? (iii) Can
      pneumonia event rates across several sites and distribution over time post stroke onset be
      determined? (iv) Can the association between dental and denture plaque and SAP be
      established? (v) Can the predetermined criteria for progression to Phase III definitive
      multi-centred stepped wedge cluster RCT with economic evaluation be met?
