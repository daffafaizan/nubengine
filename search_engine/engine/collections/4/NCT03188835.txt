    
      Each subject will follow 3 metabolic studies (A, B and C), each lasting 7.5h which includes a
      3h acute cold exposure.

      These studies will be almost identical: same perfusion of tracers, same number of Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) acquisitions and same number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      associated with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) acquisitions .

      The difference will be in the diet ingested by the subjects two weeks before each metabolic
      study: during protocol A, the subjects will follow an isocaloric diet; during protocol B, the
      subjects will follow the same isocaloric diet supplemented with a daily beverage containing
      +25% of energy intake from fructose; and during protocol C, the subjects will follow the same
      isocaloric diet supplemented with a daily beverage containing +25% of energy intake from
      glucose.

      Stool samples will be collected for each metabolic study for microbiome flora and
      metabolites.
