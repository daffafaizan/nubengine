      the 2025 Genomic Medicine France Plan. This program, called MULTIPLI encompasses two
      innovative personalized medicine clinical trials in soft-tissue sarcoma and colorectal
      carcinoma involving targeted molecules according to the tumor profile of each patient.

      This 1st clinical research program aims implementing exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to
      determine the genomic profile and to provide a therapeutic decision for each patient. Genomic
      analyzes will be performed on different technical platforms: samples will be collected in
      each investigating center, nucleic acids extraction will be performed on two genetic
      platforms, Inca labeled and identified for the purpose of this study: Institut Bergonié and
      Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou. CNRGH (Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine)
      was retained for operational platform genomics and Institut Bergonie for bioinformatics data
      processing. Each genomic profile will be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board
      which aims at providing a therapeutic decision for each patient and to propose a targeted
      treatment in case of actionable molecular alteration.

      The purpose of this program is to perform analysis on a set of gene, in order to provide
      results no more than after 6 weeks after the sample arrival on the biopathological platform.
      This gene panel analysis is based on the predefined list of genes that are direct targets of
      the drugs available in the MULTIPLI program.

      Before implanting this program in a large-scale launch, it was essential to set up a pilot
      study in order to evaluate both sample's management between several platforms, and the time
      to report the results, and to verify that it was in line with the objectives set.
