    
      In this randomized, open label, two-arm, single center phase IV trial, the investigators will
      assess and compare the efficacy and safety of continuation of ADV plus LAM versus switching
      to ADV plus ETV up to 52-weeks in Korean adults with chronic hepatitis B who have resistant
      mutants to LAM and show suboptimal response to combination of ADV plus LAM.

      All study subjects who complete the initial treatments of 52-weeks will be thereafter treated
      with the combination of ADV plus ETV for 52 more weeks.
