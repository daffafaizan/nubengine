      macrophages. The problems addressed in the project are socially significant because of the
      high incidence of life-threatening diseases and their effects in the population. The method
      of evaluation of monocyte-macrophages activity in human blood will be based on the analysis
      of expression of cytokines and chemokines - markers of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      activity of macrophages. The most informative panel of cytokines and chemokines obtained
      during the project can be further used to create effective diagnostic tests.
