      including Taiwan. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), previously considered merely as one of the
      risk factors, has been recently unanimously accepted to be coronary artery
      disease-equivalent. How T2DM may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis remains obscure.

      Hyperglycemia with or without hyperinsulinemia may lead to higher oxidative stress and
      generalized inflammation. The oxidative stress and inflammation may play a significant role
      in the pathogenesis in diabetic complications, including micro- and macro-vascular
      complications. Macrophages together with T-lymphocytes are the earliest cell-types found in
      fatty-streaks, the earliest atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophages are also well known cellular
      mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize
      that macrophages play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in patients with
      T2DM. In addition, the other cell types of the peripheral white blood cells (WBC), such as
      neutrophils, have been shown to be intimately related to acute coronary syndrome. Therefore,
      the study on the biology of peripheral WBCs may tell us something about the pathophysiology
      of diabetic macro-vascular complications.

      Methods:

        1. Normal control: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) less than 126 mg/dl.

        2. T2DM: FPG >＝126 mg/dl.

             -  Group 1 (good glycemic control): hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <＝ 7% in the past 6 months

             -  Group 2 (poor glycemic control): HbA1c >＝ 8% in the past 6 months

        3. Blood sample will be collected at baseline and after aggressive control.
