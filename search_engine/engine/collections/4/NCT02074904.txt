      on brain and behavior responses in heavy drinkers. Eligible volunteers who meet study
      criteria will be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo with weekly visits and
      medication management sessions. Participants will complete two magnetic resonance imaging
      sessions. The first scan session will occur prior to starting study drug, and the second scan
      will occur following six weeks of study drug. This project will yield novel findings on brain
      and behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the effects of topiramate on alcohol cue
      reactivity, and the mechanisms underlying topiramate's ability to blunt alcohol cue
      reactivity and heavy drinking.
