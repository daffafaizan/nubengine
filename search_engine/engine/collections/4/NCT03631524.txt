      60 subjects, who match the inclusion exclusion criteria, will be recruited from patients
      transferred to the SGH Isolation wards.

      They will be randomly assigned to control or treatment arm based on a block randomisation
      strategy predetermined and held by an independent party.

      The treatment arm will be given up to 1 hour of physiotherapist-prescribed resistive training
      exercises administered via a telerehabilitation device per day in addition to standard
      therapy for a total of 10 sessions over a 2 week period. They will be evaluated for motor
      strength, activity of daily living performance, mood and perceived level of health.

      The control arm will be subject to the same assessments as the treatment arm at the start and
      end of the two week period. They will receive standard care in the ward including
      physiotherapy as prescribed by the managing team.

      The assessors will be blinded to the arm of the study the subjects will be assigned to and
      will be independent of the terating physiotherapist.

      1.1. Hypothesis We propose that for patients with deconditioning after a prolonged period of
      hospitalization and needing inpatient isolation precautions, that a 2-week course of daily,
      up to 1-hour long, physiotherapist-developed resistive training exercises will result in a
      20% improvement in the motor power and a corresponding improvement in motor functioning and
      the perceived quality of life compared to a control group receiving standard therapy.
