      criteria and patients are genotyped for the SNPs N363S, BclI, ER22/23EK and 9Î² and grouped
      according to haplotypes. SNPs will be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients
      will be included for a Synacthen test, to evaluate their adrenal function. Information from
      the results of the study will be able to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk and
      thus individualize GC therapy in a tailored fashion. Results of the study will be important
      for all patient groups worldwide on GC therapy.
