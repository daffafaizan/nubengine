      with a 24-h emergency service, with surgery and radiology readily available. The data will be
      compiled on patients older than 18 years who will be admitted to the emergency unit with
      suspected appendicitis.

      During the study period, the clinical workflow is standardized. In all cases a resident of
      surgery and/or consultant surgeon clinically evaluate and perform an ultrasound scan on all
      patients with suspected appendicitis. With the use of clinical and laboratory results the
      physician (surgeon) will calculate the Alvarado Score and depending on the result the next
      diagnostic steps or the treatment will be chosen. Additionally, the department of gynecology
      of the university hospital routinely evaluate all women of childbearing age. Upon other terms
      following variables will be collected: age, gender, white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive
      protein (CRP), Alvarado Score, visuell pain scale, CT scan results, pathologic findings, time
      between admission and operation, operation procedure, treatment and diagnosis of patients
      without operation, length of hospital stay, and 30-day complication rate. Furthermore, there
      will be a follow-up of all patients (with and without operation) after 30 days and 6 months.

      The investigators assume that the use of a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm reduces
      unnecessary negative appendectomies and optimizes the duration of the hospital stay and the
      costs.
