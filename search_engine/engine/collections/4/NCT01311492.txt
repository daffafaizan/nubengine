    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in 1 in 7 individuals over 65, and 1 in 2 individuals over
      85. While the progression of AD is extremely variable, it is generally established that AD
      subjects will move from having compromised function in socail and work settings, to requiring
      institutionalization and/or intensive management within 10 years of initial clinical
      diagnosis. A randomized controlled piot trial is needed to provide information regarding
      exercies effects on individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

      Exercise Trial for Alzheimer's Disease (EXTRA) is a pilot randomized controlled trial
      designed to compare a moderate-intesity physical activity program to a healthy lifestyle
      health education program in 30 older adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. These
      individuals will be followed for 1 year.

      This trial will provide pilot evidence regarding whether physical activity is effective and
      practical for individuals with AD. The effects of an exercise intervention on halting,
      slowing, or reversing the cognitive effects of AD will be assessed with pilot data and
      potentially provide support for a larger trial in the future.
