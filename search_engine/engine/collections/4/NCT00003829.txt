      with previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia after treatment with
      alternating courses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. II. Monitor and assess toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Utilize molecular genetic studies and flow cytometry on
      peripheral blood cells from patients achieving complete remission by conventional criteria.
      IV. Apply FISH techniques using probes to chromosomes 12 and 13 as prognostic factors for
      time to progression and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alternating courses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
      Fludarabine is administered IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-5 of courses 1, 3, and 5.
      Cyclophosphamide is administered IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks. Patients achieving clinical complete remission (CCR) after 6
      courses of chemotherapy receive 2 additional courses (one course of each drug). Patients
      achieving partial remission after 6 courses of chemotherapy also receive 2 additional
      courses. If these patients then achieve CCR, they receive another 2 courses. Patients are
      followed every 3 months.
