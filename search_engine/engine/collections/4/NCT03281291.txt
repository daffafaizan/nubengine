      RTS,S/AS01E immunization will assess vaccine efficacy using molecular genetic data to
      identify first infections following vaccination, and to distinguish new from existing
      infections, using an amplicon sequencing-based strategy: deep sequencing of small, highly
      variable regions of the parasite genome to allow for both:

        1. Highly sensitive detection of parasitemia (analogous to conventional polymerase chain
           reaction [PCR]-based detection), and

        2. Identification of genetically distinct parasite populations within or between affected
           individuals.
