      safe gait, mobility, function, and life role participation (quality of life). It has been
      tested in chronic stroke survivors and found efficacious.

      The QualPro protocol will include three phases, all of which contain components previously
      mentioned. The QualPro protocol includes implementation of gait coordination training to
      address weakness, impaired endurance, and dyscoordination. The protocol will include
      implementation of balance training for falls prevention composed of Yang style, 24-posture,
      short-form Tai Chi. Additionally, the QualPro protocol will include implementation of aerobic
      training for fitness, health, and endurance of stroke survivors, which will be composed of
      low-volume, high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a cycle ergometer. Strength exercises
      will also be included. All exercises will address weakness, impaired endurance, and
      dyscoordination.

      The long-range financial goal of this research study is to realize the cost savings of
      implementing the proposed combination of interventions that will preclude much of the very
      costly and downwardly spiraling sequellae currently observed after stroke, and that currently
      costs managed care and insurance companies an exorbitant and unnecessary amount of precious
      resources.
