      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      very successful in real-world situations. The limitations of this approach include the
      duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session over 4-6 weeks).
      Recently, researchers have aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce
      treatment times with some preliminary success. In a recent study, the investigators applied
      this accelerated paradigm in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which
      showed a significant antidepressant effect (90% remission rate). Additionally, 5 participants
      from this study carried a bipolar TRD diagnosis and responded at minimum, equally as well,
      with no adverse events experienced or manic/hypomanic conversion observed during the
      treatment series. This study intends to further modify the parameters to create a more rapid
      form of this treatment for bipolar TRD, and look at the change in clinical measures and
      neuroimaging biomarkers.
