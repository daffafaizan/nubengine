      enrolled after signing the study-specific informed consent form. Subjects meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be scheduled for 3 treatment visits, which must occur at
      least 2 days, but no more than 7 days apart. At each treatment visit, baseline measurements
      will be taken, then either the investigational drug or placebo will be administered to both
      eyes. Afterwards, efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at specific time
      intervals. Study drug administration for each subject will be equally randomized using 1 of 2
      sequences - ABB and BAA, where A is the investigational drug and B is the placebo.
