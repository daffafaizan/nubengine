    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover trial. Participants
      will be randomized to receive a Control capsule (fexofenadine single agent) under Treatment
      Arm 1 or a Test 1 capsule (fexofenadine and 3 mg SLS) under Treatment Arm 2 or Test 2 capsule
      (fexofenadine and 30 mg SLS) under Treatment Arm 3. Investigators will assess the effect of
      SLS on the absorption of fexofenadine by measuring SLS and fexofenadine concentrations in
      plasma and stool samples and determine the change in AUC (area under the curve), Cmax and
      other pharmacokinetic parameters, between Treatment Arms 2 or 3 and Treatment Arm 1.
