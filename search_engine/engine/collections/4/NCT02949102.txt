      reward region response to a taste of a high-sugar/high-fat beverage and anticipated receipt
      of this beverage than a placebo dose.

      Test the hypothesis that a dose of Crave Crush will result in reduced ad lib candy intake
      while the participants complete a survey after the fMRI scan. Participants will receive a
      second dose of Crave Crush or placebo. They will then be placed in a room to complete a few
      surveys. A bowl of candy will be placed on the table. Participants will be told that the
      candy is left over from their assessment and that they are free to have as much as they like,
      because the candy must be discarded after each participant.
