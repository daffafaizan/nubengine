      I. Assess the feasibility of detection and quantification of differences in the temporal and
      spatial distribution of FDG uptake between lesions of HL and DLBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      scans 60 and 180 minutes after FDG administration.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for 24 hours.
