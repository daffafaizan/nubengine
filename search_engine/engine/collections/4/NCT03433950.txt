      in systolic blood pressure exceeding 50% of baseline during motor off periods to select for
      subjects with severe blood pressure fluctuations. The clinical characteristics, including but
      not limited to, the degree of change of the motor tapping score, during an "off" period of
      this group of subjects with severe hypertension. There is a screening visit, a at home
      monitoring period, and a one-time 4-8 hour study visit for subjects that satisfy the
      inclusion criteria. The screening visit will assess Parkinson's motor state and review the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. The at home monitoring period will measure blood pressure twice
      a levodopa cycle for 5 cycles (for most subjects, this will be for two days and is dependent
      on the subject's clinical levodopa cycle). Measurements will occur pre-levodopa dose (the
      maximal "OFF" time), and half-way through the cycle (maximal "ON" time). The percentage of
      change will be calculated and those that have a systolic change of greater than or equal to
      50% will proceed to the outpatient visit. The outpatient visit will measure blood pressure,
      pulse, Parkinson's motor symptoms, and plasma levodopa levels.
