    
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to determine which treatment,
      methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil, is more effective as first-line corticosteroid-sparing
      treatment for patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis requiring
      corticosteroid-sparing therapy. The primary outcome is treatment success assessed at the 6
      month visit (Phase 1, 0-6 months). If patients are a treatment success, they continue on the
      medication for another 6 months (Phase 1, 6-12 months). Patients who are a treatment failure
      can crossover to the other medication (Phase 2, 0-6 months).
