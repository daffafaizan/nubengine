    
      Dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter helping to mediate reward and reinforcement, has been
      putatively linked to the development of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and alcoholism.
      Identification of specific vulnerability-association alleles for receptors, other molecules
      within the reward mediating system, and other genes that may predispose individuals to the
      development of such disorders is the goal of the study.

      This investigation will help elucidate the genetic underpinnings of substance abuse,
      potentially leading to the improved methods to diagnose those at risk and to help develop
      better therapeutic interventions.
