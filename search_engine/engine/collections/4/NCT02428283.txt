      Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium and rocuronium, and maintained with
      sevoflurane. Patients were randomly assigned two groups: the control group received IV
      remifentanil 1 Î¼g/kg, and the block group received scalp nerve block with 0.25% ropivacaine
      2-3 ml. Time to tracheal extubation, recovery time, hemodynamic change, FLACC score, and
      Watcha behavior scale for emergence agitation were assessed.
