      between double layer silicone and double layer vacuum formed trays. The sample included 368
      attachments bonded in 16 patients. Each patient received one silicone and one vacuum formed
      tray which were randomly allocated to provide 8 trays of each type for the upper and lower
      arches. 3D scan data and local best-fit alignments were used to calculate the translational
      and rotational movements of the orthodontic attachments. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests
      were used to compare transfer accuracy and success between the groups.
