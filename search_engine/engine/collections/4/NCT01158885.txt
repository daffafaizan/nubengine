      (>0.01% abnormal blasts) after aggressive re-induction therapy indicate a relatively poor
      outcome in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, including those who proceed
      to allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). A similarly poor prognosis was seen in
      pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia patients with sub-morphologic disease prior to alloSCT.
      Studies to identify therapies that can eliminate persistent leukemia, have low toxicity
      profiles and can serve as a bridge to transplant are needed.

      This study will test the ability of clofarabine + cytarabine to eliminate minimal residual
      disease (MRD) in acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients whose
      bone marrows exhibit complete remission by morphology. The toxicity profile of this regimen
      will be evaluated in addition to toxicity experienced by patients who proceed to stem cell
      transplant. Overall length of remission will also be collected.
