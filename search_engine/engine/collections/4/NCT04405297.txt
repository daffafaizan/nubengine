    
      Subjects who have signed informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act (HIPPA) authorization, and are determined to meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in this study and receive the ADRC treatment.

      The subject will have an injection procedure (ADRC treatment) For this study, a licensed
      physician trained in liposuction must perform the syringe liposuction procedure. The licensed
      physician who performs the lipoplasty may be the Investigator or a non-Investigator physician
      (e.g., a plastic surgeon) who is trained on the study protocol.

      All subjects will undergo a minor syringe liposuction procedure to acquire approximately 100
      mL of lipoaspirate for preparation of ADRC using the TransposeÂ® RT System. The removed tissue
      is processed to extract a cell suspension (the cell product). Once the cell product has been
      obtained, tested, and found to conform to release criteria, the subject will be treated with
      the ADRCs.
