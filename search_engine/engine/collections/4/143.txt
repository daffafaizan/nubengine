enzymic synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid xviii. the repair ofpartially single-stranded dna templates by dna polymerase .a partially single-stranded dna, prepared by limited digestion of eachstrand with exonuclease iii, can be restored to its native, fullydouble-stranded structure by escherichia coli dna polymerase . the rateof synthesis observed in the repair of such a partially degraded primerin the polymerase system is faster than that seen with a native dna .the newly synthesized dna is covalently attached to the primer . thefully repaired dna resembles the original native dna as judged by itsappearance in electron micrographs, cscl density-gradient analysis,denaturability and genetic activity . dna synthesis which follows therepair phase produces a structure that is not covalently linked to theprimer and resembles, in its nondenaturability, branched appearance, andlack of genetic activity, the product obtained with a native dna primer(schildkraut, richardson + kornberg, 1964) .
