      BCCA-U98-0411; BCCA-C02-0298 will be immunohistochemically stained for activated Akt using
      phospho-specific antibodies. These samples are part of a phase I chemoprevention trial of
      myo-inositol being conducted in Vancouver, BC by the British Columbia Cancer Agency in
      collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The transbronchial specimens will be
      sent to the NCI for analysis of activated AKT. The study aims to determine whether
      myo-inositol, a putative inhibitor of the upstream kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, can
      alter activated Akt levels in smokers with bronchial dysplasia.
