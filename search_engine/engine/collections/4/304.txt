3917. plasma free fatty acid and blood sugar levels in newborninfants and their motherssimultaneous plasma free fatty acid (ffa)and blood sugar levels were determinedfor fasting newborn infants during the first24 hours of life, for their cord bloods,and for their mothers at delivery.  thefollowing observations were made.  in con-trol infants the mean ffa level rose aboutthree times the cord level after birthand was accompanied by a 25% drop in themean blood sugar level.  thereafter, themean blood sugar level remained relativelyconstant, but the mean ffa level variedfrom 2.5 to 3 times the cord level.  therewas no significant correlation between thelength of maternal fasting prior to deliveryand the infant ffa level; there was,however, a significant negative correlationbetween the length of maternal fastingprior to delivery and the infant blood sugarlevel at 24 hours of age.  high ffa levelsoccurred in the infants of obese mothersand low levels were observed in infants withdelayed respirations, in infants of preeclampticmothers, and in infants of diabeticmothers.
