      intention decisions in MM patients.

      Eligible patients will have their tumor sample analyzed for the prognostic MMprofiler SKY92,
      several cytogenetic markers, gene expression markers, and gene expression clusters.

      A total of 250 patients will be enrolled from up to 9 US centers. Patients will be followed 5
      years after diagnosis.
