      grow the T cells. These T cells are then stimulated with EBV infected cells (which have been
      treated with radiation so that they cannot grow). This stimulation trains the T cells to kill
      EBV infected cells. We then test the T cells to make sure that they kill the EBV infected
      cells.

      Therapy can take place in one of the specifically designated outpatient clinics so hospital
      admission is not required. First, patients will be given doses of Tylenol (for any
      aches/pains) and Benadryl (for any minor allergic reactions such as itching/rash). Next, the
      T cells will be injected into a vein over a 10 minute period. Patients will be closely
      watched for any side effects.

      If a patient shows some response to the treatment they may receive up to three additional T
      cell injections at three month intervals. Patients will need to be seen every other week in
      the clinic for six weeks after the injection. Following that, patients will either be seen in
      the clinic or contacted by one of the research staff working on this study, once a month for
      one year.

      To learn more about the way the T cells are working and how long they last in the body, an
      extra 40 mls(8 teaspoonfuls) of blood will be taken at these visits. Additionally, 3 mls (1/2
      teaspoonful) of blood will be taken prior to the infusion and monthly thereafter to conduct a
      CBC (a test to look at the components of the blood).
