      cancers of the chest. These scars create significant long-term morbidity to the patient.
      There is a clinical need for an alternative treatment that would reduce factors associated
      with hypertrophic and possibly keloid scar formation by providing minimal tension, low
      infection risk and an absence of foreign body material. This would result in a normal
      appearing and healed scar without associated patient morbidity. Photochemical tissue bonding
      may provide this alternate treatment. PTB differs from sutures by continuously joining the
      tissue surfaces on a molecular level rather than only at discrete suture points. In addition,
      PTB does not incite foreign body reactions nor create tissue injury during passage of the
      needle and tying a knot, injuries that may initiate scarring.
