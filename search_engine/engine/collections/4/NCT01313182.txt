      effective in short term Staphylococcus aureus(SA)suppression. Our overall study objective is
      to measure the rate of deep and superficial Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) after primary
      hip, knee, shoulder and elbow arthroplasty surgery and primary spinal fusion surgery
      requiring implantation of prosthetic material, when the patient receives either nasal
      mupirocin or nasal povidone-iodine prior to surgery.
