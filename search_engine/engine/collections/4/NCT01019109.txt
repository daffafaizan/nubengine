    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes
      following the reduction of idiopathic scoliosis.

      The following will be evaluated

        1. The 3D correction of scoliosis:

             -  Reduction of scoliosis in the coronal plane (Cobb angles)

             -  Correction in the sagittal plane (kyphotic and lordotic angles)

             -  Correction of the axial vertebral rotation in the transverse plane

        2. The functional and aesthetic outcomes
