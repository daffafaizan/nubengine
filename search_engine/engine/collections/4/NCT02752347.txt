    
      Compare the impact of using rapid maxillary expanders on masticatory muscle activities
      (Masseter and Anterior Temporalis muscles) between the cross-bite side and non-cross-bite
      sides of the same preadolescent orthodontic patient before the expansion and after one month
      of the completion treatment period.

      Two channels surface Electromyography sEMG (BioRadio), will be position to record the
      activity of anterior temporal (AT) and masseter (MM) muscles in three different statuses:

        -  Rest → patients will instruct to not bite on his/her teeth.

        -  Clench → patients will instruct to made a maximum voluntary clench on cotton rolls
           positioned around the first molar, for 5 sec "the cotton clench", and a maximum
           voluntary clench without the interposed rolls for 5 sec "the "clench".

           * This procedure followed the Sforza et al. protocol.

        -  During function "mastication" → The patients will instruct to chew on a chewing gum for
           20 sec (20 continuous masticatory cycles).

      Examination frequency:

      The patients will be examined two times as follow:

      Test 1: Immediately before rapid maxillary expanders cementation, Test 2: 5 months later (1
      month after the retention phase).

      the same procedure will be done on 35 patients (control group)
