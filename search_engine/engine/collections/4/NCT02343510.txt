      past 10 years , for cases diagnosed with primary Fallopian tube cancers , cases of high and
      low grade serous ovarian cancer and cases underwent hysterectomy and salpingectomy for non
      oncological reasons. Paraffin blocks for suitable selected patients will be examined
      histologically to confirm the primary diagnosis . Chlamydia DNA in these paraffin blocks of
      the Fallopian tubes and ovarian tissues will be examined using PCR techniques . The possible
      correlation between the presence of Chlamydia DNA and the ovarian serous tumours and primary
      tubal cancer will be analyzed statistically .
