    
      Randomized, controlled, open superiority trial, in 2 parallel groups (ratio 1:1).

      Eligible consecutive patient will be offered to take part in the trial during a visit to
      thier GP for COVID symptoms. After verification of eligibility criteria and written informed
      consent, a nasopharyngeal swab, an ECG and a blood sampled (kalaemia, magnesemia and
      calcemia) will be performed.

      Patient with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive result and still fulfilling eligibility criteria will be
      randomized on day2 (D2) through a web-based allocation system, following a computer generated
      allocation list, stratified on center and existence of any comorbidity, to experimental or
      control group. Patients without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR will not continue
      the trial. Both groups patients will have a paper-based diary to record their daily symptoms
      and drug intake. A clinical follow-up will be done by the GP at D5, D8, D14 and D28.The main
      analysis population will be in intention to treat. An intermediate efficacy analysis is
      planned when 50% of patients have reached D14.

      Two hundred consecutive patients (from pre-identified centers) will be included in an
      ancillary virological study to assess evolution of viral load at D8 and D14. For these
      patients all nasopharyngeal swab will be sent to a centralised lab at Pitié-Salpêtrière
      Hospital.
