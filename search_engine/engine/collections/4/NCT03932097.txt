      enhance parents' ability to reduce prevalence of alcohol use and consequences, and other
      substance use through the development and evaluation of Parenting Now (PN). PN is a brief,
      interactive, self-paced, and digital curriculum for parents of high-school-aged adolescents,
      a frequently neglected population created from the evidence-based Parent Handbook,available
      in hard copy and DVD for college-bound youth only. The curriculum is needed because most
      parent-based prevention interventions target children or young adolescents, neglecting older
      adolescents, despite that fact that alcohol use increases in frequency and risk through
      midadolescence. Also, unlike other evidence-based parenting curricula, PN is brief, requires
      only the parents, does not require training, and can be used "on the go" through any digital
      device. This provides a market niche for the proposed project that addresses this curriculum
      gap through the innovative use of both technology and prevention science. This format will
      allow us to personalize or target parents based on their communication style and allows
      parents to customize their experience by choosing or clicking through the optional content.
      Personalization and customization are two essential engagement strategies for digital
      prevention interventions.
