      mechanisms including neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and remyelination and repair
      mechanisms.

      The study will identify markers of disease severity in a longitudinal cohort of patients with
      multiple sclerosis who are siblings (both siblings having multiple sclerosis) including:
      biological markers (genetic, immunological and epigenetic markers, advanced MRI markers). An
      integrative model to predict disease progression will be proposed based on multimodal
      markers.
