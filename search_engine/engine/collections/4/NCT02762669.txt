      greater exposure to oxytocin in both duration and dose through exogenous administration,
      presumably mediated by OTR desensitization. In current practice, upon diagnosis of failure to
      progress during labor augmentation, oxytocin administration is discontinued, and as long as
      there is no indication for immediate delivery, there is a variable duration to proceed to CD.
      Due to the high likelihood of OTR desensitization in this patient population, it would be
      clinically relevant to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this action.

      A recent study from the investigators' group, looking at the rest time required for recovery
      and resensitization of the OTR following desensitization, showed that there were no
      improvements in oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility after either a 30, 60 or 90 minute
      rest period. The reason for why resensitization does not occur remains unknown, but a
      possible explanation is that the OTRs undergo structural and functional changes during
      desensitization that prohibit their recovery.

      The investigators propose to use our previously established in-vitro model of labour
      augmentation and OTR desensitization (using pregnant human myometrium and an isometric
      tension recording device) to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing OTR
      desensitization and resensitization after stopping administration of oxytocin. Investigation
      of the signaling pathways responsible for these processes, as well as for oxytocin-induced
      contractions in a controlled in-vitro system will aid in the understanding of the kinetics of
      the OTR-oxytocin system and provide insight into potential pharmacotherapeutic targets to
      reduce the incidence of PPH.
