      with respect to PSPs by means of Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI),
      Disease Activity Score (DAS28) results, and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      response criteria, as well as to evaluate the contribution of PSP to disease control,
      treatment continuation over time, participant's satisfaction, and PSP utilization.

      The primary endpoint is the percentage of participants achieving a minimal clinically
      important difference (MCID) in HAQ-DI at Week 78. (MCID is improvement of at least 0.22 in
      HAQ-DI compared to Baseline). Secondary endpoints include the percentage of participants
      achieving MCID in HAQ-DI at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 64 and other effectiveness parameters,
      including: changes in DAS28, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI), ACR 20/50/70 and EULAR moderate and good responses. Other secondary
      endpoints include health outcomes assessments including HAQ-DI, Work Productivity and
      Activity Impairment (WPAI), Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology (CQR), and Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) scores, expectation regarding PSP and health
      management via Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), change in participant perceptions as
      measured by the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), and satisfaction with PSP as
      measured by PSP satisfaction assessment.
