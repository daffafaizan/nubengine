      non-modifiable risk factors. the non-modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms
      like the gene coding for alpha-1-antitrypsinase

      COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by deterioration of lung function due to
      loss of elasticity of the lungs.

      SERPINA1 gene product has a protective role on the connective tissue components of both lungs
      and gums.

      Hence, this study tries to determine if the gene polymorphism in COPD serves as a risk factor
      for developing periodontitis.
