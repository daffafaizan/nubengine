      from all subtypes of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), new pharmacological treatments are in dire
      need. Characterizing molecular changes in EB, including gene expression, can identify new
      therapeutic targets and drugs that modulate those targets. However, sifting through gene
      expression information to identify the most promising drug targets is a complex data
      challenge. The goal of the study will identify a computational approach to evaluate and
      identify existing drugs approved for other diseases that can be repurposed for EB patients.
      The study will perform an unprecedented characterization of gene expression changes in EB
      patients compared to healthy, non-EB individuals across multiple tissues. Using a validated
      computational drug discovery platform, researchers will analyze gene expression and drug data
      using unique algorithms. In the first year, a list of ten, safety drugs more probable to
      treat the EB disease state will be identified. The most promising drugs discovered will then
      be tested in the clinic setting.
