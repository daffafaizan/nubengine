      bone mineral density, develop fractures with minimal or no trauma, and frequently have a
      negative family history. The disease results from either diminished bone formation or
      increased bone removal (resorption). No specific drug therapy has been recommended for
      juvenile osteoporosis. Alendronate (Fosamax) is effective in inhibiting bone resorption,
      increasing BMD and reducing fractures in adults with postmenopausal osteoporosis, but have
      not become established therapies in children. In the present study, we plan to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Alendronate in 20 patients with juvenile osteoporosis in a two-year
      period. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. In the year-1, 10
      patients will be assigned to receive Alendronate and 10 patients placebo. In the year-2,
      patients will be crossed over to the second arm of the study. Those who received Alendronate
      in the year-1, will receive placebo in the second year and vice verse. The patients will have
      5 visits, the initial screening visit followed by 4 post therapy visits in a six-month
      interval. Measurements include DXA bone density scan of spine and hip, urinalysis and blood
      work.
