      deformities. Both of these malformations predominantly affect males. They often coincide with
      the vulnerable life phase of puberty, a period characterized by great physical, social, and
      emotional changes. Outer appearance becomes a major issue for adolescents, and those who
      display a visible disfigurement may be put at a disadvantage, having to come to terms with a
      difference in their looks and having to face the risk of harassment by their peers. Patients
      with pectus deformities often experience feelings of shame and try to hide their chests. This
      can be reflected in the choice of clothing or poor body posture. Many patients even avoid
      social activities and sports. They are aware of the fact that their deformity is generally
      not considered attractive, and some regard it as an obstacle in future relationships. Reduced
      self-confidence and selfesteem appear to be rather common characteristics of PE patients.
      Recently, several authors have assessed the improvement of quality of life and body image
      following surgical repair of PE. Yet, little is known about the degree to which patients,
      differ from healthy individuals within the same age group. Steinmann et al observed reduced
      disease-specific and general health related quality in patients with a chest malformation.
      Body image was highly impaired in both PE and PC patients. However, the number of patients
      (71 PE, 19, PC, 82 healthy individuals) was not matched and was not evaluated physical
      function. Also, they evaluated patients with a high degree of preoperative deformity in this
      study. Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluated the physical and psychosocial
      characteristics of patients with pectus excavatum and carinatum compared with healthy
      controls.
