      filling and provide sustained energy, we hypothesized that gastric emptying rates of sorghum
      and millet foods are slow, particularly compared to non-traditional starchy foods (white
      rice, potato, wheat pasta) that are now commonly consumed in urban areas of the West African
      Sahel. A broader purpose for the study was to understand whether sorghum and millet foods
      have positive health attributes that can be promoted in urban areas to provide better markets
      for local farmers.

      Two human trials of similar design were conducted approximately one year apart. The carbon 13
      (13C)-labelled octanoic acid breath test method was used to measure gastric emptying rate,
      and subjective pre-test and satiety response questionnaires were used. In the first study, 14
      healthy volunteers in Bamako, Mali participated in a crossover design to test eight starchy
      foods for gastric emptying rate and satiety feelings. The second study with six volunteers
      was done to correct for endogenous 13C differences in the starch component of the foods.
