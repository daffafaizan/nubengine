      Follow-up will be performed via telephone at a specific interval during the study to
      determine the outcome of unresolved AEs, any new drug-related AEs or any pregnancies. During
      the run-in period and the treatment phase, patients are prohibited from taking prescription
      or over the counter (OTC) laxative medication or constipating medications. Prescription and
      OTC medications not related to constipation are permitted and must be fully documented, but
      any changes (e.g., dosage, regimen) are to be limited as much as possible.
