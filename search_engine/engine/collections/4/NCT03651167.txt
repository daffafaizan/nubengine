      minority populations. In addition, we hope to assess whether various demographic factors as
      well as disparity between ideal and actual skin tone effect skin protective behaviors (i.e.
      sun screen use, dermatologist appointments, skin self-exams) or skin destructive behaviors
      (i.e. outdoor tanning, tanning salon use, use of skin lightening products) in minority
      populations.
