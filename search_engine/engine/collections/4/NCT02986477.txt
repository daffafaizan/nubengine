      diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux via intra-vesicle administration of contrast agent. The
      utility of ultrasound contrast agent in contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography is well
      established and published over two decades (Darge 2002, Darge 2008, Darge 2010). As with
      other applications of ultrasound contrast agents, the method offers the advantages of no
      radiation, low cost, excellent anatomic detail, and higher sensitivity for reflux detection
      than VCUG. The most comprehensive study to detail the safety profile of intravesicle
      ultrasound contrast is by Papadopoulou et al. (Papadopoulou, Ntoulia et al. 2014) which
      described a total of 1,010 children (563 girls, 447 boys) with a mean age of 2.9 years. No
      adverse events were reported at 1 hour after exam. Follow-up phone interviews revealed no
      adverse events in the majority (973 of 1,010). The remaining 37 children experienced mild
      symptoms including dysuria (n=26) and urinary retention (n=2) which may have been related to
      catheterization rather than the contrast agent. A recent European survey at 29 centers
      evaluating the use of ultrasound contrast agent in 4,131 children for pediatric reflux
      diagnosis reported no adverse events (Riccabona 2012).

      The procedure consists of pre-contrast, post-contrast, voiding phase, and post-void depiction
      of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and transperineal scan of the urethra, for identification
      of potential ectopic ureters (Darge 2008, Duran, del Riego et al. 2012) that can easily be
      missed on non-distended ureters on CT, MRI, or radionuclide imaging. The two primary methods
      of contrast injection includes direct injection into a partially filled bladder (Darge 2008)
      and another using a saline bag for subsequent drip infusion via the catheter into the bladder
      (Back, Edgar et al. 2015).
