      compared with a nano ceramic composite resin in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) of
      patients with bruxism.

      For this purpose, twenty-five patients having NCCLs and bruxism enrolled to the present
      study. Before treatment, the dimensions of the NCCLs were measured in depth, gingival-incisal
      height and mesio-distal width using a CPI probe. Degree of tooth wear (TWI) and gingival
      conditions (GI) are also recorded. A total of 148 NCCLs were randomly restored with a a
      glass-hybrid-restorative system (Equia Forte Fil, GC, Tokyo, Japan) or a nano ceramic
      composite resin (Ceram.X One Universal, Dentsply, DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) and restorations
      were evaluated at baseline and after 6,12 and 24 months according to the modified-USPHS
      criteria. Data were analyzed with Chi- Square, Fisher's Exact Test, Mann Whitney-U and
      Cochran's Q tests (p < 0.05).
