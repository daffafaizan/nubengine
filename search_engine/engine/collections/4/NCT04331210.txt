        -  it can be done at a 60 degree angle from the vulva towards the anus or at an angle from
           the posterior end of the vulva.

        -  usually under local anesthetic and is sutured after delivery.

        -  It is done during second stage of labor to enlarge the opening for the baby to pass
           through to avoid soft-tissue tearing which may involve the anal sphincter and rectum.

           and their babies. These effects can interfere with breastfeeding and the care of the
           infant.
