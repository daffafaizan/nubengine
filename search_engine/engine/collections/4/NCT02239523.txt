    
      Patients who present to the orthopedic department in a level I trauma center will be
      prospectively randomized into one of two groups:

      Letter Group: At time of discharge, patients will be sent home with a discharge letter that
      includes standard recommendations for evaluation and treatment. They will be asked to give
      the letter to their primary care physician.

      Intervention Group: There will be 4 interventions. The patient will be given a short pamphlet
      with explaining osteoporosis and the importance of treatment. The orthopedic department will
      perform a bone density testing (DEXA). They will be given a letter with a specific medication
      recommendation based on a protocol determined by our endocrinology department. They will be
      asked to give both DEXA and medication recommendation to their primary care doctor to
      initiate treatment. Finally, a research assistant will contact the patient monthly to
      encourage them to start treatment.
