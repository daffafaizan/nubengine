      decisions, such as when to say "enough." Patient preparation for facing termination of
      cancer-directed therapy for the number one cause of cancer mortality for both men and women
      in the U.S. is not well handled in most clinical practices. Sparse literature validates that
      this concern is often denied by investigators. Failure to engage in a systematic, informed
      decision-making process, even in the initial stage of treatment, may often result in patients
      looking back and saying, "Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't make the same choice" The
      long-term goal of this program of research is to enhance patient care for lung cancer by
      oncology health professionals and to promote patient empowerment to make informed choices,
      defined as the ability to actively understand and influence one's health status. For this
      study, shared decision making is defined as a tailored, interactive process (emphasizing
      beliefs/personal values) in which the patient is informed enough to ask pertinent questions
      and to participate in the final decision at his/her own preference and comfort levels. The
      intent is to test a decision aid for patients with advanced lung cancer to help facilitate
      informed decisions about treatments that affect quality of life, including termination of
      cancer-directed treatment.
