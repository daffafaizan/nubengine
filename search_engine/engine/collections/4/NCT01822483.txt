      dosage adjustment are necessary in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), but
      there is still limited information about the dose-exposure-effect relationship of the
      enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) formulation that has quite different
      physicochemical properties (TETT et al., 2011).

      Pharmacokinetically guided exposure-controlled area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)
      approaches are helpful to limit interpatient variability of MPA exposure and to improve the
      clinical outcome of organ transplant recipients (TETT et al., 2011).

      MPA area under the concentration-time curve values between 30 and 60 μg h/mL in the early
      post-transplant period reduces the risk of acute rejections and seems to be appropriate in
      renal allograft recipients taking mycophenolate sodium (MPS) and calcineurin inhibitors
      (GRINYÓ et al., 2009; SOMMERER et al., 2010).

      Among the benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA are the evaluation of interaction
      between MPA and proton pump inhibitors and association of donor-specific antibodies
      reduction.
