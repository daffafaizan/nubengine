      stimulation protocol applied in an IVF cycle. It seems that a diminished ovarian reserve is
      the principal factor of poor ovarian response. Several strategies have been proposed for the
      management of poor responders, including flare up GnRH agonist regimens and the GnRH
      antagonist, which presents a new hope in this group of patients.

      Comparisons: Poor responder patients (see inclusion criteria) commencing an IVF treatment
      cyle will receive ovarian stimulation treatment either using a GnRH antagonist (Ganirelix) or
      flare up agonist (Arvekap) protocol. Primary outcomes compared will be ongoing pregnancy
      rates in the two treatment groups.
