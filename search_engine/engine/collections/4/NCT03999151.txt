    
      This is a PI initiated, randomized controlled trial of four exercise and diet interventions
      among 200 men opting for radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The Prostate 8-II study
      enrolls men up to 8 weeks prior to surgery and participants remain on study for 24 cycles
      after surgery (1 cycle=28 days). After obtaining written informed consent, enrolled subjects
      will be scheduled for the baseline assessments. All participants will receive Group A
      educational materials and tools, but these will be distributed at different times based on
      group assignment. The other 3 groups will receive different combinations of exercise (Group
      B), diet (Group C) and exercise and diet (Group D) tools. Men in all arms will be asked to
      complete questionnaires at baseline, pre-surgery, and at cycles 6 12 & 24 post-surgery, and
      complete blood and urine collection, diet recall, and accelerometer measurement at select
      time points. Specimens from biopsy and radical prostatectomy will be reviewed by the
      investigators' collaborator, GenomeDx, for RNA characterization and assessment of the genomic
      risk scores. Patients will be followed for 30 days after completion of the 2-year 24-cycle
      intervention period or removal from the study, or until death, whichever occurs first for any
      treatment-related adverse events. Following the completion of the intervention, we will
      follow the patient's treatment and disease status on a yearly basis, for 3 more years.
