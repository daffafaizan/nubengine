      electronic devices. Sterile magnetic drapes used to hold surgical instruments are often
      placed on the patient's thorax, and they are likely to interfere with the function of these
      devices.

      This study compares the magnetic interference of a new prototype surgical magnetic drape made
      with bottom-isolated ferrite magnets to the Covidien magnetic drape and 3 other commercially
      available surgical magnetic drapes.
