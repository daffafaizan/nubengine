    
      Antiangiogenic drugs and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) represent a new therapeutic issue in
      the treatment of several neoplasic tumors (colon, kidney, breast, lung, skin) and hemopathy.
      Antiangiogenic drugs acts through neutralization of the activity (e.g. bevacizumab) or the
      inhibition of post-receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (e.g. sunatinib, sorafenib), leading to
      a reduction and inhibition of the tumoral tissular neovascularization. Due to the ubiquitous
      role of and the systemic administration of the antiangiogenic drugs, almost all of them are
      responsible for several side effects, many involving the cardiovascular system (e.g. arterial
      hypertension, cardiomyopathies, proteinuria, bleedings,...) and leading to a reduction of the
      doses or withdrawal of the treatment. To date, the mechanism and the impact of these
      cardiovascular effects is not well understood involving structural (i.e. capillary
      rarefaction) and functional vascular dysfunction (i.e. vasomotor dysfunction, stiffening).
