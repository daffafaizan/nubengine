      aprepitant (selective antagonist of substance P receptor) vs. placebo on ratings of
      breathlessness during resistive load breathing in patients with COPD. Four hours after
      randomization, all patients will receive intravenous naloxone (antagonist of opioid
      receptors) to block the effects of endogenous opioids on perception of breathlessness. The
      two competing hypothesis of the study are:

      Breathing difficulty will be induced by the patient breathing thru a tube with fine wire mesh
      for approximately 10 - 20 minutes in the laboratory.

      Approximately 20 patients with COPD will be recruited from the out-patient clinic at the
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The population will consist of female or male adults at
      least 50 years of age, at least 10 pack-year history of smoking, and a diagnosis of COPD
      associated with chronic bronchitis based on standard criteria.
