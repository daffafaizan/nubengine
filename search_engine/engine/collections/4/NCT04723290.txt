      COVID-19 at a time when PCR (smear) testing was only allowed for hospitalized people. In
      addition, the PCR test has a fairly low sensitivity. In this context, serology can make it
      possible to determine whether the symptoms are indeed linked to exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

      As a hospital, and in order to prepare for a possible second epidemic wave, it is also useful
      to know the proportion of staff members who have already been in contact with the virus for
      organizational purposes and symptom assessment.
