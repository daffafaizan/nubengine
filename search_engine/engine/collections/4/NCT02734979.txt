      following surgery to determine the success of the surgery. In addition, the volume of the
      operated arm will be monitored by repeated measurement with a tape measure. The investigators
      will also track bioimpedance, a painless technique to detect fluid in the tissues. The
      investigators will obtain small skin biopsies and blood samples to detect the biological
      changes that may occur as a result of successful surgery.
