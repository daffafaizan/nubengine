      persistent asthma for a study protocol that includes exercise at a moderate intensity level
      in a home-based setting. The investigators primary hypothesis is that compared to no
      intervention, 12-weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise will attenuate serum levels of
      adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), and other pro-inflammatory markers. The investigators will
      also analyze the effect of the intervention on fitness levels, pulmonary function, asthma
      symptoms, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

      Given that this is a proof of concept/feasibility study, there is no primary outcome measure.
      The following measures will be assessed:

        -  Obesity related biomarkers and other markers of inflammatory responses:

        -  Asthma symptoms and asthma control measures:

        -  Lung function

        -  Fitness levels and physical activity levels:
