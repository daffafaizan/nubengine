      potentially sterilizing treatments. In the absence of other techniques such as in vitro
      folliculogenesis or injection of isolated ovarian follicles, this tissue can only be re-used
      by autograft. In France, the first live birth after orthotopic ovarian transplantation, was
      obtained by Roux et al. in 2009.

      This clinical trial aims to build a cohort of patients likely to use their ovarian tissue
      cryopreserved by autograft. This cohort will be used to:

        -  Follow up of patients with their cryopreserved ovarian tissue;

        -  Evaluate requests for ovarian tissue grafting ;

        -  Propose a search of residual disease in case of neoplastic disease risk (if possible);

        -  Allowing patients to benefit from an ovarian tissue autograft;

        -  Assess the effectiveness of autograft technique after the restoration of ovarian
           function.
