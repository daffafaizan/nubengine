      Guangzhou by the use of pretreatment susceptibility tests in selection of chemotherapy
      regimens & 2) To study the predictive factors of unfavourable outcomes in the retreatment of
      pulmonary TB in Guangzhou, where unfavourable outcomes include treatment failures and
      relapses.

      The patients will be randomized into either a) The DOTS strategy consisting of the following
      measures: political commitment, case detection through bacteriologic evaluation, standardized
      treatment with supervision and patient support, an effective drug supply system, and a
      reporting and recording system that allows assessment of treatment; or b) The DOTS-Plus
      strategy includes additional measures including continuous drug resistance surveillance,
      culture, drug susceptibility testing for TB patients, and tailoring of individual drug
      regimen through the use of first and second-line drugs.

      The Primary end point is the 18-month combined treatment failure/ relapse (unfavourable
      outcome) among rifampicin resistant group. Secondary endpoints include the 30-month combined
      treatment failure/ relapse (unfavourable outcome) among rifampicin resistant group, multidrug
      resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases and all retreatment cases; Sputum smear/conversion rate
      at 2m, 3m, 8m, 12m, 18m, and 24m; Drug resistance rates to various drugs in particular
      rifampicin, and rate of MDR-TB. The predictive factors of unfavourable treatment outcomes
      (including failure and relapse) will be analysed.

      The management of retreatment cases by DOTS alone is often problematic, especially when there
      is resistance to rifampicin, and treatment failure / relapse with further resistances might
      result. With implementation of the "DOTS-plus" strategy, Hong Kong (HK) has achieved a low
      MDR-TB prevalence of around 1%. This study will provide important data on the predictors of
      treatment failure/ relapse of retreatment cases and whether the DOTS-plus strategy can
      effectively reduce the failure/relapse rate and the prevalence rate of MDR-TB in Guangzhou.
      The project will provide useful data on the surveillance, epidemiology and public health
      control of TB with a regional (cross-border) significance.
