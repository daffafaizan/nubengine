    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of methoxyamine (TRC102) in combination with
      pemetrexed disodium (pemetrexed)-cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To (descriptively) assess the toxicity profile of methoxyamine (TRC102) in combination
      with pemetrexed-cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy.

      II. To (descriptively) assess the short-term progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6) in
      the patients treated on this protocol.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of methoxyamine hydrochloride.

      CYCLES 1-2: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and
      methoxyamine hydrochloride orally (PO) day 1; and cisplatin IV over 0.5-24 hours on day 3.
      Patients also undergo 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation therapy (RT) or
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week (3 days of week 1
      and 4 days of week 4) for 30 fractions total.

      CYCLES 3-4: Beginning at least 10 days after RT completion, patients receive pemetrexed
      disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 0.5-24 hours on day 1.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 weeks and then every 3
      months for 6 months.
