      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic and (DHA) reduce aggressive behaviors among alcoholics in a
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Aggression will be measured in a
      well-established behavioral test, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm. Secondary and
      tertiary aims are to determine if supplementation will improve neurochemical mechanisms and
      cardiovascular abnormalities that are linked to the pathophysiology of aggression. A testing
      battery will be done before supplementation (baseline) and compared to the same battery
      repeated after three months of supplementation. This battery will include 1) psychometric
      measures (aggression, depression and impulsivity), 2) a neurochemical measure (a lumbar
      puncture for assessment of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid [CSF 5-HIAA], a
      metabolite of serotonin), and 3) a measure of cardiovascular physiology (heart rate
      variability). The research participants will be randomized to consume four 1-gram capsules/ d
      containing either 1.88 grams of DHA plus EPA (active) or reference oils containing corn oil
      and 1% fish oil for flavor blinding (placebo). Research participants will be aggressive
      recovering alcoholics defined as scoring 20 or more on the Coccaro Lifetime History of
      Aggression Scale and who eat seafood no more than once per week. If these inexpensive
      nutrients reduce aggression or the related neurochemical and cardiovascular measures, these
      findings will be readily applicable to many aggressive populations.
