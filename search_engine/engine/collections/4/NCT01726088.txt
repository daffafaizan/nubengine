      Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). Unfortunately, currently available
      treatments for combat-related PTSD have produced modest treatment gains at best. New
      treatment strategies that can be directed toward objectively measured correlates of PTSD are
      urgently needed.

      Specific Aims: 1) To determine if there is evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of
      adjunctive modafinil in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. We hypothesize that OEF/OIF
      veterans with PTSD randomized to modafinil 100mg/day for four weeks will experience more
      improvement in PTSD symptoms than OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to placebo treatment
      for four weeks. 2) To determine if PTSD symptom severity is associated with
      electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and attention and if
      these measures change to a greater degree in participants randomized to modafinil versus
      those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize modafinil treatment will result in greater
      changes in electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and
      attention than placebo treatment.
