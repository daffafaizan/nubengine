        -  Determine the feasibility of treating elderly women with metastatic breast cancer with
           docetaxel.

        -  Determine the overall survival, 2-year survival, and response (confirmed and unconfirmed
           complete and partial) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity,
           depression, and functional status in elderly cancer patients.

        -  Determine the parameters of clinical pharmacology of this drug in elderly patients and
           in patients under 60 years of age.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the genetic polymorphisms and gene expression levels of
           enzymes involved in drug metabolism and resistance in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over vs under 60).

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients (60 patients age 70 and over and 20 patients
      under age 60) will be accrued for this study.
