      sphincter muscles, as a result of their damage and/or neurological changes including the
      disturbance perception of sensory stimuli from the anal canal. Biofeedback therapy using
      visual and verbal feedback techniques has emerged as an useful option in managing fecal
      incontinence and levator ani syndrome. The goal of biofeedback training is to improve bowel
      function by restoring a normal pattern of defecation.
