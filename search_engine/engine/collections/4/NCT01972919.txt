      doses of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy in controlling unresectable pancreas cancers
      than are used in either the pre-operative or post-operative setting. The investigators will
      assess acute and late side effects (problems and symptoms) of radiation therapy given at
      these higher doses of radiation (dose escalated) following full dose chemotherapy given
      before the radiation and with concurrent chemotherapy for pancreas cancer. Radiation therapy
      is given in higher doses that are limited by the proximity of normal organs to the radiation
      dose distribution to improve the likelihood of controlling the tumor in the pancreas while
      minimizing the risk of radiation injury to these organs. There are two chemotherapy drugs,
      Capecitabine is an oral drug taken twice per day on the same day that radiation therapy is
      given and Gemcitabine is an intravenous drug given once per week, during radiation therapy.
      Everyone in this study will have already received chemotherapy alone first. Everyone in this
      study will receive radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy.
