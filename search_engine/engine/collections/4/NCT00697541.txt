    
      A double-blind, randomized, 2-way crossover, safety, pharmacokinetic/-dynamic (PK/PD) study
      of 0.18% COL-118 facial gel and 0.2% brimonidine ophthalmic solution administered in male and
      female patients with moderate to severe erythematous rosacea.

      Twenty male and female subjects with moderate to severe erythematous rosacea will be
      randomized into 2 groups of 10 subjects.

      Each group will be randomized to receive 2 treatments (Treatments A and B, in Sequence 1: A/B
      or Sequence 2: B/A), as follows:

      Treatment A: One 1-g application of 0.18% COL-118 facial gel (1.8 mg brimonidine)
      administered topically plus one drop of Advanced Eye Reliefâ„¢ in each eye, once in the
      morning. 1 g of 0.18% COL-118 facial gel is reapplied once after four hours;

      Treatment B: One 1-g application of COL-118 facial gel vehicle (0.0 mg brimonidine tartrate)
      administered topically plus one drop of 0.2% brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1 mg
      brimonidine tartrate/drop) in each eye. Four hours after the first application 1-g of COL-118
      facial gel vehicle (0.0 mg brimonidine) is administered topically.

      There will be at least a 1-day washout between dose administrations (Period 1 and Period 2).

      Blood samples for PK analysis of brimonidine levels will be collected at the following time
      points during Period 1 and Period 2: 0 Hour (prior to dose) and at 1, 2, 3, 4 (prior to 2nd
      dose), 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours post-dose.
