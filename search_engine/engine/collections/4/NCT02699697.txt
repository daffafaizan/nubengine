      I. To determine whether 8 gray (Gy) x 2 fractions results in lower re-treatment rates
      compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fractions provides superior pain and narcotic relief
      compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.

      II. To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fractions is associated with improved quality of life
      compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.

      III. To determine whether use of a bone strengthening agent is associated with improved pain
      relief, narcotic relief and re-treatment rates.

      IV. To determine if 8 Gy x 2 fractions is associated with increased toxicity. V. To correlate
      patient satisfaction, perceived stress, and social support with treatment outcomes.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo 1 fraction of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) over 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo 2 fractions of EBRT over 30 minutes. The 2 fractions will be
      separated by 3-7 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 3 months.
