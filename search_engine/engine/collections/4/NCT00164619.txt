    
      This project was an RCT with 1699 patients assigned to receive the VOICES/VOCES intervention
      and 1707 to receive standard of care at each of the two STD clinics (total N=3406).
      Participant outcomes and their measures are:

        1. Change in knowledge and attitudes about condoms as determined by participant profile and
           survey data

        2. Condom acquisition as determined by project coupon redemption data

        3. STD incidence as determined by medical chart review and/or surveillance data

      In addition, cost accounting data on the amounts and types of resources required to implement
      the intervention were used to evaluate the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Process
      evaluation data allow identification of factors that influenced intervention implementation
      and the effectiveness of the intervention.
