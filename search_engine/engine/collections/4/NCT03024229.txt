      graft function in the days following transplantation and its long-term survival. When the
      kidneys are perfused on perfusion machines before transplantation, the resistance parameters
      as well as the histological score on the pre-implantation biopsy participate in the
      evaluation of the quality of the graft. The metabolomic profile of the infusion fluid could
      provide additional evidence.
