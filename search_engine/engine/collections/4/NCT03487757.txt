      Because of this close neuro-anatomic relationship; cochlear, semicircular canal, or both may
      cause damage to the vestibular dysfunction, resulting in imbalance. Sensory impairment in
      children with hearing loss may lead to decreased muscle strength and respiratory function
      with balance and coordination disorders. Core stabilization is provided anatomically with
      abdominal muscles at the front, spinal and gluteal muscles at the back, diaphragm at the top
      and pelvic floor and hip muscles at the bottom. Core stabilization training is a training to
      increase the strength, endurance and neuromuscular control of the aforementioned muscles.

      When the literature is checked, the invetigators find that postural control is being
      evaluated in children with hearing impairment, but there are few studies evaluating
      respiratory functions. However, they did not encounter a study in which respiratory muscle
      strength was assessed in these children. In this study the investigators will examine the
      effects of core stabilization exercises on respiratory muscle strength, respiratory functions
      and postural control in hearing-impaired children.
