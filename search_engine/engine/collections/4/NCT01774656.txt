      hemodynamic unloading provided by the Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) in conjunction
      with aggressive pharmacological treatment may induce a profound reverse structural remodeling
      and in turn result in a curative alternative to a specific patient population with severe
      heart failure. The active identification and characterization of the patients with a high
      potential for full cardiac function recovery is of paramount importance. The development of a
      standard and simplified recovery protocol would ultimately lead to a larger bridge to
      recovery patient population. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      proportion of subjects who have sufficient improvement in ventricular function (remission
      from heart failure) after undergoing a standardized LVAD plus pharmacologic recovery
      treatment and testing protocol to allow removal of the LVAD within 18 months. The secondary
      objectives of this study are twofold, first to determine the durability of sustained
      remission from HF following LVAD explantation at 12 months and up to 3 years and second to
      determine the predictors of recovery.
