      common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal proliferation of primitive
      and immature myeloid cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. In recent years, due to the
      aging of the population, the incidence of AML and MDS has been on the rise. What is also
      troubling us is that the incidence of treatment-related MDS and AML in children and
      adolescents with Hodgkin's disease, sarcoma, breast and testicular tumors, lymphoma and other
      patients who survive after treatment is also gradually increasing. Occupational exposure such
      as ionizing radiation and benzene and petrochemical are also related to the incidence of AML.

      Car t therapy is the most effective and widely used in the treatment of all. B7-H3, also
      known as cd276, was first discovered in 2001. It is mainly expressed on the cell surface,
      such as activated dendritic cells, monocytes, T cells, B cells and NK cells. Studies have
      shown that B7-H3 can stimulate the expansion and killing of T cells, and may selectively
      stimulate the signal receptor of T cells. It is a promising target for AML immunotherapy.
