      failures. In ulcerative colitis it may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal
      cancer. Estimates for non-adherence range from 15% to 93% with an average of around a third
      of patients failing to adhere to their recommended therapeutic regimen.

      The study aims to evaluate a wide-ranging approach to reducing poor adherence, which is based
      on factors associated with non-adherence and involves the patient in choosing interventions.

      The effectiveness of the overall intervention will be assessed through a randomised
      controlled trial comparing intervention against standard care.
