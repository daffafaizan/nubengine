    
      Objective: To test the effectiveness of a collagen-based treatment for patients complaining
      of long standing facial nerve axonotmesis, who are following a proprioceptive neuromuscular
      facilitation protocol (Kabat method), compared to a group only undergoing the Kabat method.

      Methods: Patients undergoing both procedures will be compared, after randomization, to
      matched patients undergoing only Kabat procedure after 8 weeks of treatment. The outcomes
      will be electromyographic findings, validated questionnaires (Facial Disability Index, FDI)
      and clinical grading (House-Brackmann, HB). A correlation analysis will be performed between
      pre-/post-treatment diﬀerences (Δ) in outcome and clinical-demographic measures.
