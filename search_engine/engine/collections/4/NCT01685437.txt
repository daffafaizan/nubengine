      (ie, qualified by license, education, and training to perform the study procedure according
      to local, state, and country requirements) will model the plaque in an attempt to stretch or
      elongate the plaque. If the subject's penile curvature is reduced to <15° after the first,
      second, or third cycle of injections or if the investigator determines further treatment is
      not clinically indicated (eg, adverse events; allergic reaction), subsequent treatment cycles
      will not be administered. Following the maximum of four treatment cycles, each subject will
      be followed for additional safety and efficacy assessments on Days 168 (± 7 days) and 252 (±
      7 days) (nominal weeks 24 and 36).
