      anxiety has grown rapidly. Millions of people are thought to be using them around the world.
      This research aims to help find out whether the use of online support groups is beneficial
      and to learn more about what happens in these groups.

      This research will compare online support groups with expressive writing. Expressive writing
      involves people writing about their thoughts and feelings, often upsetting ones, for a short
      period of time. In online support groups giving and receiving support from others can be
      helpful while expressive writing about emotional issues can be cathartic.

      1,000 participants will be recruited online from the UK, USA and Canada and randomly assigned
      to either an existing online support group or to an expressive writing condition.
