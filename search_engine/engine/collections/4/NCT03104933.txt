      experimental animals and humans, the intravenous administration of ADM induces a marked and
      prolonged hypotension. Serum ADM levels are elevated in patients with septic shock. In fact,
      ADM seems to be one of the main mediators involved in hypotension that these patients
      present.

      ADM is not stable in plasma due to its short half-life and rapid binding to receptors. ADM
      levels can be measured indirectly by determining proadrenomedullin (proADM) which is a more
      stable molecule and whose levels are reflected in the plasma of ADM.

      Copeptin is released primarily in response to changes in serum osmolarity or blood volume by
      increasing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.

      Copeptin is elevated in patients with shock of different etiologies such as hemorrhagic shock
      or septic shock.

      It is not defined in what situations and at what moment an invasive monitoring of the cardiac
      output and the different hemodynamic variables that reflect the preload and afterload in
      patients with septic shock should be performed. In fact, there is great variability in the
      management and treatment of patients with sepsis and septic shock, which includes the
      selection of patients who require invasive monitoring and the time of onset.

      Having a biomarker or the combination of biomarkers that allow early determination of which
      patients will evolve poorly with the development of a shock that requires volume in large
      quantities and high doses of vasopressors will allow identifying a subgroup of patients that
      should be performed early hemodynamic monitoring and intensify medical treatment to try to
      reverse these severe hemodynamic changes.
