      conflicting. One of the reported difficulties of the studies in this field is to get adequate
      power for statistical significance. The incidence of preoperative dehydration in different
      surgical populations has been reported in about one third of patients. The prevalence in the
      urologic population is not known.

      This is a monocentric observational study with no study intervention. The goal is to
      consecutively include all patients undergoing major urologic surgery during 365 days who meet
      the inclusion criteria to assess the prevalence of preoperative dehydration in elective major
      abdominal urologic surgery when the standard operation procedures of the University Hospital
      Bern are applied.
