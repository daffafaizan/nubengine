      which the flap was created with Visumax FSL, while in group II (30 eyes) the Moria M2 MK was
      used. Keratometric, refractive, and aberrometric measurements were compared preoperatively
      and 3 months postoperatively. The intraoperative subtraction pachymetry (the SP 100 Handy
      pachymeter (Tomey, Nagoya, Japan) was used for preoperative pachymetry and flap thickness
