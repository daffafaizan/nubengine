      of aerobic exercise, based on a tightly controlled program at the treadmill, on the
      rehabilitation therapy of CMT 1A neuropathy.

      Comparing aerobic training at the treadmill combined with respiratory physiotherapy,
      stretching and proprioceptive exercises (TreSPE- treated group) with a more conventional
      treatment only composed by respiratory physiotherapy, stretching and proprioceptive exercises
      (SPE- control group) will provide information on the impact of Treadmill in CMT1A.

      92 patients (23 per centre) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to TreSPE (n = 46) or to
      SPE (n = 46). Both groups will be treated for three months and followed up for six months.

      No serious side effects are expected with TreSPE, as also suggested by our preliminary
      results. For safety reasons blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and an electrocardiogram
      will be recorded during the rehabilitation treatment when the treating physician considers it
      necessary. The patients will be allowed, if needed, to hold at the parallel bars of the
      treadmill during exercise. According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines the
      cardiopulmonary exercise test will be interrupted if BP raises at 240/120 and/or HR to
      220-patients age.
