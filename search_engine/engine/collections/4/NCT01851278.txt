      injection is not well established. The objective of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness and tolerance in the medium-term between small and large dose of triamcinolone
      hexacetonide (TH) used in intraarticular injection (IAI) of medium size joint of patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Materials/Methods: A controlled, randomized, prospective,
      double-blind study will be realized in patients with RA. It will be evaluated 60 wrists
      joints (representing medium size joints) from the outpatient clinics at the Rheumatology
      Division UNIFESP, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were: patients with established RA, age between
      18 and 65 years, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) stable for at least 3
      months, synovitis in wrist with pain visual analogic scale (VAS) between 4 and 8cm. Patients
      with overlap syndromes, polyarticular synovitis, diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled
      hypertension and those with suspected local or systemic infection were excluded. Patients
      will be randomized (Clapboard randomization) in two groups of 30 patients each: group 1 (high
      dose) is injected with 40mg (2ml) of TH and group 2 (small dose) was injected 20mg (1ml).
      Only one joint is injected by patient (IAI blindly). Evaluation will be conducted by a
      blinded observer at five times: baseline (T0), one week (T1), four (T4), eight (T8) and
      twelve (T12) weeks and the following assessment instruments were used: visual analogue scale
      for pain and swollen (VAS 0-10cm); wrist goniometry; chronic disease activity index (CDAI).
      Side effects and related events were reported in a medical questionnaire. The level of
      statistical significance was 5%.
