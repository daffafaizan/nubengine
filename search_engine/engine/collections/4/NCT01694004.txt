      intravenous (IV) and intraduodenal (ID) infusions of glucose tracers or amino acid tracers
      and measurement of tracer rate of appearance in the plasma. An ID infusion of LCFA will allow
      the investigators to determine if LCFA can alter nutrient absorption and glucose and amino
      acid metabolism. Benzocaine will be added to the ID infusion of LCFA to inhibit nerve
      terminals in the duodenum thereby preventing gut-brain communication. Plasma levels of
      glucose and amino acid tracers, glucose oxidation (13CO2 breath test), gut hormones (CCK,
      GIP, PYY, GLP-1, ghrelin), and bioactive lipids (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines, NAPEs)
      will be measured during all infusion periods.
