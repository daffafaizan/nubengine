      without excessive dose modification or treatment delay in patients with previously untreated
      ovarian epithelial carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. Determine the response rate
      (in patients with measurable disease) and progression-free interval in these patients
      receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a feasibility study. On day 1, patients receive paclitaxel as a 3 hour
      continuous IV infusion followed by carboplatin as a 30 minute infusion. Gemcitabine is
      administered by continuous infusion over 30 minutes on day 1 following carboplatin and on day
      8. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, courses repeat every 21
      days for a maximum of 8 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for the next 3 years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 2 years.
