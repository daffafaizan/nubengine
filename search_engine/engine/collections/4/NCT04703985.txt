      allografts, that highlight the superiority of enteral nutrition over parenteral nutrition in
      terms of reducing co-morbidities.

      Enteral nutrition is the nutritional support recommended by learned societies for therapeutic
      intensification with autograft of autologous hematopoietic cells in hematology. Nevertheless,
      enteral nutrition presents difficulties in its implementation and failures (refusal of
      patients, probes vomiting, neutropenic colitis, etc.), requiring the use of parenteral
      nutrition in case of failure.

      In this context, the study proposes to assess the success and effectiveness of enteral
      nutrition.
