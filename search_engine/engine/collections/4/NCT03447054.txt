      psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions. Alcohol dependence is thought to reflect an
      abnormal interplay between two neural systems: an overly active impulsive one driven by
      immediate rewards prospects and a weak reflective one, tuned on long-term prospects. The
      investigators proposes that two non-pharmacological interventions, Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Inhibitory Control Techniques (ICT) may act on both systems
      when combined. tDCS has been found to improve working memory, which is necessary to evaluate
      long-term consequences of actions. ICT is able to modify the automatic approach tendencies
      towards appetitive cues.

      The investigators will recruit 160 alcohol-dependent patients and divide them randomly
      between four treatment conditions : real transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with
      active or control Inhibitory Control Technique (ICT ); or sham (placebo) tDCS with active or
      control ICT.

      Patients will be evaluated with primary outcome measures (alcohol consumption patterns) and
      secondary outcome measures (working memory and changes in alcohol-related stimuli affective
      values).
