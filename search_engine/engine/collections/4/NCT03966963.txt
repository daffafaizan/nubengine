      Reprocessing (EMDR) via investigation of the changes in the individual trauma stress response
      on sexually abused adolescents and young adults, aged between 18 and 25 during EMDR
      treatment. The findings of this mixed methods study will explore (a) neuropsychological,
      emotional (namely low self-esteem, anxiety and depression), behavioural functioning and
      quality of life issues via quantitative measures conducted before, during and after treatment
      and (b) client perspectives of such changes through qualitative interviewing (interview guide
      is in Appendix 7) at one month follow-up using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
      [IPA]. The study setting will be conducted within the Improving Access to Psychological
      Therapies (IAPT) program framework, established to ensure service users accessing NHS
      treatment are presented with choice in their treatment. Therapy will routinely be delivered
      within GP Surgeries or Health Centres.

      Within this two-fold study, the following key research questions will be considered in
      relation to the effectiveness of EMDR:

        1. Qualitative data will sought to identify; In what ways was EMDR helpful? In what ways
           was EMDR perceived as being unhelpful?

        2. Quantitative data will sought to identify; Are there changes in emotional and
           behavioural functioning (in relation to trauma, anxiety and depressive symptoms)? Are
           there changes in neuropsychological functioning (memory, attention, executive
           functioning)? Are there changes in quality of life issues? Are there changes in
           self-worth?
