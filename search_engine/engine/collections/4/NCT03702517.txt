      can be adjusted from 0 to 16.5 centimeters, the stair was 0.74 m in width, with each step
      being 16 cm deep and 10 cm long. The experimental group received different heights of lateral
      stair walking training according to the patients' ability. The patients went up the stairs
      with the affected leg up first and they went down stairs with the sound leg leading first.
      For safety, the subjects held a handrail during the lateral stair walking exercise. The
      control group received traditional physiotherapy (strengthening exercise, balance training
      and gait training) for 30 minutes. Both the experimental group and control group received the
      intervention once a week for 12 weeks. All the interventions were done by the same physical
      therapist.
