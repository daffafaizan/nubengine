    
      General objective To evaluate the efficacy of DHA-PPQ in patients with uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in a rural area of Central Vietnam, and to assess the in vitro
      susceptibility of P.falciparum isolates to DHA and PPQ.

      Specific objectives

        1. To measure the parasite clearance time in falciparum malaria patients treated with
           DHA-PPQ.

        2. To determine the efficacy of DHA-PPQ at day 42 post-treatment.

        3. To assess the in vitro susceptibility of P.falciparum isolates towards DHA and PPQ in
           Quang Nam Province.

        4. To compare genetic profiles of P.falciparum isolates with delayed and those with normal
           clearance times in order to identify potential markers of resistance;
