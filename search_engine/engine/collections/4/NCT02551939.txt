      instrument. Fat was injected into the tissues in a multitunnel and multilayer way until they
      were firm and appeared fully tumesced according to the Coleman method.All MRI volume analyses
      were blindly performed by examiner independently preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively.
      Object marking was done using avanto 1.5T superconducting magnetic resonance scanner.Volume
      analysis was done by counting pixels within the frames of the MRI using ImageChecker CAD
      software.The Chinese version of BREAST-Q augmentation module was obtained from the Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the University of British Columbia. 38 patients were given
      the BREAST-Q questionnaire to express their thoughts preoperatively and 1 year
