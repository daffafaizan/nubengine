      control and prevent disease.1-5 In an effort to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality, the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
      (ACIP) issues annual recommendations and guidelines for childhood and adolescent
      immunizations.2,6-8 However, some parents decline or delay vaccinating their children or
      follow alternative immunization schedules because of medical, religious, philosophical, or
      socioeconomic reasons.2,3,4,5,7,9-12Health care provider-based interventions have been
      suggested to overcome such vaccine noncompliance, including patient counseling; improving
      access to vaccinations; maximizing patient office visits; offering combination vaccines; and
      using electronic medical records (EMRs) and practice alerts.2,3,4,7,10,11 Community- and
      government-based interventions to improve parent and patient adherence include public
      education and reminder/recall strategies, financial incentives, and providing alternative
      venues for vaccination.2,7.
