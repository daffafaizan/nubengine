      thoracotomy. Patients had a standardized management for thoracotomies. Initial VT 10ml/ kg
      was reduced to 8ml/kg after OLV and the rate adjusted to maintain PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg.
      Haemodynamic, respiratory variables and echocardiographic data (Tei index and TAPSE) were
      obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing
      OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.31kPa (70mmHg) and pH >7.1), and T3, 15
      min after resuming OLV with normocapnia. One-way repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc
      Dunnetá¿½s test were used for analysis. A P value < 0.05 is considered statistically
      significant.
