      continue to struggle with residual depressive symptomatology that can be associated with
      severe morbidity and suicidality. Because antidepressants can activate manic symptoms in
      bipolar patients with depression, the treatment of bipolar depression poses unique and
      challenging therapeutic dilemmas Thus, the identification of appropriate safe and effective
      treatment strategies for the management of depression in bipolar youth is particularly taxing
      considering that pediatric mania is predominantly mixed with a strong depressive component. A
      recent study in our program of bupropion SR in 30 adults with ADHD and Bipolar disorder,
      treatment with bupropion SR was extremely well tolerated and was not associated with
      activation of manic symptoms. Because bupropion has not been evaluated in the treatment of
      bipolar depression in youth, there is a pressing need to evaluate its effectiveness and
      safety in the context of a treatment protocol aimed at carefully evaluating this issue.

      This is an 8-week open label study of bupropion SR in the treatment of youth with bipolar
      depression with adequate mood stabilization. All youth will be closely monitored for
      treatment emergent manic activation and drug-drug interactions with ongoing antimanic agents.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of bupropion SR in
      the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.
