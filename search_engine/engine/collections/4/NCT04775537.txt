      subjects at 12 months when instrumented lumbar arthrodesis is performed using OssiMend
      Bioactive Moldable as the bone grafting material. The primary endpoints are radiographic
      evidence of fusion and the absence of serious adverse events attributable to OssiMend
      Bioactive Moldable. The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical outcomes over a
      period of 1 year (2 years, if possible).
