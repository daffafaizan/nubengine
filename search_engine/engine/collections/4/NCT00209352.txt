    
      Herpes zoster infection occurs in 30% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
      recipients who had a history of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. A safe and effective
      prevention strategy has not been established.

      77 marrow allograft recipients at risk for VZV reactivation were randomized to oral acyclovir
      800 mg twice daily or placebo given from day 30 until day 365 and were followed for toxicity
      and clinical evidence of herpes zoster infection.
