      alignment with the mission of the organization to provide high value care to their patients.
      The CAREPLAN (Coaches Activating, Reaching, and Engaging Patients in Their End of Life Care
      Plan) intervention is an innovative program aimed to strengthen provider-patient
      relationships and facilitate whole person care about matters important to patients diagnosed
      with advanced stages of cancer and important to patients' support network and family. The
      project is intended to help establish patients' Goals of Care Plan with appropriate
      documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a model of care for patients with cancer that is
      intended to improve clinical outcomes and their experiences with their cancer care. The
      intervention provides patients with lay navigators who assist them and their families in
      formulating and discussing their goals of care with their health care teams in hopes to
      engage in shared-decision making for goal concordant care. The goal of the project is to
      demonstrate that there is improved documentation of goals of care, patient experiences,
      patient activation, quality of life, and quality of care and communication and that the
      program helps to improve goal concordant care receipt at the end of life.
