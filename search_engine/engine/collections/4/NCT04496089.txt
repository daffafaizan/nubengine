    
      Phase 1:

      The phase 1 component of this study will be conducted in in 6-10 subjects at one study
      center, with the objective of confirming the safety/tolerability and the whole-body dose
      distribution of 89Zr-TLX250. 89Zr-TLX250 will be administered via a single IV injection (at
      least 3 min) at an activity dose of 37 MBq (± 10%) and at a dose of 10 mg (±10%). After the
      enrollment of 6 subjects, if the male-to-female ratio is different from the Japanese
      epidemiological RCC data (male-to-female ratio ≒ 2:1 in 2017), more subjects, up to 10
      subjects in total, are to be enrolled.

      Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be is performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 24, 72 h
      and during the Day 5 ± 2 imaging visit. The dose distribution will be determined using
      low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced CT whole body imaging at 0.5, 4, 24, 72 h and Day 5 ± 2.
      Diagnostic images will be acquired on Day 3 and Day 5 ± 2 using whole body PET/CT-imaging
      where individual organs will be assessed using Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) method.

      Seven days after the Day 5 ± 2 imaging visit, patients will attend a follow-up visit to
      conduct safety evaluations and to undergo blood sampling for HACA measurement.

      Phase 2:

      The phase 2 component of this study will be conducted after the completion of the phase 1
      study in 6-10 patients. This part of the study is equivalent to a phase 2, open-label,
      multi-center (2-5 sites) to assess the sensitivity/specificity of PET/CT images in subjects
      with suspected but not definitely diagnosed RCC including ccRCC. The study is intended to
      evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT test as a non-invasive test with the
      CAIX-targeted imaging agent 89Zr-TLX250. The study will include patients who are scheduled to
      undergo a partial or total nephrectomy. Patients with an indeterminate renal mass with the
      longest diameter of 7cm or less, by diagnostic imaging, will receive a single administration
      of 37 MBq (+/- 10%) 89Zr-TLX250. Imaging will then be conducted Day 5 ± 2 post
      administration. The partial/total nephrectomy will be performed at institutional discretion
      any time following the PET/CT imaging visit, but no later than 90 days post administration of
      89Zr-TLX250. Histological tumour samples will be prepared and used for histological diagnosis
      of the renal mass (ccRCC or non-ccRCC) read by a central laboratory.

      Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. Qualitative visual
      analysis (presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250 uptake inside or in vicinity of renal
      lesion, as seen on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI), will be used to assess test performance or
      89Zr-TLX-250 PET/CT imaging to non-invasively detect ccRCC, using histological results from
      the central histological reference laboratory as standard of truth.
