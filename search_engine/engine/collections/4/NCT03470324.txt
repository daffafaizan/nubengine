      [STN+SNr] stimulation by "interleaving stimulation" as compared to [standardSTN] after 8
      weeks on dysphagia. The Trial is designed as superiority study with an 81% power to detect a
      clinically relevant mean improvement of 2 points on the Penetration Aspiration Scale for
      fluids (two-tailed p < 0.05). To this end 20 patients will be randomized. After a common
      baseline assessment in [standardSTN], patients will be randomized to either [standardSTN] or
      [STN+SNr] in 1:1 ratio (10 per arm). The primary endpoint assessment is scheduled 8 weeks
      from baseline assessment (V2). Both treatment arms will receive swallowing therapy as
      standard of care.

      The rationale for this study comes from the association of swallowing and oral transport to
      neuronal integration upon the substantial nigra pars reticulate (SNr)-superior colliculus
      (SC) pathway (Rossi et al., 2016). Deep brain stimulation of the SNr has been put forward to
      modulate brainstem circuitry through its monosynaptic brainstem projections to the SC and to
      the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) (Chastan et al., 2009, Weiss et al., 2013, Rossi et al.,
      2016).

      Secondary outcome measures include anamnestic assessments on dysphagia, clinical global
      impression, freezing of gait and falls, balance, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms
      and suicidality. Secondary outcome measures also include clinical assessment of dysphagia
      (Site of Swallow Reflex Initiation, Test of Mastication and Swallowing solids, pharyngeal
      residue) as well as motor symptoms with MDS-UPDRS III, Capsit-PD and Freezing of Gait
      Assessment Course.
