      Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Disease (INI), located on Rio de Janeiro,
      Brazil. INI is a national reference center for treatment and research in infectious diseases
      and tropical medicine in Brazil, which follows a large cohort of patients with Chagas
      disease, all of them diagnosed by two simultaneously positive serological tests
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence). Patients included in the
      study were submitted to a physical exercise intervention protocol performed three times per
      week, 60 minutes per session, during an 8-month period. Nutritional and pharmaceutical
      counseling were also monthly provided during the follow-up and consisted on general guidance
      about adequate eating habits for patients with heart failure, mainly sodium and water intake,
      and medication usage, particularly drug dosage and compliance.Patients included in the study
      were followed during an 8-month period in which evaluations of functional capacity (maximal
      progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test), muscle respiratory strength (manovacuometry) and
      body composition (anthropometry and skinfolds) were performed at baseline, after four months
      and at the end of follow-up. Assessments of cardiac function (bidimensional
      echocardiography), biomarkers (lipid profile, glucose and glycated hemoglobin) and quality of
      life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire) were taken at baseline and after
      eight months of follow-up.
