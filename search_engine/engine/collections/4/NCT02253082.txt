      OCTAplas trial

      Background

        -  Patients operated for thoracic aortic dissections in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest
           are prone to develop postoperative renal failure secondary to severe endothelial
           dysfunction and capillary leakage, and currently no therapy addressing this complication
           has proven successful

        -  Data from animal models of shock and massively bleeding patients indicate that plasma
           may be beneficial for re-establishing endothelial integrity

        -  Patients operated for thoracic aortic dissections generally develop requirement for
           massive transfusion during surgery

        -  Current guidelines, however, recommend against plasma transfusion to patients not
           needing coagulation factor replacement due to the inherent risk of transfusion
           complications

        -  OctaplasLG® is an immune complex-free and cell-free, pathogen inactivated standardized
           plasma product that has been shown not to be related to the transfusion complications
           seen secondary to standard fresh frozen plasma (FFP), thus, OctaplasLG® may be a
           beneficial, alternative resuscitation fluid in patients with severe endothelial
           dysfunction/damage

        -  The purpose is to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the effect of OctaplasLG® on
           endothelial integrity and safety

      Design Single-centre randomised, single-blinded, controlled, investigator-initiated pilot
      trial of 42 patients undergoing emergency surgery for thoracic aortic dissections randomized
      to administration of OctaplasLG®, as compared to standard FFP, as coagulation factor
      replacement related to bleeding, when need for coagulation factor replacement is deemed
      necessary by the clinician according to local protocol.

      Inclusion criteria

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Documented refusal of blood transfusion OR

        -  Withdrawal from active therapy OR

        -  Expected to die < 24h OR

        -  Previously within 30 days included in a randomized trial, if known at the time of
           enrolment.

        -  Known immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA

        -  Known hypersensitivity to OctaplasLG®: the active substance, any of the excipients
           (Sodium citrate dihydrate, Sodium dihydrogenphosphate dihydrate or Glycine) or residues
           from the manufacturing process (Tri (N-Butyl) Phosphate (TNBP) and Octoxynol (Triton
           X-100))

        -  Known severe deficiencies of protein S

        -  Pregnancy (non-pregnancy confirmed by patient being postmenopausal or having a negative
           serum-hCG).

      Randomization Blood Bank staff will perform 24 hour on-site randomisation by envelope-opening
      to allow for immediate allocation to either receiving OctaplasLG® (intervention) or standard
      FFP (control) as coagulation factor replacement.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome measure:

      • Plasma levels of endothelial markers (Syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM),
      sE-selectin, sVE-cadherin) at 24 hours after arrival in ICU for postoperative care, as
      compared to baseline

      Secondary outcome measures:

        -  Plasma levels of endothelial markers (Syndecan-1, sTM, sE-selectin, sVE-cadherin) at 48
           hours postoperatively, as compared to baseline

        -  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) according to RIFLE Criteria in the first 7 postoperative days,
           see appendix 1

        -  Renal replacement therapy

        -  Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), worst score during ICU stay, see
           appendix 2

        -  30-day and 90-day mortality

        -  P-CRP, IL-6, P-Catecholamines at 24 hours and 48 hours

        -  Length of stay in ICU and hospital

        -  Severe adverse reactions

      Tertiary outcome measures

        -  TRALI

        -  TACO

      Trial size The calculation is based in part by data collected in a quality control
      investigation of the effect of OctaplasLG® vs. FFP. The power calculation is based on the
      finding of a significantly higher relative level of sTM in the FFP compared to the
      OctaplasLG® group (p=0.025). The relative values of sTM post-CPB: FFP group: mean 3.35 (SD
      2.12); OctaplasLG® group: mean 1.70 (SD 0.49); SD across the entire group of patients: 1.574.
      To detect the above difference with a power of 0.90 (1-β) and alpha of 0.05 requires n=21
      patients in each group. The investigators have chosen to include 42 patients, 21 evaluable
      patients in each randomization group in case of attrition, in the present trial.
