      (intranasal application followed by control application) or sequence "B" (control application
      followed by intranasal application) using the device. Upon entering the CAE, participants
      will complete dry eye questionnaires every five minutes and will administer the device either
      intranasally or extranasally in randomized sequence when a certain level of ocular discomfort
      has been reached.
