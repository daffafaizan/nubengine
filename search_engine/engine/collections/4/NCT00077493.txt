      Primary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of BL22 immunotoxin in pediatric patients with relapsed or
           refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the in vitro cytotoxicity of this drug against lymphoblasts from patients with
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of this drug in inducing remissions in these
           patients.

        -  Determine changes in lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, serum cytokines, and
           soluble cytokine receptor levels in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 OR on days 1, 3, 5,
      7, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or
      unconfirmed CR (CRu) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or CRu for a maximum of 6
      courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BL22 immunotoxin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, the
      cohort is expanded and a total of 12 patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed weekly for at least 1 month and then every 1-3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 95 patients will be accrued for this study.
