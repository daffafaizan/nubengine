      study to obtain data on size and variance of treatment effects in subjects with mild to
      moderate Psoriasis. The target sample size of 60 was selected as a practical figure for
      recruitment purposes in one centre over 3 months.After a 2 week washout during which only
      emollients were applied to their psoriasis, patients attended for baseline assessment of
      psoriasis severity and blood tests.Subjects attended every 4 weeks for 12 weeks for clinical
      assessment and blood tests.Each patient once eligible{see inclusion & exclusion criteria} was
      allocated to either active treatment or placebo in identical packing for a total of 12 weeks.
