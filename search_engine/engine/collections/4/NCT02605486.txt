      eligibility criteria and sign informed consent to Step 2 may begin treatment on study.
      Treatment consists of bicalutamide orally once daily and palbociclib will be given orally
      daily for 3 weeks on followed by 1 week off. A treatment cycle is considered to be 4 weeks.
      Eligible patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 2 weeks during Cycle #1 and 2,
      followed by every 4 weeks in subsequent cycles. Toxicity assessment will include history,
      physical examination including vital signs, and laboratories including complete blood count
      and comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients will keep a drug diary to document adherence to
      oral therapy. Radiographic response evaluation per RECIST will occur every 8 weeks (2 cycles)
      for cycles 1-6 and then every 12 weeks thereafter with high-resolution CT scan. Patients with
      suspected bone-only lesions must have bone lesions assessed by CT with bone windows or by
      bone scan at screening.

      Phase I: We will use a standard 3+3 design for the dose finding lead in to establish the
      recommended phase II doses for the combination of palbociclib and bicalutamide. The doses for
      Phase I will be determined based on the dose level to which the patient is accrued.

      Phase II: Treatment consists of bicalutamide orally once daily and palbociclib will be given
      orally daily for 3 weeks on followed by 1 week off at the doses determined in phase I.
