      and has been reported to be to be chemosensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. Seeking a
      more appropriate treatment for these patients, we perform this randomized phase II clinical
      trial. About 460 stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients with micropapillary component â‰¥ 20%
      will be included and divided into two group. Patients in the control group will only undergo
      complete R0 resection of the lesion, no further therapy will be used. While patients in the
      experimental group are going to receive platinum-based chemotherapy (comprising cisplatin and
      pemetrexed disodium)about 1 month after therapeutic surgery. Treatment continues every 3
      weeks for 4 courses. Clinic and telephone follow up will be conducted for survival data
      monitoring.

      DFS(disease free survival rate) and OS(overall survival rate) curves will be calculated using
      the Kaplan-Meier, life-table method. Comparison of the survival curve for the two groups will
      be performed using the log-rank test.
