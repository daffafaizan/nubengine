      morbidity of COVID-19 patients in decreasing the course of the disease and viral load in
      symptomatic stable positive swab COVID-19 patients. investigators are hypothesizing that due
      to the antiviral properties of this drug it will help as a treatment for the COVID -19
      patients. In improving their condition and clearing the virus load, investigators are testing
      two groups the one that will take the drug and then compare them to a placebo group that will
      not take any drug for the treatment in a blinded fashion made by randomization done by our
      pharmacy team so investigators eliminate risk of bias. Our expectation is to find a total
      reduction of the hospital stay to 7 days instead of 14 days currently indicating the
      effectiveness of the medication in eradicating the virus.
