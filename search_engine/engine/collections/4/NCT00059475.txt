    
      Human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)*0201 positive patients at high risk for recurrence of
      melanoma, or completely resected metastatic melanoma will receive immunization with peptides
      representing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted T cell epitopes of the melanoma antigen
      recognized by T-cells (MART-1) or glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma antigens emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 or Montanide trademark(TM) ISA 51 vegetable grade (VG). Patients will be
      randomized to receive one of three different melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1)
      peptides or to receive a combination of a melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1)
      peptide plus a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide. This study is designed to evaluate the
      immunologic effects of the different peptide immunizations.
