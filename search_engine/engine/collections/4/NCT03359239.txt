    
      This is a single arm, proof-of-concept study. Fifteen subjects with urothelial cancer
      interested in participation will sign a "tissue acquisition and vaccine preparation consent"
      after which tumor tissue will be obtained from either a surgical resection specimen or
      biopsy. Subjects are scheduled to undergo cystectomy or nephroureterectomy for invasive
      urothelial cancer may consent prior to, or within 6 weeks after, surgery. The tumor specimen
      will be submitted for genomic sequencing followed by neoantigen identification utilizing a
      computational pipeline. Peptides corresponding to these neoantigens will be prepared for the
      personalized vaccine product. Subjects eligible for the treatment phase of the protocol
      (i.e., after surgery in adjuvant patients and chemotherapy in metastatic patients) will
      receive atezolizumab every 3 weeks plus up to ten doses of PGV001 vaccination plus Poly-ICLC.
      The primary objectives will be to determine the feasibility and safety of administration of a
      personalized neoantigen-based vaccine (PGV001) plus atezolizumab in subjects with locally
      advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.
