    
      Map3 is an allogeneic bone matrix which also contains demineralized cortical cancellous bone
      and multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC). MAPC-based cells are derived from allograft
      bone marrow, isolated from other cells and cryopreserved. Both the scaffold and cellular
      constituents are processed from the same donor but are provided in separate containers.
      Scaffold and cells combined constitute the implant and must be used together. The map3
      implant is available in Strips allograft and Chips allograft configurations.
