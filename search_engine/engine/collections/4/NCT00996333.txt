    
      This Phase II multicenter study is designed to determine the response rate to a biochemically
      synergistic regimen with Gemzar, Taxotere, and Xeloda in patients with Stage IVB metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. It will further determine the overall and one year survival rates, the
      diseasefree interval, and the toxicities for this regimen in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.
