      performed. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: those patients receiving the multivitamin
      supplement (Multicentrum, Pfizer, 1 tablet/day) during 3 months (Group 1), and those
      receiving the supplement during 12 months (Group 2). Laboratory data were recorded: vitamins
      (D, B12 and folic acid) and oligoelements (calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc) at
      3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
