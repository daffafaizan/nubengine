      double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. STAREE is investigating whether statins can
      prolong good health and maintain independence amongst older people and is enrolling men and
      women 70 years of age and over who are free from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and
      dementia. STAREE-HEART will recruit a subset of 1000 STAREE participants before they are
      randomised to STAREE study drug. STAREE-HEART will involve an additional suite of cardiac
      assessments in these participants and will provide detailed information about the clinical
      effect of statins on incidence of atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
