      indirectly improves insulin secretion in beta cells via vasoconstriction and reduced islet
      blood flow. Chronic exposure to high glucose or high fat increases expression of AT1R
      (angiotensin type 1 receptor), leading to reactive oxidative stresses, inflammation, and
      apoptosis in beta cells, finally decreased insulin formation and secretion. Some studies
      showed the beneficial effect of blocking AT1R on insulin secretion and beta cell
      proliferation in animal models using angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Furthermore, 26
      weeks of valsartan treatment improved insulin secretion in humans with impaired glucose
      regulation.
