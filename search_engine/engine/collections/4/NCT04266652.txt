      allocated to parallel groups receiving either 1) healthy autogenous tooth roots (e.g.
      retained wisdom or impacted teeth or 2) cortical autogenous bone blocks harvested from the
      retromolar area. After 26 weeks of submerged healing the horizontal bone gain were assessed
      both clinically and radiographically. A core biopsy was taken during the implant placement to
      assess the histology of the newly formed bone.
