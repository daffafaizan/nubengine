      often retrospective, or often limited to specific disease processes or specific extra renal
      therapy. The lack of large studies including different usual modalities in pediatrics limits
      any formal recommendation on use in relation to patient outcomes, including renal recovery
      and mortality. Some of the issues that need consideration are the choice of dialysis modality
      (including Intermittent Hemodialysis, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies, and Peritoneal
      Dialysis), the indications for and timing of dialysis intervention, the dose of dialysis and
      their effects on outcomes from acute kidney injury in children.

      This study will supply important data about pediatric acute extra renal replacement therapy,
      including the epidemiology of pediatric acute kidney injury leading to extra renal
      replacement therapy, the variety of the treatment modalities, and their effects on the course
      of the disease.
