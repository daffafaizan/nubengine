      eradication of this disease. Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes in
      the mosquito stage of Plasmodium falciparum, are the lead candidates for a malaria
      transmission blocking vaccine. Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M have each been
      conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with Alhydrogel . This
      dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in
      US adults and subsequently in Malian adults.

      A total of 260 subjects will be enrolled at sites in the US and Mali to receive escalating
      doses of Pfs25M- EPA/Alhydrogel , Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel , or simultaneous
      Pfs25MEPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel . Enrollment within each group will be
      staggered for additional safety, and subjects will only be enrolled into the simultaneous
      administration group once each individual dose has been administered and reviewed for safety.
      Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes
      will be local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
      Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA against recombinant
      Pfs25, Pfs230, and EPA, and B cell responses. Functional activity of the induced antibodies
      will be assessed by membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy
      and Infectious Diseases in the US.
