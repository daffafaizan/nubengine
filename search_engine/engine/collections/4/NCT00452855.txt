      Propofol is superior to inhalational anaesthetics as anaesthesia for patients at risk of post
      operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) as PONV is diminished. However, when remifentanil is
      used as adjuvant to sevoflurane, the total dose of the latter is reduced.

      Therefore, we wanted to investigate if sevoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia is similar to
      propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia with emphasis on nausea, vomiting and total PONV during 24
      hours.

      In the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the surgical ward nausea was scored on a
      visual analogue score. Vomiting was registered.
