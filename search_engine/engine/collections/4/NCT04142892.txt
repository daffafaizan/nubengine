      proliferative arrest in HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint is chosen based
      on reports which related the 2.7% Ki67 value (natural log of 1) both after a 15 days1 or 3-4
      months of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment with favorable breast cancer relapse free and
      overall survival2,3. Hence, this Ki67 cut-off (Complete Cell Cycle Arrest, or CCCA) has been
      consistently used in recent trials as an acceptable surrogate marker of clinical and
      biological efficacy, even though the achievement of a pathological complete response is very
      unusual in luminal tumors after preoperative endocrine therapy. Trials with biological
      endpoint, including the so-called window of opportunity trials such as the ONAWA study
      provide tumor tissue before and after a short course of a given therapy for biomarker
      analyses of response and resistance. The aim of these studies is to improve the
      investigator's understanding regarding the biologic effect of a given drug, in order to
      better define its target population early in its development without interfering with the
      standard treatment pattern of the patient.
