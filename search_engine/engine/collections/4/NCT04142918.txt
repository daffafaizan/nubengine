      affecting the orofacial region, following local nerve trauma, usually secondary to dental
      treatments (tooth avulsion, root canal treatmentsâ€¦.). It often presents as odontalgia of
      atypical presentation, unresponsive to conventional treatments. The diagnostic is often
      complex (and often is a diagnosis of elimination), leading to unnecessary iatrogenic dental
      treatments and insufficient pain relief.

      This study aims to explore potential new markers of PPTTN, based on a translational approach
      following previous preclinical work that showed the importance of the disruption of the
      blood-nerve barrier in generating post-traumatic neuropathic pain. Several markers of such
      disruption have been highlighted (such as Claudin-5, Patched-1 and Frizzled-7) that could be
      specifically downregulated in neuropathic pain conditions (as compared to inflammatory
      neuritis conditions). As such, these markers could be interesting biomarkers of neuropathic
      pain. This study aims to explore the presence (and absence) of such markers in healthy vs
      neuropathic patients respectively.

      The first part of the study investigates the technical feasibility of intra-epithelial nerve
      fiber staining in oral mucosa/gingiva specimens collected in healthy patients (undergoing
      routine oral surgery procedures) and the immunoreactivity/presence of such biomarkers in
      those specimens.
