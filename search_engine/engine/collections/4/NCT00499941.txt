      initiatives and promote the development of improved treatments and a cure for Alpha-1.
      Located at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, the Registry
      employs procedures that ensure the most stringent confidentiality of participants. The
      Registry operates under the direction of the Alpha-1 Foundation Board of Directors and is
      guided by an Advisory Committee comprised of leaders in the medical, ethical, scientific and
      Alpha communities. Individuals enrolled in the Registry have the ongoing opportunity to
      participate directly in clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches in addition to other
      research opportunities.
