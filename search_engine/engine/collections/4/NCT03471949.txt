      glucose tolerance test. The investigators have used information from a previous study of 60
      participants using Dexcom G4, CGM system. A non-randomized, days 1-7 blinded and days 8-14
      non-blinded CGM trial, the study was performed to evaluate the profile of blood glucose using
      CGM in the population with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All enrolled subjects
      with at least three time-points with evaluable values from CGM system and the reference
      capillary value obtained from HemoCue during the whole study period were included in the
      Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population
