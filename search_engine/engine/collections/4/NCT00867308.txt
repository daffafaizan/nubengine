    
      This is a single center open label phase II study of lenalidomide in IPSS Int-1 with
      increased blasts or hematologic needs with 5q31.1 deletions who have failed to respond to
      standard dose lenalidomide., IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs without
      5q31.1 deletions, and Int-2 and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with or
      without 5q31.1 deletions, regardless of whether they have received lenalidomide previously or
      not. Patients will receive two cycles of 15 mg daily lenalidomide (later amended to 50 mg
      daily lenalidomide) given on days 1-28 out of a 42 day cycle. Within each of the two cycles
      of lenalidomide, patients will be given up to three weeks with no drug treatment to recover.
      Patients who fail to respond after two cycles of treatment may receive two additional cycles
      if stable. Patients who develop clinical response may continue to receive drug until disease
      progression.
