      or abnormally activated in malignant tumors originating from the colon, breast, ovary,
      pancreas, and lung. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI), gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib
      have been for the treatment of cancer associated with EGFR gene mutation. In addition,
      monoclonal antibodies to EGFR, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, have been used as a
      chemotherapy for rectal cancer without ras gene mutation and advanced head and neck cancer.

      The incidence of cutaneous toxicity of EGFR inhibitors is reported to be 75-80%. Clinical
      features include acneform folliculitis, xerosis, paronychia, and itching. Of these, about 10%
      of patients with Grade 3 or greater have a detrimental effect on quality of life and
      adherence to treatment, resulting in impaired therapeutic results.

      There have been many attempts to prevent or treat such skin toxicity. However, there has been
      no scientifically proven treatment until now.

      There is a growing interest in the role of EGF emulsifiers in the treatment of skin adverse
      effects of EGFR inhibitors, as a result of studies that improve acne significantly compared
      to placebo.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of EGF cream in the
      treatment of skin adverse effects in patients with malignant tumors treated with EGFR
      inhibitor (TKI or monoclonal antibody).
