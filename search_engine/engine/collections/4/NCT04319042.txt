      Dental implants placed between 12 and 16 weeks after tooth loss are a well-documented
      treatment option. Placing the artificial tooth (implant crown) on the implant the same day
      (immediate loading) or approximately 4 weeks after implant placement (early loading) are also
      treatment options with good scientific documentation. Computer-assisted implant surgery
      (sCAIS) and modern implant materials/surfaces increase treatment predictability and success
      in this context.

      Clinical relevance

      The timing of implant placement post-extraction and subsequent implant loading cannot be
      separated in modern implant therapy any longer. At the "Sixth ITI Consensus Conference" in
      Amsterdam, it was concluded that the clinical evidence and documentation of early implant
      placement combined with immediate or early implant loading in partially edentulous patients
      is currently insufficiently documented. However, this treatment protocol seems to be widely
      applied in daily practice. The planned study is designed to provide evidence for the
      application of early implant placement with partial bone-healing and either an immediate or
      an early loading protocol.

      Hypothesis/Specific aims

      H0: "Early placed single tooth implants by means of static computer-assisted implant surgery
      (sCAIS) in mandibular first molar sites with immediately loaded provisionals, show a survival
      rate comparable to early placed implants with an early loading protocol." Secondary
      parameters to be evaluated will be the prosthetic survival/ success, patient-centered
      outcomes (PROs), clinical peri-implant conditions, bone-level changes, alteration of
      peri-implant soft-tissue dimensions and the accuracy of digital implant planning.
