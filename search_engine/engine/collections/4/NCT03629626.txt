      standard conventional perioperative care. The intervention arm will consist of a
      protocol-driven ERAS program. The investigators believe that this information will be very
      useful because although there is a national interest in creating ERAS protocols for
      gynecology, there currently is very little published on the subject. Investigators
      hypothesize that those patients randomized to the ERAS protocol will have shorter lengths of
      hospital stay and complications, without increasing readmission rates. The investigators
      would like to publish the investigators' results and protocol as a resource for other
      institutions to adopt.
