      ingredient of Kimchi and has been known to have antiinflammatory, anticoagulant and
      antiadhesive effects. As seaweeds are fermented in order to make Kimchi, it can encourage
      beneficial probiotics to grow and lead to preventing digestive problems such as constipation
      and diarrhea.

      In this trial, we are going to investigate the effect of combination of seaweeds and
      probiotics on intestinal function of healthy subject by evaluating intestinal microbiota. The
      trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-arm study. Forty patients with
      normal intestinal condition will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups consisting of
      Seaweed with real probiotics or Seaweed with placebo probiotics. The assigned treatments will
      last for 4 weeks and the follow-up period will be 2 weeks.

      Four weeks of administration of seaweeds and probiotics is expected to increase the amount of
      beneficial microbiota and reduce that of harmful microbiota in intestine. we will also use
      questionnaires such as K-GSRS (Korean Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale), WHOQOL (The
      World Health Organization Quality of Life) - BREF and Assessment of bowel function scores
      (frequency, consistency, ease of passage - based on Bristol stool scale) to assess the change
      of digestive symptoms and the quality of life.
