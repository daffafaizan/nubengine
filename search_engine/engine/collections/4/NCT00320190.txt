    
      Participants were randomized 2:1 to dasatinib or high-dose imatinib, respectively.
      Randomization was stratified by a suboptimal response, defined as a hematologic response less
      than a complete hematologic response after at least 3 months of monotherapy with 400-mg
      imatinib; a cytogenic response (CgR) less than a partial CgR (PCgR) after at least 6 months
      of monotherapy with 400-mg; a PCgR after at least 12 months of monotherapy with 400-mg
      imatinib; or less than a major molecular response with a complete CgR after at least 18
      months of monotherapy with 400-mg imatinib.

      Participants received either dasatinib or imatinib for 12 months or until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or study discontinuation. After 12
      months, who had a confirmed major molecular response and were still receiving dasatinib, 100
      mg, or imatinib, 800 mg, were eligible to extend treatment for an additional 12 months.
      Participants permanently discontinuing treatment before 12 months were considered treatment
      failures and withdrawn from the study.
