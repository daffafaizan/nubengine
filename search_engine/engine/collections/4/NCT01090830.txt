    
      This is a Phase Ib/II, single center, open label, dose-finding study to evaluate the use of
      Belinostat when given with standard of care chemotherapy in patients with untreated,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the Phase Ib portion, dose limiting toxicity
      evaluation will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Belinostat when
      given with fixed doses of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel(a BelCap-B regimen). Three
      dose levels of Belinostat are proposed (600mg/kg, 800mg/kg, 1000mg/kg). Determination of MTD
      will be the basis for establishing set dosing for the phase II component of the study.

      The phase II portion of the study includes further drug safety evaluation and a preliminary
      assessment of efficacy of Belinostat when used with specified induction and maintenance
      regimens. Response will be evaluated through the RECIST criteria. Additional analysis will be
      done to estimate the time to response, progression free survival, median survival, and
      overall survival (OS) in study participants to 2 years post-initiation of cycle 1.

      Based on a standard 3 x 3 statistical design, the phase Ib portion may accrue between 3 to 12
      participants. Phase II will have a minimum sample size of 10 and a maximum of 16 patients.
      Participants who complete the Phase I portion and are able to advance to Phase II, will be
      evaluable for the Phase II objectives.
