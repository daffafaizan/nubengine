    
      The primary objective of the present study is to verify the non-inferiority of once-monthly
      oral administration of NE-58095 DR tablets for 12 months to once-daily oral administration of
      NE-58095 IR 2.5 mg tablets for 12 months, in terms of efficacy in participants with
      involutional osteoporosis.

      Secondary objectives of the present study are as follows: to compare the safety of
      once-monthly oral administration of NE-58095 DR tablets for 12 months with the safety of
      once-daily oral administration of NE-58095 IR tablets (at 2.5 mg) for 12 months in
      participants with involutional osteoporosis at time of wakening.
