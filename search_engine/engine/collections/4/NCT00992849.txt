      adverse effects of this medication are discussed extensively with each patient. To further
      minimize systemic absorption, silicone punctual plugs are placed in the lower eyelids. One
      group of patients apply topical bevacizumab, 1.0%(10mg/ml), 4 times of day. The other group
      of patients received subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab(2.5mg/0.1ml) once. The patients
      are examined at 1day, 1week, 2weeks, 3weeks, and 1month, then monthly till the corneal
      neovascularization are gone or reduced to some degrees. Best-corrected visual acuity,
      slip-lamp examination, tonometry, external photography, pachymetry, specular microscopy (if
      possible), and systemic blood pressure are completed at all visits.
