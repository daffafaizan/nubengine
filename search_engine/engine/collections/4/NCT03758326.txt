      therapeutic and prognostic relevance. Developing a reliable and unbiased method to assess
      body image disturbance is imperative, as feature characteristics of eating disorders, such as
      anorexia nervosa, include the overestimation of body size and shape. Among the most essential
      features of the disorder, this inability to correctly judge one's own body image has been
      frequently linked to the maintenance of eating disorders. Moreover, persistent perceptual
      disturbance for one's visual appearance is one of the strong predictors of relapse in AN and
      bulimia nervosa.

      Body image disturbance can be conceptualized as having two main components: perceptual, and
      attitudinal/affective. These might be considered two distinct constructs, best measured
      independently. However, clinicians currently rely upon self-report questionnaires that
      evaluate aggregates of symptoms, perceptual experiences, behaviors, and thoughts linked to
      the disorder. Some scales selectively evaluate body image characteristics such as body
      dissatisfaction and body distortion. However, it is unclear to what degree each of these
      measures quantifies the specific components of perceptual experiences vs.
      attitudinal/affective aspects. This study aims to evaluate whether a new electronic
      instrument, here referred to as the 'Body App', which separates estimations of body shape and
      size from the attitudinal/affective component might result in closer approximations of the
      perceptual component of weight or shape disturbance, and facilitate the assessment of body
      image disturbance in eating disorders.
