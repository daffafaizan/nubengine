    
      The trial is a Phase I/II trial evaluating the effect of LOAd703 in patients with pancreatic
      cancer, biliary cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. LOAd703 is an oncolytic
      adenovirus serotype 5/35 encoding immunostimulatory transgenes: TMZ-CD40L and 41BBL. In Phase
      I, three doses (total viral load - 1x10e11, 5x10e11, 1x10e12 viral particles (VP)) of LOAd703
      will be tested as add-on to standard of care or immune-conditioning gemcitabine chemotherapy.
      8 treatments of LOAd703 will be delivered by image-guided intratumoral injection at the same
      time of chemotherapy. In Phase II stage of the study, patients will be treated at maximum
      tolerated dose/maximum tolerated study dose as defined in the Phase I stage. In both phases:
      tumor biopsies, blood samples and radiological imaging will be performed to evaluate safety,
      effect and mechanisms of action. Further, patients will be subjected to oral and rectal
      swabs, and urine sampling to determine virus shedding. The patients will be monitored for
      time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival.
