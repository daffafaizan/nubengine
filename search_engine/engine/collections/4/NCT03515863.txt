      thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). There is considerable evidence that both genetic and
      environmental factors are involved in the development of TAO. We conduct a study of 400
      Grave's patients, with or without TAO, and obtain the following data: genetic tests, ocular
      imaging and life style information. Genetic tests are obtained by collection of blood samples
      for DNA extraction, whole-genome sequencing, and identification of cellular biomarkers, using
      transcriptomics and mass cytometry. Ocular imaging data are collected from Orbit MRI
      examination. Life style data are collected using a standardized questionnaire.
