      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) by conventional mechanical lithotripsy, which means using a
      metal wire basket to capture the stone and crush it to make it easier to remove. This is
      successful in approximately 70% of patients, with the success rate inversely correlated to
      the size of the stone. Unsuccessful stone removal would require additional endoscopic,
      percutaneous or surgical interventions. Spyglass DS peroral cholangioscope-guided holmium:YAG
      laser/electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a recent alternate method for managing complicated bile
      duct stones. Also performed during ERCP, a thin flexible camera (called Spyglass DS peroral
      cholangioscope) is inserted into the bile duct to visualize the stone which can then be
      targeted by a laser beam for fragmentation (also known as laser lithotripsy). The smaller
      pieces are then removed. Direct comparisons of these procedures' efficacy however have not
      been performed.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Spyglass DS peroral
      cholangioscope-guided holmium:YAG laser/electrohydraulic lithotripsy (the laser arm) versus
      conventional basket mechanical lithotripsy alone (the conventional arm) for fragmentation and
      clearance of complicated bile duct stones.
