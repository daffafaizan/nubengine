    
      This is a prospective, randomized-controlled study where patients with qualifying partial
      edentulism received a short fixed bridge restoration. Each implant site was randomized to
      receive either the test (Osseotite Certain Prevail) or the control non lateralized version of
      the Osseotite Certain implant. All implants were placed in a single-stage manner with
      temporary provisionalization taking place two months after implant placement. Enrollment
      continued until 10 patients (approximately 30 implants) were treated at each participating
      study center.
