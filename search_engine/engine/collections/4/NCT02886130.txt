    
      Our study design will be a placebo controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study.
      Varsity male and female volleyball players (n=28) will each be asked to participate in both
      arms of the study, i.e. placebo and A-GPC (1000 mg/kg/day). The duration of each arm of the
      study will be 4 weeks separated by a 7-day washout period. The order of treatment (placebo or
      A-GPC) will be determined randomly. Athletes will be asked to maintain their training load
      during the duration of the experiment.
