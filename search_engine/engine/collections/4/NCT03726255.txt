      Compassionate-use Program allows the use of stem-cell therapy for patients with non-healing
      diseases, mostly complex fistula-in-ano, who do not meet criteria to be included in a
      clinical trial. Candidates had previously undergone multiple surgical interventions that had
      failed. The intervention consisted of surgery (with closure of the internal opening or a
      surgical flap performance), followed by stem cells injection. Three types of cells were used
      for implant: stromal vascular fraction, autologous expanded adipose-derived or allogenic
      adipose derived stem cells.

      Healing was evaluated at 6th month follow-up. Outcome was classified as partial response or
      healing. Relapse was evaluated 1 year later. Maximum follow up period was 48 months.
