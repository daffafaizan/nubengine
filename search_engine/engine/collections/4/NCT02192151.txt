           efficacy endpoint will be the pharmacokinetic properties after administered PHN131 such
           as the concentration of nalbuphine in plasma and pharmacokinetic parameters of PHN131
           analyzed from the concentration of nalbuphine in plasma. The bioavailability of PHN131
           will be calculated from the pharmacokinetic parameters of PHN131 and NubainÂ® injection.

        2. Safety evaluation:

      The safety evaluation will include the vital signs monitoring such as blood pressure, pulse
      rate, body temperature and respiratory rate in the treatment period.
