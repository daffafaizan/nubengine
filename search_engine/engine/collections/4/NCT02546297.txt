      than the diagnosis and treatment of either condition alone. According to the GOLDï¼Œthere are
      three treatments for patients with COPD in group C: ICS combined with LABA or LAMA alone or
      LABA combined with LAMA. However, it has not yet been demonstrated about which method is more
      effective for the patients with COPD in group C and bronchiectasis.

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, case-control trial. Patients are divided
      into three groups, one group inhaled with ICS and LABA (Symbicort), the second group inhaled
      with LAMA (Tiotropium Bromide) and the third group inhaled with LAMA(Tiotropium Bromide) and
      (Symbicort).The course of treatment is 12 months.

      The investigators will also assess other relevant outcomes, including the quality of life
      (QOL) score, pulmonary function test and the incidence of adverse event.
