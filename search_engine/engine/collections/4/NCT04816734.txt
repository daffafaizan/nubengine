      in need of parenteral nutrition, an assessment of the acquisition of both factual knowledge
      provided to parents in hospital, but also of the reasoning, decision-making, technical skills
      and parents attitudes seem necessary and essential before the child's return to his home in
      order to guarantee his safety.

      The department of gastroenterology, hepatology and pediatric nutrition of Necker-Enfants
      Malades hospital has developed an educational assessment system based on previous studies in
      this field. Composed of 4 tools, this plan allows a complete assessment with relevant
      educational decision fields of the set of skills that parents must master to cope with their
      child's illness on a daily basis, following their participation in the initial program of
      therapeutic education offered by the Necker hospital team.

      The aim of the study is to test this evaluation plan and assess its interest in the learning
      process of parents and then include it in the initial therapeutic education program for
      parents of children requiring parenteral nutrition of Necker-Enfants Malades hospital.
