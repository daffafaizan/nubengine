      strength training (resistance) exercise program for individuals receiving taxane-based
      chemotherapy for breast cancer on neuropathy, breast cancer-related symptoms, cold thermal
      sensation, vibratory sensation, gait & balance, upper and lower extremity muscle strength,
      and quality of life.

      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the effect size, feasibility and
      acceptability of a 12-week combination exercise program consisting of aerobic exercise
      (walking) and strength training for preventing or ameliorating the clinical manifestations
      and symptoms of CIPN in individuals with Stage I-IIIa non-metastatic breast cancer.
