    
      MVA-BN®-PRO is a candidate prostate cancer immunotherapy product comprised of a highly
      attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus, MVA-BN®, engineered to encode prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) and prostate acid phosphatase (PAP) proteins. The MVA-BN®-based vaccine
      provides innate and adaptive immune activating factors, and vaccination by this strategy will
      be evaluated for its capacity to help override self and tumor tolerance mechanisms.

      Previous work has shown PSA and PAP antigens to be immunogenic in humans when presented with
      immune stimulatory components. Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated promising activity
      of PSA-targeted vaccinia-based immunotherapy. Additionally, PAP-based cellular therapy
      immunization approaches, have shown promise in Phase III clinical trials and provided for
      enhanced survival. The strategy undertaken by BNIT is to combine both antigens in the MVA-BN®
      vector to enhance the immunogenic effect and to help mitigate development of tumor
      resistance.

      This trial examines three vaccination regimens of MVA-BN®-PRO:

      Vaccine is provided at (0.5cc/dose/1x10e8 TCID50)

        -  Cohort 1: 1 sc injection every 4 weeks x 3; retreated once at the same dose and
           schedule.

        -  Cohort 2: 2 sc injections every 4 weeks x 3; retreated once at the same dose and
           schedule.

        -  Cohort 3: 4 sc injections every 4 weeks x 3; retreated once at the same dose and
           schedule.

      These dose regimens are based on the current dose of MVA-BN® (1x10e8 TCID50 by sc injection)
      under development as a prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of smallpox, and on related
      clinical studies of MVA-nef-based vaccines (5x10e8 TCID50) for induction of heterologous
      immunity.
