    
      The specific aim of this clinical trial is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety
      outcomes of patients receiving Tissue-Engineered Endothelial keratoplasty (TE-EK) graft
      material generated from human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs) propagated in a
      regulatory-approved dual media approach. Post-operative follow-ups and visits will follow
      current EK protocols of Singapore National Eye Centre. Clinical assessments include
      postoperative visual acuity, intraocular pressure, keratometric astigmatism, spherical
      equivalent, endothelial cell density, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT),
      contrast sensitivity, as well as any postoperative complications such as graft dislocation or
      primary graft failure.
