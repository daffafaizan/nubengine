      modified toxicity probability interval method. AbGn-168H will be administered intravenously
      (IV) once weekly for four weeks, in patients with steroid refractory aGVHD following
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up for 90 days.The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety, and
      the secondary objectives of this study are to determine if there is an improvement in disease
      response at 3 months after diagnosis of steroid refractory aGVHD compared to historical
      cohorts and to determine the changes in frequency and/or phenotype of aGVHD-associated T cell
      clones in response to AbGn-168H therapy.
