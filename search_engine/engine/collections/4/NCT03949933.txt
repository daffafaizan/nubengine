      carbon ion as a boost dose to gross tumor volume (GTV) escalated from 12GyE to 18GyE with
      3GyE per fraction in 3 dose levels. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE
      grade 3 or higher of non-hematological toxicity (G3). The acute and late toxicities, overall
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and
      distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were the endpoints.
