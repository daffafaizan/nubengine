      hypothesize that administration of tenofovir 150 mg once daily to HIV-infected Thai adults
      with moderate renal function impairment (CLcr between 30 to <50 mL/min) will provide
      comparable drug exposure to the current recommended dose of 300 mg every 48 hours.

      Confirmed HIV-positive subjects receiving tenofovir (TDF) 300 mg, every 48 hours, as part of
      an NNRTI-based or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based HAART regimen will be proposed to
      participate.

      Subjects meeting the required criteria will be enrolled into one of 2 groups depending on
      their HAART regimen: .

      Group 1: Subjects receiving tenofovir 300 mg, every 48 hours, in combination with lamivudine
      and an NNRTI,and a confirmed CLcr 30 to <50 mL/min

      Group 2: Subjects receiving tenofovir 300 mg, every 48 hours, in combination with lamivudine
      and lopinavir/ritonavir, and a confirmed CLcr 30 to <50 mL/min

      The study procedures are identical for both groups. All subjects enrolled will have two study
      visits. At the first visit, a 48-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed.
      Immediately following completion of the PK sampling, the tenofovir dose will be changed to
      150 mg, once daily. Two weeks later, at the second visit, a 24-hour pharmacokinetic
      evaluation will be performed. Following completion of the second PK sampling the tenofovir
      dose will be changed back to 300 mg every 48 hours. At this time the subjects has reach the
      end of the study.
