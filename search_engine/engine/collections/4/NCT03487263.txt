    
      The objectives of this study are to determine:

        -  The safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of IC14 in patients with motor neurone
           disease (MND).

        -  The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IC14 in patients with MND.

        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional
           Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) in patients with MND.

        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on forced vital capacity (FVC) and other clinical markers
           of disease severity in patients with MND.

        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on patient-reported outcome measures.

        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on disease biomarkers.

      Ten patients with MND will be sequentially assigned to receive one of two dose regimens of
      IC14 in an unblinded manner:

        -  For the initial 3 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 2 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 1 mg/kg
           once daily on Study Days 3-5 for 4 total doses.

        -  For the subsequent 7 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 2 mg/kg
           once daily on Study Days 2-4 for 4 total doses.

      Study participation will continue until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
