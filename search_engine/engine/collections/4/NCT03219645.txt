      blinded-endpoint trial (a PROBE design concerning clinical trial). A total of approximately
      40 patients (18 years≤Age≤ 80 years) with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS < 12), who can be
      treated within 72 hours of symptom onset will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups
      after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive a Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone
      Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14（the injection must be added slowly
      into 0.9% sodium chloride injection diluted to 250 ml , intravenous drip for about 2 hours）,
      combined with Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) given in a total dose of 300 mg on the first
      day, followed by 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 14. 2) the other group will receive a 300
      mg loading dose of Aspirin on the day of randomization, followed by Aspirin 100 mg once/day
      from Day 2 to Day 14. The primary objective is to assess the anti-platelet effects of Ginkgo
      Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection combined with Aspirin versus Aspirin alone in patients
      with acute ischemic stroke. The study consists of 4 visits including the day of
      randomization, 24 hours after the first anti-platelet agents,Day 14±2days and Day 90±7days.
      The antiplatelet effects will be analyzed in total subjects. The trial is anticipated to
      complete in 6 months from the first subject recruitment , with 40 subjects recruited. A Data
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial
      has been approved by IRB(Institutional Review Board) /EC(Ethics Committee) in Renji
      hospital，Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine.
