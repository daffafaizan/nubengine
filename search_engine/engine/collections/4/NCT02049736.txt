      decades, partly because of the increasing prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
      elderly individuals in most countries. In southeast Asia, chronic viral hepatitis due to
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) also poses significant morbidity and mortality [2]. Chronic HBV
      infection can cause chronic glomerulonephritis and CKD. More importantly, patients with CKD,
      irrespective to the underlying renal diagnosis, who acquire HBV infection have higher
      morbidity and mortality rates, and the management of chronic HBV infections among CKD
      patients with antiviral agents is associated with a high risk of adverse effects. The optimal
      management of CKD associated with chronic HBV infection is not well defined because of
      insufficient data from clinical trials.

      Telbivudine (Sebivo®; Tyzeka®) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue that inhibits replication
      of HBV. Telbivudine is a potent antiviral that provides effective and sustained viral
      suppression in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B infection, and is used in the
      treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis B with evidence of viral replication and
      persistently elevated serum transaminase levels, or histological evidence of active disease.
      Unlike most of the other nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, renal toxicity of telbivudine
      is uncommon, and dose adjustment is only necessary for patients with moderate to severe renal
      impairment. Recent data further suggest that telbivudine treatment may have a beneficial
      effect on renal function.
