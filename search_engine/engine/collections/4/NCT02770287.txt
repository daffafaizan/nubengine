    
      This is a single-center, open-label, prospective study. Ten (10) subjects that meet the
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled from the site's pool of patients. Subjects should be a
      female at the age of 25-65, and have a suitable treatment area (e.g. skin irregularities
      and/or unwanted skin laxity in the Mons pubis, Introitus and/or Labia area).

      Subjects will receive three treatments with the study device, at four week intervals,
      followed by one month follow-up visits after the last treatment.
