      about 20% of Americans. Upper endoscopy (EGD) is commonly used to diagnose and grade GERD
      based on mucosal breaks and erosions. It is now evident from multiple studies however that
      the majority of GERD patients (50-70%) have negative EGDs.These patients are refered to as
      "Non Erosive Reflux Disease" (NERD) patients.Confocal Laser Microscopy (CLM) is a new
      endoscopic technique that offers the advantage of detecting histologic changes during real
      time endoscopy and thus can diagnose NERD. We thus propose to study the sensitivity and
      specificity of CLM in predicting NERD. We hypothesize that CLM can reliably diagnose NERD in
      the appropriate clinical setting based on intrapapillary capillary loop patterns. This will
      be a pilot study after which a randomized trial will evaluate the reversibility of these
      changes after PPI therapy as seen by CLM
