      locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma undergoing local
      regional radiotherapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of gadolinium texaphyrin with
      concurrent radiotherapy in these patients. III. Correlate estimates of tumor and normal organ
      gadolinium texaphyrin uptake and retention over time by MRI with plasma/serum levels in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 5-10
      minutes 4 times weekly at least 2 hours prior to external beam radiotherapy over 2.5 weeks
      (total of 10 fractions). Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of
      gadolinium texaphyrin. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose level in
      which dose limiting toxicity occurs in no more than 2 of 6 patients. Patients are followed
      once monthly for 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within
      18-24 months.
