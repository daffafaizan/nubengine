      who have had a cardiac event, such as a heart attack, only 5% of eligible patients complete
      this program. Some of the reasons cited include limited facility access, travel time and
      cost.

      We are testing the hypothesis that cardiac rehab compliance will be greater if patients are
      offered the opportunity, and associated technology, to perform cardiac rehab anywhere.
