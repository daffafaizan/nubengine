      has been reported to be in the range of 2.7 to 4%. The mortality in patients in all age
      groups and GCS scores undergoing surgery for evacuation of EDH is approximately 10%.

      Most people with EDH are generally expected to have a good clinical outcome with the prompt
      and correct treatment. However, AEDH still represents a potentially life-threatening
      condition when a local mass effect exists due to rapidly elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)
      resulted from the rapid build-up of blood. Brain hernia and cerebral infarction might occur
      and lead to a terrible clinical outcome. In addition, there is a set of patients who
      experience clinical deterioration after an initial hematoma-evacuation craniotomy because of
      secondary brain injuries, including massive cerebral infarction (MCI), additional
      decompressive craniectomy is recommended as soon as possible.

      Although DC can reduce the morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients with a sTBI,
      the removal of the bone flap is not necessary for the majority of patients with AEDH, because
      of the relatively low incidence of MCI secondary to AEDH. Recommendations indicated an
      epidural hematoma greater than 30 ml should be surgically evacuated regardless of the
      patient's GCS score. Although craniotomy provides a complete evacuation to remove the clot of
      the hematoma, there are insufficient data to support a specific surgical treatment method.
      The choice of operative technique is influenced by the surgeon's expertise, training, and
      evaluation of a particular situation. Therefore, there is a clinical rationale for
      investigating the current status of surgical treatments and prognosis for AEDH, thereby
      providing a reliable reference for the optimization of therapy.
