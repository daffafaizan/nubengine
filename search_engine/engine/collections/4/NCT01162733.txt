      recommendations for intravenous (IV) vancomycin. These new recommendations suggest
      administering an initial dose of 25-30 mg/kg of vancomycin as opposed to 10-15 mg/kg which is
      more traditionally done. Currently in the Emergency Department (ED) some practitioners are
      using the new IDSA dosing recommendations for vancomycin, while other practitioners have not
      changed their clinical practice. There is currently little data available to suggest that
      implementing these new vancomycin dosing regimens in the ED will achieve therapeutic
      vancomycin levels more rapidly than our traditional dosing practice.
