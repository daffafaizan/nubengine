      treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Multiple clinical trials in both children and adults
      have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of autism with medications like Aripiprazole.
      This study aims at assessing the effect of aripiprazole vs. placebo treatment on symptoms of
      irritability and aggression associated with autism, as well as the effect on the global
      severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder. Children or adolescent outpatients, with
      age ranges from 5-17, will be enrolled into an 8-week placebo controlled, double blind
      treatment study. During the 8 weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist.
      Study assessments will be administered at designated time points.
