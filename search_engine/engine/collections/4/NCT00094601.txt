      population. PD is characterized primarily by motor impairment, but cognitive impairment is
      common and dementia may occur in about 30% of patients. The pathological hallmark of PD is
      the selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and the appearance of
      intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy Bodies. Dopaminergic dysfunction has been widely
      demonstrated in PD patients. Reductions in [18F]FDOPA uptake has been consistently observed
      in PD, although it remains to be established whether there are relative differences between
      PD with and without dementia, and its association with cognitive function. Furthermore, data
      relating to dopamine D1 receptors in PD are limited to post mortem studies and imaging with
      the D1 tracer [11C]SCH 23390, and little is known about the role of D1 receptors in vivo and
      how it relates to clinical phenomena. The aim of the current study is to assess the
      feasibility and usefulness of imaging of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine terminal
      function in vivo, using PET (positron emission tomography) in patients with PD, with and
      without dementia, and to assess changes in presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic markers
      in PD. The long-term goal of the present study is to further our understanding of the role of
      the dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of PD and its relationship with cognitive and
      motor deficits of PD. Knowledge gained from the present study may assist in the development
      of novel therapeutic targets for PD.
