      among melanoma survivors and their families. The first objective is to compare patient and
      familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity before and after a patient's diagnosis
      with primary cutaneous melanoma less than 4.0 mm in depth. It is believed that the diagnosis
      will positively affect behavior regarding skin cancer prevention as the diagnosis of melanoma
      makes the risk associated with sun-exposure and skin cancer a tangible issue. The second
      objective is to test whether receiving a "Melanoma Survivor" plaque and posting it in a
      melanoma survivor's bathroom will significantly affect the survivor's and broader family's
      sun exposure and cancer screening activity. Marketing research has shown similar techniques
      have been effective in causing individuals to consume goods (e.g. getting free pens with
      company logos makes you more likely to buy goods from that company), and the investigators
      think such techniques are transferable into the field of public health.
