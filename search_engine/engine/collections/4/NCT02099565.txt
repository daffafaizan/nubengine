      study based on the data collected during one visit: 4-year after PCI performed at the Russian
      Cardiological Research Center (РКНПК). From the date of the study start and until the end of
      the study investigators will enroll those patients participated in OPTIMA study. Only
      patients, who consent to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form after
      being informed by a physician on the objectives and methods of the study, will be enrolled
      into this project.

      This study is an observational one, and there is no intervention into routine clinical
      practice either in terms of therapy, or special examinations. The main point of this project
      is the data collection using the out-patient medical records or disease history of a patient,
      as well as collection of data received during patient routine examination. Data collection
      will be performed only once during single routine patient visit to treating physician or
      hospitalized patient examination. Study participation will be finished after this visit. Data
      collection will be performed at the visit 4 years after PCI and will include medical history,
      current medications, physical examination, ECG (electrocardiogram) and laboratory
      assessments.

      The study will be conducted in Russian Federation. It is planned that 80-90% of patients
      participated in OPTIMA study will be enrolled into current project. One clinical site -
      Russian Cardiological Research Center (РКНПК) - is supposed to participate in this study.

      The total period of the study is anticipated to be about 18 months.
