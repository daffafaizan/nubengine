      NSCLC patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, which usually requires
      treatment beyond standard first-line chemotherapy. Until recently, patients were limited in
      the number of options available for second-line treatment of NSCLC. In 2004, erlotinib was
      approved by the FDA for second and third-line treatment of NSCLC. Erlotinib is a cancer
      chemotherapy medication that slows the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body.

      Recent research suggests that a medication called Digoxin can sensitize cancer cells to
      respond better to chemotherapy. Digoxin is normally used to treat certain heart conditions by
      helping the heart beat more strongly and regularly and is not approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of NSCLC. Investigators hope that subject response rates to standard erlotinib
      therapy will be significantly improved by the addition of Digoxin.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the tumor response rate and overall survival of
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with a daily regimen of erlotinib (Tarceva)
      plus Digoxin.
