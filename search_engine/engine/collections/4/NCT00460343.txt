      is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although hypertension treatment has
      improved in the last decade, the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy still needs
      attention. Adherence to medication appears to play an important role in that.

      Pharmacists can support the general practitioners in their efforts to optimize
      antihypertensive therapy, by establishing adherence to medication of patients with
      hypertension in spite of the use of one or more antihypertensive drugs. This is performed
      with the electronic Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®). Registered adherence and
      accompanying blood pressure are discussed with the patient by the GP.

      Implementation of the above-mentioned intervention is studied in two randomized groups of
      pharmacies. One group receives minimal support in the intervention, the other group also
      receives interactive educational meetings, reminders and feedback, and support of
      multiprofessional cooperation.
