      candesartan cilexetil in the new anti-hypertensive treatment environment where angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB) combination drugs have become commercially available. The surveillance
      also investigated the background factors of patients continuing treatment with candesartan
      cilexetil and patients who switched from candesartan cilexetil to ARB combination drugs, as
      well as changes in parameters such as blood pressure.

      The usual adult dosage of Candesartan cilexetil is 4 to 8 mg, administered orally, once
      daily. Meanwhile, treatment was to be started at 2 mg once daily in patients with renal
      impairment and the dose could be increased up to 8 mg as necessary.
