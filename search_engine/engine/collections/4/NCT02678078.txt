      cancer tumor is placed inside a 3D hydrogel. This material has similar properties to the
      human tissue and can visualize cell migration and proliferation. In this system, the
      investigators have already characterised human metastatic cells obtained from nude mice
      tumors. The diagnostic assay is able to evaluate the reduction in cell growth associated with
      anti-cancer drug therapy. The next step is to test the in vitro diagnostic system using human
      tissue samples from human patients, and to validate the system as a simple and effective a
      priori diagnostic tool for characterizing patient tumours.
