      retinopathy1,2.

      Laser photocoagulation is the standard of care treatment for diabetic macular edema, based on
      ETDRS and recent clinical trials findings3,4. However, because visual acuity improvement
      post-laser is observed infrequently, and because of the frequent recurrence or persistence of
      DME (refractory DME) after appropriate laser treatment, particularly in eyes presenting with
      angiographically diffuse macular edema5-9, there is a need for alternative treatments for the
      management of DME. In addition, for some patients with significant cataract, precise
      visualization of posterior pole structures may not be possible, so that pharmacological
      therapy with intravitreal agents may be preferable over laser treatment.

      Recent studies have shown promising results of pharmacological therapies for Diabetic macular
      edema. Triamcinolone has shown similar results when compared to ranibizumab and deferred
      focal/grid LASER in pseudophakic eyes (DRCRnet, prompt versus deferred). Ranibizumab
      associated with deferred LASER or as monotherapy has also shown promising results (RISE and
      RIDE). However, there are several concerns regarding long-term intravitreal injections
      therapies that include economic feasibility for the public health system, risk of
      endophthalmitis and patient acceptability. For these reasons, the present study decided to
      check associations between LASER and drug therapy, in an attempt to improve focal/grid laser
      outcomes with reduced number of intravitreal injections.
