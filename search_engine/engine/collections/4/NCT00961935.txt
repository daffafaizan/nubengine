    
      Children between the ages of 7 and 17 years old, with a diagnosis of Bipolar I, Bipolar II,
      or Bipolar NOS, are currently being recruited for this study looking at similarities and
      differences in how the brain works between bipolar disorder and attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study involves a comprehensive evaluation at intake,
      cognitive assessment, EEG, and functional MRI, done over the course of 2 or 3 visits. This
      study does not provide treatment. However, with participants' consent, the assessment
      information can be shared with the child's clinician or psychiatrist and a letter with the
      results from cognitive testing can be prepared, which can be useful in school planning.
      Referrals for treatment can also be provided.
