      when administered as a single agent. Approximately 21 to 30 patients with advanced solid
      tumors will be enrolled. At the time of this amendment, 12 patients have been enrolled in the
      monotherapy cohorts with dose levels of 0.3, 1, and 1.5 mg DSP-0509 given once per week and
      completed the DLT period. Based on review of DLTs and consistent with the BLRM model, the
      Safety Review Committee has assessed that continuing at the 1.5 mg dose level is appropriate.
      Under Protocol Amendment 4, the dose level of 1.5 mg given every two weeks will be applied in
      Monotherapy Part A. Enrollment of additional cohorts will be based on the dose escalation
      procedures.

      The primary objective of Combination Part B is to determine the RP2D of DSP-0509 when
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab, using a BLRM approach as described above. The
      combination arm will enroll approximately 21 to 30 patients with advanced solid tumors that
      are (a) metastatic or unresectable and recurrent, and/or refractory to available therapy, (b)
      a condition for which pembrolizumab is an approved treatment, and (c) the patients have shown
      either primary or acquired resistance to an ICI. Under protocol amendment 4, DSP-0509 will be
      administered on Day 1 and then every 2 weeks thereafter. Pembrolizumab will be initiated on
      Day 8 and administered using the dose and schedule described (200 mg IV every 3 weeks).

      To maximize patient safety, enrollment in the first combination escalation cohort will begin
      at dose level of 0.3 mg DSP-0509 after safety and tolerability of DSP-0509 monotherapy has
      been confirmed at least 1 dose level higher.
