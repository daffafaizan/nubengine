      half-life, and a favorable safety profile, and is therefore the LA of choice for continuous
      IV administration, it has analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are induced by
      reduction of cytokines production through inhibition of neutrophil activation, and the
      analgesia may persist even after plasma concentration reduction. It can blunt the pressor
      response to endotracheal intubation also systemic lidocaine was effective in producing
      controlled hypotension.
