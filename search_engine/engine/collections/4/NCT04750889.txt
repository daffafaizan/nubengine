      non-randomized and category 3 comparative study. The RFID trial focuses on breast
      localization in patients with non-palpable breast cancers. These patients will benefit from a
      mastology consultation: consent will then be acquired. The RFID tag or the gold standard
      localization will be put in place during this consultation (one day before surgery).

      Patients will fill in their questionnaire in two steps:

        -  during the installation of the device (RFID tag or wire localization) to evaluate the
           patient's pain,

        -  then at the 1-month post-operative consultation to assess pain in the interval until
           surgery Radiologists and surgeons will fill out the questionnaire dedicated to them
           after each procedure.
