      the prostate for curative treatment of prostate cancer. Amifostine is a radioprotector, an
      agent that reduces tissue damage incurred by ionizing radiation. It has been well studied in
      humans and is approved for intravenous use. Rectal administration results in a preferential
      accumulation of Amifostine in the rectal mucosa, and neither free parent compound nor free
      active metabolite have been detected in systemic circulation. This trial proposes to observe
      the rate of early and late bowel toxicity in a group of patients with prostate cancer
      receiving standard high dose, 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy and concurrent
      intra-rectal applications of Amifostine. Primary measures of rectal toxicity (RTOG radiation
      morbidity scoring) will also be compared with self-assessment measures of quality of life,
      and rectal radiation dose as assessed by dose-volume histograms.
