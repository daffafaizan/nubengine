      standardized surgical procedure, conducted under local anesthesia, the participants are
      instructed to take three lozenges daily (one in the morning, one at lunch time and one in the
      evening) containing either two strains of L. reuteri (DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289; >108 CFU
      per lozenge) or placebo for 2 weeks. The subjects are instructed to let the tablet slowly
      melt in the oral cavity and to fill in a personal log-book on a daily basis throughout the
      postoperative period. The patients are recalled to the clinic for follow-up after 1, 2 and 3
      weeks for examination. The post-surgical events (pain, swelling, discomfort, feeding
      problems) are registered daily by the patient in a custom-made logbook. Furthermore, the type
      and frequency of painkillers and antibiotic prescriptions are noted in the logbook. At the
      follow-ups, the healing of the wounds/lesions is scored with a clinical healing index.
      Stimulated saliva samples are collected at baseline and after 2 weeks and kept frozen until
      further analysis. In addition, smear samples are collected after 1 and 2 weeks from the
      extraction socket for bacterial analysis. Any subjectively perceived side- or adverse effect
      in connection with the intervention should be reported to the surgeon. The participants are
      encouraged to maintain their normal tooth brushing habits.
