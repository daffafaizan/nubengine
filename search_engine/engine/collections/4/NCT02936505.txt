      To evaluate whether the use of a once-daily tacrolimus-dose regimen (Advagraf®), based on
      anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®) induction, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and
      corticosteroids, reduces the cumulative incidence of CLAD after de novo lung transplantation
      at 36 months, in comparison with a twice-daily cyclosporin-based protocol, otherwise
      identical between groups.
