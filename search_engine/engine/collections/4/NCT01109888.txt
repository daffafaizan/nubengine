    
      30 patients undergoing IVF using a GnRH antagonist protocol that present with a high response
      to gonadotrophin stimulation, will be randomized into one of two groups: group A - withdrawal
      of gonadotrophin support and continue a daily dose of 0.25 mg of the GnRH antagonist. group B
      - withdrawal of gonadotrophin support and continue a double daily dose of 0.5 mg of the GnRH
      antagonist.

      The main outcome measures will be the duration of coasting (days)and the rate of serum E2
      drop (%).
