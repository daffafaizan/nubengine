      affecting the heart at first, it is now recognized that disability is largely due to impaired
      cerebral and skeletal muscle blood flow and consequently microvascular oxygenation. Reduced
      muscle oxygenation compromises oxidative metabolism and thus contractile performance.
      Impaired cerebral oxygenation not only reduces motor output (thus exacerbating muscle
      fatigue) but also constitutes a predictor of cerebral ischemic events and an independent
      prognostic risk factor.

      Reduced levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) contribute to impaired blood flow and
      oxygenation in CHF. Development of new effective therapeutic strategies is therefore crucial
      given that current pharmacological treatment has failed to abrogate oxygenation deficits in
      CHF patients. Emerging evidence shows that nitrate serves as an alternative source for NO and
      improves muscle blood flow and oxygenation in health. Another striking feature of nitrate is
      that it can improve muscle work efficiency, a tenet of physiology that was once considered
      immutable.

      Objective: To investigate systematically the role of dietary nitrate supplementation on
      central and peripheral cardiovascular function in CHF patients.
