    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of placement of the
      esophageal HILZO Covered stent with the TTS method in patients with non-operable malignant
      obstruction of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction, extrinsic malignant compression, or
      recurrent malignant dysphagia after esophagectomy.

      Other (secondary) objects are to assess the effect of the stent on the presence of
      hyperplastic reaction after implantation, the functional complications and survival.
