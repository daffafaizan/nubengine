      brain function in nicotine users.

      Specific Primary Aims include:

      Aim # 1. To test change of cortical excitability during nicotine craving in cigarette smokers
      and explore the potential use of TMS in cigarette smokers.

      Aim # 2. Given the role of the prefrontal cortex (and connected regions) in craving, we will
      examine whether modulating prefrontal activity through rTMS will impact measures of craving
      and the reinforcing effects of nicotine.

      Design:

      The study was a randomized, blind, sham-controlled crossover study in which participants will
      involve two study visits. Participants will have an initial assessment about tobacco use
      habits and craving patterns. Participant will look at images related to and not related to
      cigarette smoking.

      Participants will receive two different types of brain stimulation with repetitive TMS (10
      Hz): sham rTMS and active rTMS over prefrontal cortex. Craving assessments will be performed
      before and after each stimulus experiment.

      Participants will be measured cortical excitability with TMS before and after each stimulus
      experiment.
