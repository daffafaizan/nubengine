      marrow is aspirated from the iliac crest (hip bone) of patients with osteochondral defects
      intraoperatively under complete sterile, aseptic conditions and under proper anaesthesia
      (general, local). The bone marrow aspirate is placed in tubes and transferred under aseptic
      conditions to the Tissue Culture Unit in the Biochemistry Department at the Cairo University
      School of Medicine where it is processed and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are isolated
      and grown in culture for 2-3 weeks. After this time interval, the cells are reprocessed and
      the cell pellet is obtained. Implantation of the cell pellet into the osteochondral defect of
      the joint after embedding it on a proper scaffold is performed followed by subsequent defect
      coverage with an autologous periosteal flap obtained from the proximal tibia to seal the
      defect and maintain the cell pellet in place. The patients will be assessed clinically with
      scoring systems preoperatively as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess relief of
      symptoms and joint function. Radiological assessment (X-rays and MRIs)of the affected joints
      will be performed at the same time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed
      cartilage. Second look arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess
      the repair tissue and grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International
      Cartilage Repair Society guidelines.
