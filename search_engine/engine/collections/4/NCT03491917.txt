    
      This clinical research is a retrospective, pilot, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study with
      an enriched sample of 100 breast screening or diagnostic cases which were selected from the
      library of mammograms collected under Fujifilm protocol FMSU2013-004A (all subjects
      previously provided written informed consent agreeing their image data and supporting
      documentation could be used for future research and investigations). Approximately 6
      qualified radiologists will independently perform two reads on all (approximately 100) cases.
      Each reader will read each case both as a FFDM (Full Field Digital Mammography) read, and a
      DBT (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) plus S-View (Synthesized View) read on the ASPIRE Bellus
      II workstation.
