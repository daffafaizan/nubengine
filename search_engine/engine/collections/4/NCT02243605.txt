    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib) for Ewing
      sarcomas, in terms of 6-month objectives response as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors, Revised (RECIST version [v]1.1).

      II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib for osteosarcoma, in terms of 6-month
      objective response (complete response, partial response) and 6-month non-progression
      (complete response, partial response and stable disease), as per RECIST v1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 6-month objective response. (Ewing sarcoma only) II. Best overall response (as per the
      revised RECIST v1.1). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) III. 1- and 2-year progression-free
      survival. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) IV. 1- and 2-year overall survival. (Ewing sarcoma
      and osteosarcoma) V. Cabozantinib safety. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VI. To assess the
      ability of metabolic tumor response as measured by fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) at the end of one cycle of treatment to predict progression-free survival
      (PFS). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VII. Translational research: to determine and compare
      tumor expression of MET, phosphorylated (phosphor)-MET and circulating levels of HGF, soluble
      MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (sVEGFR2) prior to and following
      administration of cabozantinib. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
