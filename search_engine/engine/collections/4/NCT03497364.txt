           People's Hospital of Jinan University. Study protocol was approval was by the Ethics
           Committee of ShenZhen People's Hospital of Jinan University, ShenZhen, China (Permit No.
           SZY-00251, Chairperson Prof. Xiaofang Yu) on 8 February 2017. Pregnant women who were
           scheduled for cesarean section were recruited. Written informed consents were obtained
           from all patients. Women with cardiovascular disease, fetal abnormalities, placental
           abruption, placenta previa, placental abnormalities, sidewall placenta, abnormal fetal
           heart rate and spinal anesthesia contraindications were excluded from the study.

        2. Sample Size Calculation: SBP < 90 mmHg or 70% of the baseline value is defined as
           hypotension; in the study by Langesaeter et al in Anesthesiology magazine, the incidence
           of hypotension was 20% with prophylactic phenylephrine, and we considered a ≤ 8%
           difference in the incidence of hypotension to be of clinical significance. Assuming a
           type I error protection of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the sample size for a
           non-inferiority test (margin Δ=0.08) was estimated using the normal approximation to the
           binomial distribution. Therefore, each group requires 310 subjects.

        3. Anesthesia: Women were randomly divided into three groups, Bupivacaine group,
           Ropivacaine group and Control group. After entering the operation room, patients were
           placed supine with left lateral tilt and blood pressure was measured three times at
           1-min intervals. The arithmetic average of the three measured values was regarded as the
           basal pressure of pregnant women. Next, electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry were also
           monitored. Supplementary oxygen was given through a facemask. Venipuncture was performed
           in the forearm vein. In Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine group, 500 ml Ringer's lactate was
           slow given for subjects before anesthesia without prehydration. In Control group, 1000
           ml hydroxyethylstarch (6%) was first infused for subjects in the ward, after that 500 ml
           Ringer's lactate was slow given for subjects before anesthesia.

           Then, with the subjects in left lateral position, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia
           was performed as follows: skin was infiltrated by lidocaine at the L3-4 or L4-5
           interspace; epidural puncture needle was slowly perpendicularly advanced until the tip
           passed through the ligamentum flavum and reached to epidural space, which was verified
           with the loss-of-resistance; then intrathecal injection was carried out by spinal needle
           of 25G, and the epidural catheter was inserted 4-6 cm. Subjects were then immediately
           recovered in supine with left lateral tilt. In Bupivacaine group, 0.5 % bupivacaine
           (0.75% bupivacaine (2 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml)) was injection. The dose of
           bupivacaine depended on height of subjects (1.7 ml for 173~174cm, 1.65 ml for 170~172cm,
           1.6 ml for 168~169cm, 1.55 ml for 165~167cm, 1.5 ml for 163~164cm, 1.45 ml for
           160~162cm, 1.4 ml for 158~159cm, 1.35 ml for 155~157cm, 1.3 ml for 153~154cm, 1.25 ml
           for 150~152cm, 1.2 ml for 148~149cm)，1.15 ml for 145~147cm). In Ropivacaine group, 0.5 %
           ropivacaine (1% ropivacaine (1.5 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1.5 ml)) was injection. The
           dose of ropivacaine depended on height of subjects (2.3 ml for 173~174cm, 2.2 ml for
           170~172cm, 2.1ml for 168~169cm, 2.0 ml for 165~167cm, 1.9 ml for 163~164cm, 1.8 ml for
           160~162cm, 1.7 ml for 158~159cm, 1.6 ml for 155~157cm, 1.5 ml for 153~154cm, 1.4 ml for
           150~152cm, 1.3 ml for 148~149cm, 1.2 ml for 145~147cm). In Control group, 2ml
           bupivacaine (0.75% bupivacaine (2 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml)) was injection for
           all subjects. Immediately after intrathecal injection, in control group, phenylephrine
           was introduced by continuous infusion pumps programmed for an infusion rate of 0.25
           ug.kg-1.min-1 to maintain systolic blood pressure at ≥ 90 mmHg or 70% -100 % of baseline
           value. In Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine group, no prophylactic phenylephrine was
           introduced For all subjects, when systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mmHg or 70%
           of baseline value. 100 ug phenylephrine was given and repeated every 1 min until the
           systolic blood pressure returned to normal. When heart rate was less than 60 beat/min.
           0.5-1mg atropine was given to maintain normal heart rate. Nausea and vomiting were
           treated with metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. Sensory block level after intrathecal injection
           was assessed with a 20G hypodermic needle (no sensation to pinprick). When the maximum
           sensory block height was lower than T8, epidural injection of 2% lidocaine (3ml/5min,
           total volume was less than 15 ml) was given or anesthetic technique was changed into
           general anesthesia.

        4. Data acquisition: After intrathecal injection, the blood pressure, heart rate,
           respiratory rate, SpO2 and fetal heart rate were recorded every 1 min until fetal
           delivery and then were recorded every 3 min until the end of surgery. The blood flow
           volume of uterine artery was monitored by ultrasound.

           The level of sensory block, defined as the loss of pin-prick sensation (20G hypodermic
           needle) at midclavicular level, was measured every 1 min until it reached the T8
           dermatome level and then every 10 min during surgery. The following variables were
           recorded: time to initial onset of analgesia, time for sensory block to reach the T8
           dermatome level, time for sensory block to reach maximum dermatome level, time to
           two-segment regression of analgesic level, and regression of analgesic level to the S2
           dermatome. Anesthesia was considered adequate for surgery if pain sensation was lost at
           the T8 level.

           Motor block was assessed every 1 min using the Bromage scale (0 = no motor block, 3 =
           complete motor block of lower limbs) until complete motor block and then every 30 min
           until the return of normal motor function. The times to complete motor block and
           complete recovery were recorded. The motor block score when the sensory block level
           reached T8 was also recorded.

           The time from anesthesia initiation to delivery, time from skin incision to delivery and
           time from uterus incision to delivery were recorded. The total dose of phenylephrine and
           total volume of fluid before delivery were recorded. After delivery, umbilical blood
           samples were taken for blood gas analysis. APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min were evaluated
           and recorded. In the intraoperative period, side-effects and requirement for sedation,
           epidural injection or general anesthesia were noted.

           Neurologic assessment (muscle force, muscle tone, sucking reflex, rooting reflex, moro
           reflex and grasp reflex) of the infant was carried out at 2h,4h,8h, 1d,2d,3d,4d and 7d
           after delivery. The quality of anaesthesia (judged by the anaesthetist), the quality of
           muscle relaxation (judged by the surgeon) and the degree of intraoperative comfort
           (judged by the patient) were recorded as excellent, good, fair or poor.

        5. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software
           package. All metering data were recorded as mean ± standard deviation and
           Independent-Samples T test or One-way ANOVA was used to compare the metering data.
           Chi-square test was used to compare the enumeration data. p<0.05 indicates that the
           differences have statistical significance.
