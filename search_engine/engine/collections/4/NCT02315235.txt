      treatments are glucose control and pain management. Diabetic neuropathy is characterized by
      reduction of vascularity in peripheral nerves and deficiency in neurotrophic and angiogenic
      factors. Recent studies have shown that bone marrow (BM)-derived stem or progenitor cells
      have favorable effects on the repair of cardiovascular diseases. Since these BM-derived stem
      or progenitor cells contain various angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, these cells have
      been attempted for treating experimental diabetic neuropathy, and turned out to be effective
      for reversing various manifestations of experimental diabetic neuropathy.

      However, stem-cell therapy was not proven in human study. Therefore, we will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of autologous peripheral blood stem cell injection in diabetic
      neuropathy.
