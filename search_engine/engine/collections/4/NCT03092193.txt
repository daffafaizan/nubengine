      absorption and metabolism of these NSAIDs with or without the gastric protectors, and may
      differ from anti-inflammatory action and side effects. In this proposal, 20 volunteers will
      be genotyped and phenotyped for these haplotypes of cytochrome P450. For analysis of the
      proposed genes, saliva will be collected as a source of genomic DNA. For molecular analysis
      will be performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are used produced and validated by
      Applied BiosystemsÂ®. For pharmacokinetics will be collected saliva samples at various times
      after ingestion of a tablet of naproxen (500 mg) or naproxen associated to esomeprazole (500
      + 20 mg), using mass spectrometry for analysis of drug concentrations in the samples. The
      results will be described with a 0.05 significance level.
