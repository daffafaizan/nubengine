      subjects (79 subjects in each arm) are planned. The control group will receive a traditional
      cardiac anesthetic using opioids, for which induction will include fentanyl and propofol. The
      experimental arm will receive an opioid free anesthetic with an induction bolus of
      dexmedetomidine and propofol. The investigators hypothesize that using the opioid free
      technique will be more hemodynamically stable within the first 10 minutes of induction.
