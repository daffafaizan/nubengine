      persons post-stroke: traditional locomotor training (partial body-weight support and manual
      assistance of therapists) vs. robotic-assisted locomotor training (partial body-weight
      support and robotic guidance with the Lokomat). We enrolled 16 persons with chronic (>6
      months) hemiparesis post-stroke who were randomized to traditional/manual or robotic
      locomotor training. All individuals received 12 sessions (thrice weekly for four weeks) of
      training. Each session involved 30 minutes of stepping.

      The complete study results are published.
