    
      Selected patients had chronic coronary artery disease which had been treated with
      percutaneous dilatation & stenting and/or aortocoronary bypass. The severity of myocardial
      ischemia had induced heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and preserved systolic
      function, and permanent AF.

      1 Inclusion criteria:

      Abnormal left ventricular relaxation with preserved (â‰¥52%) ejection fraction (LVEF).

      Patients either in sinus rhythm or with permanent atrial fibrillation.

      2. Exclusion criteria:

      Unstable angina pectoris.

      Reduced systolic cardiac function (LVEF<52%).

      Normal diastolic function.

      Diabetes requiring insulin.
