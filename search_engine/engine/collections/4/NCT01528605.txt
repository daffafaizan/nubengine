      impairment accompanying with senescence of macular. Given the fact in treatment, prevention
      strategy is thought to be an efficient and robust approach to diminish early AMD patients in
      low-income countries, however, feasible cocktail provision in most developing nations remain
      mysteries. Here we proposed an effective cocktail treatment with different amounts of lutein
      and zeaxanthin could increase the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and serum
      xanthophylls concentrations among randomized Chinese AMD patients; and might improve visual
      function measured by visual performance indices such as best-spectacle corrected visual
      acuity (BSCVA), contrast sensitivity (CSF), flash recovery time (FRT), multifocal
      electroretinogram (mfERG) and microperimetry.
