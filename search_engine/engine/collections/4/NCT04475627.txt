    
      -  This is a single-centre, randomised, cross-sectional, cross-over observational study.

        -  Twenty healthy volunteers, aged 18 years and over will be recruited and will undergo
           cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans for long axis and short axis cine imaging at
           1.5T and 3T.

        -  Participation will involve one single visit where participants will be consented,
           randomised and then undergo scanning at both field strengths; the order of scanning at
           1.5T and 3T will be randomised. There will be no follow up period.

        -  All subjects will undergo balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging at
           3T and 1.5T. Tagging images will also be acquired at both field strengths. Participants
           will also be randomized to either have cine or tagging images obtained first on each
           scan.

        -  All scans at both field strengths will be anonymised and analysed offline by a single
           experienced observer to determine inter-field strength agreement of left ventricular
           systolic and diastolic strain measurements.

        -  Further imaging analysis will take place for secondary outcomes, including analysis
           using other software vendors, tagging images and aortic cine images.
