    
      This is a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, single-center clinical trial between
      Interferon Alfa and Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b in childhood essential thrombocythemia (<18
      years).

      Patients will be divided into the following two treatment groups: 1. Recombinant Interferon
      Alpha, with an initial dose of 300 wu twice a week. Other interferons that have been listed
      can be used if Recombinant Interferon Alpha (300 wu) is not available, and the specific dose
      will be determined by the researchers; 2. Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b, with an initial dose
      of 135 ug once a week (body surface area < 1.73 m2) or 180 ug once a week ( body surface
      areaâ‰¥1.73 m2).

      The current drug therapies and possible risks of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b and Interferon
      Alfa in the treatment of childhood essential thrombocythemia will be fully introduced to the
      guardians of the children by the researchers. Then the children will be divided into one of
      the two groups according to the guardians' will.

      The dosage will be adjusted according to the results of laboratory examinations and patient
      tolerance. The patient will be transferred to the other group if intolerance occurs.
