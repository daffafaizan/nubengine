      individual to individual. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this variability
      are poorly understood and characterized. Studies suggest that certain traits observed in
      substance dependent individuals may actually precede drug use, and could augur future
      substance dependence. Understanding how the presence of these traits increases vulnerability
      to substance addiction could aid in the development of early intervention, preventative
      measures, as well as better treatment strategies.

      Objective: The primary goal of this protocol is to improve our understanding of increased
      susceptibility to developing substance addiction. We focus here on particular gene x
      environment interactions as increased risk factors for substance dependence. The emphasis is
      on monoaminergic neurotransmitter-related genes thought to influence adaptability to the
      environment, and, therefore, on cognitive domains related to dopamine and serotonin: reward
      and punishment learning, and impulse control. To achieve the above objective, the study will
      be implemented by using cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging testing in adult addicted
      individuals along with matched controls.

      Subject Population: We focus on adult (18-55 years old) smokers and matched non-smoking
      controls.

      Experimental Design: This study involves cognitive, pharmacological and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) testing in a between-subject design involving neuroimaging and
      cognitive testing.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be BOLD fMRI activation and behavioral
      performance on various cognitive tasks that deal with impulse control and reward learning, as
      a function of gene x environment interactions.
