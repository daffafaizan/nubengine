      t(16;16)(p13; q22), or t(8;21)(q22; q22) cytogenetic abnormalities.) undergone unmanipulated
      blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation who were minimal
      residual disease positive after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received interferon
      α-2b. The end points were safety and immunologic response. Following time is 12 months.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      *The feasibility and efficacy of administering of subcutaneous interferon α-2b in this
      patient population. [ Time Frame: 1 years ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      *The immunologic impact and clinical outcomes of subcutaneous interferon α-2b in patients
      after unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation [ Time Frame: 1 years ] Estimated
      Enrollment:81 Study Start Date: Jun 2014 Estimated Study Completion Date: Jun 2016

      Intervention Details Description:

      *Drug:Interferon α-2b (subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week) for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Acute leukemia patients who were MRD positive after day 60 post-transplantation receive
      interferon α-2b(subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week). Interferon
      α-2b continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving interferon α-2b. Physical
      exams and blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other
      week until the completion of 6 months therapy.

      Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 1-60 Years Genders Eligible for Study: Both Accepts
      Healthy Volunteers: No Criteria

      The trial will be terminated in following situation

        1. Severe toxicity occurrence

        2. Cumulative incidence of relapse increased) (≥ 30%)

        3. Cumulative incidence of mortality increased (≥ 30%)

        4. Cumulative incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease increased (≥ 30%)

        5. Although large enough sample had been enrolled, it did not reach statistical
           significance
