      maxillary premolar area, admitted to the Outpatient Clinic of Fixed Prosthodontics
      Department, Faculty of Oral and Dental medicine, Cairo University.

      After a period of healing of 6 months, an implant abutment of accurate diameter and
      angulation will be placed to fit precisely into the internal hex of the fixture after removal
      of the cover screw. The platform matched abutment will be then secured into its final
      position using the abutment screw. Alginate impression will be taken and poured into dental
      stone. Using the impression transfers, impressions with polyvinylsiloxane are taken. After
      taking the impressions, the Impression transfers are removed and fixed to the implant
      replica.

      Surgeons' assistants will be asked to open the sealed envelope containing the information
      regarding the crown placement. The impressions will be sent to dental laboratory with the
      result of the sealed envelope, for preparation of the future crowns, either vita enamic
      crowns or Ips e max crowns.
