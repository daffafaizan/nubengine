      palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis but is associated with compensatory hyperhidrosis. Low
      doses of Oxybutynin can be used to treat palmar hyperhidrosis with fewer side effects.

      Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and patient
      satisfaction with the use of oxybutynin at low doses comparing to placebo for treating palmar
      hyperhidrosis.

      Methods: This is a prospective, randomized and controlled study. From December 2010 to
      february 2011, 50 consecutive patients with palmar hyperhidrosis were treated with oxybutynin
      or placebo. Data were collected from 50 patients, and 5 (10,0%) patients were lost to
      follow-up. During the first week, patients received 2.5 mg of oxybutynin once a day in the
      evening. From the 8th to the 42nd day, they received 2.5 mg twice a day, and from the 43rd
      day to the end of the 12th week, they received 5 mg twice a day. All of the patients
      underwent 2 evaluations: before and after (12 weeks) the oxybutynin treatment, using a
      clinical questionnaire; and a clinical protocol for quality of life (QOL).
