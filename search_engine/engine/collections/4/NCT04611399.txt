      workers have been implemented, especially group or individual counseling sessions delivered
      face-to-face or using phones and video conferencing platforms. However, there are significant
      barriers to the delivery of such psychological initiatives. In this context, digital
      interventions to improve health services and care outcomes are recommended for implementing
      and providing remote psychological support.

      Virtual reality can play a relevant role in providing psychological care to healthcare
      workers facing COVID-19. New commercial head-mounted display have made virtual reality
      accessible even to the mass audience, breaking down the barriers in the diffusion and use of
      this technology. Thanks to this fact, virtual reality can now be autonomously used by people
      and offered to provide psychological assistance remotely.

      Within this context, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the efficacy
      of a virtual reality home-based program for diminishing stress and anxiety in a sample of
      Italian healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the objective is
      to compare the efficacy of this type of training with respect to the same program without
      virtual reality and a waiting list.
