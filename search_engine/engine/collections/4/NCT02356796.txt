      among women throughout the world. CPP is a complex condition, and the understanding of both
      etiology and effective treatment is limited. The newest/latest clinical guidelines recommend
      a holistic and multidisciplinary treatment approach to this condition.

      In accordance with the guidelines a multidisciplinary group based treatment for women with
      CPP has been started at the University Hospital of North Norway. The treatment is offered to
      patients who are considered to benefit from conservative treatment approach.

      Method: To investigate the effect of a group based treatment compared to standard
      conservative treatment by physiotherapists in primary or secondary health care, a randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted.

      Patients who are found eligible and consent to participate in the trial, will be randomized
      to one of the two treatment options. Data will be registered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after start of treatment.
