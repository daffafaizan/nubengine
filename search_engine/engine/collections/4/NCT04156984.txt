      patients started on golimumab for active ulcerative colitis. The current dosing regimen in
      European Union is based on patients' body weight as maintenance treatment for patients with â‰¥
      80 kg is 100 mg q4 weeks and for patients with <80 kg 50 mg q4 weeks. The investigators
      recent observations in a golimumab pharmacokinetics study of 24 patients however, show large
      interindividual variations in golimumab trough concentrations. Furthermore, it seems that
      patients with continuous response have higher golimumab trough levels at several time points
      during treatment compared to patients who lose response. Higher induction/maintenance dose of
      golimumab increases golimumab trough levels, therefore it is likely that higher
      induction/maintenance dose of golimumab would increase efficacy of golimumab treatment.
