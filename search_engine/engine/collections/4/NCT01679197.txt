      steatosis and on amelioration of pathological features of NASH/NAFLD. In addition, the study
      will evaluate the impact of leptin therapy on total body insulin sensitivity and lipid levels
      as well as energy expenditure. In order to accomplish this aim, we now propose an efficacy
      study with recombinant human leptin therapy in patients with all forms of lipodystrophy who
      also have NASH/NAFLD.

        1. AIM 1: To determine the efficacy of leptin in promoting amelioration of body
           composition, hepatic steatosis and histopathological scores in patients with all forms
           of lipodystrophy and NAFLD/NASH. We will conduct a 1 year, open-label study, to assess
           the metabolic effects of recombinant human leptin (METRELEPTIN, AztraZeneca, Wilmington,
           DE). The primary outcome measure will be NASH scores. We will also explore body weight,
           insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid control, body composition, and free fatty acid
           levels.

        2. AIM 2: To Investigate molecular effects of leptin therapy. In parallel to our
           preliminary studies, gene expression will be performed on individuals participating in
           Aim 1 at baseline and following 1 year of leptin. We will combine this with measures of
           liver metabolite levels to provide novel insights into alterations in metabolism that
           occur secondary to leptin therapy. We will also measure plasma metabolites at baseline
           and after 2 (optional), 24 and 48 weeks of therapy to assess the dynamic changes induced
           by leptin and correlate these changes with phenotypic measures.
