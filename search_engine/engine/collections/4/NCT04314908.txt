      pain after apical enlargement and sonic activation assisted irrigation procedures. Patients
      who have asymptomatic teeth required retreatment will include in this study and retreatment
      procedure will be applied to these teeth. One hundreds twenty asymptomatic teeth required
      retreatment will randomly participate into 4 treatment groups in terms of apical enlargement
      and sonic activation assisted irrigation procedure applied. The presence of postoperative
      pain will assess after 12, 24, 48, 72 hrs and 1 week. Postoperative pain will be recorded by
      each patient by using visual analogue pain scale. Before the treatments, the nature of the
      study, complications and associated risks will be totally explained and written informed
      consent will be obtained from all study participants. The local anesthetic will be applied
      before the treatment start. The routine retreatment procedure will be applied. Different
      final irrigation solutions will be applied in accordance to the manufacturers' instructions.
      At the end of treatment, each patient will be given an evaluation sheet, explained the
      treatment procedure and using of visual analogue pain scales, and informed to be returned
      during the following one week. After one week the teeth will be examined according to for
      pain intensity, percussion & palpation sensitivity, swelling, analgesic intake and clinical
      status.
