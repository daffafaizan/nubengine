    
      All patients aged above 60 years undergoing planned neurosurgical operations in the duration
      up to 4 hours under general anesthesia will be included in the study. The patients will not
      be sedated by any type of benzodiazepine. A dose of 30 mg nimodipine or placebo will be
      applied 45 minutes before the surgery according to the randomization. Anesthesia will be
      managed according to the standardised protocol. Concentration of desflurane will be adjusted
      according to entropy values (target 40-50). Analgetics will be applied according to surgical
      pleth index (SPI) values. Sufentanil will not be applied in the last 15 minutes. Extubation
      will be performed at the operating theatre when meeting all extubation criteria including
      train of four ratio (TOFR) above 92%. Neither syntophylline, nor pharmacological
      decurarization (syntostigmine) will be applied to the patients.During the surgery, blood
      pressure will be maintained within Â± 15% of the patient's normal blood pressure. Cognitive
      dysfunction tests will be executed on the day before the surgery, two hours after the surgery
      and on the third postoperative day.
