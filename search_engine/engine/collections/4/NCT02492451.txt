    
      Group 1: Endometrial biopsy is performed on days 21-24 of the spontaneous menstrual cycle
      proceeding the intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment cycle. Two small biopsies are
      obtained from anterior and posterior walls of the uterus.

      Group 2: Vaginal progesterone gel is administered for luteal phase support from second day
      after insemination until pregnancy testing and is continued in the presence of pregnancy
      until the 12 weeks of pregnancy.

      Goup 3: Patients are undergone intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles stimulated with
      gonadotropin without any intervention.

      The effect of endometrial injury and luteal phase progesterone support on the pregnancy rate
      in patients intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles stimulated with gonadotropin will be
      compared in terms of biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate and ongoing
      pregnancy rate.
