    
      Purpose: The RIO trial is designed to test the efficacy of GP IIb/IIIa blockade on subacute
      reocclusions in patients with interventional recanalization of chronic occlusions in the
      superficial femoral and popliteal artery.

      Methods: A total of 420 patients will be randomly assigned to ReoPro or placebo. Patients
      will be eligible for randomisation with occlusions longer than 5 cm. Doppler ultrasound
      follow-up will be at 30 days, and after 6, and 12 months.
