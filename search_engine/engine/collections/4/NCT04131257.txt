      through a novel cost-effective nurse-led continuum of care approach that incorporates
      diabetes prevention, awareness, screening and management for low-income settings, and
      furthermore utilizes the endeavor to advocate for establishing standard diabetes program in
      Nepal.

      We will conduct a two-arm, open-masked stratified cluster randomized controlled trial of a
      NUrse-led COntinuum of care for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes (NUCOD), with primary
      care centers (Outreach centers and Government health posts) as a unit of randomization. NUCOD
      will be delivered through the trained diabetes nurses in the community to the intervention
      group and the outcomes will be compared to the enhanced usual-treatment group at 6 and 12
      months of the intervention. The primary outcome will be change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      level among diabetes and progression to type 2 diabetes among pre-diabetes, and
      implementation outcomes measured using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption,
      implementation, and maintenance) framework. Outcomes will be analyzed on an intention to
      treat basis.

      The results of this trial will provide information about the effectiveness of the NUCOD
      program in improving clinical outcomes for diabetes and pre-diabetes individuals, and
      implementation outcomes for the organization.
