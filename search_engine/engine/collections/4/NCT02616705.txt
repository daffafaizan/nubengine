      Nagoya City University Hospital, Nagoya Daini Red Cross Hospital, and Kurashiki Central
      hospital. Participants will be individuals who will receive endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiography (ERC), endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or
      percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). Bile samples collected from the target cases
      will be assayed for IgG4 concentration.
