oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold .1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured whenhuman subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal,one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck bypoliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranialdamage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of musclerelaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) .2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugswere cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose .3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygenconsumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased .4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man theincrease in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurssolely in skeletal muscle .
