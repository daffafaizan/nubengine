      by ﬁbrocellular proliferation on the anterior surface of the internal limiting membrane (ILM)
      of the macula. Pars plana vitrectomy with ERM removal and inner limiting membrane peeling is
      the standard surgical treatment for an ERM. ILM peeling is performed to eliminate the
      scaffold for myoﬁbroblast proliferation and any microscopic ERM in order to prevent ERM
      recurrence. ILM peeling is indicated for other pathologies other than ERM such as, diabetic
      macular edema, and macular hole. ILM peeling is a traumatic procedure that may have many
      effects on the underlying inner retinal layers that may lead to changes in retinal function.

      Retinal edema, eccentric scotoma, dissociation of the nerve fiber layer, iatrogenic punctuate
      chorioretinopathy, and subretinal, retinal, and vitreous hemorrhage are well described
      secondary to the surgical trauma of peeling in addition to stain toxicity. Investigation of
      these changes may assist in aiding the development of minimally traumatic techniques for ILM
      removal .

      Evaluation of functional changes may include visual field and Multifocal electroretinography
      assessment. Visual field defect after vitrectomy a well known post operative complication
      usually in eyes that underwent fluid air exchange, the cause of visual field defect remain
      unclear.

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), imaging is done to evaluate inner retinal layers after
      ILM peeling,High myopic eyes might develop more severe, "scattered" inner retinal defects
      after ILM peeling.

      Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), has been used to assess visual function and the
      electrophysiologic responses of multiple retinal locations of the macular area
