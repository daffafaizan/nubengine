    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Monitor molecular response rates of patients receiving treatment for chronic myelogenous
           leukemia by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
           quantitative Southern blot monitoring of blood samples.

        -  Compare quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative Southern blot results with marrow
           cytogenetics at the time of complete molecular response in these patients.

        -  Monitor the frequency of residual disease in patients who achieve a complete blood
           Southern blot and marrow cytogenetic response (eradication of BCR/ABL by Southern blot
           and absence of the Philadelphia chromosome by cytogenetics).

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood samples and bone marrow aspirates are collected at baseline and at
      3, 6, and 9 months after starting therapy. If patient continues to receive protocol treatment
      after 9 months, additional peripheral blood samples are collected every 6 months and bone
      marrow aspirates are taken annually. In the event of disease progression (blast crisis), an
      additional peripheral blood sample and bone marrow aspirate are collected.

      Samples are examined by quantitative Southern blot analysis with probes to BCR, quantitative
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for BCR/ABL fusion transcripts, and
      cytogenetic analysis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
