      solution of Physioneal 35 or 40 (including Clear-Flex bag), Fixioneal 35 or 40, Dianeal or
      Dianeal Low Calcium (1.36%, 2.27% or 3.86% glucose), or Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova or
      Equibalance (1.25%, 2.3%, 4.5% glucose) and Extraneal (7.5% Icodextrin) for the long-dwell
      exchange. Patients will be centrally randomized to receive the investigational product
      (XyloCore) or the active control (Physioneal, Fixioneal, Dianeal, Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova
      or Equibalance). A stratified randomization scheme will be employed to ensure a balanced
      allocation of patients with diabetes across the two treatment groups. Patients randomized to
      XyloCore will receive 2 to 3 bags of XyloCore (Low, Medium or High Strenght) with an osmotic
      strength comparable to their pre-randomization prescription of the glucose peritoneal
      dialysis solution. Patients randomized to the control group will continue the 2 to 3 daily
      (short-dwell) exchanges of Physioneal, Fixioneal, Dianeal, Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova or
      Equibalance. All patients will receive Extraneal (7.5% Icodextrin) for nocturnal (long-dwell)
      exchange. The osmotic strength and number of diurnally short dwells exchanges should be
      modified by the investigator as clinically required. PD prescriptions in both treatment arms
      are tailored to reach a minimum target of total Kt/V of 1.7 per week throughout the study.
      The study will be single-blinded (outcomes assessor), without blinding of patients or
      clinical staff.
