      surfaces of the knee joint. The goal of total knee replacement is to improve a patient's
      mobility by improving the function of the the knee joint.

      The PEAK PlasmaBladeÂ® uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy and a highly-insulated handpiece
      design to enable precision cutting and coagulation at the point of application. The
      PlasmaBlade has received FDA clearance for use in plastic, general, orthopedic, and ear,
      nose, and throat (ENT) surgery, and has demonstrated a significantly reduced thermal injury
      profile in incised tissue compared to traditional electrosurgical devices. It is hypothesized
      that this benefit may improve the post-operative outcome of patients undergoing total knee
      replacement.
