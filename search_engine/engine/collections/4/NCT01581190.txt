      ingesting BAN or CHO (0.2 g/kg carbohydrate every 15 min). Pre-, post-, and 1-h-post-exercise
      blood samples were analyzed for glucose, granulocyte (GR) and monocyte (MO) phagocytosis
      (PHAG) and oxidative burst activity, nine cytokines, F2-isoprostanes, ferric reducing ability
      of plasma (FRAP), and metabolic profiles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
