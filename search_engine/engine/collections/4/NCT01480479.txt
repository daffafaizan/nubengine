    
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether adding an experimental vaccine
      called rindopepimut (also known as CDX-110) to the commonly used chemotherapy drug
      temozolomide can help improve the life expectancy of patients with newly diagnosed, resected
      EGFRvIII positive glioblastoma.

      The duration of participation in this study may be up to 5 years. After you are screened and
      enrolled in the study, you will be administered temozolomide and either rindopepimut/GM-CSF
      or KLH until either disease progression or intolerance to the medications. If your tumor
      progresses while on this study, your doctor may treat you with other therapies that are not
      part of the study.
