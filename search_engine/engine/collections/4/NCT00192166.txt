    
      -  The primary objective of the study was to determine if intranasally administered
           influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live, cold-adapted (CAIV-T), when
           administered concomitantly with a subcutaneously administered combination live,
           attenuated mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) virus vaccine to children aged 11 to less
           than 24 months, interferes with the immune responses to the measles, mumps, and rubella
           components of the MMR vaccine.

        -  To compare the efficacy over one season against culture-confirmed influenza-illness
           caused by community-acquired subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the
           vaccine, in children who are aged at least 11 months and less than 24 months at
           enrollment, between those who receive two doses of CAIV-T and those who receive placebo,
           each with concomitant administration of a combination live, attenuated MMR vaccine
           administered prior to the anticipated commencement of the influenza season.
