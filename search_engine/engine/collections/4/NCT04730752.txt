      regarding the clinical scoring systems for acute appendicitis are remarkable. It is stated
      that clinical scoring systems, on their own, can be used to exclude acute appendicitis and
      decrease negative laparotomy rates. Currently Appendicitis Inflammatory Response Score (AIR)
      and Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) are the best clinically performing scoring systems. As a
      result, based on strong evidence the use of these two systems are recommended. Both scoring
      systems are developed on the basis of clinical findings and laboratory parameters.

      The aim of this study is to validate both systems as well as to compare the efficiency of
      both systems on excluding negative laparotomies and on the determination of severity of acute
      appendicitis.
