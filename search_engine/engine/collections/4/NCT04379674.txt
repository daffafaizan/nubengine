      taping was applied from the insertio of the muscle to the origin. Facilitation taping and
      inhibition taping was applied on the target tissue with 25% tension. Y-band was used during
      facilitation taping and inhibition taping. It was applied to individuals with shoulder mild
      abduction, external rotation, elbow extension and supination position. Placebo taping was
      applied while in a resting position. In placebo taping, it was applied using two I bands in
      horizontal direction. In placebo taping, no tension was applied to the tapes. Evaluations
      were made while the subjects were standing. The biceps curl exercise position starts with the
      palms facing the trunk. Elbow flexion is completed by making full range of motion. The cases
      were randomized into 3 groups: group-1 facilitation taping, group-2 inhibition taping and
      group-3 placebo taping.The treatment sequence to be applied to the patients was determined by
      randomization. Facilitation, inhibition and placebo banding were applied to the patients,
      respectively. Accordingly, inhibition and placebo taping was applied to the cases that
      started with the facilitation taping. Placebo and facilitation banding were applied to the
      patients that started with inhibition banding, respectively. Facilitation and inhibition
      banding was applied to the cases that started with placebo banding, respectively. During the
      evaluation, banding application was kept by wearing plenty of clothes. Evaluators and
      subjects participating in the study did not have knowledge and experience about the taping
      method.
