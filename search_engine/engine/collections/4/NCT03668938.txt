      life than in the control group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.
      Because of this, a new study was implemented with the correct sample size, defined through
      the previous study. In addition, the post-discharge phase the COPM was administered to define
      new objectives relating mainly to productivity and leisure time areas. Finally, the
      investigators have indentified some territorial services with the aim to create tailored
      paths/interventions for patients to promote social reintegration.
