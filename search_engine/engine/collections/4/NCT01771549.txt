      natriuretic peptide (n-t-BNP) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT):

        -  Group 1 (adriamycin) will consist of patients beginning clinically indicated
           chemotherapy for breast cancer with a dose-dense (every 2 week) regimen. including
           adriamycin (n=10).

        -  Group 2 will include patients who receive trastuzumab in the adjuvant or (neo) adjuvant
           setting, or in a metastatic setting in a regimen that does not include simultaneous
           adriamycin.

      Blood samples for hs-cTNT and n-t-BNP will be obtained on days pre-treatment, and
      post-treatment days 1, 2, 3, 7, pre-cycle 2, and post-cycle 2 days 1,2,3 and 7. The interval
      for treatment is usually two weeks for adriamycin and three weeks for trastuzumab. We will
      identify frequency of detectible levels above the detection limit and above the baseline,
      peak values and area under the curve. Enrollment of up to 15 per group will be allowed to
      guarantee acquisition of 10 full sets of samples. Lab draw from chemotherapy ports will be
      allowed. We plan to store specimens for future analyses with more sensitive assays in
      development.
