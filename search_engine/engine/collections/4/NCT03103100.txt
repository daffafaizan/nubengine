      infusion through a lumbar epidural. To achieve adequate pain control during the first stage
      of labor - onset of contractions to complete cervical dilation - nerve fibers up to the T10
      dermatome must be anesthetized. When a patient is in active labor and an epidural catheter is
      placed, the anesthesiologist must activate the epidural by administering LA through the
      epidural to promote spread of the LA in the epidural space to anesthetize the nerve fibers
      involved in the conduction of labor pains. The ideal LA to achieve this goal is one that
      would allow for the fastest onset to achieve quick pain relief with the fewest side effects.

      Two commonly used LA to provide labor analgesia are bupivacaine and lidocaine. When low
      concentrations - 0.25% bupivacaine and 1% lidocaine - are used for labor analgesia, both of
      these LA can be administered safely with very little concern of major adverse effects
      associated with LA toxicity. Given that there is limited and conflicting evidence for the
      usefulness of the bupivacaine and lidocaine mixture especially as it relates to labor
      epidural activation, we hope to readdress these questions in an effort to determine whether
      or not the LA combination offers any distinct advantage over the individual LA. The
      investigators intend to determine the time it takes to achieve an adequate level (T10) for
      labor analgesia, the total spread of local anesthetic, and the degree of motor block as these
      factors will be important in determining the most optimal LA solution to activate a labor
      epidural. With the results from this study, the investigators hope to recommend a LA solution
      that will allow for the fastest pain relief in the laboring mother with the fewest side
      effects.
