    
      The primary objective of this phase II study is to determine whether pembrolizumab increases
      the tumor infiltrating and peripheral blood immune response to the VRP-HER2 vaccine. The
      investigators hypothesize that HER2 specific T cell responses and anti-tumor immunity induced
      with HER2 vaccination will be augmented by concurrent anti-PD-1 antibody therapy.

      The investigators will additionally determine whether the administration of pembrolizumab is
      safe in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2+ cancers who are receiving the anti-HER2
      vaccine VRP-HER2.

      There will be an initial Safety Arm (n=3) during which subjects will receive the VRP-HER2
      immunizations plus pembrolizumab and if there is no dose limiting toxicity in the Safety Arm,
      subjects will then be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 arms (n=12 per arm). Subjects with metastatic
      HER2 overexpressing breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab will continue these
      antibodies. They will undergo a biopsy of their tumor and peripheral blood draw for immune
      cell analyses and be assigned to the applicable arm of the study. Arm A will consist of the
      the VRP-HER2 immunizations; Arm B will consist of pembrolizumab; Arm C will consist of the
      VRP-HER2 immunizations plus pembrolizumab. Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood draws will be
      performed following the course of immunizations.
