      potentials elicited by stimuli determined in prior research (Greenstein et al., 1998; Badr et
      al., 2003) to drive select visual pathways that exhibit glaucomatous damage in an efficient
      and automated manner. The results obtained with this novel device will be compared with
      results obtained using an existing commercial device. Statistical results, sensitivity and
      specificity, will be generated for the assessment of the accuracy of the test to discriminate
      glaucoma patients from controls. Repeatability of the test will also be analyzed based on the
      test-retest results.

      Visual evoked potential (VEP) is a measure of neural function in the eye and brain. Three
      skin electrodes are placed on the surface of the scalp to record the electrical activity from
      the brain while the subject is observing a flickering stimulus with isolated-check/dot
      pattern. The whole procedure is non-invasive and the risks are negligible.

      Isolated-Check/dot Stimuli of about 10 Hz with luminance contrast of 10%, 15%, -10%, and -15%
      will be used to test each eye. Eight samples for each stimulus will be recorded. Each
      experimental run takes 2 seconds. The T-circ statistical method is performed to process the
      data, and the VEP signal to noise ratio (SNR) is calculated in order to obtain an optimized
      condition (stimulus and threshold) to separate glaucoma patients and normal group.
