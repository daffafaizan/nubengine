      worldwide for patients with unresectable HCC. However there is no standard protocol exists
      for TACE currently. One of the controversy is does the way of emulsified the anticancer
      agents and lipiodol to get a high stability suspension really effect the survival rates.

      Anticancer drugs play important role in survival benefit. Many studies have innovated
      different methods to get a high stability suspension of lipiodol and anticancer drugs
      ,because they think lipiodol can selectively retained in HCC and used as a drug-carrying
      which allow a slow release of the anticancer drug from lipiodol microdroplets. Thus ,A
      stability suspension might get a maximize tumor drug uptake,which can caused a more tumor
      necrosis, and minimize systemic drug levels ,which get a less toxicity, hence survival
      benefit. While the other researcher think a stability emulsion can't get a positive effect
      ,such as pharmacokinetic and systematic toxicity of the anticancer drugs, tumor response,
      biologic response and so on.
