      formulation of leuprolide acetate administered once every 26 weeks for 1 year, will lower
      testosterone levels to and maintain them at medically castrate levels in subjects with
      prostatic adenocarcinoma. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the 45
      mg formulation and assess the safety of this formulation.
