      without known prevention or cure, and diabetes seems to be one of the strongest risk factors.
      The predominating causal model in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is based on the amyloid
      hypothesis, which posits that amyloid (A) deposition in the brain causes synaptic dysfunction
      resulting in early memory deficits and progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      dementia. Tau has also gained increasing interest as an AD pathology feature, biomarker, and
      treatment target.

      There are no known curative or preventive measures for LOAD. One of the strongest potential
      LOAD risk factors is type 2 diabetes, an abnormal elevation of blood glucose associated with
      microvascular and macrovascular complications including cerebrovascular disease. Many studies
      have reported an association of diabetes with dementia, including LOAD and vascular dementia
      (VD). Most studies have found that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of both LOAD
      and VD, with a stronger association for VD compared with LOAD. Thus, this study focuses on
      the relation of diabetes, pre-diabetes, and elevated glucose, with AD.
