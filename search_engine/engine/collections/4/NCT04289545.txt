      functional bread in healthy overweight adults. Therefore, four types of bread, consumed by
      the participants, have added galactomannan in different amounts and viscosities, and one
      bread is the control bread.

      The participants arrive after an overnight fast and before the consumption of bread, a
      fasting blood sample is taken.

      After the ingestion, blood samples are taken at specific times. The area under the curve of
      the postprandial glucose is expected to differ between the functional breads.
