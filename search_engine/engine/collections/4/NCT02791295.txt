      months of treatment. This weight gain could counterbalance the metabolic benefice of insulin
      pump treatment in improving glycemic control and could lead to treatment dropout. Lifestyle
      intervention aiming at improving physical activity and diet in type 2 diabetes is known to
      brought body weight reduction and cardiometabolic improvement.

      The investigator hypothesized that an intensive, home-based, 6-months diet and physical
      activity program could prevent the body weight gain associated with insulin pump treatment
      initiation. The investigator will randomize patients with type 2 diabetes into a "lifestyle
      intervention" arm or a "usual care" control arm at the time of insulin pump treatment
      initiation. The primary objective will evaluate body weight change at 6 months after insulin
      pump treatment initiation. The secondary objectives will evaluate change in glycemic control
      (HbA1c) and body composition at 6 months. In addition, the retention effect will be assessed
      on body weight change one year after insulin pump treatment initiation, 6 months after the
      end of the lifestyle intervention.
