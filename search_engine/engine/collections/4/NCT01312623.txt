      around the thigh up to a pressure of 15 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure for five
      minutes. Thereafter the pressure is released for another five minutes and the procedure is
      repeated fourfold. Cerebral and myocardial damage are examined by postoperative laboratory
      exams in comparison to preoperative baseline values. In addition to this, systemic immune
      response, renal function, duration of intensive care and time to discharge from hospital are
      compared between groups. Mechanisms of remote preconditioning are investigated by analyzing
      gene expression in human heart tissue obtained during surgery and in leukocytes.

      The investigation is not associated with any known risks for the children.
