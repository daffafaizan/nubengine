           hospital in India, by determining the seropositivity

        -  To compare immune changes that might occur in healthcare workers who are asymptomatic or
           symptomatic with the proven positive cases in OPD or IPD at Max hospital.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections

        -  To understand the seroconversion status at different stages of exposure to front line
           HCW

      The study population would include all employees of Max Hospitals, Delhi-NCR, who have been
      tested for COVID-19. Samples and data of the COVID positive patients admitted in the hospital
