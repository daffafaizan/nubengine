    
      This study aims to determine the efficacy of the SHINGRIX varicella zoster virus (VZV)
      vaccine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients
      that are treatment naive or receiving Bruton s-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK-I). (Note:
      Since CLL and SLL are considered the same disease, CLL/SLL will be referred to as CLL
      hereafter, unless otherwise specified).

      Key Eligibility Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of CLL or SLL

        -  Cohort 1: Treatment naive CLL or SLL patients

        -  Cohort 2: Subjects must be receiving ibrutinib for at least 6 months prior to
           administration of the first vaccine dose

        -  Cohort 3: Subjects must be receiving acalabrutinib for at least 6 months prior to
           administration of the first vaccine dose

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  ECOG performance status of 0-1

      Design:

      Patients with CLL will enroll on the study for the purpose of determining the SHINGRIX
      vaccine efficacy in patients who are treatment naive or receiving BTK-I therapy. A series of
      2 doses of SHINGRIX will be given at 0- and 3- month schedule by intramuscular injection.
      Subjects will be followed for 6 months and receive assessment of serologic response 6 months
      after the first vaccine dose administration.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      a)Determine the serologic response against VZV after completing the SHINGRIX (RZV) 2-

      dose vaccine series in the following populations:

        -  CLL patients that are treatment naive (n=54)

        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with ibrutinib (n=27)

        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with acalabrutinib (n=27)

      Secondary Objective:

      a) Determine the safety and tolerability of the SHINGRIX vaccine among CLL patients who are
      treatment naive or receiving BTK-Is (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib).
