      motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body. They include amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA),
      progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) and pseudobulbar palsy; spinal muscular atrophies are also
      sometimes included in the group.They are neurodegenerative diseases that cause increasing
      disability and eventually, death.

      In spite of intensive research, motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are still incurable. Some of the
      key factors in this failure to find a cure have been the lack of human cell-based disease
      models for molecular analysis and drug screening and the difficulty of obtaining homogeneous
      populations of specific cell types for clinical applications. Stem cell biology has the
      potential to transform our understanding of disease processes and to revolutionize our
      approach to develop novel therapies for MNDs.

      In this study, the investigators suggest a protocol for the treatment of MND by
      transplantation of purified autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells via the intrathecal and
      intravenous route.
