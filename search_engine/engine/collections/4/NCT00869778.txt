    
      First stage(0-76 weeks):

      Eligible subjects are enrolled and assigned to 3 groups randomly in a 1:1:1 ratio：

        1. εPA-44 600μg group：Subcutaneous inject εPA-44 600μg at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28；Polyene
           Phosphatidylcholine Capsules will be taken orally beginning in week 28.

        2. εPA-44 900μg group：Subcutaneous inject εPA-44 900μg at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28；Polyene
           Phosphatidylcholine Capsules will be taken orally beginning in week 28.

        3. Placebo control group：Subcutaneous inject empty liposome at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 20,
           28；Polyene Phosphatidylcholine Capsules will be taken orally beginning in week 28.

      The study cycle consists of screening and enrollment period (week -6-0), treatment period
      (week 0-28) and follow-up period (week 28-76).

      Second stage(76-144 weeks):

      In this follow-up stage the trial is open designed, and all the subjects completed the first
      stage study(0-76 weeks):

        1. Subjects with no virological response and no serological response in the first stage ,
           and refuse to continue the this follow-up study, will be provided domestic Adefovir
           Dipivoxil for one year freely;

        2. Subjects with virological response but no serological response/with serological response
           but no virological response/neither virological nor serological response in the first
           stage, and be willing to continue the this follow-up study, will be treated by εPA-44
           900 μg；

        3. Subjects with both virological and serological response, will be followed-up to 144
           weeks with no Adefovir Dipivoxil or εPA-44 900 μg treatment.

      The definition of response is defined as below:

        1. Virological response: HBV DNA<2.93×10∧3IU/ml at 76 weeks;

        2. Serological response: serological conversion of HBeAg at 76 weeks.
