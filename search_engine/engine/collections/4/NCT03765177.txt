      determine the safety and efficacy of CLIC-1901 cell therapy in patients with CD19+ ALL and
      NHL. The primary objective in the initial stage of 20 participants will be to evaluate the
      feasibility of our protocol and the safety and tolerability of infusing autologous CLIC-1901
      cells into patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ ALL or NHL. Once 20 participants have been
      treated and the treatment is deemed safe, up to 40 more participants will be enrolled in an
      extension stage where the primary objective will be overall response rate (defined as
      complete or partial response) at 6 months after CLIC-1901 infusion.
