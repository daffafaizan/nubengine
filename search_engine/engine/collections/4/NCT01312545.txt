        -  The sample size was calculated by using an equivalence formula. From a literature and
           our own experiences, the success rate for Medpor and 3DP were 92% and 94% respectively,
           the difference (D) of the success rate between two groups was 10% and assuming a 15% of
           drop out rate.

        -  Then allocation sequence was generated by a computerized program, using block of six
           with varying block size.

      Data management

        -  All definition of data, recruiting techniques, data collection techniques and data
           management flow were mentioned in the SOP.

        -  After double entry technique, each case record form from each site will be sent via
           DataFax system to the data center at Center of Excellence for Biomedical and Public
           Health Informatics (BIOPHICS), Thailand.

        -  Then data will be validated, analyzed and reported by staff at BIOPHICS.

      Plan for missing data

        -  by adding a drop out rate to the sample size calculation.

        -  by choosing the right patients. Actually, Thai patients have good co-operation
           especially in surgical research.

      Statistical analysis

      - Intention to treat and per protocol model would be used to see the difference between two
      types of implants in this project.
