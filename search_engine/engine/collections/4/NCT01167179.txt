      and neck cancer patients however, increasing research evidence shows that at least the goal
      of detecting recurrence of cancer during routine control visits in an asymptomatic stage is
      not achieved. Other goals of follow-up such as management of treatment complications and
      helping patients and families cope and adjust remain important and ask for an accurate,
      effective but tailored and sensitive approach. Increasingly, nurses are mentioned as care
      providers best suited to perform this task.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up
      intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the
      feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality
      of life of patients is determined.

      Methods and design: A quasi-experimental prospective design is used. Two groups of patients
      are enrolled consecutively (n=160) and patient data are collected at baseline (T0), at 6(T1)
      and at 12(T2) months respectively. The duration of the intervention is defined to the first
      year of follow up. Participating nurses are trained prior to the recruitment of the
      intervention group and receive supervision and individual coaching during the entire duration
      of the intervention phase.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcome, psychosocial adjustment to illness. Secondary outcomes,
      health related quality of life, psychosocial problems, and usage of care.
