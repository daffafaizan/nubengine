        -  Assess clinical response, in terms of lesion size and histological grade, of oledronate
           in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 or 3.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study. Patients are
      stratified according to degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (CIN2/3 vs CIN3).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Zoledronate: 100 cc of saline with 4 mg of Zoledronate intravenous (IV), over 20
           minutes, for 3 doses one week apart

        -  Placebo: 100 cc of saline (IV), over 20 minutes, for 3 doses one week apart

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses. In week 8, patients
      undergo surgical resection comprising loop excision or cone biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at week 10 by telephone.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
