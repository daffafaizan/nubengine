    
      FAB117-HC is an investigational medicinal product whose active substance is HC016, allogeneic
      adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      administration of FAB117-HC using: a) two sequential escalating doses administered between 72
      and 120 hours post-injury, to patients with acute traumatic SCI with ASIA Impairment Scale
      (AIS) grade A; and b) the determined maximum tolerated dose administered up to 96 h
      post-injury to patients with AIS grading of A or B. The study includes also initial
      exploration of efficacy.

      Treatment is administered by intramedullary injection into the injured spinal cord, during
      the decompression and stabilization surgery (DSS) of the fracture. DSS is routinely performed
      on almost all SCI patients.

      The study has been divided into two phases:

      Phase 1 (open label): 8 AIS A patients with lesion located between D1 and D12 will be
      included in 2 sequential cohorts.

      Phase 2 (randomized, controlled, double-blind): 40 AIS A or B patients with lesion located
      between D1 and D12, will be randomly divided into two groups (control and treated) that will
      be balanced in AIS grade.
