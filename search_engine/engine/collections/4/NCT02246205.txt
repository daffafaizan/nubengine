      pancreas, periampullary tumors and intractable inflammatory pathology.

      The high postoperative morbidity (50%) involve a mean hospital stay of 15 days after surgery.
      The most common complication is delayed gastric emptying (DGE), defined as the intolerance to
      solid oral intake by 7th day postoperative. In some severe cases, oral intolerance can occur
      after the 21th postoperative day. Therefore, the patient requires parenteral nutrition and
      prolonged hospital stay.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of Roux-en Y reconstruction (study group,
      DPCDA) versus classical Child reconstruction (DPCUN) in the incidence of VGL in patients for
      DPC.

      The hypotesis of the study is that Roux-en Y reconstruction decreases incidence of DGE after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      A pilot randomized clinical trial has been designed to compare two surgical techniques for
      reconstruction of digestive tract after DPC in patients treated in our center. The patients
      are randomized after tumor resection and before the reconstruction througt computer-generated
      random numbers using a sealed envelope technique. The primary endpoint is the incidence of
      DGE. Secondary endpoints are postoperative morbidity and specific complications as pancreatic
      fistula, the hospital stay, and postoperative endocrine and exocrine function.
