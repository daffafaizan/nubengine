      clinical practice in patients with advanced HIV disease, little is known about possible
      adverse drug interactions. The need exists to define pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      adverse interactions of the many combination prophylactic regimens that may be prescribed.

      In Part A, patients receive sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) alone for 2 weeks, then
      in combination with fluconazole, rifabutin, or both drugs, each over 2-week periods in a
      randomly assigned order. Patients in Part B receive the same regimens except with
      clarithromycin substituted for rifabutin. In Part C, patients receive dapsone alone for 2
      weeks, then in combination with fluconazole, rifabutin, or both drugs in the same manner as
      in Part A. Part D patients receive the same regimen as those in Part C, except with
      clarithromycin substituted for rifabutin. Patients are followed every 2 weeks.
