      enrolled will receive Atezolizumab 1200mg + Bevacizumab 15mg/Kg + Carboplatin AUC6 +
      Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 for 3 cycles every 21 days (+/- 3 days) as neoadjuvant treatment followed
      by surgery and 6 months of adjuvant treatment with Atezolizumab 1200 mg Q4W (+/- 3 days).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the major pathologic response defined as 10 percent or
      fewer viable cancer cells detectable in the resected tumor and in lymph nodes in stage IIIA
      EGFR mutated patients treated in neoadjuvant setting with atezolizumab- bevacizumab-
      carboplatin and pemetrexed.

      Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 2 years excluding a run-in-period of 3-6
      months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the study duration to a total of 6
      years. Patients will be followed 3 years after adjuvant treatment. The study will end once
      survival follow-up has concluded. This will be followed by a close out period of 4 months.
