      favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause
      of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel
      biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early
      primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular
      interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in
      later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular
      health in the longer term.

      The investigators have therefore designed the EPOCH study to investigate whether those
      individuals born to hypertensive pregnancies and/or to a preterm birth demonstrate
      differences in the cardiovascular phenotype at birth, or whether they develop any differences
      over the first three months of life and whether this varies with other perinatal factors.
      This study also allows investigation of the short term impact of perinatal interventions used
      in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures of cardiovascular
      structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular phenotype in this
      population.
