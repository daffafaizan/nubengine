    
      A Phase 1 Single Dose Study to investigate the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetic
      profile of SNP-630 in Health Subjects To evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      Pharmacokinetic profile of SNP-630 when oral administered to healthy subjects.

      This is a phase 1, open-label, single-dose study to assess its safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic profile of SNP-630 in 14 health volunteers. Subjects will receive oral
      SNP-630 at a dose of 720 mg to assess its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile.

      After written informed consent has been obtained, all screening procedures and tests that
      establish study eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to day -1 visit.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the following variable:

      Clinical safety observations will include Adverse Events (AEs), vital sign measurements,
      12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory assessments. Safety data will be tabulated and where
      appropriate, analyzed by the use of descriptive statistics. Safety data will be tabulated by
      system organ class and preferred term and will be further classified by relationship to
      treatment. The probability of safety events will be estimated and with associated 95%
      corresponding confidence intervals for each cohort using the binomial distribution.

      Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request
