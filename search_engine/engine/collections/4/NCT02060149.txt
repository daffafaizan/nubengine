      minocycline doxycycline 100mg (oral, q12h). All enrolled patients were randomly divided into
      three groups according to the difference in pH value of aerosol inhalation with sodium
      bicarbonate solution. Group one is blank-control and patients will received usual antibiotic
      treatment without inhalation. The pH value in group two is 7.4 and that in group is 7.8. Each
      time the volume of aerosol solution is 5ml, q8h. The average course of treatment will be two
      weeks. Clinical indexes will be collected including vital signs, pulmonary rales, cough
      level, expectoration level, sputum color,blood count, arterial blood gas, biochemical
      parameters, chest X-ray score, APACHE II score, clinical pulmonary infection score, ECG,
      sputum culture, et al.The primary endpoints are pathogenic clearance rate and recovery rate.
      The secondary end point is adverse reaction rate.
