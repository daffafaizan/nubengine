    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of the combination of anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody
      SAR-439459 (SAR439459) and cemiplimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination of SAR439459 and cemiplimab in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), median
      overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DoR).

      III. To identify biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of SAR439459 and
      cemiplimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SAR439459 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and cemiplimab IV over
      30 minutes on day 1 starting cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, then
      every 12 weeks until progression of disease is determined or patient receives additional
      anti-neoplastic medication.
