      (IRE) as the sole treatment of liver cancer close to diaphragmatic dome.

      This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an
      alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with
      particular reference to close to diaphragmatic dome, where the current therapeutic arsenal is
      inadequate or counter-indicated.

      To perform the IRE procedure the IRE NanoKnifeâ„¢ System (AngioDynamics) will be used.
