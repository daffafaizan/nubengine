      common symptoms that approximately 80 percent of the patients experience. Multiple myeloma is
      different from other tumors in that several osteoclast activating factors (OAF) released from
      multiple myeloma cells resorb bone and, at the same time, activation of osteoblast is
      inhibited, leading to unbalance of breakdown and formation of bone. Activation of osteoclast
      and inhibition of osteoblast brings about bone fractures, osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, bone
      pain and spinal cord compression. Those symptoms are directly related to patients' quality of
      life. Therefore, they are the important therapeutic targets for multiple myeloma. Various
      types of bisphosphonate agents are used for the treatment of the bone disease in patients
      with multiple myeloma. This is a prospective (a study where the participants are identified
      and then followed forward in time), multi-center, Phase 4, observational study (studies that
      record specific events occurring without any intervention from the researcher) in order to
      analyze the change in bone metabolism markers (DKK-1, sRANKL, OPG, sRANKL/OPG,bALP, OC)
      before and after the use of bortezomib injection by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA) in serum. The adverse events will be assessed through the National Cancer
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI CTCAE V3). The
      patients will receive bortezomib injection into a vein 1.3 mg/m2 twice a week for 21 days
      under usual clinical practice.
