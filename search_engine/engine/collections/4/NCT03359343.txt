      study, the investigators tried to find out an correlation between LCI images and histology
      results for polyp lesions. And a computer-aided analysis of the images was conducted to
      demonstrate the correlation objectively. Thereafter,a pilot study was performed to explore
      whether the previous correlation could be easily learned to distinguish adenoma and
      non-adenoma polyps by comparing the results of experts diagnosis of LCI image and
      non-experts. Also, in the pilot study, the investigators assessed the accuracy of an automate
      histology diagnosis method for polyp LCI images using the computer-aided system when compared
      to human experts physicians. Throughout the entire research, histology results are regarded
      as gold standard.
