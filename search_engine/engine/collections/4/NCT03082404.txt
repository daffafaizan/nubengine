      Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre. After the selection of patients for eligibility
      criteria they will be randomized into IMTG or control group. First all patients will be
      evaluated, and subsequently the patients in the IMTG will be trained six times per week
      (three times at hemodialysis unit and three times at home) for five weeks using a linear
      pressure load device (POWERbreathe Plus Light Resistance@, England). The sessions will take
      place in the first hour of dialysis and the training protocol will consist of five series
      with 10 repetitions, each serie with a two-minute interval or according to the patient´s
      feedback, using the Borg modified scale. The overload will be adjusted weekly, beginning with
      50% of maximum inspiratory pressure and increasing until 70% along the protocol period. At
      the end of follow-up, both groups will be evaluated in order to compare.
