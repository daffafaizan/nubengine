    
      This is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, multicentric study in 400 adult
      patients admitted to hospital for mild acute pancreatitis to to assess the prognostic value
      of the antithrombin III in the development of moderate or severe acute pancreatitis.

      In the context of clinical practice of general surgery and apparatus digestive services,
      patients entering with mild acute pancreatitis will be asked to participate in the study and
      if so, they will sign the informed consent.

      On admission, demographic and anthropometric data of the patient will be recorded, as well as
      medical history, patient's admission data and vital signs. Patient's blood will be drawn for
      analysys and the risk of organ failure will be measured by modified Marshall and Apache II
      scales. The assessments and procedures performed are the standard practice at the center.

      At 24 hours (Â± 3 hours) and at 7 days (or nine days to avoid weekends) after admisison, vital
      signs will be recorded, laboratory tests will be performed and the risk of organ failure will
      be measured by modified Marshall and Apache II scales.

      At discharge of the patient (regardless of when it occurs), the outcome of the acute
      pancreatitis will be recorded.

      . Those patients discharged within the first month after admission will be visited or called
      (according to standard practice at the center) one month after arrival, to record follow-up
      data, including health condition, readmissions and abdominal pain evaluation by visual analog
      scale.
