      the rural Sierra of Chiapas, Mexico since February 2012. CES works in partnership with the
      local Ministry of Health to rehabilitate and staff existing government primary care clinics.
      Each community's clinic is staffed by one CES project physician year-round. CES activities
      span the range of allopathic medicine, but the focus of the project is in the prevention,
      detection, diagnosis and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and
      hypertension. CES currently operates in several rural communities with catchment areas of
      approximately 1,500 - 2,500 people. Routine care for NCDs is based on national guidelines and
      consists of monthly in-clinic visits by primary care physicians.

      Over 9 months in 2014 and again over 6 months in 2016, CES will introduce a community health
      worker program called "Acompañantes" to its project communities to augment care of patients
      with NCDs. Acompañantes are lay health workers and members of the community who bridge the
      gap between project clinics and patients, improving understanding of NCDs, their treatments,
      and adherence to therapy. The introduction of Acompañantes to communities is planned in a
      once-every-three-months fashion, the most rapid roll-out logistically feasible for CES. The
      investigators' project will document their experience over this time, and for one year after
      introduction of the Acompañantes program to all seven study communities, by documenting
      adherence to therapy, hemoglobin a1c, and blood pressure at every-three month intervals over
      this time frame.
