    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      ARM 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR650984 in combination with
      standard carfilzomib (Arm 1 is complete).

      ARM 2: To determine the safety AND efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) of adding
      SAR650984 10mg/kg weekly x 4 doses then every other week in combination with weekly
      carfilzomib (70 mg/m2) and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.
      ORR will be defined using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response
      criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      ARM 1:

        1. To evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity (ARM 1), of SAR650984 in combination
           with carfilzomib, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma after receiving 1+
           prior lines of therapy. The severity, frequency and incidence of all toxicities will be
           assessed.

        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and carfilzomib when administered in
           ARM 1 (completed).

        3. To assess the relationship between clinical (adverse event and/or tumor response)
           effects and pharmacologic parameters (PK/PD), and/or biologic (correlative laboratory)
           results.

        4. To estimate the activity (ORR) using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
           defined response criteria of SAR650984 plus carfilzomib (ARM 1)

        5. To describe progression free survival (PFS), time to disease progression (TTP) and
           1-year overall survival (OS) in patients treated with SAR650984 plus standard
           carfilzomib, and SAR650984 with weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone.

      EXPANSION COHORTS:

      ARM 1:

      1. To further evaluate safety, PK, PD and to estimate the anti-tumor activity (response
      rates) using IMWG defined response criteria of study therapy (SAR650984 plus carfilzomib).

      ARM 1 and 2:

      1. To describe progression-free survival, 1-year OS, and TTP in patients with relapsed or
      refractory myeloma treated with these combinations.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of isatuximab. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1,
      and orally (PO) or IV on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Patients receive isatuximab IV
      over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles,
      and carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may continue treatment after 8 cycles if clinical benefit is present at the
      investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched to days 1, 2, 15, and 16 per
      investigator discretion).

      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, isatuximab IV over
      4-6 hours on 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 60 days and then
      every 3 months for up to 3 years.
