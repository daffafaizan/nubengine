    
      To determine the pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH after intravenous administration of THCCOOH (5
      mg) and its formed glucuronide in healthy individuals in order to improve the possibilities
      for the assessment of unfitness to drive. For these purposes the following criteria will be
      studied:

      THCCOOH

        -  Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma
           concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)

        -  Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution of (Vc) Formed
           THCCOOH-glu

        -  Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma
           concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)

        -  Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution (Vc)
