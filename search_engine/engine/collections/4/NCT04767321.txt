    
      Approximately 60 subjects will be screened to achieve 24 persistent MSSA and/or MRSA carriers
      and 16 randomised and dosed subjects randomized 3:1, active to placebo.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day 1 for randomisation and dosing and
      will remain at the clinic until Day 2. Following nasal and perineum swabs and a chlorhexidine
      (Hibiscrub®) shower, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be applied topically to
      both nostrils by a qualified health professional 4 times during a six hour period (every two
      hours at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours) on Day 1.

      Subjects will come back to the research clinic on Day 3, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 15 (Visits 4 to
      7) for safety, tolerability and efficacy assessments and for blood sampling for bioanalysis.
      On Day 5 and Day 6, subjects will take a chlorhexidine shower at home. A final end-of-study
      visit (Visit 8) will take place on Day 22 (±3 days) or after early withdrawal.

      All subjects will be instructed to wash the body and hair with chlorhexidine body wash and
      shampoo at the clinic on Day 1 (prior to the first dose) and on Day 2. Prior to leaving the
      clinic on Day 2, subjects will be provided with chlorhexidine body wash and shampoo for body
      and hair wash at home on Day 3 (prior to Visit 4), on Day 4 (prior to Visit 5) and on Day 5
      and Day 6.

      Each subject is expected to participate in the study for approximately 50 days including a 28
      day screening period
