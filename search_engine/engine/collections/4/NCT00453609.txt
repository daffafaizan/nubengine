      feasibility of a new, intramuscular (IM) long-acting form of naltrexone. The long-acting form
      of naltrexone may improve medication adherence, which has been shown to be critical to
      successful naltrexone treatment of alcohol dependence. The study is a 16-week, randomized,
      prospective, open-label trial, including a 12-week course of monthly naltrexone injections. A
      follow-up interview will be conducted 4 weeks after discontinuation of medication. Thirty
      subjects will be recruited. Voucher-based incentives will be provided to all subjects to
      ensure attendance for medication administration. Weekly motivational counseling sessions will
      be conducted and will focus on improving motivation to stop alcohol use. Study outcomes
      consist of self-report and biological measures of alcohol use; measures of psychiatric
      symptom severity and neurocognitive functioning; and genetic testing to examine functional
      polymorphism (Asn40Asp) differences in the subjects' Î¼-opioid receptors (OPRM1), which may
      predict response to naltrexone treatment.
