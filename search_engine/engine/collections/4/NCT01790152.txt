      I. To determine whether leukemia and lymphoma patients from P9404, P9425, P9426, and Dana
      Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) 95-01 randomized to the experimental dexrazoxane hydrochloride
      (DRZ) arms have decreased markers of cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF) compared with
      patients on the standard arm.

      II. To determine whether osteosarcoma patients from P9754 (all received DRZ) have decreased
      markers of cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF) compared with similarly treated osteosarcoma
      patients diagnosed during the same time period, but who did not receive DRZ.

      III. To evaluate whether the cardioprotective effect of DRZ is modified by anthracycline
      (anthracycline analogue GPX-150) dose, chest radiation, and demographic factors (age at
      cancer diagnosis, current age, sex).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether leukemia and lymphoma patients from P9404, P9425, P9426, and DFCI
      95-01 on the DRZ arms experienced differential rates of overall-survival and event-free
      survival compared with the standard therapy arms.

      II. To determine whether projected quality-adjusted life years (QALY) differed by DRZ status,
      accounting for premature cardiac disease, primary disease relapse, and second cancers.

      III. Determine the longitudinal trajectory of 2-dimensional echocardiographic parameters
      (focusing on left ventricular [LV] function and remodeling/geometric changes that can be
      reliably re-measured) among patients from time of cancer treatment through subsequent
      follow-up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a diagnostic symptom checklist, undergo a physical exam, echocardiogram,
      collection of serum for biomarker testing, and a 6 minute walk test, and complete quality of
      life, family history, physical activity, and smoking questionnaires.
