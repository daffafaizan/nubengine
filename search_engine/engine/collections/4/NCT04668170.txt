      predicting clinical worsening on COVID-19 patient admission in order to help physicians to
      take informed therapeutic decisions able to modify early the course of the disease.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the early dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity in patients
           followed longitudinally

        -  To assess the dynamics of gd T cells during COVID-19

        -  Transcriptomic analysis of discrete and functionally major T cell populations

        -  To assess SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity in patients upon recovery

      Identification of early predictive biomarkers of worsening of COVID-19 patients is of
      paramount importance. This goal is expected to be achieved through the fine analysis of
      circulating immune effectors, and their dynamics, in categories of patients with very
      different clinical outcomes.

      To date, management of clinical worsening relies mainly on supportive care in ICU, leading to
      prolonged stay and saturation of facilities. Earlier therapeutic intervention based on
      identification of robust predictive biomarkers should:

        -  Help physicians to take therapeutic decisions

        -  Improve prognosis of patients that suffered from clinical worsening

        -  Prevent clinical worsening and transfer to ICU

        -  Improve the burden relying on ICU facilities in a setting of overflow

        -  Improve the prevention and management of COVID-19 patients to be able to face in a near
           future several other waves of COVID-19 Furthermore, identification of immune effectors
           implicated in tissular damages may also help to identify new therapeutic targets.
