      patient will be randomized to one of the three commercially available FNA needles. At this
      time, all needles are considered equivalent and there is no medical necessity to pick one
      over another. The sample obtained by the needle will be assigned a quality score based on
      certain parameters of the sample such as the abundance of diagnostic cells and the presence
      of blood. We are going to collect certain information about your procedure such as the
      complications of the procedure, number of needle passes and final diagnosis.
