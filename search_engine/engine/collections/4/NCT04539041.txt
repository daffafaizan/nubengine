      study with NIO752 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) participants.

      Approximately 64 PSP participants in 6 cohorts will be randomized to receive NIO752 or
      placebo in a ratio of 3:1. Intrathecal ( IT ) injections of NIO752 or placebo will be given 4
      times over 3 months. All participants will remain in this study for an additional 9 month
      follow-up period with 6 scheduled visits.

      Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially.

      Safety assessments will include physical and neurological examinations, ECGs, vital signs,
      standard clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), CSF
      laboratory test, adverse event, and serious adverse event monitoring.
