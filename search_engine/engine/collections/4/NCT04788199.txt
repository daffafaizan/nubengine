      of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study aims to investigate the
      role of cyanoacrylate glue in the prevention of internal hernia (IH) after LRYGB and compare
      it with the open technique of managing mesenteric defects by leaving the mesentery intact
      without closure of mesenteric defects. Data from six UK hospitals have been involved in this
      study. Operations were done under the supervision of a single senior consultant surgeon of
      bariatric surgery.

      Methods The prospectively collected data of 813 patients with morbid obesity who underwent
      LRYGB were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were subdivided into two groups: group I
      comprising 185 patients who had the mesenteric defects closed with cyanoacrylate glue and
      group II comprising 628 patients who were managed by the open technique of leaving the
      mesentery intact without closure of the mesenteric defects.
