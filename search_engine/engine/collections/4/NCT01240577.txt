        -  The nucleoside analog iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd, NSC 39661) has shown promising activity
           as a radiosensitizer in preclinical models and has been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical
           trials. The extent of radiosensitization is directly related to the incorporation of
           IdUrd into tumor DNA as a replacement for thymidine.

        -  IPdR (NSC 726188) is an orally administered prodrug of IdUrd with a better therapeutic
           index in preclinical models.

        -  This first in human study of IPdR will evaluate whether IPdR is absorbed and what plasma
           levels of IPdR and its major metabolite, IdUrd, are achieved after a single oral dose.

      Objectives:

        -  Measure plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and IdUrd metabolites after a single oral
           dose of IPdR

        -  Determine the safety of administering a single oral dose of IPdR.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have histologically confirmed
      solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies refractory to at least one line of standard treatment
      or for which no standard therapy is available. Patients should have adequate organ function
      and no disease-associated symptoms requiring immediate therapy or intervention.

      Study Design:

        -  Patients will receive a single oral dose of IPdR on day 1.

        -  The initial IPdR dose will be 150 mg; dose escalation will be in 100% increments to a
           maximum of 2400 mg. One patient will be accrued to each dose level until we reach the
           highest dose level. Six patients will be accrued at dose level 5 (2400 mg).
