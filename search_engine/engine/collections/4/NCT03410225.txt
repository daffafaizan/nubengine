      in preventing teen pregnancy is a necessary and central component to effecting change. Young
      men, aged 15-19 and 20-24 years, father most of the children born to teen mothers. Few
      interventions have been designed specifically or shown to be effective for young men in
      reducing teen pregnancy.

      Counseling and feedback based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) principles demonstrated
      greater success than standard, didactic advice in several domains of behavior change. The
      effectiveness of this type of counseling to alter young men's sexual and contraceptive
      behaviors has not been rigorously evaluated.

      Participants will be randomly chosen (like flipping a coin) to take part in one of the two MI
      projects, and you will get coaching and use an app for that project to improve your health.
      One project is on teen pregnancy prevention and the other is on healthy eating, physical
      activity, and avoiding cigarettes. Participants will use an app via phone to do the project,
      answer survey questions, keep track of health, and learn more about healthy behaviors.

      Three hundred young men, ages 15 to 24 years, will be randomized to one of two intervention
      arms, a modified CAMI aimed at Teen Pregnancy Prevention (CAMI-TPP) or a CAMI aimed at
      healthy diet, physical activity and tobacco avoidance (CAMI-Fitness). The two interventions
      are identical in length and timing but vary in the target behavior focus (pregnancy
      prevention versus fitness).
