      spa residential program combined with a stress management program on the improvement of heart
      rate variability in the treatment of obesity.

      In the present protocol, parameters are measured on five occasions (inclusion, at the start
      of the spa, at the end of the spa, at 6 months and at 12 months).

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be two-sided and p<0.05 will be considered
      significant. After testing for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), data will be treated
      either by parametric or non-parametric analyses according to statistical assumptions.
      Inter-groups comparisons will systematically be performed 1) without adjustment and 2)
      adjusting on factors liable to be biased between groups.

      Analysis will be performed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney tests. Linear regression
      (with logarithmic transformation if necessary) considering an adjustment on covariates fixed
      according to univariate results, epidemiological relevance and observance to physical
      activity will complete the analysis. Comparisons of categorical variables will be performed
      using Chi-squared or Fischer test. Relations between quantitative outcomes will be analyzed
      using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman). Fisher's Z transformation and William's
      T2 statistic will be performed to compare correlations between variables and within a single
      group of subjects. Longitudinal data will be treated using mixt-model analyses in order to
      treat fixed effects group, time and group x time interaction taking into account between and
      within participant variability.
