    
      This single-center cohort study is designed to retrospectively and prospectively collect
      treatment and outcome data related to patients with PE and after activation of the PERT.
      Treatment information and outcomes after advanced treatment modalities, including systemic
      thrombolysis, catheter directed thrombolysis and surgical embolectomy, will be collected.

      Retrospective patient data will consist of treatment and health related outcomes of
      consecutive patients treated for acute and chronic PE between October 2017 and April 2020 (to
      assess the learning curve of the PERT) and of patients receiving surgical embolectomy between
      January 2001 and April 2020. The retrospective data will be derived from the local
      institutional dataset and will be transferred to the study database. Prospective patients
      will be included after May 2020.
