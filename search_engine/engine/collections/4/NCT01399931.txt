      PET scan is performed only for prognostic aims.

      PET with 18F-FDG is a standard staging procedure for most lymphoma subtypes. Performed early
      during the therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) its results have a high prognostic value and
      is the main predictor of treatment outcome. From 2006 onward, interim-PET after 2 ABVD
      courses has been increasingly performed in the daily clinical practice as a routine test for
      disease prognosis, and now it can be considered as a standard prognostic tool.

      The novelty of the study relies on a new method for interim-PET scan execution: a dynamic
      study, with 2 different time points of image acquisition. This could potentially enable us to
      discriminate between unspecific, inflammatory DG uptake, from a "true" uptake form persisting
      viable neoplastic cells. Therefore, the main aim of the study is reducing false positive
      results in the interim-PET scan interpretation. Since dynamic changes of FDG uptake in
      Hodgkin's lymphoma are still unknown we propose, in the present study, to assess the by the
      same acquisition technique the pattern of FDG uptake at baseline in untreated patients
      affected by this neoplasm.

      The Institutions equipped with a Magnetic Resonance scanners and a diffusion weighted imaging
      analysis technique (DW-MRI), could participate to the DW-MRI sub-study.
