      psychiatrists. These visits include side effect monitoring, scheduled medication increases,
      and ratings designed to measure subtle improvement of symptoms. Monthly blood and urine
      samples are collected for safety and substance abuse monitoring, and neuropsychological
      testing is conducted at the first and last appointments. Participants are compensated for
      their participation and receive medication and study-related visits at no cost during the
      trial. Depending on their level of response to the medication, participants may also be
      eligible for a 3-month extension phase.
