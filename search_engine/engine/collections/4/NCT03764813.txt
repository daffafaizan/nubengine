      samples, from birth to the week 32 of postmenstrual age (PMA). To fulfill the RBC transfusion
      requirements, RBC concentrates obtained from umbilical blood of full-term healthy babies are
      utilized, if available; otherwise, RBC concentrates from adult donors are assigned. For every
      week of PMA, neonates undergo a minimum of three HbF determinations, and the median values
      are considered.
