      plays an important role in preventing myocardial infarction. It is produced by the
      endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels. Previous studies demonstrate that t-PA is
      released in response to the hormones bradykinin and acetylcholine. Impaired t-PA release upon
      bradykinin stimulation may indicate endothelial dysfunction that leads to the development of
      acute coronary syndrome. In this project, we will determine whether impaired t-PA release can
      predict future occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. The study will involve individuals
      getting routine left heart cardiac catheterizations (indication for cardiac catheterization
      is solely based on clinical indication). Prior to the procedure, patient will have two blood
      samples (5 ml each) collected from their forearm before and after 2 minutes blood pressure
      cuff inflation on their arm. After routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization and there is no
      severe coronary artery stenosis (<70% stenosis), research protocol will be initiated. Study
      includes infusion with increasing doses of bradykinin into their left main coronary artery,
      and sample small amounts of blood from their coronary sinus (15 ml total).
