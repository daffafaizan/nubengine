      IOP between 45 to 60 mmHg because it provided better visual outcome than Mannitol infusion
      through the rapid stabilization of the anterior segment, which was achieved by rapid IOP
      control, better corneal edema regression, shortening waiting time for LPI. However, ACP
      should be considered in patients with the initial IOP of 60mmHg and higher only when Mannitol
      was contraindicated.
