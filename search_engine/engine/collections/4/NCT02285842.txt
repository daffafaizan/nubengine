      resurfacing components throughout the world, including the European Union (EU). As part of
      the process for gaining approval to market in the EU, MPO is conducting this post market
      clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these components. The
      objectives of this study are to evaluate component survivorship, total functional outcome
      scores, and radiographic outcomes of implanted subjects at out to 10 years follow-up.
