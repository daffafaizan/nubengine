    
      The "PrEPare for Work" package includes two behavioral intervention components:

        1. Strengths-based case management for PrEP initiation, and

        2. Counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention that addresses individualized
           barriers to optimal use.

      Stage 1: MSW will be equally randomized to receive either the strengths-based case management
      or standard of care referral to PrEP clinic.

      Stage 2: Those from stage 1 who initiate PrEP , regardless of stage 1 randomization
      condition, will then be equally randomized to either the "PrEPare for Work" adherence
      intervention or standard of care comparison condition.
