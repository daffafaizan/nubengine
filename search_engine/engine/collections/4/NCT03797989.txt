      human P. vivax malaria infection. This will be the first time that this source of P. vivax
      infected blood will be utilised and the first P. vivax bloodstage CHMI in Europe. If
      demonstrated to be safe, it is intended that this parasitised blood bank be used in future
      CHMI studies to evaluate candidate vaccines.

      This study will also assess parasite growth, including quantifying the sexual-stage parasites
      in the blood, as well as the transmission of P. vivax from volunteers to the Anopheline
      mosquito vectors and the immune responses in primary, secondary and tertiary P. vivax
      blood-stage challenge, as further secondary aims. Natural immunity to P. vivax is acquired
      over time, following repeated exposure. Repeated blood-stage challenge would improve
      understanding of how the human immune response to P. vivax infected is acquired, and how
      parasite growth changes in a second or third exposure. Repeated challenges can also be used
      to test if potential vaccine candidates can protect against repeated malaria infection. If
      proven to be safe and feasible in this study, this will provide a basis for conducting P.
      vivax blood-stage re-challenge studies for evaluation of new vaccine candidates.

      The study is funded through The Wellcome Trust and MultiViVax, a European Commission Horizon
      2020 funded project.
