      Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) once daily for 12 months; patients in the sham
      RLIC group will be treated with the Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®)
      (60mmHg) once daily for 12 months. In the study, the RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5
      cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs
      placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5
      minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation. Sham RLIC treatment will be conducted using the
      same procedure but with a minimal inflation pressure of 60mmHg, which does not result in
      upper limb ischemia. In addition, all participants will have received their usual drug
      therapy according to local medical practice.
