      Primary

        -  To compare the effectiveness of an opioid rotation to oral methadone versus an opioid
           rotation to another long-acting strong opioid (sustained-release morphine or oxycodone)
           in controlling pain (i.e., analgesia) in patients with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the tolerability of an opioid rotation to oral methadone versus an opioid
           rotation to another long-acting strong opioid (sustained-release morphine or oxycodone).

        -  To identify a subset of patients most likely to benefit from an opioid rotation to oral
           methadone, in terms of significant improvement in pain control or opioid tolerability.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to their baseline
      opioid (morphine vs oxycodone). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are switched from their current opioid medication (oxycodone or
           morphine) to methadone. Patients receive oral methadone 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients currently receiving oxycodone are switched to sustained-release (SR)
           morphine. Patients currently receiving morphine are switched to SR oxycodone. Patients
           receive either oral SR morphine or oxycodone 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients are assessed for pain control and complete a symptom questionnaire on days 1, 8, 15,
      22, and 28.
