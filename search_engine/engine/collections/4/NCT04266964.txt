    
      The muscle excitability scale (MES) is intended for patients after spinal cord injury. The
      objective is to evaluate a motor response (muscle spasms or clones) to a sensory or motor
      stimulus. A sensory stimulus is created by thumb and pointfinger compression of cutaneous
      tissue on the inside part of the middle thigh and calf. A motor stimulus is created by
      passive movement of the lower limb to flexion and extension. The MES grades from 0 to 4
      reflect the muscle spastic or clonic tendency and the extent of this motor response (from
      isolated to generalized). Two investigators will examine a spastic motor behavior in 50
      chronic SCI subjects using MES, Modificated Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Penn Spasms Frequency
      Scale (PSFS) to verify the validity and reliability of the MES.
