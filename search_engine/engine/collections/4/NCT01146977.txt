      5.2.1. PBSCs will be collected during recovery phase after the second cycle of HDAC
      consolidation chemotherapy.

      5.2.2. For mobilization, recombinant human granulocyte- colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF,
      Filgrastim) will be given subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mcg/kg from day 9 of the 2nd HDAC
      cycle until the completion of harvesting.

      5.2.3. PBSCs harvesting will be performed via perm-cath or Quinton catheter, which will be
      inserted with fluoroscopy-guided before starting and will be removed after finishing harvest.

      5.2.4. Harvest will be initiated from the day when the peripheral absolute neutrophil count
      reach up to 0.2 x 109/mm3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected by
      leukapheresis method with 'CS-3000' (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) or other compatible machine. Cell
      collection will be performed for at least 2 days and the duration of collection can be
      extended until a target CD34+ cell dose of 5 x 106/kg (in terms of body weight of recipient)
      is collected.
