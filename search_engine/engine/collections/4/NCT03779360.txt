      are scarce, rarely based on experiments in freshly isolated human immune cells, and
      potentially contradicting. Moreover, direct immunomodulatory effects of both antibiotics have
      never been demonstrated in vivo. The Centre for Human Drug Research Biomarker lab has studied
      in depth the immunomodulatory actions of erythromycin and clindamycin in vitro. These in
      vitro experiments on primary human immune cells demonstrated that both erythromycin and
      clindamycin are able to modulate the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      upon stimulation with different immune triggers such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyI:C.
      In this current study the in vitro work will be translated to an in vivo study where it will
      be made into an intradermal LPS skin challenge model in healthy volunteers.
