      socioeconomic status, dominant sexual practices of males and epidemiological factors. For
      example, the risk of being infected with HIV during unprotected sex is two to four times
      greater for women than for men. With the use of combined antiretroviral therapies, these
      women now live longer than ever before which now faces the healthcare community with the need
      for evolving understanding of HIV and aging. However, the burden of non-AIDS related health
      problems such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers on people living with HIV/AIDS while
      aging has considerably increased. Smoking is one of the major contributing factors to these
      health problems. Rates of current cigarette smoking are substantially higher among people
      living with HIV/AIDS than the general population: 40-75% versus 19%. Women smokers living
      with HIV have a 36% higher risk for developing AIDS and 53% higher mortality when compared to
      non-smoking women with HIV. This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing
      the feasibility and acceptability of a videoconferencing smoking cessation intervention
      (video arm) for women with HIV in comparison with a telephone-based smoking cessation
      intervention (telephone arm). Both arms will receive 8, 30-minute weekly cessation counseling
      sessions plus 8-week nicotine replacement therapy. Participants will be followed up at 1, 3
      and 6 months from the target quit day. Self-reported abstinence will be verified with a
      saliva cotinine test using an Nicotine Alert test strip and the testing process will be
      monitored via mobile-phone video call.
