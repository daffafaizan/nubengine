      (STDG3) Secondary to Mutations in ELOVL4

      Study Description: Potential therapeutics for Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STDG3) have
      been proposed. Cross-sectional studies of large families suggest progressive macular atrophy
      in STDG3 but there is a paucity of longitudinal data for these patients. The overall goal is
      to establish a natural history study of STDG3.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal structure
      in STDG3 patients.

      The secondary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal function in STDG3
      patients.

      An exploratory objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in functional vision and the
      participant s perceived effect on activities of daily living (e.g., mobility).

      Endpoints: The primary endpoints are: A) the growth rate of the square root area of loss of
      the inner segment/outer segment band (EZband) obtained from spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography (SD-OCT) and B) the rate of atrophy enlargement obtained from fundus
      autofluorescence

      The secondary endpoints are: A) the change in BCVA total letters read from baseline to Year 3
      and B) the rate of loss of retinal sensitivity measured with perimetry

      Study Population: Up to 25 patients with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy 3 who are >= 10
      years of age.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patients will be seen in the
      Ophthalmic Genetics Clinic at the National Eye Institute within the NIH Clinical Center in
      Bethesda.

      Study Duration: 84 months (7 years).

      Participant Duration: 36 months (3 years).
