      study of a candidate anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic
      cells primed with heat-inactivated P. aeruginosa (PA) strain POA1 and expressing the T-cell
      costimulatory molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L). The other objective is to complete a preclinical
      development for a human study of a candidate anti-anthrax vaccine. Prior to testing the
      vaccine in humans, the Food and Drug Administration will require preclinical and Good
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) practice batches of dendritic cells. The intent of the
      leukapheresis or collecting the buffy coats is to provide the biological materials for this
      purpose.
