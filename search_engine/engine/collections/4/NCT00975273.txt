      of hypoventilation-based breathing training with a control intervention that will focus on
      breathing regularity and awareness. The two therapeutic procedures are closely matched on
      important variables such as duration and the nature of patient-therapist interaction,
      monitoring asthma related status and the medication intake, use of scientific equipment and
      monitoring devices to increase adherence, and initial plausibility. Asthma patients will be
      evaluated before, during, directly after, and at 1 month and 6 months after training. The
      primary goal of this training is to determine if a capnometry-assisted breathing training to
      raise end-tidal CO2 will produce more improvement in asthma control than a control training
      of breathing awareness. The second goal is to determine if capnometry-assisted breathing
      training for raising pCO2 will lead to higher pCO2 levels after training than before training
      on all three measures of pCO2 (the 2-hour monitoring, the standardized training sessions, and
      the homework assignments). The last objective is to determine if the clinical improvement in
      asthma outcomes for the raise-pCO2 breathing group will be greater in patients with more
      improvement in their pCO2.
