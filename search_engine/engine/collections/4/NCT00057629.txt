      and anxiety in survivors of various types of trauma. PE has been successfully implemented by
      counselors at a community rape crisis clinic (Women Organized Against Rape [WOAR]) who
      received extensive training and weekly supervision from PE experts. Such extensive expert
      involvement is not a practical model for long-term clinical practice in a community-based
      clinic. Therefore, Part 1 of this study will examine whether counselors at WOAR can maintain
      their PE implementation success with reduced expert involvement. In Part 2 of this study, PE
      will be implemented by counselors at another community clinic (Joseph J. Peters Institute
      [JJPI]) to examine its effectiveness in treating PTSD and to determine the generalizability
      of training procedures.

      Participants in this study are randomly assigned to either PE or to individual and group
      therapy. Treatment sessions are conducted weekly for 10 to 20 weeks, based on participants'
      rates of improvement. Participants are assessed before treatment, after 10 weeks, and again
      in the follow-up phase at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment.
