      available from the current CANOE birth cohorts, as well as enhanced and standardized
      environmental sampling in early life. One of the main goals of this study is to gather data
      and specimens, beginning in the prenatal periods, that will assess environmental exposures to
      toxins and microbes, and host characteristics including genetics, epigenetics, gene
      expression, the proteome and metabolome, microbial colonization and viral respiratory
      infections. The main study outcomes will be important interim conditions (e.g., recurrent
      wheeze, early multiple sensitization) that are highly associated with the development of
      asthma. Additional outcomes (perinatal outcomes, growth, neurocognitive development) will be
      collected as part of the collaborative Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
      (ECHO)-wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol.
