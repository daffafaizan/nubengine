      effects but also with systemic outcomes leading to numerous chronic comorbidities, and it is
      well known that patients benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation programs. However, the effect
      of presence of comorbidity on the outcome of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD
      is not clear. Therefore, our aim in this study is to determine the distribution of
      comorbidity in patients with COPD participating in the pulmonary rehabilitation program and
      to examine the effect of severity of comorbidy on pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes We
      included a total of 173 patients referred to the Izmir Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery
      Training and Research Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit. Comorbidities were recorded
      based on self reports. Charlson Comorbid Indexes (CCI) were calculated. Patients who defined
      at least one comorbidity were divided into two groups according to CCI; 1-3 as Group 1 and 4
      and above as Group 2. Six minute walk test, mMRC dyspnea scale, SGRQ Respiratory Disease
      Questionnaire, respiratory function tests and arterial blood gases performed for assessment
      of patients before and after 16 sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation program.
