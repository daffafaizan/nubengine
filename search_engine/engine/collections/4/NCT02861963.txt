      Reconstruction is good alternative systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts (modified
      Blalock-Taussig shunt). Main advantages is straight, symmetrical, pulsating, systolic blood
      flow in hypoplastic pulmonary artery, which stimulate growth and prepares for a radical
      repair. Taking into account the absence randomized studies in this area of medicine,
      providing investigation evaluating parameters of safety for both methodics is very actual.
