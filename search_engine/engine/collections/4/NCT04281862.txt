    
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical
      study seeks to investigate the outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral LASIK surgery with
      the treatment of a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert compared to standard of care topical
      prednisolone. All eyes will receive treatment. Additionally, all eyes will receive topical
      moxifloxacin QID for 1 week.

      Twenty patient eyes undergoing bilateral LASIK surgery will be randomized to receive either
      Dextenza (Group A) OR standard of care prednisolone acetate 1% QID for 1 week, BID for 1 week
      (Group B). The contralateral eye will receive treatment with either DEXTENZA or topical
      prednisolone as a comparator based on randomization of first eye to Group A or Group B.
      Post-operative evaluations will be performed on Day 1, Day 7, and Month 1 following surgery.
