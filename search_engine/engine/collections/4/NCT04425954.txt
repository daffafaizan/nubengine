      the postoperative recovery of retinal vascular network of the optic disc in patients before
      and at 3 months after Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar
      pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

      The optical coherence tomography angiography represents a novel and non-invasive diagnostic
      technique that allows a detailed analysis of retinal vascular features.
