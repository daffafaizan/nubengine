      important part in neurocritical monitoring systems. Currently there are studies using flow
      velocities and pulsatility index (PI) to predict intracranial pressure (ICP) and clinical
      outcome. But the use of B-mode in such prediction is not yet investigated. The purposes of
      this study are to establish the correlation among clinical data, CT findings and information
      collected by TCCS, and to predict ICP and neurological outcome using such information. The
      focus would be on 3rd ventricle size, midline shift and anteroposterior-transverse ration of
      midbrain (midbrain index) obtained by B-mode of TCCS. This study is a prospective clinical
      study targeting on 30 neurocritical patients admitted to intensive care units in one year.
      The timing of performance of TCCS will be (1) within 6 hours after admission, (2) within 6
      hours after each CT examination, and (3) when ICP is higher than 20 mmHg for more than 5
      minutes. Glasgow coma scale (GCS), heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and
      mean), body temperature, central venous pressure (CVP), brain temperature, ICP, cerebral
      perfusion pressure (CPP), mean velocity (MV) of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs),
      PI, midline shift, 3rd ventricular dimension, anteroposterior to transverse ratio of midbrain
      (midbrain index, MI) are recorded. The latter three parameters are also obtained from CT
      scans, and compared with those obtained from TCCS. Outcome is evaluated with extended Glasgow
      outcome scale (GOSE), and analyzed with previous records. This study is going to prove that
      TCCS is a safe, convenient, real-time and cheap tool in clinical care for neurocritical
      patients. It also provides prediction of ICP and clinical outcome.
