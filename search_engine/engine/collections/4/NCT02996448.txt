      aureus and Candida epithelial infections, which is thought to be due, in part, to a lack of
      Th17 cell differentiation, thus impairing epithelial immunity. Treatment of AD-HIES is
      primarily supportive with prophylactic antibiotics; however, this is limited by microbial
      resistance and intolerance of medications, and infections do still occur. Immunological
      intervention with a vaccine could improve quality of life by preventing these infections
      altogether.

      The NDV-3A vaccine consists of a recombinant protein derived from the Candida Als3 adhesion
      protein. This protein is homologous to surface proteins on S aureus and has been shown in
      preclinical studies to protect against both intravascular and subcutaneous challenge with S
      aureus. Therefore, NDV-3A represents not only the first antifungal vaccine, but also the
      first vaccine to provide cross-kingdom protection. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in healthy
      volunteers (150 receiving vaccine), the safety profile of this vaccine is very reassuring as
      the vaccine elicits a strong antibody response after a single dose in all vaccinees as well
      as a Th1 and/or Th17 response in the majority of vaccinees. We will enroll 20 healthy adult
      volunteers and 20 adults with AD-HIES in an open-label, single-dose study to assess the
      immunological response to and the safety/tolerability of the NDV-3A vaccine. We anticipate an
      increase in baseline anti-Als3 IgG within 2 weeks post-vaccination.
