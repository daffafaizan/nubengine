        -  Compare the levels of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) and
           progression-related genes in the prostate tissue of patients at high genetic risk for
           prostate cancer treated with eflornithine (DFMO) vs placebo.

        -  Determine the side effects of DFMO and compare them with the biological effect on the
           prostate gland in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to age (35 to 60 vs 61 to 70) and presence of localized cancer (yes vs
      no).

      All patients receive oral placebo daily for 4 weeks. Patients who are compliant and take the
      placebo 5-7 days each week are randomized to one of two arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral eflornithine (DFMO) daily. Treatment continues
           for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      3 years.
