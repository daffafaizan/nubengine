      epithelial cells. Clinical and radiological assessment is performed.

      hAECs developing from the epiblast as early as 8 days after fertilization, recent data
      reported indicate that hAECs possess proper osteogenic differentiation potential and a
      localized modulatory influence on the early tissue remodeling process, making these cells a
      promising stem cell source for bone regeneration after fractures.
