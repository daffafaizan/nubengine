      (or) uric acid excretion disorder. Uric acid is produced by cell metabolism and food purine
      metabolism as the end-point product. Excess alcohol and purine-rich food intake together with
      abnormal function of purine metabolic key enzyme are the main causes leading increasing serum
      level of uric acid. It has been a focus in nutritional area that a safer approach of
      preventing hyperuricemia by adjustment of nutritional intake. Primary studies found that
      proper supplement of microelements showed significant regulations in inflammation and
      oxidative stress induced by elevating level of uric acid. Therefore, this study will be
      conducted to test whether the supplement of multi-vitamins with minerals will lower the level
      of blood uric acid and improve the imbalance of microelement metabolism or not. The
      investigators will recruit 200 subjects of study who would be divided into four groups and
      accept intervention of high-dose multi-vitamins with minerals, low-dose multi-vitamins with
      minerals, hypouricemic tablets and placebo, respectively. After intervention of 3 or 6
      months, serum uric acid and purine metabolism function will be detected. This study could
      provide references for illuminating the mechanism in purine metabolism and nutritional
      measures to control the pathological development of hyperuricemia.
