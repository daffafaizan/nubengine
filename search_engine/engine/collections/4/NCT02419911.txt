    
      This is a post market, prospective, comparison study of the use of the FloShield Air System
      versus Clearifyâ„¢ Visualization System (D-HELP) during laparoscopic surgery. The study will be
      randomized across two groups, one group will evaluate laparoscopic lens cleaning with D-HELP
      during laparoscopic surgery and the second group will evaluate laparoscopic lens cleaning
      using the FloShield Air System during laparoscopic surgery. Each surgery will be captured on
      video. Study parameters will be evaluated through review of each video by an independent
      evaluator.
