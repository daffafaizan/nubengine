    
      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare whether there is a clinically
      relevant difference in airway leak pressures between the Ambu AuraGain (sizes 1.5 and 2) and
      the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Supreme. Parameters of clinical relevance such as insertion
      success rates, fiberoptic view of the glottic opening, ease and speed of gastric tube
      placement, airway stability, and peri-operative complications will also be assessed.
