      will assess neurological disorders (including Parkinsonism) and current stress. All
      participants will attend 10 weeks of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) through video
      feed on the Portland VA campus. During the week prior to the first class and the week after
      the last class, participants will complete questionnaires regarding stress, collect saliva
      samples, and, for the Parkinson's patient, monitor motor symptoms of PD using diaries and
      inertial sensors. A final visit will assess stress, neurological diseases, and Parkinsonism.
