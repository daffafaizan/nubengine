      patients treated for oropharyngeal cancers with either surgical approaches followed by
      radiation or with more recent organ-preservation protocols. The nature of the impairments is
      often resistive to treatment and results in life-long health consequences and high cost
      burden on the VA health system. Recent preliminary data have linked alterations in the
      otherwise highly stable respiratory-swallowing phase pattern relationships to the swallowing
      impairment and penetration/aspiration and in this patient group. The immediate goal of this
      clinical trial is to test the effect of a novel respiratory-swallow intervention on
      swallowing impairment and penetration/aspiration in a cohort of chronically dysphagic
      veterans following treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. Patients presenting with a
      "non-optimal" respiratory-swallow phase pattern during liquid swallows and measurable
      swallowing impairment will learn an "optimal" physiologic pattern that facilitates both
      airway protective and mechanical advantages during swallowing. The broad goal of this
      research is to develop ideal respiratory-swallowing phase training methods and regimens that
      alone or combined with traditional swallowing treatments improve swallowing function in the
      acute phases of recovery and improve long term patient outcome. Our intention is to use these
      preliminary data to motivate a larger clinical trial to compare the effect of
      respiratory-swallow phase training with other evidenced based methods of swallowing treatment
      and expand the approach to other patient groups that have indications of respiratory-swallow
      phase impairments (e.g. pulmonary disease and stroke) contributing to impaired swallowing
      function
