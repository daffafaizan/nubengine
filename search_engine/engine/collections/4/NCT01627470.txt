      emergency medicine, AP needs to be monitored repeatedly or even better, continuously. This is
      usually done using an oscillometric pressure device (NIBP). A number of studies emphasise the
      importance of continuous AP monitoring as more than 20% of all hypotensive episodes may be
      missed by NIBP and another 20% are detected with delay. Prolonged hypotension precedes 56% of
      perioperative cardiac arrests and is associated with a significant increase of the 1-year
      mortality rate, indicating that NBP monitoring especially in patients with cardiovascular
      diseases might be insufficient independent from the clinical setting. Recently, a monitor for
      continuous non-invasive AP monitoring (CNAPâ„¢ Monitor 500) was introduced. It was shown that
      during procedures with high risk of hypotension NIBP missed significant more hypotensive
      episodes than CNAP. At the moment we have no evidence of the performance of CNAP in the
      preclinical emergency medicine. The evaluation against the gold standard of invasive pressure
      measurement in this study will help us to evaluate the performance of CNAP in the preclinical
      setting.
