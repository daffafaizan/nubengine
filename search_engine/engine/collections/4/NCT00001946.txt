    
      Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a developing technology for the
      non-invasive evaluation of arterial and venous structures which does not require x-ray based
      catheter angiography. While dramatic progress in MRA has recently been made, there are still
      substantial limitations in the accuracy of MRA in grading stenoses and detecting small
      accessory vessels. The purpose of this study is to recruit patients with documented
      atherosclerotic disease as confirmed on catheter angiography performed at Suburban Hospital
      for evaluation with state-of-the-art MRA on MRI units, also at Suburban Hospital. We intend
      to test new surface coils, new pulse sequence designs, and advanced image processing
      algorithms in order to improve MRA accuracy to the point that a large-scale study of MRA vs.
      conventional angiography is possible. The goal of this pilot study is to improve MRA to the
      point that it can reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography in the evaluation of
      patients with atherosclerotic disease.
