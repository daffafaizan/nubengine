      in fact have signs suggestive of vestibular dysfunction as the cause of chronic nausea and
      vomiting. Our prior retrospective study identified a population of said subjects.

      The aim of this study is to further characterize the concomitant symptoms, course of
      diagnosis, treatment and long-term follow up (up to 5 yrs) of this condition.
