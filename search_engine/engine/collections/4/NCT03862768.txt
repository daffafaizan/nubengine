      complete remission rarely happens. Besides, drug resistance can occur during the treatment
      and the median time of drug resistance is about 20-24 months. Once drug resistance occurs,
      the patient's condition will progress rapidly. As a salvage treatment, the effect of
      increasing the dose of imatinib or switching to sunitinib is very limited. Progress after
      imatinib treatment usually involves two conditions, focal progression and extensive
      progression. For local progression, all resistant lesions can be completely resected;
      extensive progression refers to resistance progression in multiple sites, and progressive
      lesions cannot be completely removed. The present study is aimed to assess the benefits of
      surgical resection of imatinib-resistant lesions in patients with localized disease.
