      usual care. Five milligrams (200,000 IU) of cholecalciferol is injected to intervention group
      before stem cell transplantation. Additional supplementation of cholecalciferol during
      follow-up period is determined according to the level of 25(OH)D3. The primary outcome is the
      incidence of chronic GVHD which is determined according to IBMTR criteria. The secondary
      outcome consists of the incidence of acute GVHD, incidence and severity of vitamin D
      deficiency, and serum concentration of 25(OH)D3. Study investigators expect that
      supplementation of vitamin D may improve the outcome of stem cell transplantation by reducing
      the incidence of chronic GVHD.
