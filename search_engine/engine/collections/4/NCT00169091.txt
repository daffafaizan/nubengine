    
      This is a longitudinal double blind, 2- 5 year study of the clinical, neuroendocrine and
      biochemical response to clozapine (CLOZ) and haloperidol (HAL) in a group of "first episode"
      schizophrenic (RDC) patients. Within the protocol, we compare the differential effects of the
      two drugs over the short term (12 weeks) and the long-term (2-5 years); we evaluate the
      relationship between change in prolactin level and clinical response of the patients; and we
      search for biochemical predictors and correlates of clinical response. To achieve the study
      aims, we employ a drug-washout period, a 12-week acute treatment period; and an 88 - 260 week
      follow-up period.
