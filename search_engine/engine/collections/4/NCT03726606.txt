    
      To compare the clinical performance, quality of vision and subjective outcomes between the
      extended depth of focus (EDOF) Mini Well Ready intraocular lens (IOL) and the diffractive
      trifocal PanOptix IOL, at 3 months following second eye implantation.

      Statistical analysis

      All data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v23
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Graphs will be made using SPSS and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft
      Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Normality will be tested for using the Shapiro Wilk test. If the
      data is normal, an independent t test will be used for comparing the continuous variables
      between the groups. If the data is not normal, then we will utilize the Mann Whitney U test.

      Sample size calculation

      The sample size calculation was based on the mean binocular Uncorrected Near Visual Acuity
      (UNVA) tested at 40cm under photopic condition. A previous study on the same diffractive
      trifocal IOL revealed a binocular UNVA of 0.01 Â± 0.087 logMAR (12). The anticipated mean
      value for Mini Well Toric Ready is 0.10 logMAR. Based on these assumptions, an alpha of 0.05
      and power of 0.8, it was calculated a number of 15 patients implanted bilaterally for each
      group. Assuming a dropout rate of 20% on the primary outcome measure, this resulted in a
      total number of 36 bilateral patients, 18 each group.

      Duration of the project: Six months to one year
