      device is closed vitrification with closed storage and the second device is open
      vitrification with closed storage. Oocyte acceptors receive oocytes from both devices. With
      the increase in cooling rate generated by the open vitrification (second device), we expect
      to get an increase in survival rate of 10%. Besides this, embryo quality will be assessed
      with oocytes obtained from both devices.
