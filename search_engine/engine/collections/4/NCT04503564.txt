    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, home-use feasibility study of device performance,
      usability, tolerability, and safety of the Capillary Biomedical, Inc. (CapBio) Achilles
      infusion set for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump therapy) in
      up to 20 participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

      The CapBio Achilles infusion set is a sterile single use device designed to be used with
      commercially available infusion pumps (e.g., Medtronic MiniMed). The investigational Achilles
      infusion set contains a coil reinforced soft polymer indwelling cannula with one distal and
      three proximal holes.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine feasibility and device performance of the
      CapBio Achilles infusion set over 2 extended home use wear periods of up to 7 days each
      during routine therapeutic insulin infusion. Feasibility is evidenced by the absence of
      uncontrolled hyperglycemia and/or suspected infusion set cannula occlusion.
