      randomized, blind, crossover design. Yogurt formulations will be administered two hours after
      the ingestion of a standardized breakfast, as a snack. Yogurt formulations include:

        -  Control cascara yogurt with 0% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 3% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 7% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 13% dietary fiber.

      The study will be conducted in 4 sessions, with at least 48h of washout period between
      treatment days. Data on gastrointestinal tolerance, satiation and sensory acceptance will be
      taken on the same day of the treatment using online surveys.
