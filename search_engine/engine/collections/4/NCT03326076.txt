      determines there is a need to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney
      transplant recipients. The DART study suggests that use of the non-invasive AlloSure test to
      measure donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) can be used to discriminate active rejection
      in a renal transplant recipient. Use of the test may reduce invasive percutaneous renal
      biopsy procedures among patients with a suspicion of rejection.

      Amendment 1 (A1) is intended to enable the development of KidneyCareÂ® which is a panel test
      which includes the clinically validated commercial AlloSure dd-cfDNA test, combined with
      AlloMap Kidney which is a peripheral blood gene expression profiling test currently under
      development, and iBox, which is an analytic platform that predicts allograft survival at 3,
      5, 7 and 10 years using a proprietary software algorithm based on a number of clinical
      inputs. The AlloMap Kidney and the iBox components are not yet clinically validated and so
      will not be used for patient management and are being developed through this study.
