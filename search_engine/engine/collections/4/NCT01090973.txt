      Based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria to non-hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) (Cheson, JCO 1999) a complete hematologic remission will be defined as the
      following:

        -  Disappearance of all evidence of disease.

        -  Any positron emission tomography (PET)+ mass prior to therapy must be PET negative after
           treatment.

        -  No palpable spleen or liver

        -  If bone marrow involvement prior to therapy, must document clear bone marrow.

      Partial response will be defined as:

        -  No new areas of disease on clinical exam and regression of previous areas of disease

        -  Greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the size of prior disease areas per measurement
           on computed tomography (CT) scan

        -  No new PET+ areas on PET scan

        -  No increase in size of liver or spleen

      Response Assessment for CLL

      Using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria, a complete hematologic remission will be
      defined as having the following present for 2 or more months:

        -  Absence of symptoms attributable to CLL

        -  Normal findings on physical examination

        -  Absolute lymphocyte count <4000/microL

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1500/microL

        -  Platelet count >100,000/microL

        -  Hemoglobin concentration >11 g/dL (untransfused)

        -  Bone marrow lymphocytosis <30 percent

        -  No nodules (lymphoid aggregates) on bone marrow biopsy

      A partial response per the NCI criteria will be defined as having the following for 2 or more
      months:

        -  A reduction in previously enlarged nodes, spleen, and liver by at · least 50 percent and

        -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/microL or

        -  Platelet count ≥100,000/microL or

        -  Hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dL or

        -  50 percent improvement over pretherapy reductions in hemoglobin concentration and/or
           platelet count
