      genetic predisposition. The target population is males (40-70 year old) carrying a BRCA1
      and/or BRCA2 germ line mutation. They will be identified via our Genetic counseling unit. All
      men after signing an informed consent will undergo the following tests: PSA, free to total
      PSA, MRI of prostate and prostate biopsy. The primary endpoint will be to estimate the
      prevalence, stage and grade of prostate cancer in this population. Additionally, the study
      aims to estimate the impact of these germ line mutations on benign prostatic hyperplasia.
      Furthermore, this study aims to create a bio-bank of tissue, urine and serum of this unique
      cohort for future investigations. Finally, this study will identify an inception cohort for
      future interventional studies of primary and secondary prevention.
