      participate in the Phase I portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of
      an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the
      intervention is being studied.

      Palbociclib is an oral drug which has been shown to stop the cell cycle, which is the way a
      cell initiates growth. Binimetinib is also an oral drug which stops a signal that a cell
      receives, instructing it to grow. By putting these two drugs together the investigators hope
      that it will have a greater affect on cancer growth than either drug alone. The FDA (the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved binimetinib as a treatment for any disease.
      The FDA has not approved palbociclib for use in lung cancer but it has been approved for
      other cancer types.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test the combination of these two drugs, Palbociclib and Binimetinib, in order to
           determine a safe and tolerable dose of the combination

        -  Determine the response rate of the combination

        -  Further evaluate the safety and side effect profile for the combination of palbociclib
           and binimetinib.
