      antibiotics, with stable FEV1 40-100% predicted were enrolled in a four week long pilot study
      where-in each patient consumed 40 grams of flaxseed each day, in the form of finely ground
      flaxseed, however they wished. Prior to starting flaxseed, each week, and then four weeks
      after each patient had finished taking flaxseed, markers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress, as well as measurements of flaxseed metabolism were collected. F2-isoprostanes,
      8-oxo-dGuo, as well as cytokines including IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g among others were measured to
      trend flaxseed effects. Enterolignans - enterodiol and enterolactone (products of flaxseed
      metabolism) were measured each week as well.
