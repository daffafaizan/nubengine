      combination with either docetaxel or cyclophosphamide as primary therapy regimens in patients
      with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and operability. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV followed by doxorubicin IV once every 3
      weeks. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV once every 3 weeks.
      Patients receive a maximum of 6 courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression
      and unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery (if operable) followed by more
      chemotherapy (if node positive), radiation therapy, and oral tamoxifen for 5 years (at the
      discretion of the investigator for estrogen receptor-negative patients). Patients are
      followed at 12, 18, and 24 months, and then annually for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients (175 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
