      world, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7.2%-9%. Because some patients are resistant to
      multiple chemotherapy drugs, and there are differences in drug sensitivity between
      individuals, the current pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) chemotherapy effect is not
      satisfactory. In order to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and achieve precise treatment,
      it is important to establish an accurate and individualized PDAC research model.

      At present, several studies have reported that surgical specimens of pancreatic cancer are
      successfully used to cultivate preclinical research models. However, most patients with PDAC
      have developed to advanced stage at the time of diagnosis and are not suitable for surgery,
      which limits our ability to obtain tumor cells. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle
      biopsy (EUS-FNB) can procure specimens when patients have not receive any treatment, and can
      also evaluate the therapeutic effect and tumor progression in the process of treatment.

      Until now, there is no study to compare the efficiency of the two methods in constructing
      preclinical research model of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the investigators intend to
      investigate the difference in the success rate of culturing primary cells derived from PDAC
      specimens of patients which obtained by EUS-FNB wet suction technique and surgery, analyze
      whether the sensitive chemotherapeutic agents screened by the primary cells cultured from the
      specimens obtained by the above two methods are consistent, and whether they are consistent
      with the clinical treatment effect of patients, verify the accuracy of laboratory drug
      sensitivity results, so as to provide the basis for PDAC patients to choose the source of
      individual treatment samples.
