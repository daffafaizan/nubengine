      reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with healthy counterparts.
      The mechanisms underlying the exercise deficit in T2DM remain largely unknown, but previous
      work has suggested that reduced exercise blood flow and impaired submaximal VO2 may be
      contributing factors. Both of these findings are consistent with a peripheral impairment of
      skeletal muscle oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, or both. Indeed, dysfunction of skeletal
      muscle metabolism plays a key role in the pathophysiology of T2DM, and considerable work has
      described abnormalities of oxidative function in the skeletal muscle of people with T2DM.
      Given this, it is likely that the causes of exercise intolerance in T2DM may relate to
      specific defects at the level of the skeletal muscle, particularly given that skeletal muscle
      blood flow and oxidative capacity are impaired in diabetes. However, to our knowledge, no one
      has related these peripheral muscle abnormalities to the diminished exercise function in this
      patient group.

      The overarching hypothesis for the proposed research is that both a failure to adequately
      increase muscle oxygen delivery following the onset of exercise and reduced oxidative
      function of skeletal muscle contribute to the acute oxygen deficit and diminished exercise
      tolerance that has been observed in patients with T2DM.
