      innate immune response. As is known, the immune system is not mature in children and it is
      reverse related to the age of children. An reasonable hypothesis is that the lactate is a
      independent risk factor in the children with viral infection progress to bacterial infection.
      Here, our aim is to test the hypothesis.
