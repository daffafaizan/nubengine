      informed consent before their randomization. Before the first CEA, the patient will have MRI,
      US, and EBCT exams of both carotids. The most occlusive plaque will be resected at the first
      CEA. The patient will then receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 3 months. Then the second CEA
      will be performed. Six weeks after the second CEA, the patient will have another MRI, US, and
      EBCT exam and at 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter. This protocol will allow comparison of the
      characteristics of the plaque that has been exposed to drug vs the plaque that has not been
      exposed. It will also allow monitoring the effect of drug on restenosis after surgery.
