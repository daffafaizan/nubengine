      acetabulum and proximal femur since anatomic landmarks are crucial for correct orientation of
      the prosthetic components. All surgeons are taught that a wide surgical exposure is one of
      the most important factors in performing successful THA. Traditionally, it was impossible to
      achieve accurate fixation and orientation of the components without complete visualization of
      bony landmarks. These extensile exposures facilitate accurate implant alignment, but at the
      expense of more extensive soft tissue dissection. Little clinical research has been
      undertaken to relate the surgical approach to postoperative complications or patient
      function. Furthermore, despite the good overall results of THA, the recovery time to improved
      function can be lengthy. Blood loss is expected to be directly related to the extent of the
      surgical exposure and to influence patients outcomes. Based upon these facts, an important
      principle of arthroplasty surgery is to minimize the amount of soft tissue trauma while being
      able to achieve the surgical goal of reconstructing the arthritic hip joint. By definition,
      minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures result in less soft tissue disruption, which in
      turn should reduce pain, expedite healing, decrease recovery time, and potentially reduce the
      number of associated complications.
