      200 patients: 100 with BoneMaster HA, 100 without BoneMaster HA. Up to 10 sites globally will
      be used to fulfill enrollment in this study.

      All cases enrolled will be those implanted with either the Cone, Broached, or Calcar Proximal
      Body and one of the five distal options (Slotted, Bullet-tip, Interlocking, STS, or ETO).

      To be included in the study, a patient must have received a revision total hip arthroplasty
      with the Arcos system. The Arcos system is to be used in accordance to the indications for
      use and contraindications detailed in the approved labeling of the device.

      Study time perspective:

      Collection of retrospective data in supplement to the data collected in the course of the
