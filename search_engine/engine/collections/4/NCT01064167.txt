      postoperative bleeding seems to be attenuated by the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB), hemorrhagic complications are not completely eliminated and the consequent need for
      allogeneic transfusions are still major problems after OPCAB.

      Tranexamic acid, a synthetic antifibrinolytic drug, has been shown to reduce blood loss and
      transfusion requirements in cardiac surgery with CPB. About 30% of patients in OPCAB studies
      still receive a transfusion. A few small sample size studies concerned with the use of in
      OPCAB surgery, found that tranexamic acid appear to be effective in reducing postoperative
      bleeding, however, the results on transfusion requirements are still inconsistency. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of tranexamic acid on the postoperative
      bleeding and transfusion requirements in a larger number of patients undergoing OPCAB
      surgery. In addition, the effect of tranexamic acid on mortality, morbidity and resource
      utilization was examined.
