      from poor enrollment and retention rates. Pediatric trials are particularly difficult because
      scheduling around the parent, participant and potentially other sibling schedules can be
      burdensome. We are evaluating using the internet and mobile devices to conduct the consent
      process and study visits in a streamlined pediatric asthma trial. Our hypothesis is that
      these study processes will be noninferior and will be less expensive compared to a
      traditional pediatric asthma trial.

      Materials/Methods Parents and participants, aged 12 through 17 years, complete the informed
      consent process by viewing a multi-media website containing a consent video and study
      material in the streamlined trial. Participants are provided an iPad with WiFi (wireless
      internet) and EasyOne spirometer for use during FaceTime visits and online twice daily
      symptom reporting during an 8-week run-in followed by 12-week study period. Outcomes are
      compared with participants completing a similarly designed traditional trial comparing the
      same treatments within the same pediatric health-system. After 8 weeks of open-label Advair
      250/50 twice daily, participants in both trial types are randomized to Advair 250/50, Flovent
      250, or Advair 100/50 given 1 inhalation twice daily. Study staff track time spent to
      determine study costs.

      Results Participants have been enrolled in the streamlined and traditional trials and
      recruitment is ongoing.

      Conclusions This project will provide important information on both clinical and economic
      outcomes for a novel method of conducting clinical trials. The results will be broadly
      applicable to trials of other diseases.
