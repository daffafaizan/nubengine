      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response [CR] +
      partial response [PR]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of
      metastatic serous ovarian cancer across all patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response [CR] +
      partial response [PR]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of
      metastatic serous ovarian cancer within patients that have overexpression of PKCiota.

      II. To estimate progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events from the
      combination of auranofin and sirolimus.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PKCiota-relevant biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer tumors are
      associated with treatment response patterns, such as ORR, progression free survival, and
      overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive auranofin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and sirolimus PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
