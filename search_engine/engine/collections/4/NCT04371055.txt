      recent ischemic stroke leads to a decrease in recurrent thromboembolism (defined as recurrent
      ischemic stroke or systemic embolism). This will be achieved by identifying patients with
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and subsequently switching secondary prevention therapy from
      antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation. The intensity of heart rhythm monitoring will
      be risk-adjusted: Patients with an estimated low risk of atrial fibrillation receive a 7-day
      Holter ECG, which is repeated after 3 and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with a
      high risk of atrial fibrillation (defined by increased supraventricular ectopic activity)
      receive continuous ECG monitoring using an implanted loop recorder. The control arm is
      treated according to local standards, which includes cardiac rhythm monitoring for at least
      24 hours according to current guidelines. Prior to randomization, a 24-hour Holter ECG is
      performed in both study arms, ensuring minimal ECG monitoring for patients in the control arm
      and allowing risk stratification in the intervention arm. Additional ECG monitoring using
      stroke telemetry and/or additional Holter ECGs is possible according to local standards,
      provided it does not exceed 7 days. Patients in both study arms will be followed up for at
      least 24 months.

      It should be noted that this study only provides diagnostic information, the therapeutic
      decision is left to the treating physician.
