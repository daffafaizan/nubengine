      parallel group, comparative study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the
      following treatments:

        -  TCZ 8 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) + MTX (Group I: TCZ+MTX)

        -  TCZ 8 mg/kg + placeboMTX (Group II: TCZ+placebo)

        -  MTX + placeboTCZ (Group III: MTX+placebo)

      Randomization was stratified by participating center and baseline Disease Activity Score,
      scoring 28 joints (DAS28) level (<5.1 vs. â‰¥5.1). Patients were evaluated every 4 weeks and at
      each visit a decision on dosage changes was made based on efficacy parameters (DAS28) and
      occurrence of adverse events (AEs). Patients received MTX/placeboMTX in climbing dosages.
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was added when remission was not reached with the maximum tolerable
      dosage (MTD) of MTX/placeboMTX. If after 12 additional weeks remission was not reached, HCQ
      was stopped and replaced by standard of care therapy (in Group I) or placebo therapy was
      replaced by the corresponding verum resulting in TCZ+MTX combination therapy (in Groups II
      and III). In case remission was reached, MTX/placeboMTX and TCZ/placeboTCZ had to be
      decreased. Patients were followed for a maximum of 24 months
