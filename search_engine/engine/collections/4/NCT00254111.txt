    
      Osteoarthritis of the hand is a disease that breaks down the cartilage and causes formation
      of new bone around the joints of the hand, resulting in pain, discomfort, and often lowered
      ability to move the affected joints. Existing methods of treatment for osteoarthritis of the
      hand include oral and topical medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, assistive
      device use, braces and surgery. This study is intended to evaluate the effectiveness of
      at-home use of a low level laser device in reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the
      hand.

      Comparison(s): Active low level laser units in addition to rescue pain medication, compared
      to non-active ('fake') low level laser units in addition to rescue pain medication.
