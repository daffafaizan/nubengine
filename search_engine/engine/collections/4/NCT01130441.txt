      family, school and friends. Psychiatric symptoms also played a role (Lin, 2002) .
      Incarcerated adolescents with poor coping adjustment will be referred to psychologists. The
      psychologists were trained by the juvenile detention adolescent psychiatrist.

      Taiwanese adolescents have very high rate of self-harming activities, furthermore,
      incarcerated adolescents are expected to have a higher rate of self-harming activities. There
      are few studies done on self-harming activities, suicidal intent and coping style of
      incarcerated youth in Taiwan. According to a study on self-harming adolescents in a juvenile
      correctional facility, these youth have higher rates of suicide attempts and use more violent
      methods of attempt than adolescents in the general population (Penn, 2003). They also have
      poor problem-solving skills. We hope to study their suicidal ideations, self-harming
      behaviors, and coping styles in order to offer appropriate and timely intervention. We can
      then offer skills to deal with similar triggering events in the future.

      Furthermore, it is hoped that recidivism can be reduced after psychopathological
      intervention.
