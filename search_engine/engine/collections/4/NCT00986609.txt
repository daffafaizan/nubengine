      I. To evaluate the efficacy of MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine in boosting systemic
      immunity to MUC1 in women who have completed therapy for AJCC(American Joint Committee on
      Cancer)stage I-III 'triple-negative' [i.e., ER(-) PR(-) HER2/neu(-)] breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the MUC1 peptide and poly-ICLC vaccine in this
      cohort of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MUC-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and poly-ICLC vaccine SC in weeks
      0, 2, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients
      may receive a booster vaccine in week 52. Patients will be followed for study-related Serious
      Adverse Events (SAEs) for a period of 30 days after their last vaccination. If a patient
      experiences a SAE while participating in this study, they will be followed until the
      resolution of the SAE.
