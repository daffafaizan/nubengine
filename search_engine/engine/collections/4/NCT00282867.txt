      have elevated glucose levels upon admission to the hospital, and hyperglycemia is associated
      with poor outcome for post-stroke patients. It is unclear if treatment of hyperglycemia or
      glucose lowering improves outcome, however, in animal stroke models and other human
      conditions, aggressive glucose lowering is beneficial.

      The goal of this multicenter trial is to determine if tight control of blood glucose is
      beneficial in hyperglycemic patients with acute ischemic stroke. In the trial, researchers
      will compare intravenous (IV) glucose insulin and potassium (GIK) therapy plus meal insulin
      to control therapy in 72 stroke patients.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups-(1) the control group with a
      target glucose level of <300mg/dL; (2) the tight control GIK plus meal insulin group with a
      target of <110mg/dL; or (3) the loose control GIK plus meal insulin group with a target of
      <200mg/dL-with all groups avoiding glucose levels of <70mg/dL.

      The specific aims of this study are to collect preliminary data on the safety and feasibility
      of GIK for treatment of hyperglycemia in acute stroke patients, and to collect preliminary
      data comparing tight GIK therapy with loose GIK therapy and control therapy. Information
      learned in this study will compliment ongoing work and allow for maximum efficiency in the
      design of future treatment trials.
