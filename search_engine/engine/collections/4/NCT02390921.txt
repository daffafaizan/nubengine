      orally administered iron in female patients previously undergone bariatric surgery (gastric
      bypass) currently receiving parenteral iron therapy chronically.

      The hypotheses are:

      (i) .- A significant percentage of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have iron deficiency
      and chronic complication. In the investigators series, approximately 100 women require
      intravenous iron therapy in a chronic (10% of all patients undergoing bariatric surgery to
      date), significantly increasing costs.

      (ii) .- The liposomal form of iron does not depend on gastric pH and increased
      bioavailability is not dependent on the presence of the digestive dudodeno circuit.

      (iii) .- Increased iron absorption and tolerability allow us to remove chronic intravenous
      iron therapy in the case of these patients. Thus, majoraria quality of life by reducing
      healthcare costs and avoiding adverse reactions associated with the procedure.

      Main objective: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of oral iron liposome female
      patients previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require parenteral replacement
      therapy for chronic form.

      Secondary objectives:

      (i) .- To evaluate the change in the levels of Hb, ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation at
      4, 12 weeks of treatment.

      (ii) .- Lay the foundation for future study of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
