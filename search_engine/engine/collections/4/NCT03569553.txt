    
      This study is a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to evaluate safety and clinical
      benefit of AIGIV administered to patients as part of their medical care after inhalational
      exposure to Bacillus anthracis. Study information (i.e. data on safety and clinical benefit
      evaluation of AIGIV up to Day 30 following administration) and patient samples (for
      assessment of AIGIV pharmacokinetics and anthrax toxin levels) will be collected (up to Day 7
      following AIGIV administration) prospectively to the extent possible; however, due to
      logistical complexities that will likely occur during a mass anthrax exposure event, most
      data for this study will be collected retrospectively (including scavenged patient samples
      for assessment of serum AIGIV concentration and anthrax toxin levels). Therefore, both
      prospective and retrospective data collection are allowed in this study to maximize the
      amount of information obtained from inhalational anthrax patients who have been administered
      AIGIV.
