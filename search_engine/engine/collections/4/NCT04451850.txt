      Cincinnati (UC). We will screen adult patients newly diagnosed with PAH and placed on
      targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy by their treating physician for enrollment.

      We will enroll 35 eligible participants over a two-year period. HRV will be measured using
      the Polarâ„¢ H10 wearable chest actigraphy device in conjunction with analytic software to
      capture HRV data.

      After enrollment and completion of the baseline visit, study participants will receive chest
      actigraphy device to measure their heart rate for a two hour period twice a week during study
      participation. Follow up research visits will be conducted at one-month, 3-months, and
      6-months to sync the actigraphy device and assess any AE's.

      In-between these visits, study staff will communicate with participants at two weeks, two
      months, 4 months, and 5 months, to identify and address any issues with study actigraphic
      device, assess any adverse events and maintain regular contact with study participants.

      Throughout study participation, subjects will continue routine clinical care at the direction
      of their treating physician as needed.
