      construction, which is most frequently presented as sacralized L5 or lumbarized S1. LSTV
      would alter the kinetics of the spine thus induce inadequate mobility and dynamic
      compensation. Patients with LSTV were commonly found when they visited clinicians for
      treatment of low back pain. Prolotherapy is a technique that stimulates the body to repair
      the painful area by assistance of injecting an otherwise non-pharmacological and non-active
      irritant solution into the body.
