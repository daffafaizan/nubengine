      (CBF) contribute to the pathophysiology of bipolar depression (BD). Pentoxifylline is a
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor that improves CBF and has potent anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant effects. We therefore hypothesize that pentoxifylline may have antidepressant
      effects in BD. We will conduct an 8-week, open-label, single-armed, feasibility study
      assessing clinical and neurobiological effects of adjunctive pentoxifylline in the acute
      treatment of BD. Feasibility will be determined by evaluating recruitment/retention rates,
      target engagement (e.g., changes in biomarkers with pentoxifylline treatment) and preliminary
      efficacy testing with 6 participants. Evaluating pentoxifylline's effects may further our
      understanding of BD pathophysiology and help identify novel treatment targets.
