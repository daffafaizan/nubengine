      of microencapsulated preparations of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a
      long-acting local anesthetic administered into post-extraction sites prior to pain onset.
      Subjects (N=84) will have two mandibular impacted third molars removed and be randomly
      allocated to receive one of six possible treatments placed into the sockets: 0 mg (placebo
      formulation), 3.125 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, or 25 mg flurbiprofen, or 50 mg bupivacaine. Each
      patient in these six groups (N=12/group) will also receive an oral placebo capsule. The
      seventh group of subjects will receive a placebo at the extraction sites and 25 mg of
      flurbiprofen orally. Subjects will remain at the clinic for six hours following drug
      administration to record every 30 minutes the offset of mandibular anesthesia, postoperative
      pain intensity, side effects, and for observation of recurrent bleeding. Demonstration of a
      dose-responsive relationship for flurbiprofen at doses lower than needed for analgesia
      following oral administration will provide the basis for a second study in which an optimal
      dose of flurbiprofen will be combined with bupivacaine.
