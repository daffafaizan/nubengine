      Group A: intravenous infusion of liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, d1; carboplatin AUC 5 (dosed
      according to the Calvert formula, with creatinine clearance estimated according to the
      Cockcroftformula), intravenous infusion, d1; once every 21days, 3~6 cycles for early stage
      patients and 6 cycles for late stage.

      Group B: intravenous infusion of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, d1; carboplatin AUC 5, intravenous
      infusion, d1; once every 21days, 3~6 cycles for early stage patients and 6 cycles for late
      stage. Treatment was initially administered for three cycles, and patients with stable or
      responding disease continued treatment for further a three cycles.

      The main purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liposomal doxorubicin plus
      carboplatin in the first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint is
      progression free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS),
      objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR):CR+PR+SD, the incidence and
      severity of adverse reactions and health-related quality of life (HQL) assessment.
