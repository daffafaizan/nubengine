      I. Compare the genetic profile of the tumor after progression has occurred, to the tumor
      prior to treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Additional molecular patterns, beyond genetics, will be analyzed, including ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) and protein expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue and blood samples are collected for genetic analysis via sequencing from patients
      receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation. Chemotherapy is not part of the protocol. Per
      standard of care, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride (IV) the first 3 of 4 weeks (qw
      3/4 wk) or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation IV qw 3/4 wk in the absence of disease progression or recurrence.
