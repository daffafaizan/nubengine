    
      This study is a post-market randomized study whereby each patient will receive 1 to 4
      implants placed in the posterior maxilla or mandible. The primary objective of this
      randomized open study is to evaluate the performance in immediate and delayed loading (4
      weeks) of Straumann standard solid screw 4.1mm and the 4.8 mm diameter wide neck implants
      with a new surface. These implants will support single crowns or 2 to 4 unit bridge
      restorations in the posterior maxilla or mandible and the treatment will be evaluated for the
      immediate and delayed loading procedures at one year post surgery. Patients will be allocated
      into two groups and then randomized into immediate or delayed loading arms.
