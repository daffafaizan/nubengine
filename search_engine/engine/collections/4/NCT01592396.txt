    
      Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes inflammation, airways
      hyper-responsiveness (directly and through recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells),
      mucus hypersecretion, airway remodeling via fibrosis, increased immunoglobulin E (IgE)
      synthesis and mast cell activation.Tralokinumab (CAT-354) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)
      anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to potently and specifically neutralize
      IL-13 in preclinical models.This study will evaluate the PK profile of a single dose of
      tralokinumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg in adolescent subjects with
      asthma to be compared with the PK data from completed studies in adults.
