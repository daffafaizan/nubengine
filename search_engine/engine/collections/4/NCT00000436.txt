    
      The specific aims of this project are to (a) implement an intervention program of patient
      education focused on self-efficacy (the belief that one's actions are responsible for
      successful outcomes) and strength training designed to improve the postoperative
      rehabilitation of older persons (65 years of age and older) who have sustained a fracture of
      the hip; and (b) evaluate in a randomized trial the efficacy of this intervention program to
      improve the overall postoperative functional status of such patients and decrease the rate of
      their subsequent institutionalization.

      The study will also (a) describe and document the risk factors for functional deterioration,
      recurrent falls, and subsequent institutionalization in a cohort of such patients; (b) assess
      self-efficacy beliefs and their ability to influence and predict postoperative functional
      capacity in such patients; and (c) document the costs associated with implementing the
      program and generate data that can provide the basis for subsequent cost-benefit analysis.

      We hypothesize that (a) a program of patient education focusing on self-efficacy and strength
      training can improve the functional capacity and reduce the rate of institutionalization of
      older persons following hip fracture; and (b) clinical, psychosocial factors, muscle
      strength, and balance are multifactorial determinants of functional capacity, recurrent
      falls, and subsequent institutionalization in hip fracture patients.

      We will randomize 200 patients who have sustained a primary unilateral hip fracture to the
      multiple-component intervention program of patient education and high-intensity strength
      training or to standard medical care. The intervention program will comprise four major
      components: (1) an in-hospital postoperative patient instruction protocol conducted prior to
      discharge with the patient and a family member or caregiver; (2) a hospital-based, 8-week
      program of high-intensity isokinetic strength training for patients; (3) an at-home walking
      program designed to enable patients to maintain strength and physical activity following the
      hospital-based portion of the intervention; and (4) supportive telephone calls through which
      patients and their families or caregivers will have regular and ongoing contact with a
      hospital-based interventionist, as well as other hip fracture patients.

      The principal outcome is within-patient change in the physical, social, and role function
      subscales of the SF-36. Secondary measures of outcome, including muscle strength, balance,
      functional status on the Cummings Scale, activities of daily living, recurrent falls, and
      rate of institutionalization, will be assessed at baseline and 1 year post-discharge.

      The long-term objective of the project is to improve the overall functional capacity and
      reduce both recurrent falls and the need for institutionalization of hip fracture patients
      through development and evaluation of an intervention program whose feasibility and cost have
      the potential for application in a wide range of institutional settings involved in the
      treatment and rehabilitation of such patients.
