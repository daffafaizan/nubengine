      in which progressive ataxia of gait, limb dysmetria, oculomotor deficits, dysarthria and
      kinetic tremor are the prominent clinical manifestations. Both the hereditary and sporadic
      forms usually present in young adulthood, and are characterized by atrophy of cerebellar or
      brainstem structures. Currently, cerebellar ataxia lack effective disease-modifying
      therapies.

      Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique, which
      has been demonstrated to modulate cerebellar excitability and improve symptoms in patients
      with cerebellar ataxias. The present randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study followed
      by an open-label phase will investigate a repetition of two-weeks' treatment with cerebellar
      anodal tDCS and spinal cathodal tDCS, after a three months interval, may further outlast
      clinical improvement in patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and can modulate
      cerebello-motor connectivity, at short and long term. In addition the investigators will
      evaluate if tDCS intervention might improve cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome in
      patients with ataxia.
