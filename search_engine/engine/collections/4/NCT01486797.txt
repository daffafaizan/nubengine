      migration and adhesion to stromal cells secreting the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (or
      stromal-derived-factor 1, SDF-1). NOX A12 is a specific CXCL12 antagonist and may improve BR
      therapy by disrupting CXCR4-CXCL12 interactions, thereby mobilizing CLL cells from protective
      tissue microenvironments to the blood. Furthermore, SDF-1 inhibition may alter the activation
      status of CLL cells, thereby triggering apoptosis or sensitization of CLL cells towards
      chemotherapy.
