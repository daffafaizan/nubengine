      have symptoms during this period. Hormone therapy is the recommended therapy for menopause
      and there is not enough evidence in favor of alternative medicine's effect.

      Our pilot trial showed that electroacupuncture had better effect for menopause transition
      symptoms than sham electroacupuncture. We are going to conduct a phase â…¡ clinical trial to
      further evaluate the safety and effect of electroacupuncture for menopause transition
      symptoms.
