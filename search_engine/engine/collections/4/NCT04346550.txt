      in acutely inflamed gallbladder, partly because of feared higher conversion rates to open
      procedure and presumed increased risk of complications. There are fewer local studies to
      elaborate the role of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acutely inflamed
      gallbladder. This study was conducted to analyze the role of routine use of drains after
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acutely inflamed gallbladder. Does it offer any advantage in
      detecting bile leak or bleeding. Also to prove that placing drains prolongs the hospital stay
      and increases postoperative pain in comparison to patients in whom drain is not placed.

      After being informed about the study and the potential risks, all patients giving written
      informed consent, underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy using conventional 4 port method.
      Patients were divided in two groups by lottery method. Group A - no drain group and Group B -
      drain group. Post operatively parameters of pain and total hospital stay were assessed and
      analysed.
