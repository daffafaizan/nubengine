      KÃ¶benhavn" (ALK), and after one year of treatment, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-antibody levels
      towards the crude allergen and important allergen components in birch and grasspollen
      (timothy) will be measured in blood. While IgE- antibodies are considered to be an indicator
      of allergy IgG- and IgG4-antibodies are considered to be "blocking" antibodies in
      IgE-mediated allergy. Therefore the investigators will measure the IgG- and IgG4-antibody
      levels to crude allergens and applicable allergen components before start, when maintenance
      dose is reached (after 6 months) and after one year of treatment. In order to evaluate
      quality of life, a validated form (DISABKIDS) will be used. Symptom score will be rated by a
      validated form (LILA). The need for medication to treat allergic rhinitis and asthma will be
      assessed using questionnaires. A conjunctival provocation with the applicable allergen(s)
      will be performed before start of SCIT and after one year of treatment.
