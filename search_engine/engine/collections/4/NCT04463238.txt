      repair 730 days (2 years) is the main indicator of this trial. In this experiment, we observe
      the improvement of Lysholm score, VAS score, ratio change of regenerated cartilage T2 value
      to normal cartilage T2 value, and ratio of regenerated cartilage △R1 value to normal
      cartilage △R1 value Indicators such as value changes are secondary evaluation indicators.
