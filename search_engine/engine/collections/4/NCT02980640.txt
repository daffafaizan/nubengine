      the aim to document the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as the quality of
      life of persons living with MS in Switzerland. The Swiss MS Registry pursues a "Citizen
      Science" approach, that is, persons with MS are not just study participants but also act as
      MS experts and are active contributors to the interdisciplinary Swiss MS Registry research
      network. Initiated and funded by the Swiss MS Society, the Swiss MS Registry represents a
      collaborative effort by numerous MS caregivers, researchers and persons with MS. It is hosted
      by the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute at the University of Zurich.

      How many MS-affected persons are living in Switzerland and how are they coping with MS in
      their daily lives? What is the current situation with regard to access to and use of drug and
      non-drug treatments for MS? These and other questions are addressed by means of semi-annual
      surveys. Further research activities concern the quality of life of persons with MS,
      mobility, personal resources and support by friends and family, work situation, mental
      health, clinical progression of MS, as well as alternative therapies.

      Owing to a flexible study design, participants can decide between different levels of
      commitment (from one-time surveys to repeated, semiannual surveys and medical records
      review). Furthermore, study participants receive summaries of their data as charts and
      tables. Data collection primarily occurs via a newly designed online platform, but
      paper-and-pencil questionnaires are also available. As an additional incentive, the online
      platform includes a diary with basic capabilities for analyses and printing.
