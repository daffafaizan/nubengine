    
      a Phase IV, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two study groups:
      postoperative standard of care with opioid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and IV
      lidocaine infusion versus postoperative standard of care plus normal saline placebo. Block
      randomization into one of the two groups will be based on a random table generated using an
      R-program. Group 1 (Study) will receive intravenous lidocaine during and after posterior
      spinal fusion for AIS. Group 2 (Control) will receive saline placebo during and after
      surgery.
