      glucose contributes to severe hospital complications and even death. Insulin infusions appear
      to reduce this risk, but are generally only continued for a few days after surgery. In this
      study, we will determine the proper method for transitioning patients from a continuous
      insulin infusion to periodic injections of a newer long-acting insulin called detemir
      (Levemir). 90 patients who have undergone recent open heart surgery and are requiring an
      insulin infusion will be enrolled. They will be randomly assigned to one of three doses of
      detemir, which consists of 50%, 65%, or 80% of the total daily insulin infusion requirement
      in the fasting state. Subjects will also receive identical mealtime coverage according to the
      amount of carbohydrate (glucose) that is ingested. It is expected that the high dose group
      will achieve superior glycemic control without excessive hypoglycemia.
