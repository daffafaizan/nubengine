      regret and longing that usually decrease over time. However, some people have difficulty
      adapting to the loss and develop Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). An open clinical trial will
      be conducted to investigate the feasibility [initial efficacy and acceptability] of an
      Internet delivered cognitive behavior treatment (ICBT) for adult people diagnosed with
      prolonged grief disorder (PGD). There will be at least 24 participants that will be randomly
      assigned to experimental group (internet-based treatment for PGD) or active control group
      (traditional face- to-face intervention for PGD). Four assessment moments will be included
      (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 months follow-up and 12 months follow-up). The present
      study aims to improve knowledge about the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy
      of an ICBT for PGD and conduct a preliminary comparison between two intervention conditions
      (internet-based intervention vs. traditional face-to-face intervention). Also, the
      investigators aim to collect information that can help to improve the efficacy and
      acceptability of Internet-based interventions in general.
