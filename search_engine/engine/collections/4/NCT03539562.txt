      early or prodromal labor to relieve the patient's discomfort and allow for progression of
      labor while the patient rests. No prospective studies exist which examine the safety and
      clinical utility of therapeutic rest in early labor, and no published studies examine the
      potential benefits of therapeutic rest from the perspective of either patient satisfaction or
      cost-effectiveness. The investigators aim to determine whether therapeutic rest using
      morphine and promethazine is associated with variations in labor characteristics, or
      obstetric or neonatal outcomes as well as patient satisfaction with this form of pain
      management.

      Methods: This will be a prospective cohort study. Women who are eligible for therapeutic rest
      (reactive non-stress test, normal amniotic fluid, in prodromal or early labor as defined by
      obstetric provider, and plan to discharge home after evaluation) will be recruited for the
      study. Participants will receive routine obstetric care by providers who are unaware of
      patient enrollment. A research assistant will then approach all participants in the
      postpartum period, prior to discharge from the hospital or with a phone call if permitted by
      the patient, to complete a questionnaire including patient satisfaction items. Chart review
      will be performed to determine differences in hospital stay and common obstetric and neonatal
      outcomes to compare these data among women who do and do not choose to receive therapeutic
      rest. These results will provide insight into a common clinical practice, helping to not only
      guide management at institutions where therapeutic rest is commonly utilized but also
      potentially encourage its initiation at hospitals were therapeutic rest is not available.
