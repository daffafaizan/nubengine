      oxaliplatin-based therapy.This parallel group randomized controlled pilot clinical trial
      aimed at investigating the feasibility and preliminary effect of henna on CIPN in women
      receiving oxaliplatin-based therapy. This trial was conducted in the chemotherapy outpatient
      clinic of University Hospital located in Turkey. All patients were women who received
      oxaliplatin-based therapy in the oncology clinic every fifteen days.

      In order to calculate the sample size, it was decided to recruit 30 female patients to each
      group (intervention and control) using the G.Power-3.1.9.2 program. A total of 60 female
      patients were included in the study.

      The study consists of two groups. In the intervention group, after the 2nd and 3rd
      chemotherapy cycles, henna application was applied to the hand-foot and toes. The control
      group underwent only the routine treatment.

      To collect data, a personal information form and Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
      Assessment Tool (CIPNAT) were used.
