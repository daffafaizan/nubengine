      use of various drug combinations.However, these combinations carry the risk of e.g.
      infection, malignancy, renal damage, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hirsutism,
      cushingoid facial appearance and bone necrosis.Therefore one of the major goals should be to
      reduce immunosuppression without increasing risk of rejections.

      Based on good results of a pilot study (not a single acute rejection episode during the 18-20
      months observation period despite low level of Tacrolimus and absence of steroids) this
      randomised trial was designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Campath-1H.
