      DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine. At the age of 10 months, 50% of each group received a plain PRP
      challenge to assess the immune memory to PRP. In this booster study in the second year of
      life, all subjects who received DTPw-HBV/Hib and plain PRP will receive DTPw-HBV as a booster
      vaccination. All other subjects will receive as booster the same vaccine they received in the
      primary vaccination study.
