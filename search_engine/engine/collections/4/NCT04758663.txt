      adults, naps following sleep deprivation have significantly elevated slow wave activity (SWA;
      1-4 Hz) relative to naps following normal overnight sleep (Werth et al., 1996). Similarly in
      preschool children, overnight sleep following nap deprivation yields significantly greater
      SWS relative to when a nap was taken earlier in the day (Lassonde et al., 2016). This impact
      on subsequent sleep physiology suggests that naps may be an extension of overnight sleep. How
      napping status (i.e., habitual and non-habitual napping) impacts overnight sleep physiology
      and subsequent memory consolidation is unknown. Thus, this study aims to investigate how
      napping vs. staying awake in habitual and non-habitual napping children may impact overnight
      sleep physiology and subsequent memory consolidation.
