    
      First, subjects will be asked to answer a brief medical questionnaire pertaining their
      general health status: since some of the subjects will be self-assessed to be "healthy" (no
      medical examination will be conducted to determine if this is indeed the case), the
      questionnaire will be used to determine if there are any possible known causes of poor
      balance performance. The questionnaire will not constitute an inclusion/exclusion criterion,
      it just has a classification purpose.

      Subjects will then be asked to fill in the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), scoring
      each of the 25 items on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always).

      Then, subjects will stand for 2 minutes on a compliant surface (a 4" tall foam cushion of
      known mechanical properties) to "learn" how to stand on it. Afterward, they will undergo
      posturography testing using the extended modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in
      Balance (ext_mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be required to stand on a hard or compliant
      surface in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, arms to the
      side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing normally, with head straight, turned
      right or left, flexed or extended.
