    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the optimal dose of post-transplant immunosuppression comprising high-dose
           cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil administered after myeloablative
           conditioning chemotherapy comprising busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by
           allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with high-risk hematologic
           malignancies.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine disease control in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to age (â‰¤ 19 years old vs >
      19 years old).

        -  Myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy: Patients receive busulfan IV or orally 4 times
           daily on days -7 to -4 OR days -6 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour once daily
           on days -3 to -1 OR days -2 and -1.

        -  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppression therapy: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
           days 3 and 4.

      After completion of study transplantation, patients are followed at 30 and 60 days, 6 months,
      1 year, and then annually thereafter.
