      experimental device will be investigated regarding Sound Quality perception ot the T-Coil
      program. A secondary objective of this study is the investigation of the Overall system
      stability in daily life situations. The experimental device contains direct connectivity
      functionality and a T-Coil. The combination of a wireless chip for Bluetooth streaming and a
      T-Coil in one housing can cause audible artifacts on the T-Coil, which shall be investigated
      within this study. This will be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at
      Sonova AG Headquarters based in St√§fa (Switzerland).
