    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097
      (RO4929097) when given in combination with fixed-dose Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 (GDC-0449)
      which will become the recommended dose for the phase II portion of this study. (Phase Ib) II.
      To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination of RO4929097 with and
      without GDC-0449 in two arms of patients with advanced sarcoma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the tolerability and adverse event profile of daily GDC-0449 administered
      orally in combination with daily RO4929097 administered orally for 21 consecutive days.
      (Phase Ib) II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of the combination of the combination of
      GDC-0449 and RO4929097. (Phase Ib) III. To assess Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 overall response rates (complete and partial response [CR+PR]) for
      combination therapy. (Phase Ib and II) IV. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies in tissue
      biopsies (pre- and post-study) for explorative and hypothesis-generating studies. (Phase Ib
      and II) V. To assess overall survival. (Phase II) VI. To further describe the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of GDC-0449 and RO4929097 at the
      phase II dose at the continuous schedule. (Phase II) V. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies in
      tissue biopsies (pre- and post- study drug[s]) for explorative and hypothesis generating
      studies. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097 followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE IB:

      PART A: Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

      PART B: Beginning within 7 days of finishing part A, patients receive vismodegib PO and
      gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on
      days 1-21.

      ARM II: Patients receive vismodegib PO and gamma-secretase/notch signalling pathway inhibitor
      RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-21.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
