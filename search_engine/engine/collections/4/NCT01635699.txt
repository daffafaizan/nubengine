      obstruction and a decrease in blood oxygen saturation as sleeping. uvulopalatopharngoplasty
      (UPPP)is one of the surgical approaches applied to the patients with OSAS, since the
      oxidative damage markers have been found high in patients with OSAS. Although antioxidant
      levels were higher in patients with OSAS than those in normal population, there is report
      about the effect of UPPP on antioxidant status in patients with OSAS. We performed this study
      to confirm whether is there a We performed the present study to confirm whether there is a
      relationship between the OSAS and oxidative damage before and after UPPP.
