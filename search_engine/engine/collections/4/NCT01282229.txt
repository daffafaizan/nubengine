    
      This multi-center study of the Laser Assisted New Attachment Procedure (LANAP protocol) using
      the FR Pulsed Nd:YAG laser compared to Scaling and Root Planing alone, Modified Widman Flap
      (MWF) surgery, and Coronal Debridement (CD) alone will utilize a single-blind, four-quadrant
      split-mouth design with MWF as the positive control, CD as a weak positive control and SRP as
      the standard treatment control. The study will be conducted at three (3) to five (5)
      investigational centers. Subjects will receive the Laser Assisted New Attachment Procedure
      (LANAP protocol) using the pulsed FR Nd:YAG laser, Scaling and Root Planing alone, Modified
      Widman Flap surgery, and Coronal Debridement alone each in one quadrant of their mouth at
      Baseline. Treatment modalities are randomly assigned to quadrants at the time of treatment.

      Efficacy evaluations, including clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), and
      bleeding on probing (BOP) will be performed at Baseline, month 6, and month 12 using a
      Florida Electronic Probe. Radiographs will be taken at Screening/Baseline and at month 6 and
      month 12.
