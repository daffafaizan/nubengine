        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent head and
           neck cancer treated with irinotecan and docetaxel.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate angiogenesis markers and cyclooxygenase-2 expression with response and
           survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate UGT1A1 genotype with the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (no prior chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease or more than 6 months
      since prior chemotherapy as primary therapy vs 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for locally
      recurrent or metastatic disease or less than 6 months since prior chemotherapy as primary
      therapy).

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-72 patients (16-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 6-14 months.
