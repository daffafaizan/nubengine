      prevalence ranging from 24% to 44% and is a strong negative prognostic marker. Several
      studies have explored whether interventions to improve anemia result in better outcomes.
      Thus, alternatives to allogenic red cell transfusion have been suggested in hip fracture,
      such as IV iron and tranexamic acid.

      The aim of the study is to test the effect of combination of IV iron with tranexamic acid
      before and after surgery for hip fracture on incidence of peri-operative red cell
      transfusion.

      It is a prospective randomized single-blinded monocentric study including 150 patients
      undergoing hip fracture surgery within 72 h after trauma aged â‰¥ 60 years divided in 3 groups:
      Group A (IV fer+Tranexamic acid), Group B (Tranexamic acid), Group C (placebo). The main
      outcome was percentage of patients who receive red-cell transfusion during hospitalization.
      Hemoglobin levels up to 60 days post-operatively and incidence of thrombotic events were
      secondary outcomes.
