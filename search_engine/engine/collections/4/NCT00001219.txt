    
      Background:

      MRI is a constantly evolving imaging modality. Pulse sequences are often modified to improve
      their performance. However, many of these changes have not yet been approved by the FDA and
      therefore, are not considered standard of care. Some of these sequences require the use of
      new types of imaging coils, which are also investigational.

      Objectives:

      The major purpose of this protocol is to inform patients undergoing MR scans in the Clinical
      Center that they be scanned with MRI sequences and/or coils which may or may not be FDA
      approved and to get the patient s consent for this. This is not a formal research study since
      specific disease entities and specific pulse sequences are not studied in a systematic way.
      Rather, the purpose is to give NIH patients access to gradual improvements in MR technology
      that would otherwise not be available to them.

      Eligibility:

      All patients who, by virtue of the NIH protocol in which they are enrolled, qualify for MRI
      will be eligible for participation in this protocol.

      Design:

      Up to 99,999 participants will be enrolled in this study.
