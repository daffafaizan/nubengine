      bell-shaped dose response curve. However, human studies with buprenorphine have not shown
      such an effect, although controlled studies have generally not tested higher acute doses of
      buprenorphine. Current clinical recommendations generally place an upper limit of daily
      buprenorphine dosing at 32 mg of sublingual tablets, although considerably higher acute doses
      have been administered to humans (primarily in clinical studies of less than daily dosing).
      Determining the relationship between higher doses of buprenorphine in humans and effects
      produced would be valuable; it would be scientifically interesting to demonstrate a
      bell-shaped curve in humans, and it would help guide clinical practice (for example, with
      respect to dosing, safety, and side effect considerations. The purpose of this study is to
      characterize the dose response curve for buprenorphine in humans, utilizing acute single
      doses of parenteral buprenorphine.
