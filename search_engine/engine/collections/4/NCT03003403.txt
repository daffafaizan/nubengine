      treatments are not available in primary care. Balance, a pragmatic effectiveness trial, will
      test a scalable treatment approach for medically-vulnerable adults, those who suffer
      disproportionately from obesity and its adverse health effects. Balance builds on the design
      and findings of the Shape study (NCT00938535) to test a pragmatic intervention within rural
      community health centers. Balance will randomize overweight adults and adults with obesity
      who are patients a local community health center network (Piedmont Health Services) to
      either: 1) a 12-month weight gain prevention intervention or 2) usual care. Intervention
      group components include tailored behavior change goals; mHealth self-monitoring and
      feedback; skills training videos; and stepped responsive coaching from clinic Registered
      Dietitians. The usual care group will receive standard primary care offered by their
      providers and automated text messages and health information about maintaining a healthy
      weight. All intervention components and materials will be provided in Spanish or English.
