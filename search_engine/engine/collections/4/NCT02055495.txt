      treatments for symptomatic planovalgus feet: lateral column lengthening osteotomy and
      subtalar arthroereisis. The goal of the investigators was to compare the outcomes of these
      two surgeries and determine whether both treatments resulted in clinical improvement. This
      was accomplished through the use of pre- and post-operative kinematics, pedobarography,
      radiographic measurements, and validated outcome measures. The investigators were
      particularly interested in analyzing the kinematic changes to quantify the changes in the
      foot mobility and alignment during ambulation, as it has not been previously studied to our
      knowledge. The investigators hypothesis was that both procedures would show significant
      improvement and be equivalent in their results.

      A prospective trial was conducted. The investigators enrolled fifteen patients (mean age
      12.8y, 24 feet) with painful, planovalgus feet refractory to conservative treatment. Seven
      patients (13 feet) were enrolled in the arthroereisis group, and eight patients (11 feet)
      were enrolled in the calcaneal lengthening group. Though not specifically excluded, none of
      the enrolled patients had an underlying neuromuscular diagnosis. Kinematic motion analysis
      was performed on each patient prior to surgery and at one year of follow-up. Pedobarometry
      studies, radiographs, and validated outcome questionnaires (Oxford Ankle-Foot Questionnaire
      for Children) were also performed to evaluate the outcomes of both groups.
