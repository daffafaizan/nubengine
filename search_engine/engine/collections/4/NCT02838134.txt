      the consequences of postoperative pain and analgesia consumptions. The use of deep
      neuromuscular blockade (NMB) has shown to reduce postoperative pain scores after laparoscopic
      surgery. With this study the investigators will investigate if deep NMB also improves the
      early quality of recovery after LDN.

      Objective: To establish the relationship between the use of deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB)
      during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) - with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum - and
      the early quality of recovery.

      Study design: A multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled trial

      Study population: 96 adult patients (18 years or older), scheduled for living donor
      nephrectomy, will be randomized into a group with deep or moderate neuromuscular blockade.
      Deep neuromuscular blockade is defined as post tetanic count 1-2.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measurement will be the Quality of
      Recovery-40 questionnaire (overall score) at 48 hours after extubation.

      Secondary outcomes measured are: intra-operative parameters (e.g. surgical conditions,
      operation time, length of pneumoperitoneum, first warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss,
      conversion to open or hand-assisted donor nephrectomy, intra-operative complications,
      cumulative use of rocuronium and sugammadex), the total score of the quality of Recovery-40
      questionnaire at 48 hours after extubation, post-operative pain (components of pain scores);
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (NRS), the cumulative use of analgesics and anti-emetics,
      time to reach discharge criteria and postoperative complications.
