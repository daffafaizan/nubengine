      neuromuscular centers. Modern diagnostic techniques, including skin biopsies and autonomic
      nervous testing, are helping to find SFN in many patients with undiagnosed pain syndromes
      including even fibromyalgia. The prevalence is rising for SFN, and an immune etiology may
      underlie up to 20% of cases. There is mounting evidence that Intravenous Immunoglobulin
      (IVIG) can cause pain reduction and improve objective nerve fiber densities on skin biopsies
      in great numbers in SFN patients. They would be spared the side effects of steroids. But
      neither IVIG nor any other immunosuppressant has been studied in a randomized clinical trial
      to demonstrate efficacy. Trisulfated disaccharide IdoA2S-GlcNS-6S (TS-HDS) and fibroblast
      growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) serum antibodies are novel antibodies being discovered in
      large numbers of otherwise cryptogenic SFN cases. The hypothesis of this double-blinded
      placebo-controlled Phase II trial is that IVIG is effective in improving biopsies as a
      primary endpoint, and in improving pain, SFN symptom and disability scales, objective
      neuropathy physical exam scores, and antibody titers as secondary endpoints. Given the
      demonstrated prevalence of SFN and especially this novel autoimmune syndrome, this trial
      could have impact on thousands of patients.
