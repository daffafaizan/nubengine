      each year. Hospital studies have shown that many patients who suffer an in-hospital cardiac
      arrest (IHCA) have been deteriorating for the preceeding 48 hrs and suggest that many IHCA
      are potentially avoidable if this deterioration is identified and actued on promptly. No
      similar study has been performed to see if patients suffering OHCA have also presented with
      warning signs in the preceeding 48 hrs that were overlooked.
