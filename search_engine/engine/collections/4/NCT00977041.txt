    
      During this phase of the study, research personnel will provide up to 15 of the subjects with
      SCI-related pain with a full course (up to 40 sessions) of NF training to determine the
      effects of this treatment on (a) chronic daily pain, (b) EEG-assessed frequency band
      amplitudes, and (c) other measures of quality of life (specifically, sleep quality, fatigue,
      and pain interference).

      Standard NF training procedures will be used that involve simply asking participants to relax
      while looking at the feedback screen and to "Do whatever is necessary to make and keep the
      color bar wide." EEG bandwidth activity that is associated with being pain-free or with
      experiencing less pain will be reinforced. This protocol will be repeated for up to 40
      30-minute sessions, scheduled at least weekly (but more often if the participant and study PI
      can arrange this with their schedules. Brain wave activity will be measured three times
      during the study: once before treatment begins, once immediately after treatment ends, and
      three months following treatment. Research staff will collect data regarding pain intensity
      and quality of life from subjects via the telephone three times: before treatment,
      immediately after treatment, and three months after treatment ends.
