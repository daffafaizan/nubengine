abscopal effects of whole-bodyx-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophyof the rat kidney.the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), andhypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys wereobtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  theeffect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiationto the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following therate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratioof kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days ofhypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent overnormal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.  foranimals 6-14 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy the correspondingincrease was only about 20 per cent.following uninephrectomy and x irradiation with 1000 rad to theexteriorized remaining kidney, 4 week old rats whose bodies werelead-shielded during irradiation showed no body weight growthretardation, no significant difference in the dna content of thekidney, and a small but significant decrease in weight incrementof the hypertrophying kidney after 21 days.rats exposed to 500 rad of x rays with the kidney shielded duringirradiation, when compared with nonirradiated controls, showed bodyweight growth retardation, a reduction in the dna content of thekidney, and a reduction in the amount of kidney hypertrophy 21 daysfollowing uninephrectomy.  a still greater inhibition of both kidneycompensatory hypertrophy and the increase in dna content of thekidney occurred after 500 rad whole body irradiation.food restriction in nonirradiated 4 week old rats resulting inbody weight growth retardation, elicited a marked reduction inkidney weight and in dna content of the hypertrophying kidney 21days after uninephrectomy.it is concluded that the reduction in kidney hypertrophy followingwhole body x irradiation with 500 rad is due in some measure to anabscopal or indirect effect, secondary to decreased body weight.
