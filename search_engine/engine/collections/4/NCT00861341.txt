      be ingested and another blood sample will be obtained 90-180 minutes later for platelet
      aggregation. After 6-9 days, subjects will ingest 81mg of aspirin. Another blood sample will
      be obtained 2-24 hours later for baseline determination of platelet aggregation and
      activation after taking aspirin. Subjects will then ingest 30mg pioglitazone and a final
      blood sample will be obtained 90-180 minutes later to measure platelet aggregation.
