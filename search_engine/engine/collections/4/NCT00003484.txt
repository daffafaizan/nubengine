        -  Determine the toxicity of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 81C6 delivered via the
           intracranial resection cavity in patients with newly diagnosed primary malignant brain
           tumors after surgery and radiotherapy.

        -  Determine objective therapeutic responses of these patients to this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of iodine I 131 antitenascin monoclonal antibody
      81C6 (I 131 MAb 81C6).

      Within 2-4 weeks after completion of external beam radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical
      resection of the tumor or brain metastasis, at which time an indwelling intracranial
      resection cavity catheter is placed. A single dose of I 131 MAb 81C6 is delivered via the
      intralesional catheter.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of I 131 MAb 81C6 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      After the MTD has been established, patients in the phase II portion of the study receive
      therapy as in phase I.

      Beginning 4 weeks after the monoclonal antibody treatment, patients begin chemotherapy.
      Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once
      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression.

      Patients are followed initially at 4 weeks, then every 6 weeks for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.
