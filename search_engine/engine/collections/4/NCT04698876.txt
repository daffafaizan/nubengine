    
      The SALUS project is developing an outpatient, intersectoral form of care in which patients
      measure their intraocular pressure in their home environment with a so-called self-tonometer.
      The measured intraocular pressure values are incorporated into daily pressure profiles, which
      can be viewed via an electronic case file together with further examination data both by the
      treating ophthalmologists in the doctor's offices and clinics and by the patients. The new
      form of care not only supports the telemedical networking of doctors but also increases the
      compliance by involving the patient in the entire course of the illness.
