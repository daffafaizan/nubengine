      cholesterol in the adrenal glands of males and females. It is also sold as an
      over-the-counter dietary supplement, and seems to have anticorticosteroid effects. DHEA
      antagonizes the effects of corticosterone on hippocampal function in rats and reduces
      responses to neural stress in mice. In our lab we have found that administration of the DHEA
      to rats during antecedent hypoglycemia, preserves counter-regulatory responses to subsequent
      hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study is to determine if the same response occurs in
      humans.
