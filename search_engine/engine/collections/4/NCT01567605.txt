      cardiovascular changes triggered by bowel care in people with spinal cord injury.

      In people with spinal cord injury, episodes of high blood pressure are common during strong
      sensory stimuli such as those present during routine bowel care. These episodes of high blood
      pressure can be dangerous due to the magnitude of blood pressure increase and because they
      can be accompanied by irregular heart beats. This condition, known as autonomic dysreflexia,
      is most common in individuals with high-level injuries.

      The experience of autonomic dysreflexia can vary widely between individuals: some have
      goosebumps, sweating, facial flushing or headaches, while others have no symptoms at all,
      despite their changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

      The use of a lubricant gel containing an anesthetic, lidocaine lubricant, is the standard of
      care in many hospital facilities when performing bowel care for individuals with spinal cord
      injury; however, it is not often used in the home setting. It is thought that using
      anaesthetic might reduce the cardiovascular effects of bowel care after spinal cord injury.
      However, it is not known whether this is the case. We do not yet know the long-term
      consequences of these short-term elevations in blood pressure during autonomic dysreflexia,
      but given that they are often associated with discomfort, and have been known to be
      associated with more severe events such as stroke, it would be beneficial to reduce their
      occurrence.

      Therefore, we will test whether lidocaine lubricant compared to a placebo lubricant improves
      the symptoms and signs of autonomic dysreflexia during bowel care in people with spinal cord
      injury.
