      gateway and server concomitant with standard-of-care cardiac telemetry monitoring for non-ICU
      hospitalized patients on a selected nursing ward at the Cleveland Clinic Heart and Vascular
      Institute. All patients will receive routine clinical care on the basis of the traditional
      telemetry monitoring using the usual processes. The patch monitor data will not be reviewed
      in real-time, and only analyzed post hoc for agreement with the standard-of-care.
