      221 veterans with advanced cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) or end stage renal disease (ESRD) were randomly assigned to one of
      three intervention groups and completed a brief battery of pre-test measures. Subjects in the
      first group ("Outlook Intervention") were randomized to meet with a facilitator three times
      for a period of 45 min-1 hour. Participants were asked in the first session to discuss issues
      related to life review. They were asked in the second session to speak in more depth about
      issues of regret, forgiveness and things left undone. The subject of the final session was
      heritage and legacy. Participants in the attention control group were randomized to meet with
      a facilitator three times for a period of 45 min- 1 hour and listen to a non-guided
      relaxation audio disc (CD). Participants in the third group ("treatment as usual") were
      exposed to no interventional sessions. Participants were assessed with post-test measures
      administered by a blinded interviewer one week and 3 weeks after the intervention window.
