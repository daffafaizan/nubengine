      an improved version of it, in which new intervention techniques were added, pointing out the
      importance of improving some self-concept dimensions in reducing symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. In order to prove this, the study design will include two active intervention
      groups; a standard transdiagnostic intervention protocol will be delivered to one group and
      an improved version of the same transdiagnostic protocol will be delivered to the other
      group. The new added techniques targets some self-concepts, namely self-compassion,
      unconditional self-acceptance and self-esteem. The main goal of the study is to concurrently
      test effectiveness of these two transdiagnostic approaches in reducing symptoms of anxiety
      and depression and improving the above-mentioned self-concepts. This non-inferiority trial
      has the power to detect an effect size larger than Cohen's d = .40 (including 20% attrition
      at post-test and 6 month follow-up)
