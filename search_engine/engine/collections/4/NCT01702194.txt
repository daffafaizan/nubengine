      evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations
      and the absolute oral bioavailability of TD-1211. The administration of radiolabeled drug is
      necessary to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD 1211, providing
      further quantitative information on the disposition of TD 1211. The results from this study
      will allow a more comprehensive comparison between animal and human routes of elimination and
      metabolic profiles of TD 1211.
