      therapy in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Radioligands currently in use with PET
      for studying human brain 5-HT(1A) receptors in clinical research or drug development are
      based on WAY-100635. Though variously effective, they each suffer from one or more drawbacks
      with respect to measuring relative regional receptor densities. These drawbacks include:
      rapid metabolism and very low non-specific binding for [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635;
      defluoridation for [18F]trans-FCWAY. Therefore, we have recently developed [(11)C](-)-RWAY as
      an alternative radioligand for brain 5 HT(1A) receptors. Even though similar to WAY-100635,
      [(11)C](-)-RWAY has a reversed amide linkage. Reversal of the direction of the amide bond may
      confer resistance to amide hydrolysis and make acceptable easy labeling at its O-methoxy
      group. In the present protocol, we plan to perform a kinetic brain imaging study in healthy
      human subjects to measure 5 HT(1A) receptors in brain regions with [(11)C](-)-RWAY.
