      the T.A.L.O.N. Intraosseous System to establish sternal intraosseous infusion. This study
      will also evaluate the user preference feedback received from the device operators about the
      ease of use and level of satisfaction with the device. Lastly, this study will evaluate the
      infusion flow rates obtained when using intraosseous infusion in the sternum.
