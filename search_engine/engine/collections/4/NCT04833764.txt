    
      Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a significant complication that occurs up to 75% of
      patients after DVT. Rosuvastatin is a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory
      effects. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      combination standard anticoagulation therapy (e.g. Factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban,
      apixaban) and three months of 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban and its efficacy as prophylaxis
      against PTS after lower extremity DVT. After the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT with either
      duplex venous ultrasound or other imaging, study participants will initiate standard
      rivaroxaban therapy as per standard medical care. All consented participants in this trial
      will receive three months of rosuvastatin (20 mg daily dose). Assessment of post thrombotic
      syndrome follow up will continue for 365 days from the time of DVT diagnosis or until
      resolution or stabilization of any clinically significant drug related adverse event, after
      which they will be considered off-study.
