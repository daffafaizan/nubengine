      been the gold standard over many years despite high rates of infection and soft tissue
      complications.

      Lately, there has been a trend towards less invasive fixation methods. Minimally invasive
      plate osteosynthesis using the sinus tarsi approach (STA) has gained popularity during the
      last decade.

      Furthermore, percutaneous reduction and fixation techniques have been described and used for
      a few decades. In the early 2000s, Rammelt et al. were the first who introduced a
      percutaneous technique assisted by hindfoot arthroscopy. The percutaneous and
      arthroscopically assisted calcaneal osteosynthesis (PACO) is applicable in Sanders II and III
      fractures and has been shown to provide good clinical outcomes as well as a low rate of
      complications.

      The study is designed as a non-inferiority study. Our hypothesis is that the percutaneous and
      arthroscopically assisted technique provides non-inferior outcomes compared to the sinus
      tarsi approach in Sanders II and III calcaneal fractures.
