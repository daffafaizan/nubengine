      at best, it is still unclear whether there is not a more substantial positive effect in a
      subset of patients, potentially identifiable by imaging markers. Allowing for prediction of
      good or bad responder from anti-angiogenic therapy prior to treatment completion is important
      to select patients most likely to benefit from anti-angiogenic treatment.

      This is a prospective observational study and no active comparator will be used. Study
      participants include adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      We hypothesized that quantifying changes in multi-modal advanced MR imaging techniques would
      allow early treatment response and long-term prediction in glioblastomas.
