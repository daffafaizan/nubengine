    
      The study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride in combination with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and
      Prednisone in the frontline treatment of patients with PTCL by conducting in two stages,
      Dose-finding stage and Dose-expansion stage.In Dose-finding stage, patients with
      treatment-naïve PTCL will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of liposomal
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride ranging from 12 to 18 mg/m2 plus Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and
      Prednisone (28 days per cycle). The dose escalation will follow the classic 3+3 design. The
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be determined
      according to the Dose-finding results. In Dose-expansion stage, additional patients will be
      recruited into two groups, the Q4W group（28 days per cycle）and the Q3W group（21 days per
      cycle）, to receive liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride at the RP2D combined with
      Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone. All patients will receive the treatment for the
      planned 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events.
