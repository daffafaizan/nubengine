      immediate perfusion, optimal pain relief, oxygen, aspirin or other anti-coagulants,
      Beta-Blockers, nitrates and Ace-inhibitors. However, because salvaging the viable myocardium
      is dependent on early reperfusion, only a minority of patients will reach the hospital within
      the time-window for myocardial rescue. Thus, even if the patient manages their tobacco use,
      hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight and exercise, many patients will go on to
      develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Though the medical management for CHF may improve
      symptoms and slow disease progression, such treatment cannot restore a functioning
      myocardium. A therapy that could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the
      incidence or severity of CHF following acute MI would provide a significant benefit. The
      characteristics and biologic activity of Prochymal®, along with a good safety profile in
      human trials to date, suggest that Prochymal® may be a good candidate for addressing this
      unmet medical need.
