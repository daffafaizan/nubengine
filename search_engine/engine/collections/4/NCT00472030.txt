    
      Objectives: The primary objective is to test the safety and efficacy of Omalizumab (Xolair)
      in the treatment of the autoimmune blistering disease, bullous pemphigoid (BP).

      Study Rationale: The current treatment for bullous pemphigoid is non-specific
      immunosuppression, causing great morbidity in these patients. Recently, pathogenic
      Immunoglogulin Class E autoantibodies have been identified in these patients. Development of
      a more targeted approach to treatment may reduce morbidity.

      Methodology: This is a pilot, open-label case-control study. Patients treated with Omalizumab
      (Xolair) will be compared to patients receiving standard treatment with prednisone.

      Number of centers and patients: This is a single center study that will enroll 12 patients.

      Population: Bullous pemphigoid patients, meeting clinical, histological and immunologic
      criteria for the disease will be enrolled. Pregnant women, children less than 18 years of
      age, and patients unable to give consent will be excluded from this preliminary study.

      Investigational drug: XolairÂ® (Omalizumab)

      Study duration: 24 weeks: 16 weeks of active treatment, 8 additional weeks of observation

      Evaluation criteria: Primary: 1. Time to cessation of new blister formation. 2. Percent body
      surface area of skin involved before and after treatment 3. Total and average daily dose of
      prednisone required in 30, 60 and 180 days after starting Xolair. Secondary: 1. Number of
      circulating eosinophils 2. Measurement of circulating anti-BMZ (basement membrane zone)
      autoantibodies 3. Histamine release assay.
