      tool that uses evidence-based practices for suicide prevention. The SPI aims to provide the
      individual with quick distraction and coping tools to overcome a suicidal crisis without
      acting upon the suicidal thoughts. The SPI was used in the Treatment for Adolescents Suicide
      Attempters study in youth 12-19 and has been found to be feasible and acceptable among adult
      patients and staff as well as among clinicians who work with adolescents. Its effectiveness
      in reducing suicide risk among veterans has also been confirmed. The SPI could be a good fit
      for children, as it uses concrete ways for the person to recognize their reaction, as well as
      concrete methods to cope with distress, which fits with the developmental stage of
      prepubertal children. Moreover, the collaborative way in which the personal safety plan is
      tailored to the suicidal person will allow the engagement of the child in the intervention.
      The SPI is an intervention that is relatively easy to administer and, therefore, if found to
      be appropriate for this age group, it could be implemented in different child-focused
      settings, including schools. The aim of the study is to evaluate the acceptability and
      feasibility of the Safety Planning Intervention for prepubertal Children's (C-SPI) among
      suicidal children and their parents. Additionally, children will be interviewed and be
      assessed for impulsivity, attention bias, irritability and coping skills.
