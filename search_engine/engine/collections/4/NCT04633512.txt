    
      Design:

        -  This is a feasibility study designed to evaluate safety and feasibility of ActivSightTM
           in gastrointestinal anastomoses and cholecystectomy.

        -  Safety will be determined through clinical assessments and evaluation of any adverse
           event.

        -  Feasibility will be determined through technically successful completion of intended
           visualization.

        -  Assessment of preliminary efficacy will be performed through analysis of any
           intraoperative decisions made based on visual display as compared to standard endoscopic
           approach, or non-inferiority to ICG-based visualization and usability.

        -  Patients outcome and follow up to Postoperative day 28 will be monitored for clinical
           outcome.

        -  Target enrollment for the assessment of intestinal anastomoses is total of twenty
           patients: 14 evaluable patients with stopping rules that are triggered following the
           first 6 patients and a comparison group 6 patients in ICG-based treatment.

        -  Target enrollment for the assessment of biliary tree is total of fourteen patients: 14
           evaluable patients with pre-planned use of ICG-based IOC.
