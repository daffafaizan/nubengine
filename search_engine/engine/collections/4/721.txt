etiology of trypan blue induced antenatalhydrocephalus in the albino ratwistar strain albino rats were injected with 1 cm3 of a 1% solutionof trypan blue.  three types of dye were used: matheson, coleman and bell,chroma-gesellschaft and a highly purified sample.  the dyes were injected ondays 6, 7, and 8 of gestation.  fetuses were excised from days 16 through 20,fixed, decalcified where necessary, embedded in paraffin, serially sectionedand stained.  newborn young were treated similarly.  chroma-gesellschafttrypan blue was without reproductive or teratogenic effect at the above doses.increasing the dose did not increase the teratogenicity but did yield adecrease in litter size.  both matheson, coleman and bell trypan blue and thepurified sample were teratogenic.  the most frequent neural defect observedwas hydrocephalus.  serial sections of the newborn hydrocephalics showed anoccluded or extremely tenotic aqueduct of sylvius in 31 of 33 sectionedanimals.  the fetuses collected from days 18 through 20 also had occluded orstenotic aqueducts if hydrocephalic.  aqueductal stenosis or occlusion waspresent in 17-day-old fetuses, but hydrocephalus was not conclusivelydemonstrated at this age.  sixteen-day-old fetuses did not have aqueductalocclusion in any of those examined, but stenosis was evident.  it is concludedthat the defect predisposing to hydrocephalus in the young of trypan bluetreated rats of this strain is aqueductal stenosis or occlusion.
