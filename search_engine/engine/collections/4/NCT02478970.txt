      refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry) by a corneal specialist. After endothelium
      evaluation with use of slit-lamp biomicroscopy a grade of severity will be given. The grades
      will be based on the density and confluence of guttae and presence of clinical edema.

      Two microscopes, non-contact specular microscope (KONAN SP4000) and paracentral non-contact
      specular microscope (NIDEK CEM-350), will be used for the exam.

      For each patient both eyes will be examined by the two non-contact specular microscopes.

      Three pictures of the central cornea will be captured from the standard specular microscope.

      The paracentral specular microscope can capture image of one central point, eight paracentral
      points with 5° visual angle and six peripheral points with 27° visual angle. It will capture
      16 images and automatically will classify based on quality and the ability to be analyzed.
      The optimal image for analysis will be indicated with orange highlight. Once the image is
      selected, a new manual or automatic software will be used to count the endothelial cells,
      complete analysis will be automatically performed.
