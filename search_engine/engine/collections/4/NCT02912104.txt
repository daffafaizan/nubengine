      ovarian follicles. Patients with POF suffer from amenorrhea, infertility, low levels of
      estrogen, and high gonadotropin concentration before the age of 40. The early failure of
      ovarian function leads to lost fertility and increases risk of osteoporosis and
      cardiovascular disease, which has serious impact on the patient's physical, mental health and
      family stability. The etiology of POI is complex, and so far there has not been any effective
      treatment. Recent study showed that human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs), also known as
      the birth waste, are newly discovered adult stem cells. The hAECs have the ability to repair
      nerve damage, myocardial injury, as well as liver damage. hAECs have low immunogenicity and
      no ethical restrictions. Therefore, hAECs are expected to become the new seed cells for
      regenerative medicine. Our previous study was the first to show that human amniotic
      epithelial cells have the ability to restore folliculogenesis in a mouse model with
      chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure. Our further studies demonstrated that hAECs
      either directly transdifferentiated into granulosa cells, or inhibited tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha-mediated granulosa cell apoptosis and reduced the inflammatory reaction in
      ovaries induced by chemotherapeutics, regulating VEGFA and its receptors to induce follicular
      growth related to paracrine activity. Therefore, it is necessary to start the clinical study
      of human amniotic epithelial cells transplantation in the POI disease which may offer a novel
      therapeutic strategy for improving the quality of life of POI patients.
