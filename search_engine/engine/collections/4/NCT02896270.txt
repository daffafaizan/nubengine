      Current treatment options are limited, have limited efficacy and a considerable side effect
      profile. Recent findings in a murine model suggest that VPA treatment in an early phase of
      renal disease could halt or even prevent the development of proteinuria and the progression
      of kidney damage. VPA is a commonly used and easy available oral antiepileptic agent with a
      favorable side effect profile compared to the current standard of care agents for
      podocytopathies.

      This trial investigates wether

        1. VPA on top of or in substitution of standard of care agents is effective in remission
           induction in patients with FSGS or MCD with proteinuria resistant to first line therapy
           with corticosteroids.

        2. VPA is effective in remission maintenance allowing reduction and cessation of chronic
           immunosuppression without relapse in patients with frequently relapsing FSGS or MCD.
