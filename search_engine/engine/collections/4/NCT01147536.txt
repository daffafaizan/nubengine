    
      A multicenter, randomized, single-blind study to assess patients' immune response following
      treatment with HSPPC-96 (vitespen, OncophageÂ®)for resectable renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
      considered to be at intermediate risk for recurrence given the pathologic tumor stage at time
      of resection.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients exhibit a measurable and durable
      immune response after multiple administrations of HSPPC-96 during a maximum 15-month time
      period.

      The study consists of two parts: Part 1 with Part 1a (Assessment of Immune Variation)and Part
      1b (Assay Standardization), and Part 2 (Immune Monitoring Study).

      The study was terminated early with 12 patients enrolled only in Part 1a and Part 1b. Part 2
      of the study involved randomization after 8 doses of HSSPC-96. After the 8 doses of HSSPC-96
      administered in Part 2, the patients were to be randomized to the Treatment Extension Arm or
      the Placebo Extension Arm. There were no patients enrolled in Part 2 since the study was
      terminated early. Therefore, no randomization occurred in the conduct of this study and only
      a single arm was enrolled.
