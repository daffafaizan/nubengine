    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of M3814 (peposertib) when given in
      combination with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of M3814 (peposertib) with
      radiotherapy.

      II. To estimate the rates of grade 3 or greater acute toxicities of the regimen.

      III. To estimate late toxicities of the regimen. IV. To evaluate the clinical response rate,
      based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, at 3 months post
      completion of radiotherapy.

      V. To estimate 6 and 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) in the dose expansion cohort
      (DEC).

      VI. To estimate 6 and 12-month overall survival (OS) in the DEC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter of M3814 (peposertib) using population PK
      approaches.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib.

      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and undergo IMRT daily Monday-Friday
      for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
