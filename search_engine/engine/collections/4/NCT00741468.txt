    
      This is an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized study to assess the drug-drug
      interactions of Proellex速 with cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in healthy female subjects. On Day
      1, following an overnight fast and morning void of the bladder, subjects will be administered
      CYP probe drugs orally. Serial blood samples will be collected at pre-dose and post-dose.
      Subjects will be administered two Proellex速 25 mg capsules (50 mg total dose) at
      approximately 0800 hours on Day 2 and 0700 hours on Days 3 through 8. One hour after
      administration of Proellex速 on Day 8, the five CYP probe drugs will be administered and blood
      and urine samples collected as on Day 1. Blood samples for the determination of plasma
      concentrations of CDB-4124 and its metabolite CDB-4453 will be collected at pre-dose (trough)
      on Days 6, 7, and 8 to determine if steady-state conditions have been achieved. Samples will
      also be collected on Day 8 at 1, 2, 8 and 24 hour after administration of Proellex速 to
      determine the plasma concentrations of CDB-4124 and CDB-4453.
