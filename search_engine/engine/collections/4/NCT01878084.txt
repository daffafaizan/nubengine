      The current proposal introduces a newly tailored bioactive glass scaffold with multi-scale
      porosity prepared using the sol-gel technique to regenerate bone in extraction sockets with
      the aim of preserving the alveolar ridge. This novel material has the potential to enhance
      angiogenesis and osteogenesis thereby preserving the overall height and width of the alveolar
      bone by regenerating new bone that closely mimics the adjacent healthy one. Thirty patients
      requiring myofunctional therapy including premolar extraction as part of a two stage
      orthodontic treatment (class II division I) will be enrolled in this phase I/II clinical
      study. Patients will undergo extraction of their maxillary and mandibular premolar teeth.
      This will serve as a split-mouth study where on one side the extraction sockets will be left
      empty while on the other side they will receive the bioactive glass as a bone graft
      substitute. Clinical and radiographic assessment of healing will be performed at the
      following time intervals; 1,2,4,12,24 weeks. Clinical criteria will include scoring for pain,
      inflammation, and occurrence of any post-operative complications using a well-defined scoring
      system. Radiographic assessment will monitor the changes in crestal bone height and bone
      mineral density. Computed tomographic scans will also be taken preoperatively and at 6 months
      for each patient for 3D assessment of bone changes. A core biopsy will also be taken after
      informed consent at the 6 months time-point to evaluate the quality and quantity of new bone
      formed.
