    
      Study Design:

        -  Part A: Cohorts of 3-6 patients diagnosed with MF will receive up to five intratumoral
           injections of cobomarsen over a period of up to 15 days with follow-up for an additional
           20 days, beginning with the maximum deliverable intratumoral dose. Doses may be
           decreased in subsequent cohorts to determine the minimum pharmacodynamically active
           dose.

        -  Parts B-F: Patients in these parts of the study will be diagnosed with MF (Parts B and
           C), CLL (Part D), DLBCL (Part E), or ATLL (Part F). All patients will receive
           subcutaneous or intravenous cobomarsen (or a combination of systemic and intratumoral
           administration for MF patients only) on Days 1, 3 and 5, and will continue dosing on a
           weekly schedule until the patient becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant
           side effects, progresses, or the trial is terminated. Doses administered will not exceed
           a dose level predicted to be safe based on all prior treatment experience with the drug.
           Patients in Part B may continue on a stable background therapy for their disease during
           their treatment with cobomarsen, while patients in Parts C-F will be treated with
           cobomarsen alone.
