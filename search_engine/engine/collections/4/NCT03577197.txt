    
      This SONABRE registry is an ongoing observational cohort study aiming at the inclusion of all
      patients aged â‰¥18 years and diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in 2007-2019 in 14
      hospitals in the Southeast of the Netherlands. Patients with de novo or recurrent advanced
      breast cancer were identified from the hospital-based management information systems.
      Specially trained registration clerks retrospectively collected data from the medical files
      of the patients based on extensive medical chart review. Information was collected about
      patient and tumour characteristics, type of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and systemic
      treatment, both neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and palliative), palliative treatment changes due to
      adverse events, hospitalization, comorbidities and outcomes (progression and death). The
      SONABRE Registry has already been effectively used to perform real-life studies on safety and
      (cost-)effectiveness of various systemic treatments used in patients diagnosed with advanced
      breast cancer.
