      impairment by inducing irregular astigmatism and corneal opacities. This disorder typically
      begins during teenage years, progresses until the age of 30 to 40 years and, in severe forms,
      may need a corneal transplantation.

      Currently, keratoconus has not known etiopathogenesis, and it is difficult to detect
      subclinical forms.

      Several risk factors seem to be implied, environmental and genetic : the risk of keratoconus
      in case of familial history of keratoconus isn't well known at that time, but seems to be
      important to consider to promote screening and follow up of patient with a familial history
      of keratoconus (KC).
