    
      This single centre, open-label, randomised (order of treatments), balanced, multiple dose
      trial will be performed in a 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover design.

      The Test Product (patch) will be applied once daily over 14 consecutive days, whereby each
      patch will remain applied for 24 h. Blood sampling will be performed after the 1st patch
      application over 24 h in order to characterise the single dose application and after the 14th
      patch application over 72 h in order to characterise pharmacokinetic parameters after
      multiple dosing including elimination phase. In between through values will be taken in the
      morning of specified study days to characterise steady-state built-up phase.

      The Reference product will be administered after a light meal as single oral doses of 100 mg
      flurbiprofen three times daily (i.e. every 8 h) over 4 days. Blood sampling will be performed
      after the 10th tablet administration over 72 h in order to characterise pharmacokinetic
      parameters after multiple dosing including elimination phase. In between through values will
      be taken in the morning of study days 1 to 4 to characterise steady-state built-up phase.

      The clinical trial will be performed as a cross-over investigation with intra-individual
      comparison, thus reducing variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters, which is supposed to
      be higher between subjects than within an individual subject.
