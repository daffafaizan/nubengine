    
      This is a single-center, randomized (study vaccine assigned to participants by chance),
      placebo-controlled study (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no vaccine in it]
      that is compared in a clinical trial with a vaccine to test if the vaccine has a real
      effect), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving) Phase 1 study in healthy participants. The study comprises a 4-week
      screening period; vaccination for each participant on Days 1, 85, and, 169; a 28-day
      follow-up period performed after each vaccination and a final visit at Day 337. Approximately
      32 Participants will be randomized in parallel in a 3:3:2 ratio to 3 treatment groups (Group
      1/2/3) to receive either Ad26.RSV.FA2 or Ad35.RSV.FA2 or placebo. The study duration will be
      approximately 52 weeks. Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected. Participant's
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
