      single blinded in that participants will be told that they will be given a pill that may or
      may not help with their pain. The researcher, however, will know that all participants are
      receiving placebo

      At the initial visit, participants will undergo screening to determine that they meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will sign consent and then complete pain assessment
      instruments as well as one high resolution anatomical scan (T1) and one functional scan (a
      resting scar) in a 3 Tesla magnet. A single scanning session comprised of a 10 minute
      functional scan (a resting scan) will be done two weeks from the first scan and pain
      assessment instruments will be completed at this visit as well. After finishing this second
      scan (done two weeks after the initial scan), the participants will have completed the study.
