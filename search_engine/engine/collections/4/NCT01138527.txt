      clinically significant (volume > 0.5cc; Gleason > 6) prostate carcinoma in the prostate.

      Objective 1

      To determine the diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve)
      of 3-Tesla multi-modality non-endorectal coil (ERC) MR imaging in localizing prostate cancer,
      by correlating:

        1. focal areas of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images;

        2. the extent and degree of deviating metabolite ratios derived from MRSI. This can be the
           choline+creatine/citrate ratio or if possible, the choline / citrate ratio;

        3. the extent and degree of apparent diffusion coefficient reduction on DWI;

        4. the extent and degree of perfusion abnormality on DCE-MRI; with the presence or absence
           of cancer at (reconstructed) whole mount section histopathology.

      Objective 2 Proving that multi-modality MR data allows for predicting tumor grade. The
      parameters from the different MR methods for a tumor focus can be correlated to the local
      Gleason grade of the corresponding lesion in the histopathological specimens.
