      disease after definitive treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancers (duodenal,
      ampullary, bile duct). Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) administered in
      1-3 fractions has been shown to be an effective treatment option for patients with
      unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, achieving local control rates of
      84-92% at one year. Associated late gastrointestinal toxicity rates have been reported to be
      22-25% at 1 year. We hypothesize that similarly excellent local control rates (80-90% at one
      year) with a reasonable rate of toxicity (≤20%) can be achieved using Linac based SBRT
      delivered as 5 Gy x 5 for patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous
      treatment with conventional chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without surgery and as 6.6
      Gy x 5 for radiation-naïve patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous
      treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The toxicities of note for this trial are grade 2
      and greater gastritis, fistula, enteritis, ulcer, or any other grade 3 or greater
      gastrointestinal toxicity.
