      favourable in reducing blood product transfusions. The tests are performed on whole blood
      instead of plasma, which saves time and gives a quick sight at the interaction between
      cellular and plasmatic clotting factors.

      Reviews of the literature suggest that transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC), plasma,
      and platelets are all decreased in patients whose transfusions were guided by viscoelastic
      tests rather than by clinical judgement or conventional laboratory tests.

      The benefits of viscoelastic coagulation monitoring have been described in many fields of
      surgery and intensive care. Current literature and a guideline for the treatment of massive
      haemorrhage in perioperative bleeding and trauma patients recommend the use of viscoelastic
      tests to guide haemostatic resuscitation.
