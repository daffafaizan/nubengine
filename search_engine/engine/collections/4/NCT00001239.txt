      metastatic breast cancer using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to
      ameliorate chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Combination chemotherapy consists of Flurouricil,
      Leucovorin, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan (FLAC) which will be given every 21 days for 10 cycles.
      This protocol will replace the phase I study of this regimen (MB-232/88-C-0207) which found
      the MTD of this regimen to be at the first dose level. This is a phase II study to determine
      response rates of this regimen in advanced breast cancer.
