      I. The MTD of the 1-MT/docetaxel combination using CTCAE 4.0 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of PK data for the combination of docetaxel plus oral 1-MT.Overall objective
      response rate (CR, PR) per RECIST criteria.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral 1-methyl-d-tryptophan twice daily on days 1-21 and docetaxel IV over 1
      hour on day 1 (in course one patients receive 1-methyl-d-tryptophan once daily on days 1 and
      3-21). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and correlative studies.
