      environment, followed by a heat or cool exercise exposure every 5th day for 25 days.
      Cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and perceptual strain were measured throughout exercise
      each day. Hydration assessment and stress response via blood biomarkers were measured before
      and after exercise. Aerobic capacity was measured before and after heat acclimation as well
      as after the intermittent exercise-heat exposure. Hand cooling was implemented periodically
      during exercise-heat stress visits to determine cooling efficacy before and after heat
      acclimation.
