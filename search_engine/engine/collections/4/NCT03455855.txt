    
      study objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JETSTREAMâ„¢ Atherectomy System
      (Jetstream) for treating symptomatic Chinese patients with occlusive atherosclerotic lesions
      in native superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/ or proximal popliteal arteries (PPA)during
      percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention.

      Planed Indications for use: The Jetstream System is intended for use in atherectomy of the
      peripheral vasculature and to break apart and remove atherosclerotic disease, debris, and
      thrombus from the SFA and/or PPA.

      Primary Safety Endpoint: Major Adverse Event (MAE), defined as all-cause death, target limb
      unplanned major amputation and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR), within 30 days post
      index procedure

      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: Acute reduction of percent diameter stenosis (%DS) post
      atherectomy but prior to any adjunctive therapy, when compared to its baseline diameter
      stenosis (absolute mean percentage).
