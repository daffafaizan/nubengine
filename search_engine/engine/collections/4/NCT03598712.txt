      serolymphatic effusion that is created in the days following surgery. Iterative puncture is
      the only treatment for seroma mentioned in the literature. A retrospective study in the
      investigator's establishment on 1800 patients determined that a second puncture greater than
      250ml is predictive of a chronicisation of punctures. The research hypothesis is that by
      applying local compression by chest bandaging with the UrgoÂ® K2 kit, the "dead space" created
      by surgery would be removed. This would help resorb the seroma and reduce the number of
      punctures.
