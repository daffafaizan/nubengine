      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who came from specialized departments of the
      Pulmonology Service of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas of Porto Alegre and were referred to the
      pulmonary rehabilitation program of this institution. Patients will be evaluated in relation
      to anthropometry, body composition, blood biochemistry, phase angle, dietary intake, physical
      capacity, muscle strength and lung function. The data will be processed in the statistical
      program SPSS version 17.0 and for statistical analysis they will be tested for their
      normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and after this definition will be applied specific
      tests for parametric or non-parametric data, being they presented in the form of mean and
      standard deviation or median, minimum and maximum, according to their distribution. The
      differences will be considered significant for values of p <0.05.
