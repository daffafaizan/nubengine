      (~0.9 g EPA+DHA/day) vs high dose (~5.4 g EPA+DHA/day) of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs) in women survivors of hormone unresponsive breast cancer. The objectives of the trial
      are to develop unique mammary epithelial, adipose tissue specific markers of exposure and
      response to omega 3 fatty acid supplements that can be carried forward into definitive
      intervention trials of EPA, DHA/omega 3 PUFAs for breast cancer prevention. The investigators
      will randomize 80 subjects with hormone receptor negative, HER-2/neu overexpression positive
      or negative breast cancer to either a high or low dose of omega 3 PUFAs. Using fine needle
      aspiration to procure cellular samples of breast epithelial and adipose tissue, the
      investigators will determine the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on mammary specific
      biomarkers of response.
