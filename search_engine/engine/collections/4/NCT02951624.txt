      participants will undergo the four interventions in a randomized cross-over design. Wash out
      between intervention will be minimum four days.

      Control (CON): Participants will be sedentary. Sedentary time will be spent sitting in a
      chair, restricted to sedentary behaviors (working on a computer, reading, watching TV, etc.),
      with a target MET below 1.5 (i.e. 1.5 times REE). Participants will only be allowed to stand
      or walk to go to the toilet.

      Breaker: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 2 min intervals of low
      intensity walking.

      Intermediate: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 6 min intervals of low
      intensity walking

      Prolonger: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 12 min intervals of low
      intensity walking

      All interventions will be matched for total physical activity as well as sitting. Thus, we
      aim for the active interventions to be iso-caloric.
