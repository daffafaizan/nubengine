      a baseline clinical and imaging evaluation and one follow-up evaluation two years later.
      These evaluations will include clinical and neuropsychological assessments, structural MRI
      and/or PET scans. Additional scans and scanning procedures will be performed on a subset of
      participants and participant visits, including serotonin density levels.
