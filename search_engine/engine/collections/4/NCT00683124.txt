    
      Marfan Syndrome is a rare disease (1:5000)(MIM#154700) caused by mutations of the Fibrillin 1
      (FBN1) gene. The major clinical problem is aortic aneurysm with risk of dissection when root
      diameter is 5 cm.

      The investigators designed a clinical trial in which a new generation Beta-Blocker Nebivolol
      with expected effects on shear stress, heart rate and potential anti-stiffness benefits is
      compared to Losartan, and Angiotensin receptor blocker anti TGF-beta effects, and to the
      association of both molecules in patients with Marfan Syndrome. Nebivolol is a patented drug
      that differs chemically, pharmacologically and therapeutically from all other BBs. Nebivolol
      shows the highest selectivity for ß1 receptors among the currently available BBs, influences
      the arterial stiffness through an agonistic effect on ß2-receptors and preserves the arterial
      compliance. We expect a significantly lower progression of the Aortic Root Dilation in the
      arm of Nebivolol plus Losartan vs. single drug (primary end-point).The investigators further
      expect: decrease of arterial stiffness higher in the arm treated with both drugs than in
      solely Nebivolol or Losartan; a decrease of serum levels of active TGFb in both Losartan
      arms, a drug & age-dependant variation of the expression of the mutated FBN1 gene. As for
      other end-points, the potential results are the improvement of valve function, hard events &
      delay of surgical timing for the aortic root. The enrolment period will last 12 months, while
      the overall follow-up period will be of 4 years. An interim analysis for the primary outcome
      is programmed at month 24.
