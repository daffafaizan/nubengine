      regulation of HA treatment is unclear. Compared the expression SF proteome from OA patients
      who received HA/800 treatment or not (post and pre-HA treatment) may be possible to identify
      the protein that response to the HA treatment and apply this to prognosis of OA. We used
      two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization time of light mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) to determine the
      differentially displayed proteins in human SF. Finally, we used Western blotting and ELISA
      analysis to validate the potential biomarkers.
