      compared to healthy controls, and to analyze links between social cognition and both
      neurocognition and symptoms, (2) to collect data in a large sample of healthy controls in
      order to establish appropriate standards for tools composing ClaCoS battery.

      For the first objective, three kind of evaluation will be proposed: clinical, neurocognitive
      and social cognitive (ClaCoS). Three populations of 80 participants will be compared: healthy
      controls, patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, and patients with autism
      spectrum disorders. These three groups will be matched on sex, age and level of education.

      For the second objective a systematic collection of data will be carried out in a large
      sample of healthy controls. In this part of the study, only social cognitive measures will be
      recorded. Subjects will be ranked according to three criteria: three classes for age (18-25
      years old, 26-35 and 36-45), five classes for socio-professional status according to the
      INSEE classification, and two classes for sex (men/women).
