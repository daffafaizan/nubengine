      I. To validate body composition estimates derived from the seca (SECA) medical body
      composition analyzer (mBCA) bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scale by comparing with
      computed tomography (CT) measured lean and fat body mass.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate sensitivity of mBCA to detect changes in body composition during treatment.

      II. Identify whether BIA-estimated loss of lean body mass (LBM) during treatment predicts
      development of sarcopenia.

      III. Determine whether BIA-derived estimates of body water correlate with requirements for
      intravenous (IV) hydration and unplanned hospital admissions.

      IV. Explore associations between body composition and symptom burden during treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance analysis with seca mBCA and CT or positron emission
      tomography (PET) at baseline, weekly for 6-7 weeks during standard of care radiation therapy
      (RT), and at 10-12 weeks after completion of RT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
