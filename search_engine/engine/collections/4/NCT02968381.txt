    
      The objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a
      theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking
      cessation.

      Aim 1. Develop a theory-based, guided mental imagery tobacco cessation intervention for quit
      line callers with input from expert consultants in health disparities and a Community
      Advisory Board representing diverse populations and tobacco control stakeholders. The
      intervention will include phone-based coaching, an interactive website, and optional
      cessation medication. It will be focus tested with 40 smokers (from diverse racial/ethnic and
      age groups with at least 40% males), and usability tested with 5 smokers.

      Aim 2. Develop training and competency standards for, and train, four coaches in the
      implementation of the guided imagery and control interventions. Coaches will be assessed at
      6-weeks and 6-months post-training for implementation fidelity and satisfaction.

      Aim 3. Conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on the effects of the
      guided mental imagery intervention on quit line callers' tobacco use, cravings, and
      self-efficacy to quit smoking, and to refine study procedures, including recruitment,
      retention, and use of intervention components. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the Imagery Intervention (N=50) or an attention control condition (N=50) as
      delivered by study coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months
      post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged
      abstinence of tobacco use. Biochemical validation will be conducted on a sub-sample to
      determine validity of self-reported abstinence in this population. Secondary outcomes will be
      self-reported cravings and self-efficacy.
