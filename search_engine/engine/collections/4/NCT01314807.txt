    
      Three groups will be included in this study:

        -  Patients with COPD (cases)

        -  Patients with smoking history but no COPD (smoking controls)

        -  Patients with no smoking history and no COPD (non-smoking controls)

      An extensive test battery will be performed at baseline and after 3 years:

      Clinical assessment (height, weight and blood pressure)*

      Complete pulmonary function ((post-bronchodilator)spirometry + diffusion)*

      Sputum Induction

      Fasting venous blood sample (fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, inflammatory
      markers, creatinine, NT pro BNP, hemoglobin, testosterone, vitamin D)

      Vascular screening (arterial stiffness - arterial stenosis - CIMT)

      Muscle force (peripheral + respiratory)*

      Functional exercise capacity (6 MWT)**

      Maximal exercise capacity (incremental cycle test)**

      Dexa scan (osteoporosis - body composition)

      Spiral CT scan of the chest

      RX thorax - RX lumbar

      Questionnaires (MRC, CCQ, SF-36, EQ5D, HADS, Exacerbation, CATZ)**

      Physical activity monitoring (sensewear armband)*

      * test will be repeated every 6 months

      ** test will be repeated every year

      !!!! Remark (26/9/2013) Based on the last data analyses, in contrast to our expectations, we
      concluded that the two groups with a smoking history, with or without COPD change in a
      similar way over time. The length of the study will therefore be prolonged with 3 more years
      (6 years in total).

      After 3 years the patients with a smoking history will be evaluated yearly, unless they were
      hospitalized for >5 days. In that case we will sooner contact these patients in order to pick
      up comorbidities in these patients.!!!
