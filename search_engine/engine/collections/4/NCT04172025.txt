      costs, substantial morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the rapid recognition of outbreaks and
      transmissions with hypervirulent and multi-drug resistant pathogen is a key priority for
      infection control and public health. For hospital epidemiologist, infectious disease and
      public health experts, and microbiologists the identification of an outbreak source is a
      first important step to establish effective counter-measurements. In Switzerland, the burden
      of pathogen transmission between humans, animals and the environment is substantial. The main
      goal is to implement a shared database, connecting human and veterinary microbiology
      laboratories, which would allow near real-time molecular epidemiology with high
      spatiotemporal resolution of bacterial pathogens such as transmission and outbreak
      surveillance between different compartments including humans, animals and the environment in
      Switzerland. Investigator aims to analyze already collected encoded retrospective datasets of
      various pathogens by combining epidemiological data and whole genome sequences from
      pathogens.
