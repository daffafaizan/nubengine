    
      This study is a 54-week randomized, double-blind base study with an optional 104-week
      extension study (MK-0941-007-11). Beginning on Week 16, participants not randomized to the
      maximum dose of MK-0941 could up-titrate to MK-0941 40 mg three times daily. Participants who
      complete the 54-week base study are eligible to enter the extension study and will remain in
      the treatment group to which they were assigned in the base study.
