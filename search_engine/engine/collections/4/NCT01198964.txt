      surface of the brain and who will, for all clinical purposes, subsequently receive
      stimulation for mapping of function of the ECoG sites. The decision to place the electrodes
      on the brain, the location of the electrodes and the length of time the electrodes are in are
      all part of clinical care.

      There will be two types of testing, motor and language. Motor will involve inducing
      stimulation to the thumb cortex and the wrist cortex. There will be a conditioning of this
      over 4-12 hours. Language will involve showing pictures on a computer screen and the subject
      will be observed whether speech is disrupted with stimulation or not.
