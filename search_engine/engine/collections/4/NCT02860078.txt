      techniques (fluoroscopy) with respect to regional anesthesia. Some studies have shown its
      usefulness as a quick, safe and simple tool for the location of the sacral hiatus and to
      guide the puncture of the sacral epidural space in patients with chronic low back pain,
      despite the lack of data with respect to clinical outcomes.

      OBJECTIVES: Evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the pain control and incidence of
      adverse effects in patients undergoing corticosteroid infiltration and local anesthetic
      through sacral epidural puncture with ultrasound assistance or isolated use of fluoroscopy to
      aid puncture and location of the sacral epidural space. It will also be evaluated success
      rate in the first puncture, and the time duration of the procedure in groups.

      METHODS: It is clinical, analytical, prospective trial, randomized, covered for evaluators.
      It will include 30 patients with chronic low back pain or pain in the lower limbs resulting
      in lumbar canal stenosis, refractory to medical treatment. A group will be submitted to
      epidural corticosteroid infiltration associated with local anesthetic with the use of
      fluoroscopy for locating the sacral epidural space, which is currently the gold standard for
      this technique, while in another location group will be held with the use of ultrasound.
