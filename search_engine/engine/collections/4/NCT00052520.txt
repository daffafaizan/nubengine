      I. To determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with infusing donor CD8+
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for Wilms' tumor (WT1) in patients who have
      relapsed or at a high risk of relapse post transplant for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and assess migration to the
      bone marrow, a predominant site of leukemic relapse.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred WT1-specific T cells mediate antileukemic
      activity.

      OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis for stem cell harvest to generate CD8-positive WT1
      gene-specific CTL clones at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      After post-transplantation hematopoietic recovery, patients receive treatment for either
      highest-risk disease (prophylactically) or relapsed disease.

      Highest-risk disease group: Patients receive CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 0, 14, and 28. Beginning 2-4 hours after CTL
      infusion, patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 28-42 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Relapsed-disease group: Some patients with evidence of leukemic relapse may receive standard
      salvage chemotherapy prior to donor CTL infusions and then receive CD8-positive WT1
      gene-specific CTL clones and interleukin-2 as in the highest-risk group.

      Patients in both groups who have progressive disease after complete or partial response to
      therapy may be eligible for retreatment with CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
