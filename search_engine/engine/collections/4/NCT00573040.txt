    
      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes to the following MLD (Mean Lung Dose):

        -  MLD=19 Gy when Fev1 and DLCO > 50% of the predicted value

        -  MLD=15 Gy when Fev1 and/or DLCO 40-49% of the predicted value

        -  MLD=10 Gy when Fev1 and/or DLCO <40% of the predicted value

      Other dose-constrains: spinal cord max: 54 Gy, brachial plexus (Dmax):66 Gy Minimum tumor
      dose:79.2 Gy.

      Radiotherapy will be delivered in twice-daily fractions of 1.8 Gy with 8 to 10 h as
      interfraction-interval, 5 days per week.

      The radiation doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be
      applied, as well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in
      standard practice at MAASTRO clinic.
