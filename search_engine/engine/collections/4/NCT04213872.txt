    
      This is a single-group pilot study on the effects of 8 weeks of MM practice on changes in
      cognitive function, anxiety, sleep quality, depression, and selected gene expression factors.
      Forty BCS will be consented and assigned to an intensive eight-week MM program. The forty BCS
      will be nonrandomly assigned to the eight-week MM program with no control group. The forty
      BCS will be organized in cohorts of 10 for the 8-week MM program. Cognitive functioning and
      associated symptoms/conditions data will be collected before and after the 8-week MM program
      to assess cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, and sleep-quality. This data will be
      analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics program. Peripheral blood samples will be collected
      before and after the 8-week MM program. The gene expression data will be processed and
      analyzed by the bioinformatics team at the Single-Cell, Sequencing, and CyTOF Core (SC2),
      Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles.

      Endpoints:

      Endpoint 1: The Meditative Movement (MM) program will affect cognitive impairment.

      Endpoint 2: The Meditative Movement (MM) program will affect anxiety, depression, and sleep
      quality.

      Endpoint 3: The MM program will affect gene expression associated with cognitive impairment
      and associated symptoms.
