      criteria and report nausea and receive a blend of 45% ginger, 25% peppermint, 5% spearmint,
      and 25% cardamom essential oils while using a nasal clip to facilitate inhalation will have
      more relief from nausea than those who receive normal saline inhalation using the same
      delivery system.

      The secondary purposes of the study is to determine the duration of effectiveness of the
      essential oil blend as compared to the saline in the relief of post-operative nausea and to
      investigate the degree of comfort participants report using the nasal clip delivery system
      for aromatherapy.
