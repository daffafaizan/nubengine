      MRI predisposes to CIS/MS in female MZ twins discordant for CIS/MS.

      Secondary Objective: Define the protein and microarray gene expression profile predictive of
      conversion to MS/CIS in female MZ twins discordant for CIS/MS.

      Design and Outcomes: This is a single center, clinical study to determine if the presence of
      MS-like MRI brain lesions predict the rate of conversion to CIS in female MZ twins discordant
      for CIS/MS.

      We will screen and recruit 30 subjects, and begin to follow these subjects annually for a
      total of 5 years to determine if MR brain scans predict CIS/MS conversion.

      Interventions and Duration: Subjects will be recruited over 2 years and followed for five
      years with annual neurological examinations and MR brain scans.

      Sample Size and Population: 30 female co-twins discordant for CIS/MS will be studied. We
      predict 72% of the 27% 'at risk' subjects with characteristic MR brain lesions at baseline
      will convert to CIS within 5 years. We predict only 6% of the 73% 'at risk' subjects without
      characteristic MR brain lesions at baseline will convert to CIS within 5 years.

      These data will determine if paraclinical (MRI) evidence of demyelinating disease and
      specific blood or cerebrospinal fluid proteins predict clinical expression of disease in
      highly susceptible populations predicts.
