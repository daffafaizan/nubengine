      slow the growth of urothelial cancers. Cetuximab is an antibody that blocks a protein called
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR sits on the outside of tumor cells and controls
      tumor cell growth. This agent has been looked at alone and with other chemotherapy drugs
      including paclitaxel. It has been found to be safe and can shrink other types of cancer.

      This research study is also being done to find out if cetuximab, alone or with paclitaxel
      shrinks urothelial tumors. If it extends the time the tumors shrink. If it helps people live
      longer.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) these
      treatments have on you and your cancer. We do not know if you will benefit from this research
      study. It is possible that your condition will get better, but it is also possible that there
      will be no effect on your condition or that your condition will get worse. We can use what we
      learn from this research study to help other people with the same disease.
