      amygdala and hippocampus. These are brain regions that have been previously associated with
      obsessive-compulsive, affective, and psychotic phenomena. The investigators will test for
      correlations between pre-treatment FDG brain images and subsequent SSRI treatment outcome to
      identify potential predictors of treatment response. Finally, the investigators will compare
      pre-treatment and post-treatment PET FDG studies as well as MRI studies in BDD subjects to
      examine changes in these brain regions following treatment. The goals of the proposed
      research are to use FDG-PET and MRI to identify predictors of treatment response to SSRIs in
      BDD and to determine changes in rCMRglu in BDD subjects following treatment with SSRIs.
