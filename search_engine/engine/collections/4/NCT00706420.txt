      (clusters of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin and other metabolic hormones), which
      makes patients depend on an outside source of insulin. Despite insulin treatment, type 1
      diabetes mellitus causes a significant risk of long-term problems, including damage to the
      heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The results of recent research studies
      suggest that these complications are caused by poor glucose control.

      Transplantation of islets offers the prospect of good glycemic (blood glucose) control
      without the major surgical risks associated with whole pancreas transplant and may result in
      not needing any insulin injections. In 2000, a group of investigators in Edmonton, Canada
      showed that islet transplantation using a combination of anti-rejection drugs to help prevent
      the rejection of transplanted islets was effective in eliminating insulin intake in 7
      subjects who were followed up to 20 months. After 5 years, more than 60 patients have been
      transplanted at Edmonton and only 1 in 10 remained off of insulin.

      This study is being performed to confirm the results of the Edmonton study to see if islet
      transplantation alone (ITA) is a safe and effective way of treating subjects with type 1
      diabetes. This study uses a few additional medications and vitamin supplements that were not
      included in the original Edmonton study. We hope this will improve the long-term outcome of
      islet transplantation.
