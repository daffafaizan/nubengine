      supranuclear gaze palsy, early balance dysfunction and falls. Tau-protein aggregation, mainly
      in the brainstem, is the disease hallmark. Because of the similarities with Parkinson's
      disease (PD), the diagnosis is made approximately 4 years after the symptoms onset. Cognitive
      deficits are a leading feature of PSP and they actually represent one of the four functional
      core domains in the revised diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study is to better
      understand the nature of this cognitive decline, the time of its development and the relation
      with the other cardinal features of the disease.
