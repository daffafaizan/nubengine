    
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the biochemical and therapeutic effects and
      safety of enzyme replacement therapy using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modified
      glucocerebrosidase for the treatment of Gaucher disease and to evaluate the benefit to risk
      ratio. The study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy in Gaucher patients of
      recombinantly produced human glucocerebrosidase, which is PEG modified. Parameters to be
      monitored include hemoglobin, platelet counts, organ size, and extent of bony involvement.
      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antibody studies will also be evaluated.
