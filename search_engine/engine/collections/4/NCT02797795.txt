    
      In Part A, subjects will be treated with a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of NEV801 on
      Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of continuous 28-day cycles. The starting dose of NEV801 will be 20
      mg/m2/dose, and the NEV801 dose will be escalated in successive cohorts of 3 subjects per
      dose level. In Part B, up to 3 expansion cohorts of up to 12 subjects each, defined by tumor
      type, will be enrolled at or below the MTD (i.e., the RP2D) of NEV801. In both parts,
      subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may continue to
      receive NEV801 at the discretion of the Investigator for up to 12 cycles. Subjects who
      tolerate the drug and experience clinical benefit will be eligible for further treatment in
      an extension protocol or through another means to be determined by the Sponsor.
