      adults in the United States. Modifiable health behaviors contribute to this growing epidemic.
      Insights from behavioral economics have shown promise for motivating behavior change through
      the use of financial incentives. However, social incentives or those influences that impact
      individuals to adjust their inherent behaviors based on social ties and connections have not
      been well examined. Social incentives are a more patient-centered approach that leverages and
      enhances the existing connections and influences on the individual. Since one individual's
      behavior change is connected to many others within their network, social incentives have the
      potential to be a scalable intervention that impacts the community. Gamification, or the use
      of game design in non-game situations, is often used in the real world, but its effectiveness
      is unknown. In this study, investigators will conduct a 36-week, three-arm, randomized,
      controlled trial using a team-based model to compare two weight loss programs to control.
      Each intervention will use insights from behavioral economics to leverage social incentives
      and gamification.
