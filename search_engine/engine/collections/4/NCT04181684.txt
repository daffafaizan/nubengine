      diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. LITT offers an alternative to surgical resection, and
      due to its minimally invasive nature, does not delay initiating radiation therapy. Another
      advantage of LITT prior to radiation therapy is the ability to obtain a tissue diagnosis of
      recurrent tumor prior to initiating radiation therapy.
