      continuous renal replacement protocols (including citrate anticoagulation) in the intensive
      care unit patient population at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota utilizing a prospective,
      observational study. This data will allow practitioners to better tailor caloric provision
      with nutrition support programs, minimizing the risk of overfeeding in this complex critical
      care patient population.
