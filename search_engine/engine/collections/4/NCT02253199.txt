      30 min after administration of Initial dose of chloral hydrate) were stratified into four age
      groups as follows: 1-6 month, 7 -12 month, 13 -24 month, and 25-36 month. The intranasal
      dexmedetomidine dose was determined by the success or failure of rescue sedation achieved by
      the previous patients, according to Dixon's up-down sequential allocation method. Successful
      sedation was defined as a MOAA/S(modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation) of
      between 0 and 3. The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of
      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Patients' sedation status, sedation induction time,
      time to Wake up, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded.
