    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrinopathy in women, affecting
      4-15% of those who are of childbearing age. It is a complex and heterogeneous disease in
      which the gynecological disorder coexist with metabolic problems such as insulin resistance.

      The beneficial effect of the extract plant BSL-EP044 on glycemic metabolism in women with
      PCOS is widely studied and demonstrated and Lactobacillus BSL_PS6 appears to exert a
      synergistic effect by supplementing the effect of BSL-EP044. The hypothesis of our study is
      that the addition of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus BSL_PS6 to extract plant BSL-EP044
      treatment may improve the beneficial effect of this one on insulin resistance and other
      metabolic alterations related to PCOS.

      The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of a
      Plant Extract (BSL_EP044) and Lactobacillus BSL_PS6 on parameters related to glycemic
      metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and high insulin levels.
