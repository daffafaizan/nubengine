      translation and that this functional instability depends on additional load applied, on
      anatomical and morphological variations, and on type and severity of the injury. The study is
      to investigate the dose-response relationship between load-induced muscle activation (liMA)
      and load-induced glenohumeral translation (liTr) in patients with rotator cuff tears and
      asymptomatic control subjects.

      Furthermore the study is to investigate the in vivo dose-response relationship between
      additional weight and glenohumeral translation, to understand the biological variation in
      liTr, the influence of disease pathology on the liTr, the potential compensation by muscle
      activation and muscle size, and the influence of liTr on patient outcomes.

      This study entails cross-sectional experimental multimodal (clinical, biomechanical,
      radiological) data collection with multiple conditions and a control group.
