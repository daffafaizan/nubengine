    
      Primary endpoint of the study is to quantitatively evaluate the presence of microangiopathy
      as increase of capillary basement membrane thickness and decrease of capillary lumen area
      determined by transmission electron microscopy analysis in type 2 diabetic patients with only
      motor-sensory neuropathy or chronic critical ischemia affected by foot ulcer.

      The following parameters will be evaluated:

        -  presence of capillary (n/mm2) and thrombosis (%) and correlation of this quantitative
           histological data with ischemic parameters (TcPO2, ankle-brachial index) and risk of
           diastasis

        -  correlation between presence of inflammatory infiltrate (leukocytes/mm2) with blood
           inflammatory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein,
           alpha-2 globulin)

        -  rate of diastasis and/or time required for recovery associated with histopathological
           data

        -  presence of acanthosis related to clinical and demographic variables
