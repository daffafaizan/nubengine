      treatment for advanced NSCLC and are intended to receive PD-1/PD-L1 antibody will be
      recruited and followed for 4 years. According to the baseline sleep monitor results,
      participants will be divided into Group NSCLC(AHI<15), and Group OSA+NSCLC(AHIâ‰¥15), and then
      explore the influence of obstructive sleep apnea on the efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy.
      The baseline level of white blood cell count (WBC); absolute neutrophil count (ANC); absolute
      lymphocyte count (ALC); ANC to ALC (ANC:ALC) ratio; interleukin 6 (IL-6); C-reactive Protein
      (CRP) in peripheral blood, lymphocytes classification and count by flow cytometry, and gut
      microbiome analysis by quantitative metagenomics will also be measured to further search for
      the possible mechanisms. Primary outcome is the objective remission rate (ORR), secondary
      outcomes include overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).

      The study protocol has been approved by the Peking University First Hospital Institutional
      Review Board (IRB). Any protocol modifications will be submitted for the IRB review and
      approval.
