      proposed larger clinical study design:

        1. Comparing different potential primary outcome measures

        2. Demonstrating that an exclusionary diet as determined by elevated IgG levels using the
           Biomerica InFoods速 IBS Test is associated with alleviation of IBS symptoms

        3. Demonstrating the ability to mask the sham diet

        4. Demonstrating the safety of the exclusionary diet

      Subjects' diets will be based on the results of the Biomerica, InFoods速 IBS Test.

      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels above a certain threshold are considered a positive response
      against a specific food or foods. It is expected that severity of symptoms of IBS will
      decrease when foods that generate a positive immune response in the Biomerica InFoods速 IBS
      test are eliminated from the diet of the IBS patient.

      The Endpoint Determination Study format will be a double-blinded randomized controlled
      clinical study enrolling subjects at two trial sites within the United States and designed to
      evaluate the use of IgG antibody guided dietary restrictions, based on the Biomerica InFoods速
      IBS Test, in the management of patients diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

      The 2 sites will enroll approximately equal numbers of subjects. The target for each site is
      a minimum of 30 subjects in each classification: IBS with diarrhea [IBS-D], IBS with
      constipation [IBS-C] and IBS mixed [IBS-M] for a minimum of 90 patients per site, 180 total
      subjects for this study.
