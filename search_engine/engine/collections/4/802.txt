sensory dominancein autistic imbecile children and controlsin a previous experiment (hermelin ando'connor, 1964) it was found that autisticand control imbecile children responded mostfrequently to a light stimulus in conditions ofbimodal, simultaneous stimulation.  however,the role of the relative intensity level of thestimuli remained to be determined.  in thepresent experiment a light and a sound, or alight and a verbal command were presentedsimultaneously in various intensity combina-tions.  all responses, irrespective of the stim-ulus to which they were made, wererewarded.  autistic, mongol, and nonmongolimbecile children were tested.  in addition toa tendency for visual dominance resultsshowed that independent of modality, highintensities affected all groups.  nonmongolimbecile children also responded significantlymore frequently to the verbal than to thesound stimulus, while the other two groupsdid not.
