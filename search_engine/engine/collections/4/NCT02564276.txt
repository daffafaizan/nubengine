      solution to the debate on lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. Using blue-dye is
      inexpensive but results in an unsatisfactory detection rate of SLN. IndoCyanine Green (ICG)
      with near-infrared imaging is a novel technology for SLN mapping and initial reports on the
      use of ICG have shown high detection rate. In the present study, we aim to determine
      precisely the increase in detection rate of SLN associated with the use of ICG instead of
      blue dye. This randomized controlled trial will include patients with preoperative stage I
      endometrial carcinoma. All included women will undergo SLN mapping with blue dye in one
      hemipelvis and ICG in the other hemipelvis. Randomization will concern the side of the
      hemipelvis in which blue dye vs ICG mapping is used, so that the patient's contralateral
      hemipelvis will serve as a control to her ipsilateral hemipelvis. The primary endpoint is the
      difference in the proportion of hemipelves with successful detection of SLN according to the
      dye used. The unique precise information gained from the present study will contribute to
      determine whether the benefit of the use of ICG over blue dye is sufficient to justify the
      expense of its use.
