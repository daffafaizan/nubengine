    
      In HIV-infected subjects who have virologically failed first-line antiretroviral therapy
      comprising 2N(t)RTI + NNRTI a regimen of second-line therapy incorporating ritonavir-boosted
      lopinavir and raltegravir provides comparable (i.e., non-inferior) antiretroviral efficacy
      over 48 weeks to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and 2-3N(t)RTIs.

      Eligible patients will be randomised to one of two arms:

      I. ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) 200mg/50mg 4 tabs once daily or 2 tabs twice daily +
      2-3N(t)RTIs

      II. ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) 200mg/50mg 4 tabs once daily or 2 tabs twice daily +
      raltegravir 400 mg twice daily

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the virological efficacy of the two
      strategies as measured by the proportion of participants with HIV RNA < 200 copies/mL 48
      weeks after randomisation.

      Secondary objectives include virological, immunological, safety and antiretroviral therapy
      endpoints.

      Exploratory endpoints include clinical, metabolic, drug resistance, medication adherence and
      quality of life endpoints.
