      risk for HIV-infection or who have been recently infected with HIV.

      Participants will have from 10 to 60 ml (approximately 1 to 4 tablespoons) of blood drawn for
      one or all of the following tests:

        -  T cell subset enumeration

        -  Serologic reactivity with HIV antigens

        -  Viral load assays by bDNA, PCR, or RT-PCR

        -  Routine Laboratory assessments (chemistries, liver function tests, hepatitis serology,
           RPR)

        -  HIV-1 Resistance Testing

      These data are used for diagnostic, prognostic and management decisions as outlined by
      current HIV-1 Treatment Guidelines
