      de novo stage IV breast cancer with bone metastasis only. Previous reports of carefully
      selected patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer suggest that surgery on the primary
      tumor may result in improved survival, but this remains unproven. The early results of our
      ongoing trial MF07-01 trial (a phase III randomized controlled trial of breast cancer women
      with distant metastases at presentation who receive loco-regional treatment for intact
      primary tumor compared with those who do not receive such treatment) showed that patients
      with bone metastasis only have a trend toward improved survival with initial surgery. Our
      goal is to test if primary surgery improves overall survival in bone only metastasis.
