      and/or psychotic symptoms, which leave lacuna about the effects on depressive disorder with
      low or moderate scores. The literature is poor about the use of Repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the old age population.Therefore, we chose this group to
      research for the antidepressive effect of TMS; other interests are to identify modifications
      in the magnetic resonance imaging, evaluate cognitive functions and to verify the occurrence
      of collateral effects and safety use for this specific population.
