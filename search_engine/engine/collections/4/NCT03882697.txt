      hypoperfusion in the organs of the body, resulting in ischemia and increased mortality within
      one year. Hypotension may occur at any time during general anesthesia but may also occur with
      changes in posture. In robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, hypotension often
      occurs when posture is changed from a Trendelenburg position to a supine position. However
      there is no data regarding which hemodynamic parameters can predict hypotension induced by
      position change.

      Excessive administration of the fluid in steep Trendelenburg position may lead to fluid
      overload and lead to complications such as pulmonary edema. Thus, the predictors are should
      be identified to manage patients without fluid overload. Therefore, the aim of this study is
      to investigate the parameters of Cardio Q which are useful for predicting hypotension after
      position change.
