        -  Assess the overall survival of patients with resectable ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma
           undergoing extended versus standard pancreatoduodenectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or PD with
      extended lymph node resection after an exploratory laparotomy.

      Patients receive adjuvant chemoradiation therapy 4-6 weeks after surgery, if no metastases
      are evident. Radiation therapy is given every week for 5 weeks. Fluorouracil/leucovorin
      calcium is administered by rapid IV push daily within 2 hours of radiation on days 1-4 of
      week 1 and days 29-31 of week 5.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be accrued per group for a total of 100 patients.
