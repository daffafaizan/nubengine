    
      In the dose escalation step (phase 1b), 3 subjects are registered for each dose step, and the
      DLT is evaluated by administering the investigational product for 1 cycle (28 days). However,
      for reasons other than toxicity related to the test drug, the patient was given a combination
      of Paclitaxel and TEW-7197 (Vactosertib) during the DLT evaluation period during the first
      cycle of the planned TEW-7197.

      If more than 80% of the administered dose of (Vactosertib) is not administered, the patient
      will be considered unevaluable for DLT and another patient will be enrolled. At the end of
      one cycle of each cohort, the SMC decides whether to proceed to the next cohort. After
      completing the DLT evaluation of the final phase 1 cohort, the recommended dose to proceed in
      the dose expansion phase (Phase 2a) is determined. For subjects who have completed one cycle
      (DLT evaluation period), administer the investigational drug at the same dose until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Tumor imaging (CT or MRI) for tumor evaluation
      is performed after screening and C1D1. Assessment every 6 weeks (±2 weeks) and at the end of
      treatment (EOT/DC). As efficacy evaluation items, PFS, OS, ORR, and DCR are evaluated
      according to RECIST 1.1, and the amount of change in the biomarker is confirmed.

      In the dose expansion phase (phase 2a), 50 patients will be enrolled at the dose determined
      in the dose escalation phase. Tumor imaging (CT or MRI) for tumor evaluation is evaluated
      every 6 weeks (±2 weeks) after screening and C1D1, and at the end of treatment (EOT/DC). As
      validity evaluation items, PFS, OS, ORR, and DCR according to RECIST 1.1 are evaluated, and
      the amount of change in the biomarker is confirmed.
