      phacoemulsification is considered a safe method of performing cataract surgery, the risk of
      endothelial cell loss (ECL) remains.

      Given that the surgical technique and speed typically improve with surgeon skill and
      experience, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of surgeon experience on the
      occurrence of ECL, as reflected by the presence of corneal edema.
