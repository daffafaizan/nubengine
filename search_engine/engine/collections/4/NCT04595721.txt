      based on what level of pain 0-10 they anticipate they will feel during the local anesthesia
      injection. Following the injection the participant will be asked to quantify the pain felt
      during the injection on a 0-10 Visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scores will only be taken
      from the first injection of the appointment. Participants will be asked their gender, race,
      age, geographic location they spent most of their lives as well. Participants will be
      de-identified and randomly assigned a number that will be recorded along with their collected
      data on a two-factor, password protected web server. Information collected during this study
      may be used for further analysis and publication.
