      in the process of adjustment to chronic stress, independent of the effects of negative
      affects like depression. The overarching goal of this research is to provide evidence and
      direction for the development of interventions for people with HIV that include a focus on
      positive affect. To this end, this study will document the occurrence, predictors, and
      consequences of positive affect during the 18 months post-notification of HIV+ serostatus.
