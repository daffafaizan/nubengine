      transplantation are not considered for transplantation because an HLA identical family or
      unrelated donor is unavailable. For these patients the only curative option is a transplant
      from a partially matched family donor. Such transplants are feasible but are less successful
      than matched sibling donor transplants. The main problems with mismatched transplants are
      graft rejection, graft-vs-host disease, and regimen-related mortality. This restricts the use
      of mismatched transplants to patients less than 45 years at high risk of dying from the
      hematological malignancy.

      This protocol evaluates a new preparative regimen designed to ensure stem cell engraftment by
      increased immunosuppression, followed by a G-CSF mobilized T cell depleted, stem cell rich,
      peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplant from a mismatched related donor in
      patients with high risk hematological malignancies.

      This phase I study evaluates engraftment and GVHD following T cell depleted, HLA-mismatched
      PBPC transplants. Stopping rules will be used to make modifications to the protocol in the
      event of graft failure.

      The end points of the study are graft take, acute and chronic GVHD, leukemic relapse,
      transplant-related mortality, death and leukemia-free survival. Patients will be followed up
      for 5 years. It is planned to treat up to 35 patients aged between 10 and 45 years.
