      among patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease in terms of antibody levels, differences in
      response related to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, duration of the antibody
      response and protective efficacy.

      Of particular interest is the demonstration of seroconversion with neutralizing antibodies,
      their duration during a follow-up of two years and their ability to prevent subsequent
      infections and disease. If antibodies are demonstrated to protect against subsequent
      infections and that protection is long-lasting, this can be instrumental for the
      reincorporation of immune individuals into normal life and economic activities.

      Additional secondary objectives include determination of population-prevalence of past
      infection and assessment of genetic determinants of the immune response and the clinical
      presentation of the disease. Finally, we will investigate secondary transmission in a sample
      of household contacts of Covid-19 cases.

      This study will provide important information to define the use of specific types of
      antibodies and their potential utility for diagnosis, ascertainment of previous exposure and
      acquired immunity. The effort is being conducted by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social,
      the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones
      Biom√©dicas (ACIB), in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute, the US National
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the German Cancer Research Center and will
      be supervised by the Ethical Committee of the CCSS according to local regulations.
