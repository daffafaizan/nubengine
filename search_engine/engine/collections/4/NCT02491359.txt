    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine proportion of subjects with treatment failure by 6 months of carfilzomib therapy
      for chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine 3 month overall (complete + partial), and complete response rate.

      II. Determine 6 month overall (complete + partial), and complete response rate.

      III. Report overall survival, non-relapse mortality, primary malignancy relapse, failure-free
      survival, treatment success, and discontinuation of immune suppression at 6 months and 1
      year.

      IV. Examine functional outcome (2-minute walk test) and patient-reported outcomes (Lee
      Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, quality of life [Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36, Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) Questionnaire], Human Activity
      Profile [HAP]) at study enrollment, 6 months, and 1 year.

      V. Study biologic effects of proteasome inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
