      losing weight improves long-term weight management (i.e., during a subsequent follow-up
      period once classes and staff contact have ended). Overweight/obese participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Maintenance First or Weight Loss First). In the
      Maintenance First condition, participants will learn stability skills during a novel 8-week
      maintenance program before participating in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss
      program. In the Weight Loss First condition (usual care/active comparator condition),
      participants will participate in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program followed
      by a standard 8-week problem-solving skills maintenance program. Participants in both
      conditions will participate in identical standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss programs and
      be offered the same number of 90-minute weekly classes over the 6-month intervention period,
      (thus matching for time and attention from study-led health educators). Participants will be
      assessed at baseline and 6 months during the 6-month intervention period and at 12 and 18
      months during the subsequent 12-month follow-up period (i.e., after classes and staff contact
      have ended). There will be no intervention staff contact during the 12-month follow-up, only
      6, 12 and 18-month assessments. The primary aim will test whether participants in the
      Maintenance First condition gain less weight during the 12-month follow-up period (i.e., 6-18
      months) than those in the Weight Loss First (active comparator) condition. Secondary
      questions of interest include examining psychometrics of lifestyle behavior questions (e.g.,
      physical activity).
