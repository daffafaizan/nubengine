      assessment of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Subject screening will be performed by the
      Penn State Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) medical staff and will include a
      physical exam by a clinician, anthropometry, and a chemical and lipid profile, liver and
      renal function. Women will be either postmenopausal (absence of menstruation of >1 year and
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) >25 milli-international units per milliliter (mlU/ml)) and
      not be taking hormone replacement therapy, or normally menstruating and tested in the early
      follicular phase of their cycle. Subjects will also go through an assessment of conduit
      vessel endothelial and vascular smooth muscle function with brachial artery flow-mediated
      vasodilation (FMD), and sublingual nitroglycerin.

      Subjects will undergo initial microdialysis experiments and biopsy samples will be obtained.
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned to treatment group. Blood pressure will be monitored
      every 2 weeks and weekly compliance checks will be made by the researcher's nurse
      coordinator. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be conducted monthly to
      determine the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment and to inform dosing titration.
      Examining pharmacokinetic and dynamic data from the literature indicate that blood pressure
      lowing and peripheral vascular effects are maximized by 12 weeks of antihypertensive therapy
      and maintained thereafter. After 16 weeks of the assigned intervention, subjects will repeat
      microdialysis experiments and additional cutaneous biopsy samples will be obtained. Conduit
      artery measures including brachial artery FMD and responsiveness to sublingual nitroglycerin
      will also be evaluated at this time.
