      autonomic nervous system. These patients develop neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH)
      because of impaired autonomic reflexes that control cardiovascular and neuro-humoral
      adaptation to upright posture. The treatment of neurogenic OH is challenging; the therapeutic
      options are scarce, and some patients are refractory to treatment.

      Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor that increases the
      availability of norepinephrine in the synapse by blocking its reuptake. Our preliminary data
      in sixty-five patients with primary autonomic failure and neurogenic OH showed that
      atomoxetine was more effective than midodrine, standard of care, in improving standing SBP
      (+7.5 mm Hg). Notably, only atomoxetine and not midodrine induced a significant reduction in
      OH-related symptoms (lightheadedness and dizziness) compared with placebo. In this proposal,
      we will test the hypothesis that prolonged administration of the norepinephrine transporter
      blocker, atomoxetine, improves OH-related symptoms and OH-impact on daily activities compared
      with placebo in autonomic failure patients. We propose a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover study.
