      Lab investigators have designed to obtain biopsies from the upper GI tract.

      A total of twenty (20) subjects, adults 18 years of age and older, scheduled for elective
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy will be enrolled in this study.

      A maximum of 3 cryobiopsies per subject will be collected. After each cryobiopsy is complete,
      the endoscopist will then take 1 standard forceps biopsy from the area adjacent to where
      cryobiopsy was performed. A maximum of 3 standard forceps biopsies for research purposes only
      will be taken. Biopsy collection will be performed at the discretion of the endoscopist. The
      standard forceps biopsy sites will also be monitored directly throughout the entire
      experimental procedure. The total experimental procedure time will not exceed 15 minutes.
