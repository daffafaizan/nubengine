      complication that can occur after a patient undergoes CABG or heart valve surgery. People who
      experience AKI after heart surgery may be at increased risk for post-operative complications,
      including long-term kidney failure or heart damage. AKI is currently identified by testing
      serum creatinine levels in the blood, which is the traditional marker of kidney function.
      However, serum creatinine levels can be affected by other non-kidney-related factors and may
      not positively identify AKI until 48 hours after it begins. This study will examine three new
      biomarkers found in urine and blood-urine interleukin 18 (IL-18), neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and cystatin C-that may be able to predict AKI more
      effectively and faster than serum creatinine levels. In addition, study researchers will also
      determine if changes in these biomarkers can predict the severity of AKI more successfully
      than serum creatinine tests.

      This study will enroll people undergoing CABG or heart valve surgery at Yale-New Haven
      Hospital. Before the surgery and once a day for 5 days after the surgery, blood and urine
      collection will occur. Study researchers will also review participants' medical records.
      Twelve months after hospital discharge, participants will return to the clinic for a
      follow-up visit for repeat blood and urine collection and to complete questionnaires. A
      portion of blood will be saved for future genetic testing; this is optional.
