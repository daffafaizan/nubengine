      genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. We have determined the
      HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptide derived from this molecule and identified that this
      peptide significantly induces the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo.
      According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and
      clinical response of that peptide. Patients will be vaccinated twice a week for 8 weeks. On
      each vaccination day, TTK-A24-567 peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be
      administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until
      patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the
      phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of this peptide vaccine. In the
      following phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine
      therapy.
