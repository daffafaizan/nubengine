      with ω-3 fatty acids reduces plasma triglyceride levels. The mechanisms of action of ω-3
      fatty acids are currently not completely understood. It has been hypothesized that
      polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acids beneficial effects may be mediated through their ability to
      facilitate plasmalogen replenishment.

      Polyphenols are associated with beneficial effects on some cardiovascular risk factors, in
      particular with a reduced lipid oxidation. Less data are available on their effects on lipid
      metabolism. Recent data suggest that these effects could be mediated by changes in
      plasmalogen levels.

      The effects on lipid metabolism of combining the two dietary approaches (ω-3 fatty acids and
      polyphenols) are not known.

      While developed populations live for the most part in the postprandial state, much of the
      information on lipid metabolism refers to fasting condition.

      Dietary Intervention Study Design

      Eighty people at high cardiovascular risk randomly assigned to one of the four different
      nutritional 8-week interventions:

      (A) Control diet poor in omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols (B) Diet rich in omega-3 fatty
      acids (C) Diet rich in polyphenols (D) Diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols
