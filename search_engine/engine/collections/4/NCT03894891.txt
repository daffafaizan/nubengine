      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug or combination of interventions is
      being studied.

      Nivolumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer (head and neck cancer that has come back or is
      incurable) but is considered investigational for head and neck cancer patients who have not
      received prior chemotherapy.
