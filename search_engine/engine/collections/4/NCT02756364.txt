      treat postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human
      epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer that has progressed during
      or after aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of combination of fulvestrant + daily sapanisertib and fulvestrant + weekly sapanisertib
      compared with fulvestrant alone.

      The study will enroll approximately 153 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Fulvestrant 500 mg

        -  Fulvestrant 500 mg + Sapanisertib 4 mg

        -  Fulvestrant 500 mg + Sapanisertib 30 mg

      All participants will receive either fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly (IM), fulvestrant 500
      mg + sapanisertib 4 mg daily or fulvestrant 500 mg + sapanisertib 30 mg weekly.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted Spain and the USA. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic, and end of treatment (EOT) visit which will occur 30 to 40 days after
      receiving their last dose of study drug or before the start of any subsequent anticancer
      therapy. After EOT, participants will be followed for progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).
