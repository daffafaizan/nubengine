      randomized and divided into two groups. (26 patients in each of the PECS and TPVB groups)
      Thoracic paravertebral block was administered from two consecutive levels for TPVB group and
      a modified pectoral nerve block was performed in the PECS group. Postoperative analgesia was
      provided by intravenous morphine infusion using a patient-controlled analgesia device.
      Postoperative 24-hour total morphine consumption and duration of analgesia were the primary
      outcome measure. Perioperative remifentanil use, visual analog scale values during at rest
      and coughing, time of the first analgesic request, and additional analgesic consumption were
      recorded.
