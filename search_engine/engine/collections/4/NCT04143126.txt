      Enhancement Therapy (CET) and Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) for the treatment of
      schizophrenia patients with significant and persistent negative symptoms. A total of 90
      stabilized schizophrenia outpatients with moderate-to-severe persistent negative symptoms
      will be randomized to 18 months of CET or EST. Comprehensive data on persistent negative
      symptoms, social and non-social cognition, and functional outcome will be collected prior to
      treatment and at frequent 6-month intervals to (1) confirm the efficacy of CET and EST for
      improving persistent negative symptoms; (2) confirm the impact of cognitive target engagement
      on reduced negative symptoms; and (3) examine the short-term durability of CET and EST
      effects on negative symptoms and functioning.
