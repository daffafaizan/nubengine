      occlusion is an important element, in order to introduce early therapeutic strategies.
      Invasive coronary angiography (CA) is the gold standard to evaluate the postoperative
      myocardial ischemia due to the graft occlusion. Since this procedure has several important
      risks, such as thromboembolic events, dissection, bleeding, and contrast dye-induced
      nephropathy, in daily clinical practice, only patients with strong clinical suspicion of
      early MI following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergo this invasive procedure.
      There is a clinical need for the development of safe and accurate non-invasive diagnostic
      approaches to assess the early coronary bypass graft occlusion and to predict the consequent
      MI. A new clinical approach for the identification of the early post-procedural graft
      occlusion in patients undergoing CABG surgery is the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin
      (hs-cTn) cut-off level. The peri-operative bypass occlusion will be assessed by a Coronary
      Computed Tomography (CCT) scan which is a widely available non-invasive approach that permits
      an accurate evaluation of coronary stenosis. This study is to evaluate the correlation
      between hs-cTn level as cardiac biomarker for ischemia and early graft occlusion as assessed
      by CCT in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.
