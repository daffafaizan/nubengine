    
      -  Before beginning study treatment, participants will be asked to fill out a Quality of
           Life (QOL) questionnaires, a Speech Assessment, a ChemoSensory Questionnaire, a Patient
           Swallowing Diary, A Swallowing Study, Salivary Tests and a Trismus Assessment.
           Participants will need to go to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) or
           Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for these tests.

        -  Radiation therapy will be given once a day, five days a week, for seven weeks. This will
           be given as outpatient care at the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (proton component)
           and Massachusetts General Hospital (photon component).

        -  During radiation treatments, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously once
           every three weeks. This three-week period is called a cycle of treatment.

        -  After the completion of radiation, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously
           once every 4 weeks along with fluorouracil as a continuous infusion over 4 days starting
           on the day cisplatin is given, for three cycles.

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and blood work drawn weekly to monitor their
           health.

        -  An MR/CT scan of the head and neck will be done 2 months after the radiation treatment.

        -  Follow-up visits will occur once every three months for 2 years, then once every 6
           months during years 3-5, then annually. During these follow-up visits, participants will
           have the following tests and procedures: physical examination; blood work; chest CT scan
           and CT/MRI of the head and neck will be repeated once every 6 months during the first
           three years; swallow study; salivary study; QOL questionnaires; speech assessment;
           ChemoSensory Questionnaire; and Trismus Assessment.
