      A high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal (HFHC) induces an increase in inflammation in
      peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in healthy subjects. A few studies have shown that orange
      juice, when consumed together with the high-fat meal, is able to revert the increase in
      inflammatory markers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To study the effect of a single HFHC meal taken with water, orange juice (500ml) or an
      isocaloric glucose drink on protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
      healthy individuals.

      DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:

      Twelve healthy, normal weight individuals consumed a HFHC meal with water, water with glucose
      or orange juice in a cross-over design with at least one week interval between the meals.
      Blood samples were collected before, 1, 3 and 5h after the meals. Blood glucose, insulin and
      lipid profile were measured. Also, proteome analysis using TMT labeling was performed on
      peripheral-blood mononuclear cells collected before and at times 3 and 5h after the meal.
