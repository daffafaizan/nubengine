      for postoperative pulmonary complications including severe hypoxia are those who undergo
      abdominal surgery, emergency surgery or have a respiratory failure due to chronic lung
      disease including obstructive sleep apnea. The cause of postoperative restrictive lung
      function and hypoxia is unknown. Previous studies report that PaO2 decreases by an average of
      2 kPa after abdominal surgery, while PaCO2 is unchanged and vital capacity decreases by 35%.

      The study aims to investigate changes in lung function and diffusion capacity for carbon
      monoxide after open and minimally invasive abdominal surgery and whether such changes can
      explain hypoxia after surgery.

      Design: Prospective cohort study

      Inclusion: 30 patients undergoing surgery for abdominal surgery

      Exclusion: Dementia or cognitive impairment that makes it impossible to participate in
      studies.

      Method: The day before surgery and the day after surgery: Lung function (Vital capacity and
      FEV1) using box and diffusion capacity measurements and blood gas measurement

      Primary outcome measures:

        -  Pulmonary function test with dynamic spirometry (Vital capacity, FEV1) and diffusion
           capacity for carbon monoxide.

        -  PaO2, PaCO2 and oxygen saturation (blood gas) Other variables examined: age, sex,
           height, weight, type of surgery, type of anesthesia, smoking status, length of surgery,
           previously known lung disease.
