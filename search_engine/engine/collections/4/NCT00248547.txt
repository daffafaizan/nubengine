    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of standard antiemetic therapy comprising ondansetron and
           dexamethasone combined with either aprepitant or placebo in controlling nausea and
           vomiting, as determined by the number of retch/emesis-free days, in patients undergoing
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of aprepitant in these patients.

        -  Compare nausea, appetite, taste changes, nutritional intake, and mucositis in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide, carboxyethylphosphoramide mustard,
           hydroxycyclophylamide, and aprepitant in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, pilot study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on the first day of conditioning chemotherapy, patients receive oral
           aprepitant once daily and standard antiemetic therapy comprising oral or IV ondansetron
           and oral dexamethasone.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily and standard antiemetic therapy as in
           arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues until day 4 after stem cell transplant in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed until day 18.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
