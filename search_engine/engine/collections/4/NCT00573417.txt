    
      This pilot study is an eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, escalating
      dose trial of the novel vigilance-promoting drug, modafinil, added to a stable dose of
      clozapine in 40 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Modafinil will be
      initiated at 100 mg/d. After 2 weeks, the study drug may be increased to 200 mg/d and after 4
      weeks, study drug may be increased to a maximum of 300 mg/d. Dose escalation will be based
      upon persistence of sedation versus emergence of side effects.

        1. Evaluate tolerability and safety of modafinil compared to placebo using the SAFTEE and
           vital signs.

        2. Evaluate the effect size of modafinil compared to placebo upon wakefulness and fatigue
           using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).

        3. Evaluate the effect size of modafinil compared to placebo upon negative symptoms using
           the SANS total score.

        4. Evaluate the effect size of modafinil compared to placebo upon cognitive functioning
           using a standard battery of cognitive tests.

        5. Evaluate the effect size of modafinil compared to placebo upon weight, BMI, waist/hip
           circumference and fasting glucose and lipids.

        6. Effect the variability of response in placebo and modafinil groups for each of the
           outcome measures.
