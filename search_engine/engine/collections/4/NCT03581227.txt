    
      The CAPTURE tool consists of a 5-item self-administered questionnaire and selected use of
      peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement, designed to identify clinically significant COPD.

      For Aim 1 approximately 5,000 patients will be recruited across 100 participating primary
      care clinics. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit during which the CAPTURE
      tool and PEF will be obtained, as well as spirometry and other participant characteristics.
