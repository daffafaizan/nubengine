    
      Randomized multicentric open-label study, comparison of 2 therapeutic strategies.

      2 arms:

        -  Standard of care, non-drug approach: following the recommendations of the Alzheimer's
           disease care by the Frenchh Health Authority. The care is cognitive, psychic, functional
           or social and centered on the patient and his environment. This care is best carried out
           by the memory consultations participating in this study and having extensive experience
           in the care of Alzheimer patients. It is usually based in particular on the prescription
           of cognitive stimulation sessions by a speech therapist and a mobile Alzheimer
           specialist team at home for cognitive remediation sessions.

        -  Donepezil group: Management similar to the previous arm plus addition of Donepezil 5 mg
           per os once a day for one month and then 10 mg per os once a day until the 6th month.
