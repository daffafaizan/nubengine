      system, and under some circumstances,the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.
      An antibody is a natural protein made by our immune system that binds other proteins and
      molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.

      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active
      against Cancer. Bevacizumab is an antibody that works by stopping the formation of blood
      vessels.Rucaparib is an oral pill that can block the ways cells repair their DNA, which can
      cause damage to certain cancer cells.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Nivolumab for Relapsed
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer but it has been approved for other uses.

      Bevacizumab has been FDA approved when used together with chemotherapy for the treatment of
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Or Primary Peritoneal Cancer that has returned within 6 months of a
      chemotherapy that contains a platinum drug.

      Rucaparib has been FDA approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated ovarian
      cancer who have been treated with 2 or more prior chemotherapies or as maintenance therapy
      following for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.

      The combination of Nivolumab, Bevacizumab, and Rucaparib has not been approved by the FDA in
      any setting.
