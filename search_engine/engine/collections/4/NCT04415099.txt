      dynamic and static position of the foot, caused by the tibialis posterior muscle which is
      activated by the fatigue protocol. The study includes 30 healthy patients whose
      socio-demographic and descriptive characteristics are held. The changes in the dynamic and
      static position of foot were measured by pedobarography whereas the level of fatigue was
      measured by Borg Fatigue Scale. The variables were investigated using Shapiro-Wilk's test to
      determine the normality. The student's t-test for paired samples were used to analyse, means
      (X), standard deviations (SD), 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), mean difference and Cohen's
      d-effect size were calculated. The significance level was set at .05. The effect size was
      considered 'small' if d= .20; 'medium' if .d=.5; 'large' if d= .8.
