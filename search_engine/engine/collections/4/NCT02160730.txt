      has shown early signs of anti-cancer activity in approximately 240 patients. Studies included
      a Phase I study in which single agent seliciclib was administered to patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and two Phase IIa studies in which seliciclib was
      administered in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line treatment and with
      docetaxel as second-line treatment in NSCLC. Seliciclib was also evaluated in a Phase I study
      in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) with evidence of tumor shrinkage and concomitant
      reduction in copy counts of the EBV virus that is causally associated with the pathogenesis
      of NPC. Results from APPRAISE, a randomized discontinuation, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, Phase IIb study of oral seliciclib capsules as a monotherapy in heavily
      pretreated patients with NSCLC, demonstrated no difference between the seliciclib and placebo
      arms in progression free survival but a substantial increase in overall survival was observed
      (388 versus 218 days respectively (Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals press release Dec 21, 2010).
      Here, the investigators propose an exploratory, proof of concept clinical trial to determine
      if seliciclib can safely normalize urinary free cortisol levels by reducing pituitary
      corticotroph tumor ACTH production in patients with Cushing disease.
