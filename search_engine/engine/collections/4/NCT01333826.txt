      Education has been suggested as a "social vaccine" to prevent the spread of HIV (Jukes,
      Simmons, and Bundy, 2008), but almost all of the evidence we have on the link between school
      attendance (or attainment) and the risk of HIV infection comes from cross-sectional studies.
      Furthermore, the role of income (especially that of women's poverty) has been hypothesized as
      a significant factor in the spread of HIV in SSA, but again there is no credible evidence
      showing a causal link between income and HIV risk. A randomized intervention, such as the one
      proposed here, that provides randomly varied amounts of cash transfers to young individuals
      and their guardians is the perfect setting to examine the possible existence of such causal
      relationships.

      Objectives:

      The objective of the proposed study here is to provide credible evidence on issues about
      which we still know very little. Specifically, the main questions the study will try to
      answer are the following:

        1. Are the observed effects of a CCT associated with the transfer or the conditionality
           imposed on the recipient?

        2. Do the outcomes of interest improve with increased benefit levels set by the program?

        3. Do CCT programs for schooling have any positive health impacts, including prevention of
           STIs such as HIV/AIDS among young people?
