      (GLP-1) response and fat malabsorption, respectively but do not reverse type 2 diabetes.
      Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery reverses type 2 diabetes 84% of the time while the
      less invasive, reversible laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) procedure reverses
      type 2 diabetes 48% of the time.

      Decreased caloric intake occurs after RYGB and LAGB but increased post-prandial GLP-1
      response and fat malabsorption only occur after RYGB. Since FDA-approved agents Liraglutide
      and Orlistat increase GLP-1 response and fat malabsorption, respectively, it is of
      significant clinical interest to determine if addition of Liraglutide and/or Orlistat can
      improve type 2 diabetes remission rates in the 52% of patients who have not achieved diabetes
      reversal after gastric banding.
