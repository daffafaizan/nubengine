      pre-determined points. Number of attempts to fix the mesh with a novel non-penetrating
      fixation device (LiquiBandFix8) will be recorded. This novel device uses n-butyl
      cyanoacrylate and a defined amount of glue can be delivered with this 5mm laparoscopic
      instrument (liquid anchors).

      In addition, closure of peritoneum should be accomplished using this device.
