      carried out in a group of gingivitis patients who underwent periodontal treatment. Subjects
      were randomly allocated into PHES group (test, n = 25) and standard oral hygiene education
      group (OHE) (control, n=25). Test group received information about the pathogenesis of
      periodontal diseases, its consequences, its interaction with systemic diseases and the
      importance of daily proper cleaning by experienced periodontologist via brochure. Control
      group received only standard oral hygiene instructions. The Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque
      index (RMNPI) and papillary bleeding index (PBI) were utilized to evaluate the oral hygiene
      at baseline and repeated at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up.

      The clinical outcome variables of RMNPI (primary outcome) and PBI (secondary outcome) scores
      were analysed with Mann Whitney U test. Friedman-Wilcoxon sign ranked test was used for
      within group comparison. All data were analysed using the Statistical software (SPSS, version
      19.0, Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value of <0.05 was accepted as statistical significance.
