    
      Pain: Pain intensity was measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which is a straight 10
      cm long devoid of numbers, in which there is only an indication of the extreme left of "no
      pain" and extreme right to "unbearable pain". The higher the score, the greater the pain.

      Feature: Survey conducted by Lequesne, which is an index composed of 11 questions about pain,
      discomfort and function. The scores range from 0 to 24 (without affecting the extremely
      severe, respectively), the higher the score, the greater the impairment.

      Range of motion (ROM): ADM flexion and knee extension was measured using a universal
      goniometer (AESCULAP) with the patient prone second methodology Marques.

      Muscular Strength: To assess the maximal isometric strength of the quadriceps muscle was used
      Dynamometer model Lafayette ® Portable (USA), while seated at 60 ° of knee flexion and this
      gradation was controlled with a goniometer. Patients remained seated on the stretcher and
      held steady with thigh extension strength, the dynamometer being maintained in the distal
      leg. Three measurements were taken, and the mean value.

      Quality of Life: The Questionnaire was used Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis (WOMAC)a self-assessment that evaluates pain, stiffness and physical activity.
      The higher the score, the greater the impact of OA on quality of life.
