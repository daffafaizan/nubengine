      for progression of HIV infection. The study of intercurrent illness in patients with
      initially undetectable viral load removes viral load as a possible cause for virologic and
      immunologic changes and allows for a more direct association of the intercurrent illness with
      changes in viral load, viral HIV-1 phenotypes, viral HIV-1 genotypes, and T cell phenotypes.
      Studying intercurrent illness and viral load provides an opportunity to characterize the
      potentially dynamic changes not only in viral load but also in phenotypic markers of T cell
      activation, plasma cytokine levels, phenotypic and genotypic changes in circulating virus,
      and HIV-1 tropisms.

      This is a study to determine whether patients exhibit a temporary burst of viral replication
      or other changes in response to intercurrent febrile illness. Although there is no study
      treatment, patients on this study must be co-enrolled in at least 1 other ACTG antiretroviral
      treatment study. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and other variables are measured at the time of
      presentation, on Day 3, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24.
