      (Leuprolide and Flutamide), given with suramin (a growth factor inhibitor) to improve the
      clinical outcome(s) in a cohort of patients with bulky metastatic prostate cancer. Combined
      androgen blockage is currently the standard of care for such individuals. Suramin has shown
      reproducible activity in individuals with androgen independent disease. Since these two
      approaches are independent of one another - on the molecular level, and in clinical results -
      it is hoped that the combination of these two approaches will result in improved response
      rates and in improved survival.
