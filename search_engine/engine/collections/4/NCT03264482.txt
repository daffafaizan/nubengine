      enough to warrant surgical intervention, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has
      been the historical reference-standard procedures for prostate size between 30-80 ml for
      years.

      Over the past decade, New minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST), new medications, and
      novel combinations of medical therapies have expanded the number of treatment options ranging
      from watchful waiting to open surgery. The range of treatment options is as broad as the BPH
      spectrum of symptoms.

      These treatment options include prostate vaporization, resection and enucleation using
      various energy sources , however the main theme for all these new procedures that they were
      done using physiological saline as an irrigant nullifying the risk of TUR syndrome.

      One of the biggest changes in surgical treatment of BPH over the past 2 decades has been the
      introduction and use of lasers. Two-micron (Thulium) continuous-wave (CW) laser may have
      several advantages, including sufficient homeostasis with minimal thermal injury, more
      precise tissue incision, and operation in CW/pulsed modes. Pieces of the prostate are
      vaporized small enough to evacuate through the resectoscope sheath and use of a mechanical
      tissue morcellator is not required.

      The introduction of the latest generation of the Thulium laser namely "200w laser " raises
      the expectations of the prostate vaporization.
