      death in the United States. This is largely due to the fact that most patients present with
      advanced, unresectable disease, highlighting the critical need for a screening test for this
      disease. Stool testing is an approach that has not been explored for use in PDC screening.
      With the advent of stool-based DNA tests, it may be possible to target genetic abnormalities
      that have been recently characterized in PDC tumorigenesis.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to determine if deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations present
      in pancreatic cancer and precancerous intrapapillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) can be
      reliably recovered in matched stool.

      Methods: This is a case-control prospective study to determine the utility of a stool-based
      digital melt curve (DMC) assay in PDC screening. A total of 30 patients (18 with pancreatic
      cancer, 12 with IPMN) who will be undergoing pancreatic resection will be enrolled.
      Pancreatic neoplastic tissue will be isolated from their surgical specimens and the genes
      most commonly mutated in PDC will be sequenced from extracted DNA. In addition,
      hypermethylation at common promoter sites will be assessed by methylation-specific PCR. The
      genetic and epigenetic alterations isolated in pancreatic tissue will be utilized as the
      targets for stool DMC assay. Blinded technicians will process stool specimens from control
      patients as well as a matched control. The primary outcomes of this study will be the
      sensitivity and specificity of the stool DMC assay in detecting genetic mutations present in
      tumor or IPMN lesions.
