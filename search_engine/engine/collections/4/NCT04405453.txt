      one or more muscle groups. It is characterized by myofascial trigger points that are felt as
      a band or a nodule harder than normal consistency located in the muscle. Myofascial trigger
      points are developes as a result of muscle injury ; this can be acute trauma caused by sport
      injury, accident, or chronic muscle overuse by repetitive occupational activities, emotional
      stress or poor posture. Trigger point injection is the application of low dose local
      anesthetic drug into the trigger point.Its main purpose is to weaken the trigger point caused
      by muscle spasm.However, it may reduce pain partially or have a short duration of action, so
      it may need to be repeated several times at regular intervals.Trigger point injection can
      reach trigger points in superficial muscles With the erector spina plane block technique,
      more effective and long-term pain treatment can be achieved by reaching deeper trigger
      points. With this hypothesis, we aimed to investigate the contribution of the erector spina
      plane block to trigger point injection in the treatment of myofascial pain.
