    
      -  The combination of all three drugs and radiation treatment has never been given to
           people before, therefore, we are going to add just one additional drug at a time for
           safety reasons.

        -  The first group of participants (3-4) who enroll on the study will receive 5-FU,
           radiation therapy with the added drug oxaliplatin, this is called Regimen level 1. If
           these participants have few or easily manageable side effects, then another group of
           participants will be enrolled and will receive 5-FU, radiation, oxaliplatin with the
           addition of bevacizumab this is called Regimen level 2.

        -  The combination of study drugs and radiation will last about 6 weeks, this 6 week period
           is called a cycle 1.

        -  Regimen Level 1 will receive the following: oxaliplatin intravenously on days 1, 8, 15,
           22, 29, and 36; 5-FU infused by a continuous infusion on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26,
           29-33, and 36-38; radiation therapy Monday-Friday to complete on day 38.

        -  Regimen Level 2 will receive the following; bevacizumab intravenously on days 1, 15, and
           29; oxaliplatin intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36; 5-FU infused by
           continuous infusion days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38; radiation therapy
           Monday-Friday to complete on day day 38.

        -  The following are tests and procedures that will be performed during cycle 1: physical
           examination; blood work, urine sample. perfusion CT scan on day 12 (for those
           participants enrolled at Massachusetts General Hospital).

        -  At the end of cycle 1, CT scans will be performed to evaluate the participants disease
           status before they receive combination gemcitabine and bevacizumab. If the scans show
           the tumor has reduced in size and can be surgically removed, then surgery will be
           scheduled and the patient will receive gemcitabine and bevacizumab about 4 weeks after
           the surgery. If the scans show the tumor can not be removed, the patient will receive
           the gemcitabine/bevacizumab combination about 4 weeks after completing cycle 1.

        -  Cycles 2-5 consist of: gemcitabine given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28
           days; bevacizumab given intravenously on days 1 and 15 every 28 days. During cycles 2-5
           the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical examination including
           vital signs on day 1 and 15 of each cycle; blood work on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle;
           a urine sample on day 1 of each cycle; CT scans will be done every 2 cycles.

        -  It will take about 7 months to complete the study treatment (longer for those who have
           surgery after Cycle 1).
