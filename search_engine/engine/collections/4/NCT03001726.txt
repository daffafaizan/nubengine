      Several retrospective, single institutional studies have shown that the addition of
      gastrectomy to chemotherapy might improve patient survival among patients with metastatic
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor. However, REGATTA trial, a phase 3,
      randomized controlled trial, concluded an opposite conclusion that gastrectomy followed by
      chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor. Interestingly, five patients initially
      assigned to chemotherapy alone in the study had got survival benefit form gastrectomy with
      curative intent because of complete disappear of all non-curable factors during chemotherapy.
      This finding raised the question as to conversional radical surgery following upfront
      chemotherapy could be a possible treatment option. We assessed the effectiveness of
      conversional radical surgery following docetaxel, oxalipaltin and S1 therapy for advanced
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor.
