      psychiatric disorders, and is associated with 4.6-fold risk for MDD later in life. In spite
      of these epidemiological data, the neurobiological underpinnings associated with maladaptive
      sequelae of severe childhood adversity as well as resilience remain largely unknown.

      Preclinical research suggests that early adversity leads to (1) structural abnormalities in
      brain regions critically implicated in stress regulation; (2) increased oxidative stress; and
      (3) glutamatergic abnormalities. The current research protocol is designed to prospectively
      test the contributions of these abnormalities in individuals exposed to severe childhood
      adversity.

      Improving our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms associated with different childhood
      adversity outcomes is of paramount importance in order to (1) identify individuals at risk
      for psychopathology and maladaptive behavior, (2) prevent re-victimization, and (3) develop
      more targeted therapeutic interventions.
