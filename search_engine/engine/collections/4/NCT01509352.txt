      require an operation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is intended to be a definitive
      study. All patients will receive the standard operation for reflux: laparoscopic
      fundoplication. The dissection will be performed by leaving the phrenoesophageal membrane
      intact in all patients.

      One group will undergo laparoscopic fundoplication with 4 esophageal-crural sutures while the
      other group will not have these placed. The operation, post-operative care, and follow-up
      plan will otherwise not differ between groups.
