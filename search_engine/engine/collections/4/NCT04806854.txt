      study therapy. Once subjects have completed screening, and if they are determined to be
      eligible, they will return to the clinic for a 12-hour pulsatility study. On Day Two of the
      trial, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two oral daily doses of LUM-201 and PK
      samples will be collected. All subjects will have an equal chance of being placed in either
      of the two groups.

      The trial consists of 6 months of treatment. After screening, subjects will return to the
      clinic monthly for visits. At most clinic visits, subjects will have a physical exam, blood
      and urine collections. At the Month 6 visit subjects will repeat the 12-hour pulsatility and
      PK studies.
