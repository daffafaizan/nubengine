      premenopausal overweight or obese women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) a
      control group (C, N=21) that participated only in measurements, (b) a training group (TR,
      N=14) that participated in a supervised 40-week DoIT workout exercise training program and
      (c) a training-detraining group (TRD, N=14). During the first 20 weeks, TR and TRD followed
      exactly the same training protocol. At the end of this period, TR continued training for 20
      more weeks whereas TRD terminated training for 20 weeks (detraining). Anthropometric,
      metabolic, daily nutritional intake, habitual physical activity and performance measurements
      were performed in all groups at baseline, at 20 weeks and 40 weeks.
