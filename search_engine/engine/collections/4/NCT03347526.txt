    
      This is a prospective randomized trial comparing 3 treatment arms:

        1. Cosyntropin Injectable Suspension, 1 mg/mL

        2. Vigabatrin

        3. Combination of both these therapies, Cosyntropin Injectable Suspension, 1 mg/mL and
           vigabatrin for treatment of new onset infantile spasms. Outcome measures include
           resolution of clinical spasms, improvement of hypsarrhythmia as well as longer term
           outcomes of development and subsequent seizures.

      The data is expected to demonstrate greater efficacy with Cosyntropin Injectable Suspension,
      1 mg/mL than vigabatrin for the treatment of IS.
