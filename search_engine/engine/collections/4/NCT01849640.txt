      care therapy with DHA-piperaquine to monitor therapeutic efficacy and measure resistance. The
      cardiac safety of piperaquine will be monitored with electrocardiograms during the treatment
      period. Resistance to DP and DP-PQ will be assessed by a combination of clinical,
      pharmacologic, and parasitologic parameters including genomic signatures of selection during
      careful weekly follow-up visits for 42 days. Volunteers will be randomized on day 3 to either
      a single 45mg dose of primaquine or no sexual stage therapy to evaluate effects of primaquine
      on the sexual stages of malaria (gametocytes) and potential transmissibility of infection to
      Anopheles mosquitoes as compared to those not treated with primaquine.
