      stage breast cancer is 15 to 30 treatments delivered once a day for 3 to 6 weeks. This
      treatment schedule can be inconvenient and costly for elderly, rural, uninsured, and minority
      patients. This study will evaluate a new radiation treatment schedule called whole-breast
      accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHF-RT). AHF-RT delivers higher doses of radiation
      in fewer treatments than traditional radiation therapy. The AHF-RT treatment course is
      completed with 5 radiation treatments delivered once a week for 5 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy
      (AHF-RT) is a safe, effective, more convenient, and less costly alternative to traditional
      radiation that will offer the same chance of cure with no additional side effects.
