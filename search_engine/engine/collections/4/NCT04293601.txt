      following risk factors:

        -  Very Low birth weight (< 1500 g)

        -  Gestational age < 32 weeks

        -  NCPAP duration > 5 days

        -  NICU stay of > 14 days

      However, previous studies results are mixed regarding factors affecting nasal injuries in
      neonates supported with NCPAP.

      Interventions indicated as protective are:

        -  Appropriate size of mask or nasal prongs and headbands

        -  Use of hydrocolloid as nasal barrier dressing

        -  A frequent alternation of the NCPAP device (nasal prongs or mask)

        -  A frequent assessment of skin integrity In this study a cohort of neonates (experimental
           group) will be prospectively enrolled and compared to a cohort of neonates born in 2018
           (retrospective group) with similar characteristics. The NICU clinical procedures for
           skin integrity are similar for both cohorts but the experimental group will receive them
           with different frequency and modality based on previously defined risk factors that each
           newborn present.

      Hence, aim of this study is:

      - To asses the effectiveness of specific nursing care interventions on the incidence of
      pressure injuries due to NCPAP support in neonates admitted to NICU.
