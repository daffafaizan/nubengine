      following participants forward in time), single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than 1
      center), interventional pilot study of the effects of a combined dietary and exercise
      intervention on glucose metabolism. The duration of this study will be 6 months and will
      include following visits: Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24. Dietary compliance will be
      evaluated with a 3-day food record and during weekly telephone conversations and face-to-face
      visits with a dietician. Exercise compliance will be measured using an exercise log presented
      to the co-ordinator at the end of each month. Primarily, participants with insulin resistance
      will be assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) of greater than
      1 at 6 months. Participants' safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.
