      LOcalisation (A-POLO), with optimised margins and cone beam CT technology for improving the
      accuracy of radiotherapy treatment delivery.

      The previous study (CCR2873, REC 07/Q0801/13) evaluated the use of cone beam CT in
      radiotherapy for bladder cancer. A larger than expected number of bladder radiotherapy
      treatments were seen to have been delivered with some element of geographic miss. Using the
      novel adaptive planning method these fractions of radiotherapy could have been correctly
      treated. The feasibility of this method has been proven in the previous study, particularly
      it has been shown that this method is appropriate and provides a simple solution to the
      problem. It can be carried out by the radiographers at the treatment unit without adding
      extra time to the treatment.
