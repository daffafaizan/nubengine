      different analgesic strategies, continuous interscalene block is reported to be an efficient
      method, reducing opioid consumption and allowing rapid rehabilitation; however, patients may
      develop a transient neuropathy after surgery, which could have a significant impact on active
      patients. This study is designed to compare the incidence of brachial plexus injury in two
      groups of patients: one with a continuous interscalene block, and one with a patient control
      analgesia of morphine (self-iv administration of morphine). All patients will have a clinical
      neurological exam with a preoperative electromyogram in order to rule out a pre-existing
      neuropathy. Another clinical neurological exam with electromyogram will be performed between
      4 and 6 postoperative weeks and, if pathological repeated at 6 months, 9 months and 12
      months. The surgery will be done under general anesthesia for all patients.
