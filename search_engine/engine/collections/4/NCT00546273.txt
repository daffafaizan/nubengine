      conditions, fragmented, detoxified, heat inactivated (FCMtb) and liposomed. RUTI provides a
      strong humoral and cellular immune response against antigens from active growing and latent
      bacilli but also against structural antigens, as it has been proved in animal models of
      latent tuberculosis infection. The vaccine has been designed to be used against Latent
      Tuberculosis Infection as a therapeutic vaccine after 1-month of chemotheraputic treatment,
      instead the current treatment based on 6-9 months of chemotherapy.
