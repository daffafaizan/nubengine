      order to determinate the frequency of CHRNA4 AND CYP2B6.

      The polymorphisms in genes involved in the coding of metabolized drug enzymes, in the
      variability of carrier proteins or receptors are at the heart of these investigations. The
      gene CHRNA4 is an important gene for anti-smoking pharmacogenetics studies because they
      encode the alpha 4 beta 2 subunits of acetylcholine- nicotinic receptors ( which is important
      target for an action of varenicline ) and CYP2B6 major isoenzyme that metabolizes the
      bupropion. Rocha et al found the association of polymorphisms CHRNA4rs1044396 with success in
      smoking cessation in patients treated with varenicline and Tomaz et al found an association
      between CYP2B6rs2279343 and efficacy of bupropion.

      Patients with the CC genotype, for the polymorphism CHRNA4rs1044396, had a lower success rate
      in treatment with varenicline( 29,5% ), compared to those with CT or TT genotypes (50,9% ) (
      P =0,07 , n=167 ). The CT or TT genotypes were associated with a higher risk - Odds ratio (
      OR ) - of success ( OR=1,67, IC 95%=1,10-2,53,P=0,02), in a multivariate model. Patients with
      the genotype AA, for the polymorphism CYP2B6rs2279343, obtained a higher success rate in
      treatment with bupropion ( 48,0% ), compared to patients with the AG or GG genotypes ( 35,5%
      ) (P=0,05,n=237). The AA genotype was associated with higher odds ratios for treatment
      success (OR=1,92,IC 95%=1,08-3,42,P=0,03) ,in a multivariate model.

      It is suggested that these polymorphisms influence the pharmacological response and may be
      important for the design of an individualized pharmacotherapy.
