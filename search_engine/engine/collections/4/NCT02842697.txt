      Beijing (Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing Shijitan Hospital) centers designed to determine the
      diagnostic performance of vHVPG (investigational technology) by anatomic CTA for non-invasive
      assessment of the CSPH in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Direct HVPG measurement by
      means of catheterization of a hepatic vein with a balloon catheter is the gold-standard
      method to assess the presence of CSPH, which is defined as HVPGâ‰¥10 mmHg.
