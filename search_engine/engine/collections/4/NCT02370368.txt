    
      A randomised clinical trial will be used consisting of 34 (17 in each group) athletes
      undergoing training. Both groups will undergo one hour of training three times weekly for six
      weeks, with one group doing dance training (DT) using the Xbox Kinect and the other doing
      standard training (ST) using traditional ladder drills. Outcomes will be assessed using the
      Illinois Agility test for agility, sit and reach test for general flexibility, straight leg
      raise test for hamstring flexibility and the Thomas test for hip flexor extensibility.
