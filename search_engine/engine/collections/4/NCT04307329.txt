    
      In this phase II clinical trial with an explorative nature, the efficacy of the combination
      of monalizumab and trastuzumab is assessed in patients with metastatic or locally incurable
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Clinical efficacy will be assessed in patients with high stromal
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) or low sTILs in two separate cohorts (higher or equal
      to 5% versus lower than 5%). Since the combination of monalizumab and trastuzumab has not
      been administered before, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be monitored throughout the
      trial using the Pocock-type boundary rules for continuous monitoring of toxicity in phase II
      trials.

      In the first stage, 11 patients will be accrued per cohort. If there are 1 or fewer responses
      in these 11 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be
      accrued for a total of 19 patients.

      The study will start with two cohorts (sTILs high and sTILs low), a total of 22 (2x11)
      patients will be included in the first stage. Dependent on the interim analysis (continuation
      of no cohorts, 1 or 2 cohorts), a maximum of 38 patients will be included.
