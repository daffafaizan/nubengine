      and problems with logistics and preparations for the main hospital (Ostfold Hospital Trust)
      moving into a new hospital, we were unable to extend the recruitment period in study 1. In
      RCT (3) AI was not an inclusion criterion. However, as both RCTs had the same outcome
      measure; anal incontinence, and a joint randomization process, stratified on hospital site
      and whether the participants had sustained an obsteric anal sphincter injury at delivery or
      not, the results from these studies will be reported together.
