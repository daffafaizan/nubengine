      their own non-computerized hydraulic foot, while in-socket pressures are measured. The
      prosthetic foot will then be replaced by a computerized prosthetic foot for one month,
      following which, the measurements will be repeated. Gait factors will be examined
      (spatio-temporal data, center of pressure movement) and internal loads inside the residuum
      will be evaluated. Comparison will also include patient's satisfaction and his ability to
      move around, evaluated by dedicated questionnaire.
