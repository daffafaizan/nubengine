    
      To evaluate the short-term effects of a daily dose of Polyphenon E administered during the
      interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy in men with recently diagnosed
      prostate cancer. Endpoints will be changes in serum and tissue biomarkers related to
      progression of cancer.

      The effect of Polyphenon E on tumor cell c-Met expression and phosphorylation is the primary
      objective. Secondary objectives include the effects on the other tissue and serum biomarkers.
      Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of Polyphenon E in this subject population is
      another objective.

      1.1 Determine the effects of Polyphenon E on tumor cell c-Met expression and phosphorylation
      levels in patients with prostate cancer 1.2 Determine the effects of Polyphenon E on PI-3K
      activation in patients with prostate cancer 1.3 Determine the effects of Polyphenon E on MAPK
      activation in patients with prostate cancer 1.4 Determine the effects of Polyphenon E on
      expression levels of other proteins involved in motility and invasion such as Rho GTPases and
      extracellular proteinases in patients with prostate cancer 1.5 Determine the effects of
      Polyphenon E on markers of angiogenesis in patients with prostate cancer 1.6 Determine the
      effects of Polyphenon E on serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in patients with prostate
      cancer 1.7 Determine the effects of Polyphenon E on other serum markers: C-reactive protein
      (CRP), Insulin-Like Growth factor I (IGF-I), Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3
      (IGFBP-3), Hepatocyte Growth Factor HGF 1.8 Evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      Polyphenon E in this subject population
