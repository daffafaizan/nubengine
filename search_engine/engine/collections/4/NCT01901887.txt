      fatty acids (omega-3 HUFAs) reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal
      thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk, in a Veteran and
      non-Veteran population that is at risk for suicidal behaviors. Changes in cognitive processes
      specific to suicide risk will be evaluated, including implicit associations, response
      inhibition and sustained attention. Sub-analyses will evaluate efficacy in reducing
      depressive symptoms, alcohol and nicotine use among Veterans and non-Veterans with
      concomitant significant depressive symptoms, and alcohol and nicotine use disorders. In
      addition, a sub-study will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate
      the neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects of the omega-3 HUFAs. This study seeks
      to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 HUFAs among a representative population of US Veterans
      and non-Veterans already receiving appropriate medical care so that if successful, these
      results can be readily applied to broader populations in the US.
