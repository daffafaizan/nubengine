      health at whole body level to cell studies. Cells will be isolated from muscle samples
      obtained from the post-menopausal women before and after the training intervention. This will
      enhance the understanding of the changes that occur after prolonged loss of estrogen on
      thrombotic risk and vascular function, and whether exercise training can alter these
      parameters.
