      patients should continue therapy unless disease progression is documented on two occasions at
      least 1 week apart. Progressing patients will have dexamethasone 20 mg twice per week added
      to the perifosine. Patients who experience toxicity may continue on treatment with doses
      delayed or reduced.

      Evaluations: Serum and/or urine-electrophoresis will be evaluated for progression or response
      at 3 week intervals.

      This study will enroll a total of up to 64 patients.
