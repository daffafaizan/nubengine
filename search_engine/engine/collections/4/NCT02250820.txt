      undergoing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

        -  One method provides sedation by mouth with the drug pentobarbital,

        -  The other provides sedation through the nose with the drug dexmedetomidine.

      The choice of which method is used is based on evaluation of the patient's medical history
      and the preference of the anesthesiologist. To our knowledge, no study has compared these two
      sedation techniques for quality of care. The proposed study will help us determine which
      method yields the best quality and will allow us to improve the healthcare experience of our
      patients.
