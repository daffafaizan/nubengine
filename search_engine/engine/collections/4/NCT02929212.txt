      Patients will be studied before GBP (T0) and 12-15 months after GBP (T1). At T0 and T1,
      patients will come for 2 study days for 8 hours: On one study day, a single meal will be
      served, on the second study day, three small meals, with the order of the conditions randomly
      assigned. The total amount of calories (600 kcal) and the over all nutrient composition (55%
      CHO, 15 % protein, 30% fat) will be equivalent between conditions. The meals will be either
      all solid or all liquid. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to solid or
      liquid test meals.

      Recruitment and data gathering for this study were performed at St. Luke's Hospital in New
      York, NY. Data Analysis was performed at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY.
