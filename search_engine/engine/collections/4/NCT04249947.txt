      dose-escalating cohorts of single and multiple doses of P-PSMA-101 to determine a Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Additional participants will be treated with P-PSMA-101 at the
      determined RP2D.

      Following consent, enrolled participants will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to obtain
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which will be sent to a manufacturing site to
      produce P-PSMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the investigational site
      and administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen. Rimiducid may be administered
      as indicated.
