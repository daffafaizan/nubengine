      points, taut bands, range of motion limitations and pain. One of the most common place for
      MPS is neck region and trapezius muscle is the common cause of these symptoms and 9 different
      trigger point location has been identified on trapezius muscle. Myofascial trigger points,
      characterized by hypersensitive nodules, can be palpated in stretched bands in the affected
      muscles. In order to eliminate trigger points fascial releasing, dry needling, kinesio taping
      and other physical therapy applications can be used.

      Although there are several studies investigating the effectiveness of Kinesio taping (KT) and
      Dry needling(DN) methods in MPS, it is controversial which one is superior to others.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of exercise, KT, and DN methods on pain and
      disability in the treatment of upper trapezoidal muscle MPS.
