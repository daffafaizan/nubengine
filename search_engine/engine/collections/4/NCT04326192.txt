      metabolism by upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We believe that our
      multidisciplinary research team presents a unique opportunity to test whether SCS can
      activate BAT metabolism, as tested during a routine screening procedure for spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) for pain control. Our marker for BAT activation is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) - positron emission tomography (PET), which has previously been used to gauge
      cold-evoked BAT activation, and other studies of BAT in humans. We believe this
      proof-of-concept study could pave the way for a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of
      morbid obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
