    
      Randomized, single-center study. Forty-five patients with intended BVS implantation will be
      randomized in ratio of 1:1:1 to different predilatation strategies(non-compliant
      balloon/Emerge NC™, Boston Scientific, cutting balloon/Flexitome™, scoring
      balloon/Scoroflex™,Orbus). Predilatation is intended to be done in a vessel:balloon ratio of
      1:1. If the device is not able enter the lesion, it will be replaced with a conventional
      semicompliant balloon with the same predilatation strategy (a vessel:balloon ratio of 1:1)
      After a successful predilatation, the BVS (Absorb™, Abbott) will be implanted and this
      procedure will be accomplished by a high pressure postdilatation with a non-compliant balloon
      (Emerge NC™, BSCI). The MLA of the Absorb stent will be evaluated with optical coherence
      tomography (OPTIS, St.Jude).
