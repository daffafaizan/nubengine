      normal endometrial tissue and tumor tissue. No additional endometrial tissue will be taken
      for this study other than what is surgically indicated to resect the patients tumor
      completely. Prior to this surgery, patients will receive one more dose of L9NC in the
      outpatient clinic in the same manner as the other L9NC treatments they have received. After
      the tumor has been removed, the tissue will be examined by a pathologist, who will take what
      is needed to diagnose the residual disease. What is not needed for patient care will be used
      for research. A piece of the tumor and some normal endometrial tissue surrounding the tumor
      will be sent to the Investigational Drug Program laboratory, which is located in the Cancer
      Center, to measure the amount of drug that is left in the patients tumor. The patients tissue
      will be kept until all tissues are collected from all patients, which could take up to 10
      years. The tissue will not be used for any other purpose. The samples will be labeled with
      the patients initials.
