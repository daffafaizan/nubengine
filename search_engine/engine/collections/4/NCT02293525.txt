      disorders ranging from instability to degenerative disc disease. However, severe
      postoperative pain is a significant adverse outcome in patients who have undergone a lumbar
      spinal fusion procedure. This pain may delay mobilization and decrease compliance with
      physical, occupational, or pulmonary physiotherapy.

      Pain symptoms may worsen with activity and ambulation due to reflex spasms of the paraspinal
      muscles elicited by pain from the wound. A local anesthetic agent administered immediately
      after surgery into the tissue surrounding the wound addresses the pain source for less than
      four hours. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider continuous local anesthetic infusion,
      which may limit local pain mediators for a longer duration.

      Continuous local anesthetic infusion into the paraspinal musculature with the ReLeaf catheter
      has the potential to reduce pain, narcotic demand & usage, and accelerate the rate of
      recovery in lumbar spinal fusion patients.
