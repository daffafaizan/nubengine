      metastatic breast cancer harboring BCBM, pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes:

        -  Cohort A = Newly diagnosed, untreated BCBM, not candidate to initial surgery or
           stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and with pauci-symptomatic disease not requiring
           immediate whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)

        -  Cohort B = BCBM pretreated with SRS and/or surgery alone, without WBRT, and not
           requiring immediate WBRT

        -  Cohort C = BCBM pretreated with WBRT
