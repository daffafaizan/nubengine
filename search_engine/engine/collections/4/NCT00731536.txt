      then followed backward in time, for the outcome of the study) study. In this study review of
      all reports of possible cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) that were identified
      within the PALGA database of pathology results for The Netherlands from 1995 to 2008. All
      patients whose information is contained within the PALGA database were prescribed treatments
      by a physician on the basis of usual clinical practice or may have received other treatments,
      including experimental drugs, while participating in an interventional clinical study. The
      identified data on each of the patients with reports of HSTCL will be collected from the
      pathologist(s) who prepared the report and from the physician(s) who treated the patient at
      the time of diagnosis.
