      study V49_24 (NCT01680016), an immunogenicity and safety trial conducted in Chinese children
      (6 to 17 years) and adults (â‰¥51 years), which confirmed the non-inferior immunogenicity of
      the Zagreb versus the conventional Essen post exposure prophylaxis intramuscular (PEP IM)
      regimen at Day 15 for both age groups.

      At the time of license renewal in 2015, the Chinese health authorities requested that GSK
      continue to conduct immunogenicity persistence follow-ups for at least 1 year to compare the
      Zagreb regimen with the Essen regimen in populations under 17 years old.

      V49_24E1 is an extension study to meet this request, in which subjects aged 17 years or
      younger who were immunized in the parent trial V49_24 will be recalled for a blood
      immunogenicity analysis approximately 4-5 years after the original vaccination.
