      Ryd√©n).

      This study will evaluate two new methods for the early detection of acute kidney injury in
      200 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery at the Karolinska Hospital.

      These methods are:

        1. Ultrasound based measurement of the kidneys blood flow profile measured using renal
           resistive index (RRI). This will be measured prior and within 4 hours post surgery. Ref
           Herzberg, Le Dorze.

        2. Urine creatinine clearance will be measured in the first four hours after cardiac
           surgery.

      The investigators will also measure known renal injury markers in blood and urine samples
      post operatively. These include Neutrophil gelatinise-associated lipocalin (NGAL), tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-2), Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
      (IGFBP7), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1), Nephroclear, Interleukin 18 (IL-18), Fatty
      acid-binding protein (L-FABP), Fibulin-1, cystatin C och albumin.

      The new methods of AKI detection will be used to build a statistical model to predict AKI
      after cardiac surgery. We will determine whether the addition of renal injury markers and
      epidemiological factors known to be associated with the development of AKI (variables such as
      age, known chronic renal dysfunction or heart failure) can improve precision in diagnosis.

      AKI will be defined by the Kidney Disease improving Global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (Ref
      KDIGO KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury, Khwaja A).
