           compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer
           who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor
           and neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (Stratum A [surgery of the primary tumor followed by
           adjuvant chemotherapy] and Stratum B [neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery]
           combined).

        -  to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS)
           compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer
           who have completed treatment with curative intent including neoadjuvant chemotherapy
           followed by surgery (Stratum B).

        -  to determine whether Avelumab improves overall survival (OS) compared to observation in
           patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed
           treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor and neo- or
           adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS)
           compared to observation in PD-L1-positive (as determined by a companion diagnostic test
           under development) patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who
           have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor and
           neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy.
