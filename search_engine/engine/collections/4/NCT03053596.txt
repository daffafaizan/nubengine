    
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer in men and the eight
      in women and is the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The overall
      incidence of HCC remains high in developing countries and is steadily rising in most
      industrialized countries.

      Available treatment options depend on the size, number, and location of tumors; degree of
      cirrhosis, if present; and comorbidities; overall performance status; patency of portal vein;
      and presence of metastatic disease. They include surgical (liver resection, liver
      transplantation), medical (e.g. sorafenibâ€¦), ablative (ethanol ablation, radiofrequency
      ablation, cryoablation) and intra-arterial (chemoembolization, radioembolization) modalities.

      Trans Arterial Chemo-Embolization (TACE) with various drugs (anthracyclines being among the
      most commonly used ones) has been an important therapeutic option for treatment of patients
      with intermediate stage HCC according to BCLC/EORTC guidelines (REF). In order to maximize
      therapeutic efficacy of TACE, chemotherapy loadable beads were developed allowing to lower
      systemic toxicity of chemotherapy, to deliver high and sustained chemotherapy concentration
      to the tumor, and to prolong delivery of drug and embolization to the tumor.

      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate liver and systemic toxicity, treatment efficacy,
      and safety of Drug Elutable Beads -TACE using anthracyclin loaded Life-Pearls -TACE for
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
