      haemophilia is taken. There are no scientific data on the HRQoL in patients after switching
      from Standard Half Life (SHL) FVIII prophylaxis to efmoroctocog alfa (Extended Half Life,
      EHL) prophylaxis in Russia.

      It will be a 12-month prospective open-label, single-arm multicentre study. Evaluation of
      parameters will be carried out on the backdrop of patient treatment in the settings of
      routine medical practice. No medical examinations/ procedures/ treatment(s) on the top of
      regular medical practice are planned, except fixed time of examinations. Providing the
      centers/ patients with the study drug (efmoroctocog alfa) may be considered as interventional
      component, whereas all administrations should be in accordance with Instruction on Medical
      Use approved by Russian Ministry of Health.

      Research question:

      Whether there are the changes in quality of life in patients with haemophilia A after
      switching from SHL FVIII prophylaxis to efmoroctocog alfa prophylaxis?

      No hypothesis is formulated for this exploratory study. The obtained data will be used to
      assess real world data on quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with haemophilia
      A after switching from SHL FVIII prophylaxis to efmoroctocog alfa prophylaxis in routine
      medical practice in Russia
