    
      Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS) is the first glomerulopathy in children and 60% of the
      patients develop Steroid-Dependant Nephrotic Syndrome (SDNS). Depleting B cells demonstrated
      the ability to increase relapse free survival and to decrease the number of relapse and the
      need of other immunosuppressive drugs. However, the remission rate after 2 years is only 30
      to 40%.

      The aim of the study is to study the ability of intravenous Immunoglobulin to improve
      remission rate in SDNS when added associated with Rituximab compared to a treatment by
      Rituximab alone.
