      placebo and SRX246 for 5-7 days before testing (given in counter-balanced order). The study
      will examine the effect of the drug on the potentiation of startle using a well-established
      paradigm that involves anticipation of no-shock, predictable shock, and unpredictable shock.
      Drug effects on emotion recognition will also be explored.
