      injury. It is a concept that briefly induced ischemia and reperfusion before the myocardial
      injury can reduce the myocardial injury. But it is difficult to apply ischemic
      preconditioning in operative field, because cross-clamping of aorta or coronary artery is
      difficult and invasive. Afterward concept of remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) has
      introduced that ischemia of remote organs like kidneys, skeletal muscles can reduce distant
      myocardial injury.

      It is known that myocardial protective effect of ischemic preconditioning have biphasic
      pattern. Early protective effect wanes after a few hours, then recurs after 24-48 hours, and
      can persist for up to 3-4 days. It is called second window of preconditioning or delayed
      ischemic preconditioning. Delayed ischemic preconditioning is similar to early ischemic
      preconditioning in mechanism but it is different that it produces protein that can mediate
      myocardial protection effect.

      Unlike ischemic preconditioning, it is little known about delayed effect of RIPC. RIPC can be
      done by applying compression cuff on upper or lower extremities and it is noninvasive and
      easy to deliver compared to ischemic preconditioning that is done by aorta or coronary artery
      clamping.

      Delayed ischemic preconditioning is performed one day before the surgery, and it is safe and
      easy to apply RIPC in a clinical setting. And in this study investigators are going to
      evaluate cardioprotective effect of delayed RIPC. Myocardial injury can be predicted by
      elevation of cardiac enzyme. Investigators are going to perform RIPC one day before the valve
      replacement surgery and compare troponin I with control group to assess cardioprotective
      effect of delayed RIPC.
