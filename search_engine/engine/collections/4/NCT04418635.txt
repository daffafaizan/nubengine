      from patients and are divided into three groups, storage, voiding, and postmicturition
      symptoms. Many epidemiological studies have pointed out that the prevalence of LUTS among
      individuals aged at least 40 years in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, China,
      Taiwan, and South Korea is up to 60%. LUTS may cause mental health disorders such as anxiety
      and depression and affect lifestyle that leads to a negative impact on the quality of life.
      In recent years, there have been numerous academic or clinical studies that assess the
      improvement of plant and herb extracts in LUTS.

      Prosta-OK® Neo is mainly comprised of herb extracts, including lycopene, phellinus linteus,
      pomegranate, pumpkin seed, selenium and zinc that have been demonstrated with functions of
      inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and regulating the synthesis of
      nitric oxide.

      The aim of the study is to explore whether take Prosta-OK® 2 tablets for 85 days compared
      with placebo group can help reduce symptoms and elevate the quality of life in patients with
      mild to severe non-neurogenic male LUTS receiving Tamsulosin therapy.
