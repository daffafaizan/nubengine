    
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic kidney
      disease and the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease in adults Worldwide.

      The tolvaptan tablet has been approved by EMA (European Medicines Agency) with the indication
      of slowing the progression of cysts development and renal insufficiency in adults with ADPKD.
      It is the newest and only possible treatment for this patient group and could be initiated in
      patients with evidence for rapidly progressive disease Development.

      There is however in Denmark and other countries both scientific and financial reluctance to
      initiate this expensive treatment for several reasons e.g. selection of patients who might
      benefit, effect on progression of kidney disease, side effects and tolerability.

      Before deciding on implementation in Denmark, more knowledge is needed. The results of the
      PoCKET trial will contribute with guidance on this decision.

      Foremost the trial is designed to address not only the change in kidney volume, but the
      change in kidney function, which is what matters to the patients and their prognosis in terms
      of postponing time to end stage renal disease. Furthermore, important data on side effects
      and tolerability will be generated.
