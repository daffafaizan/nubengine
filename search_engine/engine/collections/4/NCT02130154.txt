      Elderly are known to have less metabolically active brown adipose tissue as compared to their
      younger counterparts.

      The reason for this diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue activity is unknown.

      However, a lower sympathetic nervous system activation to brown adipose tissue in the elderly
      might explain a diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue.

      Therefore, in this study, both the sympathetic nervous system activation to brown adipose
      tissue and the metabolic activity will be measured in young and older subjects.

      sympathetic nervous system activity will be measured using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine
      single-photon emission computed tomography computed tomography scans, metabolic activity will
      be measured using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scans.
