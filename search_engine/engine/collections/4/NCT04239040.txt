    
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the GVAX vaccine as a treatment
      for any disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab or ipilimumab for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      This phase 1 study will be conducted in 2 parts

        -  In the first part, participants will, as part of standard of care procedure to remove
           cancerous tissue, undergo neuroblastoma cell collection from a portion of resected
           tumor.

        -  Those cells will then be used to create the vaccine which will be stored for potential
           use during the second part of this research study.

        -  In the second part, participants who did not respond to standard therapy will receive
           the GVAX vaccine along with nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      The study treatment will continue for up to 24 months and participants will be followed for 2
      years after last study treatment (if received at least one vaccination).
