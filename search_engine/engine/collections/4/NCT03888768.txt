    
      Patient blood management (PBM), refers to "the timely application of evidence based medical
      and surgical concepts designed to maintain haemoglobin concentration, optimise haemostasis
      and minimize blood loss in an effort to improve patient outcome.

      PBM relies on three corresponding aspects:

        1. Optimising haemopoiesis,

        2. Minimising bleeding and blood loss

        3. Harnessing and optimising physiological tolerance of anaemia.

      Therefore, this randomised control trial aims to study the effect of applying a modified
      patient blood management protocol on the perioperative allogenic blood transfusion incidence,
      mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing major surgery in gynaecology, intraabdominal
      surgery and orthopaedics comparing with current practice.
