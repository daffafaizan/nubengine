      University of Florida Health Hematology Clinics and conduct study visits in a research room
      located at the College of nursing.

      The investigator will stratify participants on worst pain intensity (<=5 and >5) and randomly
      assign 15 adults to attention control (stress/pain tracking; 12-min SCD experience
      discussion) and 15 adults to experimental (stress/pain tracking; 12-min GR video clip)
      groups.

      The immediate intervention effects will be examined for pain (primary) and stress (secondary)
      outcomes. Vital signs for determining relaxation responses (mediators) will be collected
      immediately before and after the 12-min interventions.
