      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and feasibility of visceral lymphatic mapping using isosulfan blue
           in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, colon, stomach, small bowel, or
           gallbladder.

        -  Evaluate the ability of surgically defined sentinel lymph nodes to predict whether other
           lymph nodes in the basin are involved with the tumor in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the results obtained from the sentinel lymph node (i.e., positive or negative
           for metastatic disease) with the results obtained from the other nodes in these
           patients.

        -  Compare immunohistochemical analysis with standard analysis of the sentinel lymph nodes
           in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the value of intraoperative touch prep analysis of sentinel lymph nodes in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      During surgical resection of the primary tumor, patients receive isosulfan blue
      subcutaneously 5 minutes before undergoing sentinel lymph node identification/excision and
      radical lymphadenectomy. Tissue samples are analyzed by IHC for cytokeratins and CEA.
