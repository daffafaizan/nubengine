      (CPET) at baseline and at 2 weeks. After the initial CPET, all patients will receive anakinra
      as a daily injection for 2 weeks. Patients will be instructed in the use of anakinra during
      their initial visit. Our primary outcome will be the difference in the exercise capacity of
      patients with PAH, as measured by maximal uptake of oxygen on CPET.
