      and especially LDL-cholesterol concentrations are established risk factors for coronary heart
      disease (CHD) and reducing these concentrations by dietary modification or drug treatment
      have been shown to reduce the risk of CHD. Direct evidence supporting a reduced risk of CHD
      has so far not been generated. Investigating the effects of consuming plant sterols on
      intermediate risk factors beyond cholesterol-lowering is therefore warranted.
