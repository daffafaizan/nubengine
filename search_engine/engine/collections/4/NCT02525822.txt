    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 12-week study designed
      to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP-123 Lotion in comparison with Tazorac
      Cream, Vehicle Lotion, and Vehicle Cream in subjects with moderate to severe acne. Treatment
      success will be evaluated by changes in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, as
      well as treatment success using an Evaluator's Global Severity Score. IDP-123 is a lotion for
      the topical treatment of acne.
