      randomly divided according to the usage of G-CSF.

      Subgroup with G-CSF will be treated with G-CSF after 7~10 days post-chemotherapy, when blasts
      will disappear from peripheral blood.

      Subgroup without G-CSF will be observed until 25~28 days post-chemotherapy. If blood counts
      are nor recovered, the investigators can perform bone marrow biopsy to identify the status of
      the bone marrow.

      After then, G-CSF can be applied if blasts are not observed in both peripheral blood and bone
      marrow.

      When absolute neutrophil counts are recovered and there are no evidence of infectious
      complications, patients will discharge safely from hospital.
