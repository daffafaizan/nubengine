    
      The problem is stated in the following starting questions:

      - What conditions are associated with infection and non-infection by SARS-CoV-2 among health
      professionals working in the three hospitals on the islands of Santiago and SÃ£o Vicente? Who
      are they (gender, age group, profession, type of contact, etc)? Where do they work (sector)?
      When and how did the infection occur?

        -  What is the frequency of antibody presence in professionals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
           infection?

        -  How long do anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies last?

        -  What is the impact of infection on unplanned absenteeism?

        -  What complaints persist after SARS-CoV-2 infection?
