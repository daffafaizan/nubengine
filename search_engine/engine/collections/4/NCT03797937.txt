      investigators will investigate if active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients have
      a more pro-inflammatory gut microbiota signature than multiple sclerosis patients with less
      active disease and matched healthy controls.

      More specifically, the investigators will investigate whether temporal variability of the gut
      microbiota is related to inflammatory disease activity in multiple sclerosis, whether changes
      in the gut microbiota are predictive of future inflammatory disease activity in multiple
      sclerosis, and whether gut microbiota characteristics are predictive of the disease course
      after 2 years.
