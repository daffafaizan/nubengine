      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study will not use a medication, but instead will
      involve weekly stress reduction classes that use different strategies to reduce anxiety. The
      study involves having a formal psychiatric interview, filling out questionnaires, ECGs,
      saliva samples, a urine test for drugs of abuse, and study visits over 12 weeks. Each study
      visit will take a few hours. Qualified participants will be compensated for time and travel.
