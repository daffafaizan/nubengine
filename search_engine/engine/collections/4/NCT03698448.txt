      rate, Quality of Life, sputum rheology and microbiology, safety laboratory tests and adverse
      event reporting.

      Part 2: Randomized double-blind 6 -month study, for longer term follow-up of the dose
      identified in Part 1. New patients will be recruited in part 2, in addition to patients who
      received placebo in Part 1. In addition to the endpoints studied in Part 1, Part 2 will
