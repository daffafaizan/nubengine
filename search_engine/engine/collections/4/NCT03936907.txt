    
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose, crossover, randomized, pharmacokinetic
      study in healthy male adults.

      Sixsteen (16) subjects will participate in the study. Each subject will undergo screening
      procedures within 28 days prior to dosing, to assess his eligibility to participate in the
      study.

      Eligible subjects will participate in two dosing periods. They will be randomized to one of
      two administration sequences - AB or BA. In each period subjects will be admitted to the
      clinic on the evening before dosing. On the next morning, under fasting conditions they will
      receive one of the following administrations, according to a randomization list:

        -  Administration A: A single tablet of Medical Grade Cannabis - Orally Disintegrating
           Tablet (MGC-ODT) containing 5mg THC and 5 mg CBD (Test Formulation)

        -  Administration B: Sativex® spray X 2 actuations (1 under the tongue and 1 inside the
           cheek administered within 2 min) - Reference Product [Each 100 μL spray contains 2.7 mg
           THC and 2.5 mg CBD, total per administration: 5.4 mg THC and 5.0 mg CBD] A taste
           assessment questionnaire will be filled in by the subjects 2 minutes after drug
           administration (immediately following water administration).

      Dosing will be followed by Pharmacokinetic (PK ) blood sampling for 24 hours and Adverse
      Events (AE) monitoring for the next 24 hours, at time points specified below.

      A washout period of at least 2 weeks is required between the dosings.

      An End-of Study (EOS)/Safety Follow-up visit will take place 7-10 days after the last dose of
      study treatment.
