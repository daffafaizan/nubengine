      improve upper limb function for post-stroke patients. However, the treatments of BoNT-A
      injection are associated with high cost and invasive treatment. Recent studies have showed
      that radial extracorporeal shock wave (rESWT) is a novel, effective and safety treatment
      method for the spasticity. However, there were no studies to compare the effect of rESWT and
      BoNT-A injection for treatment on spasticity.
