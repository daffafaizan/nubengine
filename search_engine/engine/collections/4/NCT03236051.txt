      management contributes to reducing complications and accelerating postoperative
      rehabilitation. Traditionally, the opioids were used for postoperative pain control. However,
      the opioids may increase the time to recover bowel function and lead to postoperative ileus.
      Multimodal analgesia is recommended in recent years, but studies on multimodal analgesia
      after gastrectomy are scarce. In this study, we introduced a multimodal analgesia strategy
      consisting of incision infiltration with ropivacaine, intravenous injection of parecoxib, and
      oral administration of an oxycodone/paracetamol mixture and evaluated the effects of this
      strategy compared with PCIA analgesia which is used widely for pain after gastrectomy.
