      pharmacokinetics of emixustat hydrochloride (HCl) in subjects with geographic atrophy (GA)
      associated with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Subjects will receive study drug
      during multiple dose periods in a crossover design, and serve as their own controls. There is
      a 21-28 day washout period between dose periods. The final Study Exit visit is 21 to 28 days
      after the subject's last dose of study drug at the end of the final dosing period.
