      involved in the modulation of pain. There has been little direct evidence that MgSO4 relieve
      neuropathic pain and prevents opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans.

      Intramuscular Diclofenac seems to offer the most effective sustained analgesia for renal
      colic in the ED and has few side effects.

      Lidocain became the agent of choice in visceral and central pain. Intravenous lidocain is
      effective in the management of neuropathic pain such as diabetic neuropathy, post-surgical
      pain, post herpetic pain, headaches, and neurological malignancies. At low doses, lidocain is
      known a relatively safe medication. Lidocain seems an effective treatment who can be
      administrated in the renal colic.

      Objective of study :

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of a standard dose of intravenous
      magnesium added to intramuscular diclofenac compared to intravenous lidocain combined to
      intramuscular diclofenac or intramuscular diclofenac alone in patients presenting to the
      emergency department with renal colic and whether it can reduce opioid consumption.
