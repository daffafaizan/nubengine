      some of paralysis. As a result, adults with this condition are unable to move their impaired
      arm well during their activities of daily living. Our research is focused on understanding
      how best to improve the ability of the arm to move after brain damage due to a stroke. We
      have implemented novel robot technology designed for eventual use as a home therapy device
      and have used software and hardware technologies to design activities that can assess the arm
      ability and engage the person during therapy. We will study how the prolong use of this
      device with simple, functional, and engaging activities improve the arm's movement ability
      and sustain motivation to use the arm over repeated therapy sessions and away from
      supervision.

      Overall, we will establish whether using our technology to perform tasks that are more or
      less game-like and functionally relevant to driving will make a difference in the impaired
      arm after stroke. Two groups of stroke survivors will be followed while they complete
      therapy. We have three main aims. In aim #1, we will determine whether therapy using
      functional tasks compared to simple rote tasks lead to significant increases in the use of
      the arm during therapy and the arm improvements experienced by the subjects after the
      therapy. In aim #2, we will measure how each group engage in the more and less functional
      therapy and monitor their effort and enjoyment during training. This aim will help us to
      determine the value of more fun training. In aim #3, we will upgrade our technology for use
      in the home therapy environment and follow some subjects to determine if the results change
      in under supervised condition (at home)
