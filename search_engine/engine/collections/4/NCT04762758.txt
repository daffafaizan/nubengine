    
      This international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III
      clinical study is designed to evaluate PXT3003 versus placebo in male and non-pregnant female
      subjects with genetically confirmed CMT1A of mild-to-moderate severity (CMTNS-V2 score >2 and
      â‰¤18) aged 16 to 65 years.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 48 sites worldwide. Genetically confirmed CMT1A
      subjects will be screened (approximately 500 subjects assuming a 30% screen failure rate) and
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral PXT3003 daily or matching placebo for 15
      months. A total of approximately 350 subjects will be enrolled. Visits will take place at
      Screening (up to -35 days), Baseline (Day 1), and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Randomization
      will occur at the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. Telephone contacts (TC) will take place at Weeks 2
      or 3, Month 1 and 2, and then monthly between subsequent in-person visits. A Safety follow-up
      visit will be conducted at Month 16.

      Subjects will receive in-clinic dosing of study medication at visits on Day 1 and Months 6,
      12, and 15. Study medication will be dispensed for outpatient dosing on Day 1 and Months 3,
      6, 9, and 12. During outpatient dosing, subjects will complete the Study Medication Diary
      using an application on their tablet, phone, or computer. The Study Medication Diary will be
      evaluated, along with returned unused study medication, as part of study drug compliance at
      visits at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

      The primary outcome measure (mONLS) and the 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT), along with the
      Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be evaluated at each post-Screening
      visit. The other secondary outcome measures, exploratory outcome, and safety/tolerability
      assessments will be evaluated as per Schedule of Activities (SOA). A Safety Follow-Up Visit
      will take place 30 days (Month 16) after the active treatment period ends (Month 15). A Data
      Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet on a scheduled basis throughout the study to
      review safety data and will reconvene on an ad hoc basis as necessary.
