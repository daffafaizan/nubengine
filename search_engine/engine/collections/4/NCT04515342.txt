      low muscle strength and possibly also poor physical performance. In the general population,
      the risk of fall and bone fracture increases, when sarcopenia is also present.

      Sarcopenia is known to occur in patients with chronic kidney disease, but whether, and if so,
      how this differs from the incidence in patients without kidney disease has not previously
      been described.

      Patients with chronic kidney disease have a 3 times higher risk of bone fracture compared to
      the Danish background population, and they also have an increased risk of falls.

      The association between sarcopenia, risk of falls and osteoporosis in patients with kidney
      disease is until now sparsely described, and because of this, the investigators want to
      explore this further in this cross-sectional study.
