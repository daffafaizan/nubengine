      low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with standard of care cetuximab. Tumor biopsies will
      be collected before and six weeks after treatment for measurement of tumor infiltration by
      effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. In
      addition, the proportion of Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) to effector cells will be measured in
      peripheral blood at the same time points.
