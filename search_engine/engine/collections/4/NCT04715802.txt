    
      The primary purposes of this study are to:

        1. Compare the safety and effectiveness of IBR vs DBR after PAAG removal;

        2. Compare the safety and effectiveness of breast implants with silicone gel prosthesis vs
           autologous fat transplantation after PAAG removal;

        3. Evaluate the clinical characteristics associated with and rates of complications based
           on reconstruction timing and type.

      The secondary purposes of this study are toï¼š

        1. Explore and summarize the characteristics of long-term complications of PAAG injection
           for breast augmentation;

        2. Compare the rate of postoperative complications and reoperations between the patients
           who had breast reconstruction with implants and patients who had primary breast
           augmentation with implants.

        3. Further refine the algorithm for breast reconstruction in patients with PAAG injections.
