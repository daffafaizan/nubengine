      best long-term success. However, use of alarms is very time-intensive, often taking months
      before yielding results. Researchers in the division of pediatric urology are initiating a
      randomized controlled study comparing a standard bedwetting alarm with a newly developed
      technology, with the hope that the new alarm will result in better, more rapid, and easier
      treatment for bedwetting.

      Children between the ages of 5 to 15 years old who have issues with bedwetting after
      successful toilet training may qualify for the study.

      Participants must first be evaluated by a pediatric urology specialist.
