      epi-LASIK-LASIK microkeratome (Ziemer ophthalmics systems AG, Switzerland). A Visx star 4
      system (Visx, Santa Ana, CA, USA) was used to perform the laser ablation in all eyes. A
      central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken with the confocal microscope (Confoscan
      4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) before and at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery. Corneal
      epithelial thickness and the Anterior stroma morphology were analyzed by using the NAVIS
      software V. 3.5.0 (NIDEK, Multi-Instrument Diagnostic System, Japan).
