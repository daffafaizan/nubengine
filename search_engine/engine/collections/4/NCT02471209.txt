      (HABR) with reduced portal vein blood flow (PBF) and compensatory increases in hepatic
      arterial blood flow (HABF) which can help maintain hepatic blood flow (HBF). For infants with
      obstructive hepatobiliary disease, reduced HBF may affect drug metabolism and increase the
      risk of respiratory depression during analgesia, which can be life-threatening.

      To evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on HBF and HABR in infants with obstructive jaundice
      by Doppler ultrasound.Twenty-five infants with biliary atresia (1-3 months-of-age) scheduled
      for a Kasai procedure were enrolled. PBF, HABF and HBF were measured by Doppler ultrasound
      before induction, and after inhalation of 2 and 3% sevoflurane.
