      of laryngeal mask incubation and reduce the related complications (such as laryngeal spasm
      and postoperative throat pain ) of laryngeal mask incubation. It is necessary to use muscle
      relaxants in laryngeal mask incubation under non-special circumstances. However, the dosages
      of muscle relaxants used in various researches vary greatly of normal endotracheal
      intubation. Previous studies have shown that the amount of muscle relaxant required for
      laryngeal mask intubation is smaller than that required for endotracheal intubation. Although
      the dosage of muscle relaxant required for tracheal intubation can ensure the smooth
      insertion of laryngeal mask airway, laryngeal mask airway is mostly used for short surgery,
      which is prone to postoperative muscle relaxation residue and prolongs the recovery. We
      planning use the most classical method for determining the ED50 or half effective
      concentration of cis-atracurium using sequential method, which is also called " up and down
      method" and " ladder method".
