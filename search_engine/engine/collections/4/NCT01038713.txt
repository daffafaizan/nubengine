      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or metastatic lesions, or from intrinsic lesions such as
      cholangiocarcinoma. Malignant biliary obstruction is typically treated endoscopically with
      placement of either plastic (polyethylene) or metal biliary stents. Metal stents have a wider
      diameter than plastic stents, and have been shown to have higher patency rates, but are also
      15-40 times the cost of plastic stents. Metal stents with a polymer coating have been
      developed to prevent tumor ingrowth into the stent, which can lead to stent occlusion. Cost
      analysis has demonstrated an advantage to the use of metal stents in patients with
      unresectable disease, or who may achieve operable status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      while either plastic stents or metal stents are used when patients are deemed to have a
      surgically resectable lesion. Patient's determined to have resectable, or borderline
      resectable malignancy (those who may achieve resectability status following neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy) will receive either plastic, uncovered metal, or covered metal stents in a
      randomized fashion, while patients determined to have surgically unresectable malignancy will
      randomly receive either covered or uncovered metal biliary stents. The primary aim of this
      study is to prospectively evaluate stent occlusion rates in patients presenting with
      malignant biliary obstruction. Secondary aims of the study will include a cost analysis of
      each stent type, rate of hospital admission following stent placement, days off of
      chemotherapy due to procedural complication, and rate of acute cholecystitis associated with
      stent placement.
