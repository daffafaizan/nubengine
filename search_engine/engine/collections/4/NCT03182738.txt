      seen in older HIV negative patients. HANA conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, liver
      disease, diabetes, and asthma) are becoming more common as PLWHA age.

      An individual's ability to identify and self-manage symptoms of HIV illness has been shown to
      improve patient outcomes and quality of life. The investigators will develop and pilot test
      the Video Information Provider (VIP), a web application (app) that delivered HIV-related
      symptom self-care strategies for PLWHA for 13 common (non-HANA) HIV/AIDS symptoms. There is a
      need to identify the symptom experience of PLWHA with HANA conditions.

      The aim is to compare the efficacy of VIP-HANA to a control arm for ameliorating symptom
      frequency and intensity and secondary health outcomes in 100 PLWHA with HANA conditions over
      6 months.
