      such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, post-infectious conditions, aspiration and
      immunodeficiency; It is a disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of airways.
      Symptoms; purulent sputum production, chronic cough, hemoptysis, recurrent fever and
      pleurisy. Mucociliary clearance disorder secondary to inflammation and involvement of
      exocrine glands in CF plays a major role in the development of symptoms; In non-cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), the development of similar symptoms may occur regardless of
      these reasons. However, in the examinations of CF, proximal airways; In NCFB, distal airways
      have been affected more intensively. As part of pulmonary rehabilitation, comprehensive
      respiratory physiotherapy (CRP) has an important role in the treatment and management of
      bronchiectasis. Airway cleaning techniques, approaches to reducing respiratory work, and
      patient education form the basis of CRP and play an active role in the treatment and
      management of the disease. In the literature, there are studies in which the effects of CRP
      are given in both CF and NCFB patients and studies comparing evaluation results in both
      groups without treatment. However, no study was found to compare the efficacy of CRP in these
      two groups of diseases. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the
      differences between the efficacy of CRP among the groups in children with CF and NCFB.
