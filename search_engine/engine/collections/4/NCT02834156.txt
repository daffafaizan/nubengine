      essential to diseases diagnosis and treatment.

      In hematological malignancies, lumbar punctures are particularly frequent as the therapy
      processes. Despite a good analgesia, this repeated procedure can generate pain, anxiety,
      apprehension leading to an increasing difficulty in the procedure realization.

      Two positions are possible to carry out lumbar puncture: seated or lying position.

      The main goal of this study is to assess the impact of the child positioning during the
      lumbar puncture process in term of pain, anxiety and stress.

      This study is a prospective, monocentric, randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Inclusion
      period is 1 year, 30 patients will be included from 2 to 18 years old.

      Each patient will have 2 LP one in seated and one in lying position in a specific order
      determined by randomization.

      All data regarding pain and anxiety will be collected the day of LP. Patients will be re
      contacted 48 hours and 15 days after LP procedure in order to evaluate complications such
      post-lumbar puncture syndrome or hematoma. The main analysis will be done on
      intent-to-treat-analysis basis and will compare pain intensity between the two groups.
