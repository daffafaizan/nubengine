      To evaluate the early detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis using ULDCT, the
      investigators will establish the observational cohort of close contacts living in the same
      space with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants will visit our center at enrollment,
      after 3 months, and 12 months and will be received ULDCT, chest X-ray and Interferon-gamma
      assays at each visit. One chest radiologist will interpret findings of ULDCT and chest X-ray.

      Patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis will be excluded from the study and treated based
      on World Health Organization guidelines.
