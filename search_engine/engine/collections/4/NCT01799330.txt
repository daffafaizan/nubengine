      in COPD and the benefits of PR for these patients, the role of TCEMS as a routine
      rehabilitative strategy for patients with COPD has yet to be established. The studies
      proposed in this research will build on the knowledge gained in our previous study of TCEMS
      by investigating whether and how TCEMS adds to the beneficial effects of PR on exercise
      capacity and muscle function among outpatients with stable COPD, and by assessing for the
      first time whether TCEMS improves exercise tolerance and functional status among COPD
      patients unable to make gains following conventional outpatient PR. Thus, this proposed study
      may provide a novel strategy in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic lung disease.

      The two specific aims of the proposed study are:

        1. Determine whether administration of TCEMS after conventional exercise training in PR
           leads to added gains in muscle strength, exercise capacity, dyspnea and health status,
           to determine if TCEMS should be considered as an additional routine method in outpatient
           PR programs.

        2. Determine whether patients who are unable to improve exercise tolerance during
           conventional exercise training in PR can achieve gains in muscle strength, exercise
           tolerance, dyspnea, and health status following TCEMS used as an alternate
           rehabilitative strategy.
