      humidity modes (No humidity, controlled heated humidification, controlled heated
      humidification with heated tubing) with CPAP 8 and 12 mmHg and with and without leakage. The
      ambient room temperature is controlled with air conditioning. Changes in temperature and
      humidity is measured inside of the mask with a humidity sensor and recorded. After each phase
      the participants subjective opinion about humidity and temperature is asked.
