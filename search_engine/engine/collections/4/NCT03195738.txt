      injuries in youth. While most recover quickly, a substantial subset (30-58.5%) report
      symptoms that persist at one month with a reported 11-14% who continue to report symptoms
      beyond three months. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for treatment that
      address occupational (meaningful activity) concerns for youth who are slower to recover
      post-concussion. It is postulated that a top-down rehabilitation approach with metacognitive
      strategy training as the core of the intervention might be effective.The Cognitive
      Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO-OP) Approach is a metacognitive strategy training
      approach with a growing body of literature supporting it's value in improving participation
      in meaningful activity and achieving self-selected occupation-based goals for adults with
      brain injury and youth with moderate to severe brain injury.Given the long-term occupational
      concerns in youth with persistent post-concussion symptoms, and the lack of evidence based
      interventions for these youth, it is hypothesized that the CO-OP Approach may facilitate
      return to meaningful occupation in this population.
