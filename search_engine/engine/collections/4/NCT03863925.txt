      major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar affective disorder refractory to or
      contraindicated to psychopharmacological treatment. Anesthetics have been introduced into ECT
      sessions to alleviate ECT-inducing discomfort sensation, tachycardia, arrhythmia,
      hypertension, and anxiety. Propofol is highly lipid soluble and able to rapidly cross the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB), which leads to rapid onset of sedation and hypnosis. Meanwhile,
      propofol has hemodynamic depressant effect and attenuates hypertensive surge during ECT.
      Characteristics mentioned above make propofol one of widely used anesthetics for anesthetized
      ECT.

      Propofol can be administered with bolus injection or target-controlled infusion (TCI).
      Compared with bolus injection, TCI provides relatively constant concentration at site of
      interest based on computer simulation with input of pharmacokinetic parameters, such as age,
      body weight, body height, etc. However, propofol is also well known for anticonvulsant
      property, which may inevitably interfere with seizure propagation by electroconvulsive
      stimulus and diminish consequent efficacy. Thus, dosage of electrical stimulus may be
      increased to achieve ideal seizure quality in this setting, which also leads to higher risk
      of subsequent cognitive impairment.

      In our clinical practice, TCI system reduces total amount of propofol in comparison with
      bolus injection method. Therefore, we hypothesize that application of TCI system in
      anesthetized ECT relates to lower dosage of electrical stimulus and decreased incidence or
      severity of post-treatment cognitive impairment.
