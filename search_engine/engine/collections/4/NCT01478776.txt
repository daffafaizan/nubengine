      function of storing unlimited energy but also its secretory roles is subject to intense
      research in recent years. Acylation stimulating protein(ASP), Retinol-binding protein 4
      (RBP4) and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) are circulating adipokines elevated in diabetes. C5L2 is a
      G-protein-coupled receptor. activation of C5L2 by ASP, has been shown. Fatty acids may
      influence the expression of adipokines. Epidemiological studies showed that omega-3 reduce
      the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Because fatty acids are the main
      component of adipose tissue, it is essential interest to clarify the biological effects of
      omega-3 on the expression of relevant adipokines.
