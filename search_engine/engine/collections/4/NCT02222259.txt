      psychosocial issues in older cancer patients, which in turn can inform interventions to
      prevent/postpone adverse outcomes and maintain/improve the functional status and well-being
      of this population. However, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been completed
      showing the evidence.

      OBJECTIVE - To explore the feasibility and impact of a CGA followed by an integrated care
      plan on quality of life and functional status for older adults with advanced breast,
      gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer METHODS -

      A two-group parallel single-blind phase II RCT is enrolling 60 patients aged 70 or above,
      diagnosed with cancer, and starting first line chemotherapy at Princess Margaret Cancer
      Centre in Toronto. The randomization using sealed opaque envelopes is stratified by treatment
      intent (adjuvant versus palliative). The intervention entails a comprehensive CGA by a
      multidisciplinary geriatric oncology team followed by an integrated care plan to address any
      issues identified. Participants in the intervention group are seen at baseline for the CGA
      and for initiation of the integrated care plan, and again at 3 and 6 months to assess
      intervention fidelity and measure outcomes. The co-primary outcomes are: 1)
      maintaining/improvement in quality of life; 2) refining of cancer treatment plan. The
      secondary outcomes include: 1) Functional status; 2) feasibility of the study by tumor site.
