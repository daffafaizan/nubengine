    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, crossover bioavailability study comparing the fractional
      absorption of calcium from amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) versus crystalline calcium
      carbonate (CCC) using stable calcium isotopes in postmenopausal women.

      The study is comprised of 15 subjects orally administered immediately after breakfast a 600
      mg gelatin capsules containing either 600 mg (2 capsules of 300 mg)of ACC (192 mg elemental
      calcium) of 480 mg CCC (192 mg elemental calcium), labeled with 15 mg of 44Ca (2 capsules of
      300 mg).

      Five minutes following the oral administration, each subject will be infused intravenously
      with 1.5 mg of CaCl2 labeled with 42Ca over 10 min. Over the following 24 h subjects will
      consume meals that will be selected by the Unit of Clinical Nutrition at Sourasky Medical
      Center nutritionist on the basis of their food diary and ALL urine excreted during this time
      should be collected in a designated urine container and returned to the Unit of Clinical
      Nutrition at Sourasky Medical Center for evaluation. The same protocol as in day 0 with a
      crossover oral treatment will be performed after 21 day washout period.

      Dosing day will be designated "Day 0". Eligible subjects are randomly assigned to one of the
      study treatments according to the following regimens:
