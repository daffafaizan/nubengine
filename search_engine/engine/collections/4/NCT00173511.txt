      undergoing emergent endoscopy, then this technique can be used safely in this group of
      patients. If myocardial ischemia occurs more frequently in CAD patients undergoing emergent
      endoscopy, we can try to analyze factors associated with increased risk, such as duration of
      endoscopy, severity of anemia, or drugs used for endoscopic hemostasis. Then we can try to
      avoid these predisposing factors and increase the safety of emergent endoscopy.
