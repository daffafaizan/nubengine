      of these diseases are without symptoms and therefore difficult to diagnose and treat. Gastric
      analysis is the quantitative measurement of gastric acid output and is a critical tool for
      the diagnosis of acid related disorders and the ongoing assessment of therapy response. At
      present gastric analysis requires a technically difficult procedure, using gastric aspiration
      through a nasogastric tube, that is costly, invasive, and uncomfortable for patients.
      Recently there is introduction of the SmartPill, which is a disposable pill that measures pH,
      temperature, and pressure throughout the GI tract. We propose a pilot study to validate a new
      method of gastric analysis with the ingestion of the SmartPill with a meal of a known
      buffering capacity to measure both the acidity and quantity of acid output in the stomach. We
      will validate this method by comparing it to the accepted gastric aspiration method under
      maximally stimulated conditions. We will study healthy volunteers for the validation phase
      and then study patients with known acid related disorders to assess its usefulness in
      patients. Interested subjects will report to the NIH outpatient gastrointestinal clinic for
      evaluation to be followed by a 3 day in-patient admission and 2 subsequent clinic visits.
      Subjects will have gastric analysis of basal, meal stimulated, and pharmacologically
      stimulated rates with both the conventional and study methods. Outcomes will include a
      quantitative measurement of gastric acid output in unit time, normal meal stimulated acid
      output values in healthy volunteers and patients with acid related disorders, and the
      assessment of acid suppression in patients treated with a variety of anti-secretory
      medications.
