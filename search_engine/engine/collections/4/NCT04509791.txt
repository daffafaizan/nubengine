    
      A phase II, Multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Multi-arm parallel
      cohort trial.

      Randomisation wil be stratified by age. The trial consist of seven cohorts. The first cohort
      of 30 participants will be randomised to placebo, 2.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 0.1
      mg/kg.

      ATG total dose in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. There will be an initial age step down
      selection of this cohort with recruitment starting with dose aged 12-25 years and, providing
      no new safety concerns are raised in the first 10 participants to receive active dose,
      progressing to all ages (5-25 years) The next two cohorts of 12 participants will be
      randomised to placebo, 2.5 mg/kg, and 2 specified middle ATG total doses in a 1:1:1:1
      allocation ratio.

      The next four cohorts of 15 participants will be randomised to placebo, 2.5 mg/kg, and a
      single selected middle ATG total doses in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.

      This design allows sequential adjustment of the middle doses to be explored following review
      of all safety and early efficacy data by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC)
      and Dose Determine Committee (DDC) to seek the minimum effective dose
