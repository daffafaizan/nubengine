      tumour control/cure. Both acute and late side effects are substantial. Proton radiotherapy is
      hypothesised to have the potential to decrease the incidence/severity of some acute side
      effects from certain organs at risk e.g. bone marrow and intraperitoneal bowel. By sparing
      the dose to these organs it is also possible that late effects might be less evident. Sparing
      of the bone marrow may lead to fewer septic events and dose reductions of chemotherapy which
      may, as a consequence, improve tumour control. The primary aim of this study is to find ways
      to decrease acute side effects primarily to alleviate some discomfort from the patient during
      and after a usually painful treatment experience. It has also been concluded by others that
      reduction of acute side effects is a relevant aim and end point for the evaluation of new
      treatment techniques and both patient reported and physician reported data are assessed
