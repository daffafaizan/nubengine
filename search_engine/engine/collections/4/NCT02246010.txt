      % of all childhood death worldwide, and is a major public health burden, especially in
      developing countries. A recent Cochrane review of 33 randomized or quasi-randomized trials
      reported a modest reduction in the duration of diarrhea in children younger than 5 years who
      were on reduced or lactose-free diet. Those trials however were conducted on inpatients in
      high or middle-income countries. None were from developing countries where diarrheal diseases
      are severer and result in higher morbidities and mortalities. This study aims at
      investigating the effect of lactose-free milk on the duration and severity of diarrhea in
      infants from a developing country, who present with acute gastroenteritis to the Emergency
      Department (ED) or pediatric clinics. The findings from this study will help provide
      evidence-based dietary recommendations for infants with acute diarrhea in developing
      countries who are treated in the ambulatory setting.
