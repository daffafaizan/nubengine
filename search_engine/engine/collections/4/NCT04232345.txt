    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose
      (MAD), sequential-group study in healthy Japanese (Part 1, Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) and Chinese
      (Part 2, Cohort 4) male subjects, conducted at a single study center. Four cohorts are
      planned, but one additional cohort may be enrolled based on a Safety Review Committee (SRC)
      decision.

      The 4 multiple dose levels are planned as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: Dose 1

        -  Cohort 2: Dose 2

        -  Cohort 3: Dose 3

        -  Cohort 4: Dose 2

      A randomization ratio of 3:1 (AZD4831 versus placebo) will be used.

      For each cohort the study will comprise:

        -  Screening Period of a maximum of 28 days.

        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects are resident in the study center from the day
           before first dosing with the Investigational Medicinal Product (Day -1) until at least
           48 hours after last dosing on Day 10; subjects will be discharged on Day 12.

        -  Three Follow-up Visits on Day 14, Day 16 (±1 day), and Day 20 (±1 day).

        -  A Final Follow-up Visit on Day 24 (±2 days).

      Each subject will be involved in the study for 8 to 9 weeks.
