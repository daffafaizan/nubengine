      developed sequencing instrumentation which has the ability to sequence not only genomic DNA
      (gDNA) but also derivatives of messenger RNA (mRNA) and 16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA). This
      technology has the potential to survey the nucleic acids involved within a mixed population
      of species, such as atherosclerotic biofilm. In addition to transcriptome science; proteome,
      metabolome, and other -omic sciences are advancing rapidly. Examining atherosclerotic plaque
      using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and other -omic approaches may provide valuable
      insight into the wound's microecology.
