      mechanisms and test new therapeutic interventions to correct the different disorders
      associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The effect of FFA on insulin
      action is well established (4-6); however, the pressor effect of FFA infusion in obese
      subjects has not been investigated. We hypothesize that observed changes in blood pressure is
      the result of acute endothelial dysfunction due to increased FFA concentration; and that
      rosiglitazone, a PPAR gamma receptor agonist, will protect against FFA-induced elevation in
      blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction in obese subjects.
