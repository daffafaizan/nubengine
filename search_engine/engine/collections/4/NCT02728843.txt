      the last 3 years and are currently taking antiparkinsonian medication. There are four dosage
      cohorts, with patients in each cohort receiving either deferiprone tablets or placebo. At the
      baseline visit, participants will be randomized to a dosage cohort and to either active
      product or placebo within that cohort, and will take the assigned study product twice-daily
      for 9 months. They will come back to the study site for assessments at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, and 9, and will need to have their blood count checked weekly, at either the study site or
      a local laboratory.
