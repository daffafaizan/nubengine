      some patients, and the management of surgical pain is still a real challenge. In order to
      avoid the side effects of medications, a lot of caregivers are turning to complementary
      medicines. Hypnosis in particular has long been used in the non-pharmacological management of
      pain and anxiety.

      Many clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of hypnosis have been conducted in recent
      years, some of which show that hypnosis reduces pain perception better than drug treatments
      administered to control groups, and that it is at least as effective as other complementary
      therapies (such as massage, acupuncture, yoga). However, their conclusions are limited by a
      significant risk of bias, and further studies with rigorous methodology remain necessary. The
      hypothesis of this study is that hypnosis support methods can reduce anxiety in patients
      requiring facial surgery under local anaesthesia, and thus improve their medical management.

      Patients requiring facial surgery under local anaesthesia in an ultra-short circuit will be
      informed of the study in consultation by the maxillofacial surgeon. If they give their
      informed consent, a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ("Spielberger Self-Assessment
      Questionnaire") will be given to them and collected on the same day. Each patient's anxiety
      score will be calculated so as to select only patients who are at least lightly anxious about
      their management (score â‰¥ 36). The latter will be randomized into 2 groups, one benefiting
      from experimental management based on hypnosis techniques and the other benefiting from
      conventional management.
