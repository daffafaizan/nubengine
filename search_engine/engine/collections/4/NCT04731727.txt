      the front of the eye to bulge out. This results in distorted vision and could eventually
      result in the need for a cornea transplant. This study proposes to conclude that saturating
      the cornea with vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) and then applying 365nm wavelength of Ultra Violet
      Light will result in the various layers of corneal tissue linking together. This cross
      linking results in a stronger cornea which is designed to halt the progression of keratoconus
      or ectasia. This treatment is already being successfully used in Europe.
