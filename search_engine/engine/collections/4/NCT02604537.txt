      properties, then there is a reasonable and rational argument to be made for the local
      injection of NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) into the first dorsal extensor
      compartment. Ketorolac is an NSAID that has been proven efficacious in the treatment of
      another musculoskeletal condition. Moreover, compared to betamethasone (or other injectable
      corticosteroids), injection of ketorolac decreases the patient exposure to the potential
      side-effects of corticosteroids, especially that of elevation of blood sugar levels in
      diabetics.
