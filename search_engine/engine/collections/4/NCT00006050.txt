      combined with intravenous leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil in patients with liver
      metastases from colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin by hepatic perfusion over 2 hours on day 1 plus
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. If a good response is achieved after 8 courses of chemotherapy, patients may
      undergo surgical resection of metastases.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
