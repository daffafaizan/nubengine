    
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) are comprised of a group of fatal neurodegenerative
      diseases caused by mutations in an enzyme or protein which results in the accumulation of
      toxic deposits in the eye, brain, skin, muscle and other cells.

      CLN5 is a type of NCL, caused by homozygous or bi-allelic heterozygous variants in the CLN5
      gene. Lack of CLN5 protein impairs the breakdown of certain proteins, leads to defective
      lysosomal trafficking, resulting in accumulation of toxic material and subsequent cell
      damage. CLN5 disease presents in childhood with neurological findings including motor
      clumsiness and attention disturbances, followed by progressive visual failure, psychomotor
      depression, epilepsy, and premature death.

      CLN7 is another type of NCL caused by homozygous or bi-allelic heterozygous variants in
      CLN7/MFSD8 gene, whose function is poorly characterized. CLN7 presents with neurological
      signs, including blindness, seizures, progressive deterioration in intellectual and motor
      capabilities, culminating in premature death in the first or second decade of life.
