      decisions based on EIT information, the clinicians will be blinded to the EIT findings during
      the study period. Data on clinical interventions and clinical findings will be recorded using
      a specially adapted graphical user interface on the EIT device in combination with a
      paper-based case report form (CRF). EIT data analysis will be performed off-line.
