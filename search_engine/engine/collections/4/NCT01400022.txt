      association with other autoimmune diseases and the detection of autoantibodies against ECM-1
      point to an autoimmune genesis. Genital lichen sclerosus typically affects women around and
      after the menopause. Common sites of affection are the vulva (clitoris and labia majora) and
      the anus in women, the prepuce and the glans penis in men. Skin lesions include ivory-white,
      atrophic, porcelain-like plaques with a tendency to atrophy and fissures in the advanced
      stages.

      First-line therapy for genital lichen sclerosus in the active, inflammatory phase is the use
      of topical glucocorticoids. Alternatively, topically applied hormone-containing emollients
      and topical calcineurin inhibitors are widely used. However, the use of topical
      corticosteroids is because of the associated long-term side effects (atrophy, striae)
      limited.

      In the treatment of localized scleroderma (morphea), a similar sclerosing disease, the use of
      ultraviolet radiation (UVA1) has proved highly effective. After a pilot study, the high-dose
      UVA1 phototherapy (120 J / cm ²) was significantly more effective was a low-dose UVA1 (20 J /
      cm ²), however no difference could be found in subsequent studies. Meanwhile, the medium-dose
      UVA1 phototherapy in circumscribed scleroderma has been determined as the most effective
      therapy regime and is included in the german dermatological guidelines (see also AWMF
      guideline for diagnosis and therapy of circumscribed scleroderma at:
