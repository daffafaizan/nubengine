      mg after a myocardial infarction (MI), and describe their patient characteristics and
      persistence to treatment. To contextualise the characteristics of the ticagrelor patients,
      two reference cohorts will be created, including patients treated with another P2Y12
      inhibitor than ticagrelor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticlopidine), and patients not treated
      with any P2Y12 inhibitor, within a comparable timepoint from an MI as for the ticagrelor 60
      mg patients. If the a priori threshold of 5,000 person-years on treatment with ticagrelor 60
      mg is met, to ensure sufficient precision, outcome events (bleeding and cardiovascular
      events) will also be analysed and described. Outcome events will only be described in the
      ticagrelor cohorts; no comparison of outcomes will be made between the ticagrelor and the
      reference cohorts.

      The primary outcome is bleeding requiring hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes include
      components of the primary outcome, and cardiovascular outcomes. Persistence to treatment with
      ticagrelor 60 mg will also be assessed The study will be performed in the US and 4 European
      countries (Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany).
