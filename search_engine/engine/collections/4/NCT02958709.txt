    
      Open-label, randomized clinical trial in three treatment groups. Patients with probable or
      definite TB meningitis (TBM) will all receive isoniazid and pyrazinamide at standard doses
      for 8 weeks. Arm 1 participants will receive high-dose rifampicin plus ethambutol (EMB) at
      standard doses for 8 weeks. Arm 2 participants will receive high-dose rifampicin plus
      levofloxacin for 8 weeks. Arm 3 participants will receive rifampicin plus ethambutol at
      standard doses for 8 weeks (control arm). Patients will be screened to confirm TBM diagnosis,
      will receive 8 weeks of study treatment, and then will receive isoniazid (INH)/rifampicin for
      an additional 40 weeks, to complete 12 months of TBM treatment. All participants will receive
      oral steroids. PK sampling will be performed within first week and 6 (+/- 2) weeks following
      treatment initiation. Participants will have scheduled follow-up visits to assess safety and
      clinical status. In addition, functional and neurocognitive outcomes up to 18 months
      following treatment initiation will be assessed. Interim PK and safety analyses will be
      performed to ensure dosing is producing predefined PK targets and safety is acceptable. It is
      anticipated that a majority of children will be hospitalized for the initial 2-8 weeks of the
      study.
