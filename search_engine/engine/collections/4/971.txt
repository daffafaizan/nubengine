air-pantopaque ventriculography in congenital hydrocephalus andmyelomeningocele.a study of the csf pathways by combined pantopaque-airventriculography in infantswith congenital hydrocephalus and myelomeningoceleis presented.  the advantagesof this method are discussed.  combined pantopaqueand air ventriculography providesnot only a demonstration of the extent ofthe hydrocephalus but also the exactlocation and cause of the obstruction.  in infantswith myelomeningocele it permitsthe disclosure of unmanifested hydrocephalusand coexistent intracranial malformations.the early detection of the latter is veryimportant for the complete evaluation,management and prognosis.  the introductionof pantopaque into the ventricularsystem of infants did not produce an immediatereaction and did not precipitatedeterioration of the clinical status.  retentionof small amounts of pantopaque in thelateral ventricles did not interfere with the functionof bypassing procedures.
