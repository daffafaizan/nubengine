      11C-methionine (MET) PET/CT and 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT in the detection of pathologic
      parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

      Secondary:To compare the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 11C-MET and 18F-FDG PET/CT
      scans in the detection of pathologic parathyroid glands in patients with primary
      hyperparathyroidism.

      STUDY DESIGN A phase II diagnostic imaging, single-centre study to compare the accuracy of
      11C-MET PET/CT with standard 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and with 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients
      with primary hyperparathyroidism.

      STUDY POPULATION Number of Subjects: 50 patients Number of groups: 1: 50 with primary
      hyperparathyroidism. Age/Gender: Age greater than or equal to 19 years / Male and Female
      Study specific requirements: Subjects with clinically suspected primary hyperparathyroidism
      who require 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT parathyroid imaging.

      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT Product: 11C-Methionine Route of administration: Intravenous
      Dosage(s) and frequency: Radioactive dose of 11C-Methionine of 6 MBq per kilogram body weight
      per injection (maximum dose of 555 MBq); one injection per patient.

      COMPARATOR PRODUCTS Product: 99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite; 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Route of
      administration: Intravenous Dosage(s) and frequency: (1) Radioactive dose of
      99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite of 555 - 740 MBq per injection; one injection per patient.
      (2) Radioactive dose of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose of 296 - 521 MBq per injection; one injection
      per patient.

      EVALUATION CRITERIA Efficacy: The comparison of the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of
      11C-MET PET/CT with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of pathologic
      parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

      Safety: Vital signs before and following 11C-MET administration; adverse events collection.
