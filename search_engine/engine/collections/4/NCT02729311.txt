      primary care partners who are randomly assigned to Group 1 (immediate start) or Group 2
      (delayed start). Pairs randomized to Group 1 participate together in the Paired PLIÉ program
      2 days/week for 12 weeks (24 classes total) while pairs randomized to Group 2 continue with
      their usual activities. Then Group 1 transitions into a maintenance phase, and Group 2
      participates in the Paired PLIÉ program 2 days/week for 12 weeks. Outcome data are collected
      in all study participants at baseline, mid-point and end-point so that we can examine the
      initial impact of the program as well as whether effects are maintained in Group 1. Outcome
      measures include cognitive function, physical performance, quality of life and caregiver
      well-being.
