      All participants will receive alisertib (ECT) in dose escalating cohorts, orally, twice daily
      for 7 days followed by 14-day rest period in Cycle 1, 3 and onwards (21-day cycle) and orally
      twice daily from Day 3 to Day 7 followed by 14 day rest period in Cycle 2 [dose held for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) collection] along with docetaxel 75 mg/m^2, intravenous (IV) infusion on
