      slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. This functional impairment persists
      for a variable duration following surgery, usually resolving within 1 day in the small
      intestine, 1 to 3 days in the stomach and 3 to 5 days in the colon. When POI persists for
      more than 5 days, it is generally considered severe, sometimes referred to as complicated or
      prolonged POI, and increases the risk for related morbidity. This is a randomized,
      controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of DAM
      solution for the treatment of POI in patients following abdominal operation. It will be
      conducted at multiple centers in China. A total of 480 patients will be enrolled in the
      study. Patient participation in the study will last for up to postoperative day 7 [POD 7] ,
      with follow-up safety assessments to occur 7 days after the operation.The treatment outcome
      measures include: 1) GI2(Time to achieve recovery of both upper and lower GI function as
      measured by a composite endpoint of time to the first bowel movement and time to tolerate
      first solid food). 2) Time to ready for discharge. 3) Time to the first flatus.
