      aims to show via an in-place validation that MRI can replace VQ-SPECT as a screening test for
      chronic pulmonary embolism in the diagnostic algorithm for CTEPH. The diagnostic gold
      standard is catheter pulmonary angiography (CPA) or computed tomography pulmonary angiography
      (CTPA) with correction from the clinical outcome after 6-12 months.
