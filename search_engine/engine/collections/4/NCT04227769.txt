      islets and insulin sensitive tissues. However little attention has been given to a potential
      role of the innate immune system in the cephalic phase of insulin secretion. In humans, the
      cephalic phase of insulin secretion appear reduced in obesity and in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      In this prospective, randomized, mixed double- and single-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over clinical trial we aim to test whether acute treatment with an IL-1 receptor
      antagonist impacts insulin secretion over time during the cephalic phase, defined as the
      first 10 minutes after the first sensorial contact to food, in healthy individuals in healthy
      humans (Group 1) and in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (Group 2).

      Group 1: After screening, subjects will be randomized to two crossover visits with a washout
      period of at least 4 days in-between visits and at most two weeks: A) subcutaneous saline
      injection 3h before an oral standardized meal, B) subcutaneous injection of 100 mg of the
      IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra 3h before an oral standardized meal. Treatments will be
      placebo controlled, crossover, double blinded. The study will be performed in a population of
      healthy individuals.

      Group 2: Same as for Group 1 with the following addition: after the second study day,
      participant in group 2 will be trained to self-inject the medication for 6 days. On the 7th
      day, an oral standardized meal test will be performed.

      Healthy subjects from group 1 will be matched for sex and age to the diabetic cohort from
      group 2.
