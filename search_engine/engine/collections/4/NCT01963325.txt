      The efficacy of S-1 as first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed in several
      studies. The IMPACT study showed that Abraxane plus gemcitabine provide better survival than
      gemcitabine alone. Since cholangiocarcinoma displayed similar sensitivity to chemotherapy
      which was used in pancreatic carcinoma, we assume that S-1 plus Abraxane is effective and
      safe in treating cholangiocarcinoma.
