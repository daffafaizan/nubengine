      optimizing LV lead position at the time of the left ventricular pacing lead implantation.
      This optimization (using a Doppler wire) would alter the left ventricular activation pattern
      and contraction mechanics. This increase in contractility may improve the likelihood of
      mid/long term response to therapy. This study will compare 6-month response to CRT (left
      ventricular ejection fraction, decrease in left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic
      dimensions and volumes) in heart failure patients.

      The secondary objective will be to:

        1. To determine if optimal lead placement, guided by the largest improvement in stroke
           volume, results in a greater 6-month improvement in clinical QOL and NYHA class.

        2. Acutely compare and/or correlate intra-operative A-V and V-V timing optimization via
           invasive pressure volume data to post-operative echo optimization of these same
           parameters.

        3. Acutely contrast changes in stroke volume during pacing from several different left
           ventricular lead locations.
