    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective disease control rate (i.e., partial or complete response as
      defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or stable disease
      for â‰¥ 16 weeks) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach
      or gastroesophageal junction treated with AZD0530 (saracatinib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the median time to disease progression, median overall survival, and 1-year
      survival rate in these patients.

      II. To assess the toxicity of AZD0530 in these patients. III. To evaluate potential
      predictive markers by assessing pretreatment intratumoral levels of src, Y419 phospho-src
      (P-Src), and c-terminal src kinase (Csk) in archival tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 2 months.
