      moderate ulcerative colitis (UC; modified Mayo Score 4-10 and endoscopy score of 2-3). The
      trial included male and female subjects aged 18 or older. Subjects were currently receiving
      ≥2.4 g/day mesalamine or equivalent, provided they had taken 5-aminosalicylate (ASA; i.e.,
      mesalamine) at a dose ≥2.4 g/day for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization and were on a
      stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the screening phase of the study.

      Qualifying subjects who entered into this study received 3 daily doses of oral HMPL 004
      tablets or placebo for 56 days (8 weeks). There were 3 arms in this study consisting of
      placebo, HMPL-004 600 mg three times a day (TID) or 800 mg TID. Approximately 420 subjects
      were to be randomized 1:1:1 to one of these 3 arms, stratified by country/region in up to 150
      clinical centers in North America, Europe, and Asia.
