    
      BACKGROUND:

      The study is in response to a Request for Applications (RFA) on Obstructive Sleep Apnea in
      Children. NHLBI issued the RFA in December, 1997, with co-sponsorship from the National
      Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research and the National Institute of Child Health and
      Human Development.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This cross-sectional study recruited a population-based sample of young children from among
      the more than 8000 children in Massachusetts enrolled in the on-going Infant Care Practices
      Study. Stratified sampling was used to assemble a cohort of 250 children with habitual
      snoring (> 3 nights/week), 100 children with occasional snoring (<3 nights/week), and 100
      non-snoring children. These children were studied within 3 months of their fourth birthday
      using overnight laboratory polysomnography and a detailed neurobehavioral evaluation, in
      order to test the hypothesis that, after adjusting for potential confounding variables, both
      parent-reported snoring and polysomnographic measures were associated with standardized
      measures of the following neurobehavioral domains: immediate attention, sustained attention,
      working memory, and symptoms of hyperactivity. These data also provided an opportunity to
      determine normal values for polysomnographic measures in 4-year-old children and to determine
      the prevalence of snoring and polysomnographic abnormalities among 4-year-old children.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
