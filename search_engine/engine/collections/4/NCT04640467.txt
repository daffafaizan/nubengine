      time. In most women, placental function is sufficient to allow appropriate fetal growth
      throughout pregnancy, however in some, it may be not near term or during labor leading to
      intrapartum compromise Small for gestational age (SGA) is estimated fetal weight (EFW) or
      abdominal circumference (AC) below the 10th percentile of given reference ranges Fetal growth
      restriction (FGR) is fetus that has not achieved its growth potential. There are early-onset
      (< 32 weeks) and late-onset (â‰¥ 32 weeks) types. Late FGR is defined as

      - AC/EFW < 3rd centile Or at least two out of three of:

        1. AC/EFW < 10th centile

        2. AC/EFW crossing centiles >2 quartiles

        3. Cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) <5th centile or Umbilical artery Pusitility Index(UAPI
           )>95th centile FGR fetuses will not necessarily be SGA at delivery and vice versa. In
           fact, most SGA are likely to be 'constitutionally' small CPR is the ratio of the Middle
           cerebral artery Pulsatility Index (MCAPI) to (UAPI). The CPR gradually rises until
           around the 34th week and subsequently slowly declines until term. Its use has been
           echoed recently because of association of an abnormal ratio with fetal distress in labor
           requiring emergency cesarean section , a lower cord pH, admission to the intensive care
           unit and poor neurological outcomes The biophysical profile (BPP) abnormalities that
           characterize late FGR include alteration of fetal breathing, oligohydramnios and loss of
           fetal heart rate reactivity on conventional cardiotocography ( CTG). It seems that BPP
           becomes abnormal only shortly before stillbirth .
