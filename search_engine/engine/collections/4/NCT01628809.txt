      mortality. Eight-week Mindfulness-Based Meditation programs (MBSR) have been shown to improve
      participants' health and well-being, including reducing inflammation and slowing the
      progression of chronic diseases such as HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      potential benefits of a three-day mindfulness-based meditation retreat program (vs. an active
      rest and relaxation retreat control condition) on a highly stressed, unemployed, community
      adult population.

      Participants are recruited from the Pittsburgh area and are randomly assigned to either the
      mindfulness-based retreat program or the rest and relaxation retreat program. All
      participants complete a psychosocial survey, blood work, and a baseline fMRI before
      completing the intervention. Participants complete a second fMRI immediately following the
      intervention and then additional blood work and psychosocial surveys at a four month
      follow-up timepoint. At each fMRI appointment, participants will complete neuroimaging tasks
      (where they will be presented with words, picture, and sounds) that will assess
      neuroreactivity, regulation responses, and brain volume before and after mindfulness
      meditation training.
