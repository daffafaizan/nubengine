    
      EARS ("Exercise Adherence Rating Scale" or Adhesion to Physical Exercise Programs) assesses
      in the first part what type of physical exercise was recommended for patients with common
      chronic pain, as well as their frequencies and the date until which they were prescribed. The
      patient can also inform how often he can do his exercises, or otherwise, if he has completely
      stopped them, to mention since when and why.

      A second part of the questionnaire explores the behavior of patients towards adherence to
      exercise programs and a final part examines the reasons for or not performing these
      exercises.
