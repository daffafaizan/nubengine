      patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine
      the response rate and survival of these patients after this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of vinorelbine. Patients receive carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes followed by vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients will be accrued for this study over 6-12 months.
