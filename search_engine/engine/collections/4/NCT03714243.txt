    
      The goal of this prospective, single arm, non-randomized study is to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of using the Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 "Neuro-System" as a tool to serially
      disrupt the blood brain barrier in a temporary and localized fashion in patients with breast
      cancer and brain metastases. Up to 10 patients will be recruited at Sunnybrook. Patients will
      be consented, screened, undergo up to 6 study Exablate BBBD treatment cycles, every 2-3 weeks
      based on their trastuzumab regimen. Follow-up will continue through 12 weeks following the
      last BBBD post-treatment and the subject's participation in the study will be complete.

      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis
      for later studies to evaluate clinical efficacy.
