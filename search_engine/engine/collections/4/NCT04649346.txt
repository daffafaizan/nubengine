      pressure and sealing condition with different SGA including air-Q、i-gel、LMA-supreme、AMBU
      auragain 、ProSeal LMA and other new SGAs.

      In the perioperative period, investigators documented respiratory function data including
      oropharyngeal leak pressure and peak airway pressure in these randomly selected SGA.
      Oropharyngeal leak pressure was measured by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system
      at fixed O2 flow 3L/min and noting the airway pressure at which the dial on a calibrated
      aneroid manometer reached equilibrium.

      investigators wanted to compared the respiratory function between
      air-Q、i-gel、LMA-supreme、AMBU auragain、ProSeal LMA and other new SGAs during surgery and
      postoperative care unit.
