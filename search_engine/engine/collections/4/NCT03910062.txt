      cardiac arrest. Complications of VA ECLS include hemorrhagic, infectious and ischemic events.
      VA ECLS requires arterial and venous canules which are frequently positioned in the femoral
      artery and vein, which carries the risk of lower limb ischemia due to retrograde flow and
      obstruction of the femoral artery lumen. VA ischemia during VA ECLS is frequent (11-52%) and
      requires the use of reperfusion canula in the femoral common artery on VA ECLS implantation
      in a primary prevention strategy, before lower limb ischemia occurs. Even with this strategy,
      lower limb ischemia can occur due to arterial thrombosis, arterial spasm or insufficient
      blood flow through the reperfusion canula. Lower limb complications are prevented by
      monitoring of regional oxygen saturation, control of the reperfusion canula position
      (ultrasound, angiography) and rapid management when lower limb ischemia is suspected. There
      are no clear recommendations regarding prevention of lower limb complications during VA ECLS
      and arterial angiography has been described to diagnose ischemic events and evaluate the
      effectiveness of an intervention such as injection of vasodilators. This study is a
      prospective evaluation of a strategy to prevent lower limb complications during VA ECLS with
      a systematic arterial angiography on VA ECLS implantation and when lower limb ischemia is
      suspected (regional oxygen tissue saturation <50% or a differential >15% between both lower
      limbs) in addition to continuous NIRS monitoring of lower limbs during VA ECLS.
