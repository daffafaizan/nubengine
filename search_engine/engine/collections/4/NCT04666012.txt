      Part B is conducted as multi-center, open-label, a Phase 2a clinical trial. In Part A, we
      assess safety in all dose groups and set suitable two doses for Part B. In Part B, we assess
      immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and set suitable dose for next phase of clinical trial.
      DSMB will evaluate safety during the whole study period.
