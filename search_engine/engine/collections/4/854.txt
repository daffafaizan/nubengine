parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.
