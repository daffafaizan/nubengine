      dietary information from questionnaires and interviews. Although scientists have long
      recognized that this information contains error, considerable uncertainty remains about its
      structure. The interpretation of findings from NCI's nutritional epidemiology and
      surveillance efforts is critically dependent on the assessment of dietary measurement error.
      We evaluated such measurement error in the previously conducted Observing Protein and Energy
      Nutrition Study (OPEN) conducted in 1999 and 2000. This study, the largest study of its kind,
      used unbiased biomarkers of dietary intake (doubly labeled water for energy and 24-hour
      urinary nitrogen for protein) to assess measurement error in dietary assessment methods
      commonly used in epidemiology and surveillance research around the world. The landmark
      findings indicate that relative risk estimates in nutritional epidemiology may be severely
      attenuated by the use of food frequency questionnaires and that the conventional use of
      24-hour dietary recalls as reference measurements may lead to severe underestimates of the
      extent of this attenuation. Key questions remain regarding whether these findings hold in
      diverse populations, for other dietary-report or physical activity instruments, across
      varying nutrients and food groups, and how measurement error affects relative risks in
      existing prospective cohorts. In light of the OPEN study findings, we would like to
      re-contact participants, for whom we already have a wealth of nutritional biomarker data, in
      order to assess the structure of measurement error with respect to two other self-reported
      dietary assessment instruments: the food record and a food checklist-adjusted food frequency
      questionnaire. Our intent is to evaluate whether these instruments might have more favorable
      measurement error structure than the food frequency questionnaire, thereby providing better
      tools for nutritional epidemiology.
