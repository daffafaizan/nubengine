      remove unwanted tattoos and benign pigmented lesions. This trial is designed as a
      multi-center exploratory, open-label clinical trial comparing each subject's condition before
      and after treatment. Subjects meeting all entrance criteria will be assigned to Group A for
      treatment of unwanted tattoos and Group B for treatment of unwanted benign pigmented lesions,
      melasma, or other skin conditions such as skin rejuvenation. Subjects in each treatment group
      will receive a series of treatments, e.g., 2-5, and will be asked to complete 1 and 3 month
      follow-up visit(s) following each treatment to assess treatment efficacy and safety. At
      investigators' discretion, additional follow-up visits, e.g., at 6 months following
      treatment, may take place to observe the time course of reactions after treatment and/or
      assess efficacy. Outcome measures include clinician grading and subject satisfaction
      post-treatment. Pre-treatment study photos will be obtained at baseline; post-treatment study
      photos will be obtained at each post-treatment follow-up visit.
