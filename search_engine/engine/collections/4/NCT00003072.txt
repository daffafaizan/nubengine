      cancer receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel have significantly fewer neuropathic events when
      treated with amifostine.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel group, double blind, controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to either the amifostine or control group. All patients receive intravenous
      paclitaxel over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients
      who are randomized to the amifostine group receive intravenous amifostine administered as a
      15 minute infusion 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel therapy. Patients randomized to the control
      group receive an intravenous placebo solution. Patients are discontinued from the study if
      they have disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects after 2 cycles of treatment.
      Patients are followed monthly for 8 months post treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued (40 with advanced ovarian cancer
      and 40 with advanced non-small cell lung cancer) within 2 years.
