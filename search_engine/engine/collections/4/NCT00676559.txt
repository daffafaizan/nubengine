      play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy . Efalizumab inhibits the binding of
      leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
      thereby inhibiting the adhesion of leukocytes to other cell types.

      Clinical studies have demonstrated the bioactivities of intravitreal ranibizumab, a Vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist, in reducing retinal thickness and improving
      visual acuity in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).

      The objective of the CAPTURE Study is to assess the safety and tolerability of efalizumab,
      administered subcutaneously as a weekly (1 mg/kg) dose, compared to and in combination with
      ranibizumab, administered intravitreally (0.5 mg), in the treatment of DME.
