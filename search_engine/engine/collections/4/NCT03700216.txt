      Pediatric Orthopedics Unit of Shanghai Xinhua Hospital in 2016 to collect the basic
      information about this kind of patient, including age, gender, kind of fracture, temperature
      and color of skin, swell, artery pulse, laboratory test indicators, method of fixation, and
      the usage of mannitol. Then, combining the professionals' suggestions, the investigator will
      use multi-factor regression to identify the independent risk factors of blood circulation
      disorder. According to the independent risk factors, the early-warning model of blood
      circulation disorder will be built, and the rating scale as well. Finally, the critical value
      of blood circulation disorder after limb fracture will be set by receiver operating
      characteristic curve.
