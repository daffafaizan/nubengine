    
      This study is aimed at patients with predominant knee osteoarthritis and health professionals
      with a link to the pathology.

      A semi-directed interview according to a pre-established interview guide will be performed.
      Interviews are conducted by trained professionals and recorded with a dictaphone.
      Self-questionnaires are submitted to the patient after the interview.

      The recordings are transcribed as quickly as possible in text format. The verbatim will then
      be coded (axial coding) then grouped by categories and then by themes.

      The objective is to determine the expectations of patients and health professionals regarding
      a smartphone application dedicated to osteoarthritis.

      This study will serve as a basis for designing a tool of this type to improve the long-term
      management of osteoarthritis.
