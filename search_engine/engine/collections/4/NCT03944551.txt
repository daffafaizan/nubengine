    
      This study includes two cohorts. One cohort will participate in an interventional clinical
      trial and the other cohort will participate in an observational study.

      Interventional Cohort:

      The first cohort will include 600 children with signs of severe pneumonia, 1 year up to 5
      years of age. Signs of severe pneumonia include fast breathing, difficulty breathing and who
      are very sick (not able to drink, vomiting, having seizures, are very sleepy or with severe
      malnutrition). Two out of every three children will receive oxygen with the bubble CPAP and
      one out of every three children will receive treatment with oxygen with regular nasal
      cannula. The treatment assignment will be determined randomly. We will follow up participants
      during their entire hospitalization. During this time we will collect information on the
      child's illness, test results and treatment.

      Observational Cohort:

      The second cohort will include 450 children with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of
      age. In Mali, bubble CPAP is currently given as standard of care (when possible) for children
      with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of age; therefore, children in this cohort will
      already be receiving bubble CPAP as standard of care prior to enrollment. The only research
      activities will be to follow the children during their hospitalization and collect
      information about their clinical condition, test results, treatment and the amount of oxygen
      required during the hospital admission.

      The remainder of the information in this ClinicalTrials.gov registration will refer only to
      the Intervention Cohort.
