      of a pacemaker lead in untypical positions in the heart like in the His- bundle area.

      This study is designed as post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to identify and
      evaluate residual risks associated with the use of the guiding catheter Selectra 3D that
      remained unrevealed even after risk analysis, risk mitigation and successful conformity
      assessment. Moreover, the study aims at providing additional PMCF data, as required by
      regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the performance and efficacy of the Selectra 3D shall be
      assessed. The results will be used for updating the clinical evaluation.
