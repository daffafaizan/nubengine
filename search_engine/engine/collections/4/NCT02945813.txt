      after prostatectomy failure, it has provided suboptimal results over the years. Metformin may
      represent an effective and inexpensive means to improve SRT outcomes with a favorable
      therapeutic ratio. Taken pre-clinical and retrospective clinical data together, there is a
      compelling rationale for conducting a RCT with SRT and metformin. Herein we propose a
      multicenter, randomized, open-label, proof-of-concept phase II trial with the hypothesis that
      the addition of metformin to SRT can delay time to progression compared to the
      standard-of-care SRT. The study has 1:1 randomization and stratification variables include
      Gleason score, PSA at SRT, surgical margin status and ADT use.
