      patients scheduled to undergo peripheral angioplasty in order to determine the MRI
      characteristics of acute and chronic vascular inflammation. The vascular territories to be
      angioplastied will be imaged in 20 patients with peripheral vascular disease prior to
      angioplasty. Patients will then be randomly assigned for imaging at 24-72 hours (10 patients)
      or imaging at 2-4 weeks (10 patients) post-angioplasty. Analysis will focus on paired
      comparisons between pre- and post-angioplasty data within each group. This study should
      provide data that can be applied to other research protocols designed to image inflammation
      associated with vascular injury and atherosclerosis.
