      included. Firstly, radiographic caries depth, International Caries Detection and Assessment
      System (ICDAS) codes and MIH levels of teeth were recorded. Then, during the treatment, EPT
      and cold test were performed before and after the administration of local anesthesia. Visual
      Analog Scale for Pain was used to evaluate cold test and pain during treatment. When
      interpreting results, significancy level was stated for the values of p<0.05.
