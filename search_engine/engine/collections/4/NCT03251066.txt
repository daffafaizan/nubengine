      improvement of the ciliary function the efficacy of mucociliary clearance can be remarkably
      enhanced, pathogens from the environment can be physically removed and a bacterial or viral
      infection may be prevented on this way.

      Such an optimizing effect may be reached by the administration of an equilibrated saline
      solution with an optimal composition regarding osmolality, pH-value and buffer substance.

      In addition it would be very advantageous to support the efficacy of the local unspecific and
      specific immune mechanisms in the nasal respiratory mucosa (NALT) without any negative
      effects on the optimized mucociliary clearance.

      As demonstrated recently in airway mucosa sodium propionate is able to interact with
      macrophages, the interleukin system and other factors of the TNF receptor family.

      Sodium propionate could therefore have an ancillary effect on the genuine immune mechanisms
      of nasal respiratory mucosa. On this way the primary effect of administration of saline
      solution is supported.
