      Choice (decision aid) to a control group receiving usual primary care. 100 patients and 60
      cardiologists will be randomize by computer. The investigators will measure the effect of CTO
      Choice on five outcomes: (a) patient knowledge regarding CTO of PCI or medication (risk and
      benefit); (b) quality of the decision making process for both the patient and clinician; (c)
      patient and clinician acceptability and satisfaction with the decision aid; (d) rate of
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medication; and (e) trial processes (e.g.,
      ability to recruit participants, collect patient outcomes). To capture these outcomes, the
      investigators will use patient and clinician surveys following each visit and video
      recordings of the clinical encounters. These video recordings will also allow us to determine
      the extent to which clinicians exposed to the decision aid were able to recreate elements of
      the decision aid which control patients.
