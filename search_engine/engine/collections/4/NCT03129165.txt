      interventions have a variable impact on health at the population level. The largest benefit
      may be obtained by addressing high-risk, disadvantaged and traditionally hard-to-reach
      groups.

      Effective actions include health promotion, timely screening of modifiable risk factors,
      application of evidence-based targets and interventions, broad access to heart-friendly
      environments/facilities and dissemination of favorable social norms. Thus, community
      prevention is a multifaceted task that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. A suitable
      program should be tailored to the specific social context and make the most of local
      resources to improve access, adherence and continuity, as well as sustainability.

      ProSALUTE is a new model of primary CV prevention for the prevalently low-income and
      multiethnic community of Ponte Lambro (n=3600 adults), the neighborhood where the
      coordinating hospital (Centro Cardiologico Monzino, Milan, Italy) is located.

      Under the coordination of a Case Manager (a Nursing Researcher) the citizens are involved in
      a prevention program, which is personalized (content and intensity) according to the
      individual global risk and specific risk factors. The citizens follow an individualized
      schedule of short-term specialist care. Besides, the participants are "gently nudged" to make
      use of local resources that may contribute to sustain a healthy life-style (e.g. parks, gyms,
      social services, etc). Moreover, public preventive events for the community are devised (e.g.
      healthy-cooking course, walking groups, etc) through a collaborative network with
      representatives of the neighborhood.
