      pharmacy in unit dose containers. The initial exposure - filling the posterior bowl of the
      scleral contact lens by the Investigator and applying the lens to the eye - will be monitored
      in the office for one hour, prior to any dispensing of the solution to the patient for their
      use at home or work.

      This is a one week, unmasked comparison of the new solution to the subject's habitual
      solution used for scleral lens insertion. The (historical) control is the saline habitually
      used by the subjects.

      The sample size is determined to be manageable to insure close supervision of the subjects in
      these initial trials and to inform us for future safety and efficacy trials.

      The primary safety outcome measure will be slit lamp examination of the ocular anterior
      segment and the secondary outcome measure will be photo-documentation by ocular coherence
      tomography of the clouding of the tears between the cornea and scleral contact lens. The
      primary efficacy outcome will be ocular comfort as assessed by questionnaire.
