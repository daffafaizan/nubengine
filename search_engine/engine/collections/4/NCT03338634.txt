      Behavior Lab in Chandlee Laboratory. Up to four hundred subjects (200 children and 200
      parents) may be recruited.

      Child Procedures: Both Child and parent's current height and weight will be obtained. After
      being seated at a computer, they will complete the Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAMS) and
      a Freddy Fullness pictorial hunger score. Then their ability to discriminate between portion
      sizes will be assessed. They will be shown several pictures of macaroni and cheese on a
      standard white plate with a grey tablecloth background and asked to determine which picture
      had a larger amount of food. Finally, they will view 180 pictures of common foods and
      non-food objects (office supplies). After each picture, children will be instructed to answer
      questions about the image (what is this image, how happy does it make you feel and how
      excited does it make you feel). Children will then score their hunger again with a Freddy
      Fullness pictorial hunger score and take a Post-Scanning Questionnaire.

      Parent Procedures: Parent's current height and weight will be obtained and he/she will
      complete a demographic questionnaire.
