      days or more. Each attack is characterized by severe pain, typically on one side of the head
      and often involves a number of other symptoms, including pain with a pulsating or throbbing
      quality, nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, visual disturbances or aura.
      Currently the management of migraine may be either acute treatment or prophylaxis. Acute
      migraine treatment aims at aborting or reversing already present migraine symptoms with acute
      administration of medicine such as with triptans, whereas migraine prophylaxis aims to reduce
      the frequency and severity of migraine attacks over time through chronic medication.

      The overall protocol design and outcome measurements of this study follow the guidelines and
      durations recommended by the International Headache Society for prophylaxis studies of
      migraine medications.

      The study ARPH-CL-03 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three parallel group design
      with moderate to severe migraine patients to assess the ability of daily administration of
      AST-726 at one of two doses to reduce the number of headache days in a 4 week period more
      than in patients that receive a placebo. AST-726 and the placebo will be self-administered by
      intranasal spray daily for 12 weeks. Among other efficacy and safety assessments, patients
      will have be asked to collect information on a daily migraine diary.

      Patients will be instructed on the allowed use of acute migraine medications during this
      study.
