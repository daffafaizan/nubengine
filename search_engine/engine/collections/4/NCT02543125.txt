      mechanical ventilation,early extubation may have more benefits.Early extubation may decrease
      the ventilation-associated pneumonia(VAP),sepsis and decrease the incidence of severity
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD).But often fail attempts at extubation because of
      apnea,atelectasis,hypercapnia,hypoventilation or other illnesses.

      High frequency oscillatory ventilation is benefit to lung.Initial ventilation with HFOV in
      preterm with RDS may reduce the incidence of BPD and improve the neurodevelopment.Compared
      HFOV with conventional ventilation in preterm infants showed that HFOV had superior lung
      function when 11 to 14 years age.Whether nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation(NHFOV)
      also have those advantages in non-invasive mode? Null D M et al do a experiment on preterm
      lambs,the result suggest that NHFOV may promotes alveolarization.But there was no clinical
      trials to prove.

      The nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) group fail definition：1、
      Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)>40%、MAP>12 centimeter water column (cm H2O),but arterial
      oxygen saturation (SaO2)<90%.2、significant abdominal distension.3、PaCO2>60millimeter of
      mercury(mmHg)or partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)<45 millimeter of
      mercury(mmHg).4、severe apnea( definition:>6 episodes requiring stimulation in 6 hours or
      requiring >1 episodes of positive-pressure ventilation) 5.potential of hydrogen (PH)<7.2 The
