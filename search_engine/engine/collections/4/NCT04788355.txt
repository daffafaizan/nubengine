      suspected COVID-19, as well as preventing hospitalizations and the need for intensive
      treatment. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the use of hydroxychloroquine or
      hydroxychloroquine with apixaban or apixaban alone, could be able to reduce disease
      progression on an ordinal scale of outcome (including use of mechanical ventilation and
      death) and decrease the likelihood of hospitalization or worsening of clinical conditions.
