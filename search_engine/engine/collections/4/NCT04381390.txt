      ingestion (daily and after training sessions) during 12 weeks of resistance training on
      skeletal muscle regulatory markers, hormonal responses and body composition in
      resistance-trained men. Specific aims of the study are to:

      To investigate the extent to which both whole egg and egg white ingestion will improve
      anabolic factors, fat free mass, fat mass and decrease catabolic markers after 12 weeks of
      resistance training in resistance-trained men.
