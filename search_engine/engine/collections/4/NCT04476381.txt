      viscoelastic properties (tone, stiffness and elasticity) of a trigger point (TP) located in
      the infraspinatus muscle in participants with non-traumatic chronic shoulder pain.

      Methods: Forty-eight individuals who presented non-traumatic chronic shoulder pain were
      recruited. The presence of a TP in the infraspinatus muscle of the painful side was confirmed
      by an experienced physiotherapist with a palpatory exam according to Travell and Simons
      criteria. The TP was marked and the viscoelastic properties including tone, stiffness and
      elasticity were measured with the MyotonPro device by an evaluator. After the first set of
      measurements (T1), an experienced physiotherapist applied a dry needling puncture to the TP
      with a pistoning technique to obtain a local twitch response (LTR) with an Optimed 40 x 0.30
      mm single use acupuncture needle. The same set of measurements was repeated immediately after
      the dry needling (T2) and 30 minutes later (T3). Repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc tests
      were used to assess changes in viscoelastic properties over time with a significant level set
      at 0.05.
