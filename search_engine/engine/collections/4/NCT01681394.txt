      intervention will consist in the administration of 250g of chocolate cream with or without
      the extract after 12 hours fasting. Blood samples will be taken at point 0, 2, 3 and 6 hours
      after the administration. At each time point, blood pressure and endothelial function (with a
      non-invasive method) will be measured.
