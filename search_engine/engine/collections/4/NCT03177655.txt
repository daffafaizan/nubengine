      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord
      (central nervous system). Because nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be
      damaged, patients with multiple sclerosis can have symptoms in different parts of the body.
      Many Multiple Sclerosis patients suffer from depression, fatigue and anxiety in addition to
      physical symptoms. Drugs prescribed for MS have been shown to not improve these comorbid
      psychological symptoms. Researchers have shown that mindfulness-based training programs can
      help MS patients, but these therapies are highly resource demanding and taxing for those
      involved. "Healing Light" Guided Imagery (HLGI; supplementary materials) is a guided imagery
      therapy that simulates a self-hypnotic trance state that has been anecdotally shown to
      improve depression and fatigue in patients with MS in less time and with fewer support
      resources. The investigators plan to test whether HLGI can increase patient well-being.
