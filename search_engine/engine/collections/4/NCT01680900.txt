      reduces the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes. An additional exploratory aim
      is to identify improvement in menopause-related quality of life. Healthy, perimenopausal
      women ages 45-60 with an average of 4 or more moderate or severe hot flashes/night sweats per
      day for 3 screening weeks will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment in a 2:1 ratio of
      vilazodone or matching placebo pills. Flexible dosing of vilazodone will start at 10 mg
      once/day for 7 days, increase to 20 mg/day for 1 more week and increase to 40 mg once/day at
      week 3 if unimproved. The primary outcome assessments are the frequency and severity of hot
      flashes at week 4 and week 8 as assessed by prospective daily diaries (using 7-day mean
      scores from the daily diaries). The secondary outcome is clinical improvement, defined as hot
      flash frequency >=50% decrease from baseline. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be
      monitored and patient ratings of tolerability will be obtained.
