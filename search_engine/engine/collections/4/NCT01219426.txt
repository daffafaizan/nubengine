    
      This study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, students from the University of
      Nantes completed the two assessment tools of gambling related cognitions (GABS : Gambling
      Attitudes and Beliefs Survey ; GRCS : Gambling Related Cognitions Scale), and a reference
      tool for gambling problem severity (SOGS : South Oaks Gambling Screen).

      In the second stage, consecutive pathological gamblers seeking treatment at the University
      Hospital of Nantes completed the three questionnaires.

      Only questionnaires from participants who reported gambling at least one time in the past
      year were kept for analyses.

      Responses of students gamblers and pathological gamblers presenting for treatment have been
      compiled for analysis.

      The main objective of the study is to validate the French adaptations of the GABS and the
      GRCS, and to explore their psychometric properties and structures.

      The recruitment period for the first stage is comprised between March 2008 and August 2008.

      The recruitment period for the second stage started in September 2008.
