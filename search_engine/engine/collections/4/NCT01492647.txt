      physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), single dose ascending study of
      JNJ 10229570-AAA in Japanese participants with acne. The study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics ([PK] how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the
      body and removed from the body over time) of M1 (active metabolite) in a total of eighteen
      (18) participants enrolled in the study, nine (9) in each group. Each participant will
      receive JNJ 10229570-AAA at 1.2%, 3.6% or vehicle in a cream formulation as a 2.5 mL
      application, to the face, neck, shoulders, chest and upper back areas. The investigational
      product will be washed off after the blood sampling at 24 hours after application. Safety and
      tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study and a topical dermatological assessment
      will be done by the dermatologists. The total duration of the study will be maximum 35 days.
