      entire population was stratified according to the timing of surgery and residual disease
      status (any residual disease after primary surgery vs. no residual disease after primary
      surgery vs. interval surgery) and the paclitaxel schedule (weekly vs. every 3 -weeks), stage
      of disease (III vs. IV), geographic region (Japan vs. North America and rest of world [ROW]),
      and germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation status (positive versus
      negative or Unknown).

      Cytoreductive surgery could be performed before randomization and the initiation of study
      treatment (primary) or after 3 cycles of study treatment (interval). The weekly or
      every-3-week paclitaxel schedule and the choice of primary or interval cytoreductive surgery
      were determined at the discretion of the investigator.

      The primary objective was evaluated in the BRCA-deficient cohort, participants with
      homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. These
      populations were sequentially inclusive, with the HRD population including the BRCA-deficient
      population, and the ITT population including the HRD and BRCA-deficient populations. The
      BRCA-deficient population was defined as participants with either a germline (gBRCA) and/or
      tissue-based (tBRCA) deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2
      confirmed by centralized testing. The HRD population was defined as participants with HRD
      tumors based on HRD score or presence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 as determined by centralized testing.
