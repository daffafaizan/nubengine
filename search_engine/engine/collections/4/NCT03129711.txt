      leucite crystal ranging from 5 to 10 Âµm in size. The leucite crystals increase the material
      strength and interferes with crack propagation, while the fracture energy is absorbed by the
      crystalline phase. The resistance and flexural strength (160 Mpa) is improved by the
      difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the glass phase and the
      crystalline phase and the cooling process following sintering phase.

      CELTRA DUO: is a new generation of glass ceramic material. With the aid of a new
      manufacturing process, the glass ceramic is infiltrated with 10% zirconia by weight,
      producing zirconia reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (ZLS). The material is characterized
      by a unique homogenous structure with fine grains that provides excellent material quality
      and consistency, high strength properties and long term performance. In addition, the
      material offers satisfying processing characteristics which can be milled and polished
      easily. After milling the restorations are shaded correctly shaded, with no need for
      crystallization step 10. The milled restorations have a flexural strength of 210 MPa. After
      stain and glaze firing the restoration will exhibit a flexural strength up to 370 MPa.
