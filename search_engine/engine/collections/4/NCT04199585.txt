    
      The study is divided in two parts, Part A and Part B:

      Part A: interventional, randomized, double-blind, sequential-group, placebo-controlled,
      single-ascending oral dose study in healthy young men.

      Part A will consist of up to 6 cohorts (Cohorts A1 to A6) with 9 subjects in each cohort. In
      each cohort, the subjects will be randomised to receive a single oral dose of Lu AF95245 or
      placebo (ratio 6:3)

      Part B: interventional, randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study to investigate
      intra-subject variability, effect of food and mass balance and metabolic profile in healthy
      young men. Part B will be initiated when a anticipated therapeutically relevant dose
      confirmed to be safe and well-tolerated has been identified in Part A; this dose will be used
      in Part B. Part B is divided into 3 dosing periods and subjects will be randomised to 1 of 3
      groups (Groups B1, B2, and B3) with 4 subjects in each group and the groups will be running
      in parallel.
