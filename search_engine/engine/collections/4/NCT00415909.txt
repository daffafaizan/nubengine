    
      Imatinib mesylate is designed to block the enzyme that is believed to be responsible for
      starting the type of leukemia patient has. TALL-104 cells are cells of the immune system that
      have been obtained from a patient with leukemia and then processed in the laboratory to try
      to make them able to kill leukemia cells.

      If found to be eligible to take part in this study, patient will continue receiving imatinib
      mesylate by mouth at the same schedule and dose patient had been receiving before entering
      the study. Patient will receive TALL-104 cells through a needle in their vein over 1 hour on
      Days 1-4, and then again on Days 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 of the cycle. The cycle will last 28
      days.

      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn every week for the first 4 weeks, then every 2-4
      weeks for 2 months, then every 4-6 weeks until 6 months, and then every 3-6 months for
      routine tests and to check for any effect on organs.

      Patient will have follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and at least annually for
      2 years, and then at least every 5 years from then on for the rest of your life. Blood (about
      1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the status of the disease. An additional 1 tablespoon will
      also be collected and stored to be analyzed in case unexpected side effects occur after
      receiving therapy. If patient experiences certain side effects, more blood may need to be
      drawn and more tests performed based on the side effects experienced.

      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
