      short and long term. From the mechanistic standpoint, hyperglycemia can attenuate
      thrombolysis, increase platelet aggregation, induce coronary vasoconstriction, reduce oxygen
      transport and prolong endothelial inflammation after MI. Consistently, observational data
      indicates that glucose normalization improves survival in hyperglycemic patients hospitalized
      with MI.

      High dose potent statins have been included in the early treatment of acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS) based upon a broad range of potentially beneficial mechanisms. Recent
      studies, however, revealed that chronic statin treatment may increase the incidence of type 2
      diabetes mellitus in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, according to studies in cellular and
      animal models, such decrease in insulin sensitivity may be observed immediately after statin
      therapy initiation. By inference, one may speculate that statin treatment initiated at the
      acute phase of MI may potentially favor the appearance or aggravation of stress
      hyperglycemia. To date, however, this hypothesis has not been investigated. Hence, this study
      aim was to investigate the dose-dependent effect of statins on insulin sensitivity in
      patients in the acute phase of MI.
