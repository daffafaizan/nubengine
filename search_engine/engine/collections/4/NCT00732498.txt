      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival of patients with relapsed stage II-IV
           follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with ESHAP chemotherapy for cytoreduction
           followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the median time to progression in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the overall and complete response rates in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  ESHAP chemotherapy: Patients receive ESHAP chemotherapy comprising etoposide IV over 1
           hour, methylprednisolone IV, cisplatin IV on days 1-4, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Between 4-6 weeks after completion of ESHAP chemotherapy, patients
           receive rituximab IV followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes
           on day 1. Patients with < 25% bone marrow involvement and expected biodistribution
           proceed to treatment. Patients receive rituximab IV followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
           tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 7, 8, or 9.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
