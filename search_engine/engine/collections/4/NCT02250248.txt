    
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study. Subjects will be recruited from
      patients already under the Investigator's care who are indicated for XLIF with iliac crest
      bone graft (ICBG) autograft or AttraX Putty. To minimize bias, all consecutive patients at a
      given investigational site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to
      participate in the study whereby the biologic (ICBG autograft or AttraX Putty) will be
      randomly assigned. All subjects will be followed for 24 months following surgery to quantify
      the clinical and radiographic improvements of each biologic compared to baseline and in
      comparison with each other.
