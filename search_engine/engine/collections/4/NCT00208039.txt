      that as many as 75% of chronically ventilated extremely low birthweight premature infants
      have at least one episode of surfactant dysfunction beyond the first week of life, as
      measured in vitro, associated with a low surfactant protein B content. Furthermore, episodes
      of surfactant dysfunction are significantly associated with clinically significant
      respiratory decompensations. We hypothesize that booster doses of surfactant given during the
      second and third week of life to extremely low birth weight premature infants requiring
      persistent intubation and mechanical ventilation will improve their respiratory status during
      the first 28 days of life. We propose to enroll premature infants < 1250 gm birthweight,
      between days 7 and 10 of life who are intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Infants
      requiring persistent intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support at 7-10
      days of life will receive a total of 3 doses of Infasurf surfactant, 3 days apart, at the
      standard dose of 3 ml/kg. Primary outcome is the change in area under the respiratory
      severity score curve between days 7 and 28 of life. Total sample size is 88 infants, study
      duration is 36 months, and recruitment of study patients will occur at The Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia PA, Women and Children's Hospital in Buffalo, St.
      Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis MO, Mercy Children's Hospital in Kansas City, Oakland
      Children's and Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, CA and Long Island Jewish Medical
      Center, NY.
