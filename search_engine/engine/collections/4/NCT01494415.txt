      with nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced
      squamous cell lung cancer. Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 60mg/m2,
      in combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic
      radiation was administered at a dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions, both 3 dimensional conformal and
      intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed. Two cycles of consolidation therapy with
      full dose nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2 on day 1) and carboplatin (AUC 6 on day 1) every 21 day
      will be delivered.
