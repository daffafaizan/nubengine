      retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema (DME) occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the
      macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the
      macula swell, blurring vision. Diabetic macular edema (DME) affects between 8% to 10% of 23.6
      million diabetic individuals in the United States. The prevalence of diabetic macular edema
      after 15 years of known diabetes is approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes, 25%
      in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2
      diabetes who do not take insulin. Within two years of diagnosis, nearly half of individuals
      with DME will lose 2 or more lines of visual acuity (the smallest line you can read on a
      standardized vision chart held 20 feet away).

      Diabetic macular edema is typically treated with laser and/or intravitreal injections of
      drugs such as anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF agents block a protein that slows the growth of the
      abnormal blood vessels. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation.
      Dexamethasone implant is a steroid implant injected into the eye to treat swelling that may
      occur when there is a blockage of certain blood vessels in your eyes. Both anti-VEGF agents
      and dexamethasone implant are approved by the FDA to treat DME.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of using a dexamethasone
      steroid implant versus monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for research participants
      with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME).
