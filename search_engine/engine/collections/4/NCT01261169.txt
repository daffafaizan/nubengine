      with Myfortic® in a dose of 360 mg bid for six months. From day 0, Myfortic will be combined
      with 1 mg/kg prednisone. Prednisone will be tapered from week 1 based on the clinical
      findings of the ophthalmologist.

      There will be no other stratification of patients. After the screening, patients will be
      treated with Myfortic® for 6 months. Patients will be seen at month 1, 3, and 6. Thereafter
      patients will be followed up at month 12. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed
      at each visit.
