      T-cells in the pathogenesis of T-cell decline and long-term persistence of HIV infection.

      The study is divided into two parts.

      Part 1 aims to determine the origin of HIV infected naïve T-cells in vivo by assessing the
      viral relatedness between HIV strains from naïve and memory CD4 T-cells. To do this we will
      be studying ten chronically infected individuals. Naïve and memory CD4 T-cells from these
      individuals will be purified using a magnetic bead sorting (MACS) strategy. Envelope
      sequences will then be isolated and subjected to diversity calculation

      Part 2 seeks to answer whether infection of naïve T-cells is established early in infection
      and what the effect of antiretroviral therapy is on this subset of T-cells. We will initially
      examine the relative proportion of CD31+ (recent thymic emigrants) and CD31- naive CD4+
      T-cells in infected acute (n=15) and chronic (n=15) infection and uninfected (n=15)
      individuals compared with healthy controls. We will then prospectively test individuals prior
      to and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following intiation of HAART (Highly Active
      Antiretroviral Therapy) in individuals with acute (n=10) and chronic (n=10) HIV infection.
      Immunophenotyping will detemine the proportion of naïve T-cells that are CD31+ and those that
      are CD31-. Naïve and memory T-cell subsets will again be purified and total and integrated
      HIV DNA will be quantified using real-time PCR.
