    
      This study is a Phase II randomized, masked, controlled trial that compares the current
      standard dose of indomethacin to a higher dose for the closure of PDA in premature infants
      less than 28 weeks of gestation.

      Neonates (<28 weeks gestation) who are started on indomethacin treatment (with an initial
      3-dose course: 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 mg/kg of indomethacin) within the first 96 hr after birth
      will be eligible for this trial if they continue to have Doppler evidence of ductus patency
      before the third dose of indomethacin. This group of infants have greater than 65% chance of
      developing symptomatic PDA and surgical ligation even after our standard extended course of
      indomethacin. Those infants who do not fit the exclusion criteria will be randomized to
      either a Standard Dose group or to a Higher Dose group after obtaining consent. The infants
      randomized to the standard group will receive a 4th, 5th, and 6th dose of indomethacin (0.1
      mg/kg) at 24 hr intervals (starting at 24 hr after the 3rd dose). The Higher Dose group
      infants delivered between 26-27 weeks gestation will receive a 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and
      9th dose of indomethacin (0.1mg/kg) at 12 hr intervals (starting 12 hr after the 3rd dose).
      The Higher Dose group infants between 24-25 weeks gestation will receive a 4th, 5th, 6th,
      7th, 8th and 9th dose of indomethacin (0.25mg/kg) at 12 hour intervals (starting 12 hr after
      the 3rd dose). To keep the study blinded, the standard group will receive 3 extra doses of
      saline to match the 3 additional doses given to the higher dose group.
