      HIV infected patients who have commenced HAART with varying CD4+ T lymphocyte responses.

      METHODS: IL-7Rα gene SNPs and haplotypes will be measured by constructing DNA pools, and PCR
      amplification and DNA sequencing. IL-7Rα expression will be examined using constitutive
      expression of IL-7Rα, IL-7Rα gene expression, and inducible expression of IL7Rα.
