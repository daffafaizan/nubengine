    
      Knee OA is a chronic, progressive, degenerative disease that affects over 20 million
      Americans, and is cited as the primary cause for activity restriction and physical disability
      in older adults. The joint damage and symptoms (i.e., pain, stiffness, and fatigue)
      accompanying symptomatic knee OA result in activity restriction, muscle atrophy, reduced
      quality of life and difficulty in performance of functional tasks.

      Despite the well-established benefits of the Arthritis Foundation's (AF) exercise programs,
      recent evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions combining Exercise and Dietary Weight
      Loss (EX+DWL) results in superior improvements in key clinical outcomes in older, overweight
      or obese knee OA patients.

      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of a novel community-based EX+DWL program to AF's Walk
      with Ease (WWE) EX intervention on improved mobility in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the cost effectiveness and effects of the EX+DWL and WWE
      interventions on weight loss, pain, and quality of life.
