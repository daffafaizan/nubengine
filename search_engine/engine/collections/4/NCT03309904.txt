      years) floorball players. Club is used as cluster unit.

      Coaches in the intervention group receive education of the preventive neuromuscular training
      program Knee Control (Kn√§kontroll) before the start of the season. Knee Control consists of 6
      different exercises, with 4 different variations and 1 pair-exercise, and takes about 10
      minutes to complete. In addition, coaches are instructed to perform a 5-minute running
      warm-up before the Knee Control exercises. Teams are to carry out the intervention at all
      training sessions, and the 5-minute warm-up also before all matches.

      Coaches in the control group carry on their normal training and warm-up routines with their
      clubs.

      Teams are followed for one full season: October 2017 - March 2018. Data registered for the
      study include exposure to floorball training and matches, and injuries that occur as a result
      of participation in floorball.
