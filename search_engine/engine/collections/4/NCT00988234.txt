      surface anatomical landmarks and a loss-of-resistance technique, but over the years it was
      almost abandoned for its low successful rate, the huge numbers of adverse effects and its
      difficulties to be performed. The introduction of the nerve stimulator and ultrasound guided
      technique in recent years increased the success rate in various peripheral nerve blocks and
      decreased adverse effects. Ultrasound guided LPB as well as sciatic nerve block technique in
      a small patient population resulting in a encouraging result, but published clinical data on
      optimal patient position for ultrasound-guided LPB are limited. We designed this prospective
      randomized study to compare the success rate, time of performance and complications of
      ultrasound guided posterior lumbar plexus block as well as subgluteal or sub-greater
      trochanter sciatic nerve block under lateral decubitus position v.s. prone position.
