      month period in which, after a random start, the Linkage condition alternately is added to
      Usual Care in the Chemical Dependency (CD) clinic and then removed. We compare Usual Care to
      Usual Care plus Linkage. Follow-up interviews will be conducted at 6, 12 and 24 months. The
      Linkage intervention includes Usual Care plus 1) sessions on activation regarding overall
      health behaviors and on selecting a Primary Care physician and communicating with him/her,
      and 2) a linkage phone call (and/or a facilitated email) with the patient, clinician, and
      Primary Care physician. The intervention aims to place drug abuse problems in the context of
      overall health and health care and to activate patients to increase involvement in their own
      health care.
