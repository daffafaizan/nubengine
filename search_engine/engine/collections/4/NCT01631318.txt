      I. The purpose of this study is to perform a pilot feasibility study on 3-dimensional (3D)
      ultrasound imaging of liver metastases and to evaluate whether perfusion characteristics
      (measurements of blood-flow) of hepatic metastases can predict tumor response to treatment in
      patients with liver metastases. The investigators long term goal is to assess whether early
      perfusion changes at 2 weeks after chemotherapy initiation can be used as a non-invasive
      early biomarker for treatment response assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging before initiation of
      chemotherapy, at 2 weeks, and at 2 months.
