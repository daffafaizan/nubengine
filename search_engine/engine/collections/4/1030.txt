lengthening of the thrombin time by an anti-equine antithrombin in ahyperthrombocyte myelosis.a report is given on a patient treated with numerousi.m. injections of thrombase (equine thrombin) forchronic gingivorrhagia caused by a hyperthrombocyticmyelosis.  these were ineffective and an antithrombinspecific against equine thrombin had developed.  thisdid not cause any specific disturbance of the intrinsiccoagulation.  the observation can be compared with twocases of haemophilia where such an antithrombin hadalso developed after repeated injections of equine thrombin.
