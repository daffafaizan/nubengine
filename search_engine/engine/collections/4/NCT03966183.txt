      central auditory processes, which in turn would have a negative impact on motor control
      capabilities during voice production. This study was conducted in patients who had undergone
      Type I thyroplasty. To highlight these influences, the authors relied on behavioral tests of
      auditory perception and vocal production.

      The investigators would like in this study, based on a similar and existing population at the
      Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, to try to understand the changes observed clinically by
      proposing to perform vocal production tasks (also planned for the longitudinal study) in the
      MRI. The investigators would like to objectify the differences in the areas involved in the
      central auditory processes in comparison between patients and control subjects.
