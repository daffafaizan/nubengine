      5-10 mcg subcutaneous exenatide for 28 weeks. Liver histology was assessed using the NAFLD
      Activity Score (NAS) prior to therapy and after 28 weeks of therapy. We used the following
      criteria to define our primary outcome: (i) no worsening of fibrosis score, (ii) improved
      score by at least one point in hepatocyte ballooning, (iii) either (a) improvement in NAS by
      2 or more points spread across at least two of the three NAS components, or (b)
      post-treatment NAS equal or greater than 3.
