      part of standard clinical care. Participants will provide information and content from their
      electronic media to research assistants during in person interviews if they are in the
      intervention group. Research assistants will then give clinicians the information collected,
      so the clinicians can incorporate the data into the session as they see fit. Therapists will
      retain full clinical discretion of how they continue to conduct their therapy sessions. The
      investigators will compare the impact of receiving this electronic enhancement intervention
      versus only receiving treatment as usual care on mental health related functioning and
      therapeutic alliance.
