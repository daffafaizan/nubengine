      lesions are difficult to evaluate by standard ultrasound. The quantitative elastography is a
      new medical imaging technique and potentially a diagnostic tool in brain lesions in preterm
      infants. Shear wave Imaging (SSI) could be of interest in this clinical setting. This
      technique, already investigated in adults (breast, thyroid or liver fibrosis staging), has
      not been yet evaluated in neonates.
