      disease.All eligible patients were randomly divided into three groups: experimental group 1:
      dual stent group: both main vessel(MV) and side branch(SB) were stented, and DK-Crush or
      Culotte were performed according to different pathological characteristics. Experimental
      group 2: single stent + drug-coated balloon（DCB）: stent was implanted in the MV, and only
      drug balloon was used in the SB.Experimental group 3: L-Sandwich : stent was implanted in the
      MV, and the branch was implanted 3-5mm away from the ostium，and the DCB was implanted in the
      ostium of the branch.IVUS+ angiography was used to guide the operation and evaluate the
      outcome.
