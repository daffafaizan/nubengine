      survival, irrespective of diagnosis, is approximately 8.8 months (95% confidence interval,
      7.4 to 10.9 months). In recent years there has been increased interest in novel agents.

      Elucidating the molecular basis of advanced cancer will lead to the development of
      potentially curative strategies for these diseases aimed at the specific molecular and
      genetic aberrations characteristic of specific tumors.

      This study is a molecular profiling analyses of the patients' stored samples and will not
      involve more than minimal risk to the subjects. Subjects are at no more than minimal risk
      because only leftover blood, tissue, and patient data will be used for this study, and all
      patient data will be kept confidential.
