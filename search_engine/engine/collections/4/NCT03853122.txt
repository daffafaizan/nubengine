      continuous model of tendinopathy proposed by Cook and Purdam (Cook & Purdam, 2009), showing
      in the literature this methodology more effective than the wait and see approach or that the
      use of corticosteroid injections, accentuating the differences in long-term follow-up
      evaluations (Mellor et al., 2018). However, the current system lacks an objectification
      methodology for the severity of the pathology and objective criteria for the progression of
      the load, usually based on subjective feelings of discomfort or pre-established intensities.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the development and introduction of a
      methodology for the quantification and progression of the loads, with an individual control
      and management of the exercise dose, as well as the execution of specific exercises for each
      one of them, could improve the clinica and functional results. Moreover, achieving
      neuromuscular adaptations based on the characteristics of the neuromuscular system, could
      improve the times and results of the intervention, as well as the rate of treatment failures,
      in the tendinopathies of the lower limbs.
