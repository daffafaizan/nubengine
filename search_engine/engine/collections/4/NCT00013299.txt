    
      This is a randomized clinical trial to: (1) Determine the extent to which custom made study
      shoes will reduce the incidence of reulceration in diabetic individuals with prior history of
      footulcers, and (2) Estimate costs of ulcer prevention using these strategies. Patients from
      the Seattle VA (n=214) and Group Health Cooperative (n=213) will be randomly assigned to one
      of two study arms. They are: (1) patients wearing study shoes and premolded polyurethane
      insoles and (2) the control group of patients wearing their own footwear.
