      Over the past 2 decades, well-designed clinical trials have documented the clinical benefits
      of combination of chemotherapy and radiation for localized esophageal cancer, either as
      primary therapy or in neoadjuvant setting.

      Paclitaxel, a radiation sensitizer, has important single-agent activity in esophageal cancer.
      Paclitaxel-based chemoradiation has been the framework for the recent Radiation Therapy
      Oncology Group (RTOG) trials of nonoperative management of esophageal cancer.

      Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      represents a viable target in the treatment of esophageal cancer. EGFR expression is
      associated with poor prognosis. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody, binds specifically to EGFR
      on both normal and tumor cells and competitively inhibits the binding of EGF and other
      ligands, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î±.

      Preclinical models have suggested synergy between cetuximab, paclitaxel, cisplatin and
      radiation. For patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, the combination of
      cetuximab and radiation has demonstrated both response and survival benefit.

      With all these, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of locally advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)with cetuximab in combination with paclitaxel, cisplatin and
      radiation may further improve clinical outcomes. This trial results will be important as it
      may support further studies for setting the new treatment standard for ESCC.
