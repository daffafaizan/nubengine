        2. Identify patient experiences and tolerance of three commonly used acupuncture needles at
           Mike O'Callaghan Military Medical Center at Nellis Air Force Base. This study will
           compare 30 patients (10 per needling group) and will serve as a pilot study for a
           potential larger randomized control trial (RCT) across multiple MTFs in the Defense
           Health Agency (DHA) to establish better BFA care practices. We will be recruiting a
           total of 39 subjects, which is inclusive of a 30% drop out rate to accommodate those
           that may be lost to the study or have missing data to achieve a final total of 30
           subjects.
