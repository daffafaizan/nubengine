      to understand the processes related to smoking and relapse. The specific aims of the current
      study were to test a series of hypotheses about the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      long-term, tailored interventions in chronic, older smokers and the interaction of these
      interventions with gender and depression. Participants were 50 years or older and smoker 10
      or more cigarettes per day. Baseline assessments includes measures of smoking behavior,
      nicotine dependence, depression diagnosis, demographics and life circumstances and measures
      of anger, depression and mood disturbance, stress, social support, health status, motivation
