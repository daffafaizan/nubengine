      common complications after gastrointestinal surgery. In our previous study, a nomogram model
      was established to predict intra-abdominal complications after gastrointestinal surgery. This
      model was based on the clinical data and the drainage fluid cytokine levels, and it received
      an AUC >0.9. A predicting score (i.e. APPEAL-GC score) was created based on the model. In
      this study, validation of this score in predicting intra-abdominal complications is planned
      to be conducted in this prospective cohort study.

      In this study, all patients undergoing gastric or colorectal cancer surgery with a primary
      anastomosis will be included. The clinical data and complication data will be prospectively
      collected; the discarded drainage fluid will be collected and analyzed afterward. No
      additional intervention will be applied.

      The cytokine levels in the drainage fluid will be evaluated, and together with the clinical
      data, an APPEAL-GC score will be created for each patient. We will investigate whether the
      above-mentioned score is able to predict the intraabdominal complications after surgery. The
      predictive value (clinical usefulness) of the score will be validated in this study.
