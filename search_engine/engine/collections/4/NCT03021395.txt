      consolidation therapy are enrolled. Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) after
      consolidation therapy receive decitabine treatment if patients do not receive stem cell
      transplantation. The treatment regimen includes three course of decitabine regimen at a dose
      of 20mg/mÂ² on day1-5. The MRD clearance rate is the primary outcome to measure the efficacy
      of decitabine regimen.
