      response of a nociceptive stimulus. This autonomic reflex, parasympathetic mediated in
      sedated patients, can be generated by various pain stimuli (built in standardized protocol,
      surgical incision, â€¦) The PDR is a robust reflex, even in patients under general anesthesia,
      and provides a potential evaluation of the autonomous circuit within the nociceptive
      evaluation based on pupil dilation upon A-delta and C fibers in both electrical or mechanic
      stimulation. This mono-centric project involving American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      classification I-II patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia
      are recruited. Enrolled patients perioperative undergo PDR measurements at four different
      standardized times.
