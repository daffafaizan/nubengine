      treatment of hypophonia in Parkinson's disease. The procedure includes a device that records
      the sound intensity level of the wearer's speech and compares it to the noise level around
      them. The device will provide the wearer with feedback if their speech becomes too quiet for
      them to be heard by their listener.
