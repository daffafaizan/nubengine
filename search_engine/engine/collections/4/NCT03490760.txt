      (RT) for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have progressed through first-line
      chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer patients who have received second-line or greater
      chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are not eligible. Target accrual is 39 patients.
      Durvalumab 1500 mg (or 20 mg/m2 if <30 kg) IV every 4 weeks will be started and continued
      during RT and afterwards until the patient experiences either unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression, whichever comes first. Patients must have at least three
      radiographically measurable pancreatic cancer lesions in different organs that have not
      previously received RT, two of which will receive RT. Eligible lesions include either the
      primary pancreatic tumor in unresected patients or distant metastatic lesions. Three
      fractions of 8 Gy each will be prescribed to one lesion during Week 3. Three fractions of 8
      Gy each will be prescribed to the second lesion during Week 5.

      This is a single-arm trial with continuous monitoring of acute non-hematologic toxicity with
      the primary endpoint of progression free survival. Efficacy will be evaluated by time to
      progression or death, whichever comes first, and compared to historical control of
      chemotherapy alone as reported in the literature.
