      use. The investigators hypothesize that the combination acts synergistically to reduce AFP.

      The trial consists of a double-blind treatment period of twelve weeks with either Placebo or
      ATNC05. Subjects who do not respond to the study medication will continue on to a twelve week
      Open-Label extension phase, during which they will receive ATNC05.

      The subjects will have six office visits during the Double-Blind phase. Subjects continuing
      to the Open-Label phase will have four additional visits.

      Data gathering procedures include daily pain questionnaire forms, as well as questionnaires
      and physical examination during office visits.
