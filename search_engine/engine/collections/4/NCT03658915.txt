      musculoskeletal dysfunction such as disturbed joint position sense, which impairs their
      ability to perform their regular daily activities. As rehabilitation should target impairment
      in function, it is essential that therapists assess joint sense during baseline and follow-up
      evaluation of patients to decide on needed therapeutic interventions. Joint position sense
      can be assessed by various methods such as motion tracking systems and the isokinetic
      dynamometer, yet these equipment are expensive and are not readily available at regular
      clinical settings.

      Smartphone has been introduced as an assessment tool in rehabilitation of musculoskeletal
      disorders. For the knee joint, smartphone has been validated for measuring range of motion
      and joint position sense in healthy population, yet it has never been validated in patients
      with knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, this study will investigate smartphone validity and
      reliability as an assessment tool of knee position sense in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.
