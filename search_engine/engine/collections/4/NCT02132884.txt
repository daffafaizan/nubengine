      I. The three month progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with targeted agents
      in the second line setting based on the tumor molecular signature as defined by CancerCode
      will be 40% vs 20% with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (RR). II. Overall survival (OS). III. Proportion of Arm-B patients whose
      second line therapy is changed as a result of physician access to CancerCode-50 results.

      IV. Concordance of variants identified when sequencing is performed on samples from the same
      patient collected at baseline and follow-up time points.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive standard of care therapy based on the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      ARM B: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for analysis via sequencing.
      Upon disease progression following front-line treatment, patients receive specific targeted
      therapy based on the mutational status obtained during sequencing.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
