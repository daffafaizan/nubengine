      pain and disability related to lateral epicondylitis.

      The investigational medicinal products will be Chirocaine, ABBVIE OY, Espoo, Finland
      (levobupivacaine) and ExparelÂ®, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, N.J. (liposomal
      bupivacaine).

      The design of the study will be an off-label, investigator initiated, randomized, controlled,
      double-Blind cross over treatment trial. Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) will be the
      medicinal product in the intervention arm, whilst Chirocaine (levobupivacaine) will serve as
      the active control.

      Patients for the study will be recruited from the patients referred to the hand surgery
      outpatient clinic at Turku University Hospital, Finland.

      During the pilot phase of the study, four patients will be recruited, after which power
      analysis is done. The main study will include up to 50 patients, 25 patients in each study
      arm. Patient enrollment will start immediately after the all the relevant permits have been
      obtained (estimated September 2020).

      Normal distribution of data will be tested by Shapiro-Wilks test. The mean and Standard
      Deviation will be reported for normally distributed data. For data not distributed normally,
      the median and inter quartile ranges of the data will be reported. Independent samples t-test
      will be used for between-group comparison (normal distribution). The Mann-Whitney test will
      be used for non-normal data.

      The results will be published in a peer reviewed international academic journal.
