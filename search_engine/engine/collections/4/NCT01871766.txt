      post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system. Treatment for low-risk (subset 1)
      participants will consist of chemotherapy and radiation. Low-risk (subset 2) and
      intermediate-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation and/or undergo surgery
      to destroy/remove the tumor. Intermediate-risk participants will also receive 16 weeks of
      maintenance chemotherapy. High-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy. High-risk participants will also receive additional maintenance therapy with
      anti-angiogenic chemotherapy.
