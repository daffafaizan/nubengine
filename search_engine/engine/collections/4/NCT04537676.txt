      life of patients and cause people a significant burden to life. A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)
      is associated with deterioration the physical, mental and social life quality. Given the
      detrimental effect foot ulcers have on patients, it is essential that quality of life metrics
      be evaluated among DFU patients. To what degree can diabetic foot ulcers affect the quality
      of life of patients? What are the facilitators and barriers to an improved quality of life?

      To gain insight into these questions Podimetrics researchers will be conducting a
      longitudinal study among patients suffering with a DFU. The general purpose of the study is
      to evaluate the current quality of life of DFU patients from the subject perspective in
      various domains including physical functioning, general health perception, psychological,
      social functioning, vitality and role limitations. The study will also explore the
      relationships between HRQoL and usage of the Podimetrics System. Improved understanding of
      patients' subjective evaluation of their quality of life, and the role of the Podimetrics
      System, will help clinicians provide better care for these patients.

      A cohort of DFU patients will be recruited upon providing informed consent. Participant
      lifestyle and ulcer status information is collected by a background survey. HRQoL is assessed
      at baseline, 6 month and 12 month using questionnaires. The investigators intend to use two
      types of questionnaires for HRQoL evaluation in this study: one generic questionnaire, SF-36,
      which addresses general quality of life issues, and one specific questionnaire, DFS-SF, which
      addresses issues specific to diabetic foot diseases, such as ulcer severity and impact of
      ulcer care.
