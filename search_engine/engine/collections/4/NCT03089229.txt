    
      This study is a 13 week (91 days) randomized, double-blind, in home use study among 30 male
      and female subjects with moderate to severe active atopic dermatitis (AD). The study will
      include subjects with ages 12 - 65 years old inclusive. Group assignments will be balanced by
      age and disease severity of AD. The study will consist of a 1 week washout period and 12 week
      treatment phase. During the treatment phase, subject will be provided one of the two test
      products to use twice daily on all lesions and non-lesional areas as instructed. No
      additional creams, lotions or soaps other than provided test products will be allowed
      throughout the duration of the study. Measurements, expert visual assessments and
      self-assessments will be taken as described below. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated
      by incidence of AE's (defined per CTCAE), exacerbations, application site
      reactions/infections, and lab evals. There will also be consumption/compliance checks and
      dermatological evaluations at each visit.
