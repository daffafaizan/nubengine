      evaluation of DBS surgical candidacy for Parkinson's disease. Once it is determined that a
      patient is an appropriate candidate for DBS placement (multidisciplinary team consensus) and
      has met inclusion criteria,the researchers will discuss the study with the subject and
      explain the rationale for the study as well as the implications the subject's participation
      has to their treatment. Informed consent will be obtained prior to study procedures being
      performed. Subjects will be in the study from the time of enrollment before surgery until all
      post-operative visits and tests are completed, usually by 6 months after surgery. Follow-up
      during this time will consist of the standard follow-up schedule that all patients who
      undergo DBS follow. This includes a clinic visit at 10-14 days, 12 weeks, and 6 months after
      DBS surgery. Subjects will also have a follow-up neurocognitive evaluation consisting of the
      same evaluative tests administered pre-operatively. These post-operative visits are standard
      for all patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson's.
