      Subjects. Up to 15 study sites will participate in this study. The primary and secondary
      endpoints are as follows:

      Primary endpoint:

      The primary endpoint is acetabular cup position success at 6 weeks postoperatively. Success
      is defined as cup inclination and version within 10 degrees of the plan.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Inclination success (as defined for the primary endpoint)

        2. Version success (as defined for the primary endpoint)

        3. 90-day complication rates

        4. Change from preoperative baseline for the Harris Hip Score

        5. Radiographic Outcomes (based upon: AP Hip, AP Pelvis, and Modified Lauenstein Lateral)

        6. Change from preoperative baseline for the EQ-5D-5L (health state, EQ-VAS, and index
           value, if applicable)

        7. Change from 6 week baseline for the Forgotten Joint Score
