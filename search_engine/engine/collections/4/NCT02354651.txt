      be invited to participate in this study. The following tests will be performed during
      participation in the study:

        1. Forced expiratory tests

        2. Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)

        3. Resting Breathing Pattern

        4. Phrenic Nerve Function Evaluation with EMG

        5. Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire

        6. Magnetic stimulation

        7. Diaphragm conditioning consisting of:

             1. The external stimulator settings

             2. The duration of diaphragm stimulation

             3. Off-ventilator spontaneous breathing (SB)
