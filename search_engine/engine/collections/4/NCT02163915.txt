    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-137. TAK-137 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose and to assess how TAK-137 is metabolized in people with
      attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study will look at side effects and
      lab results in people who take TAK-137. This study is designed as a randomized,
      sequential-cohort, multiple rising dose study.

      Therefore, the TAK-137 2 mg Cohort will not start until the TAK-137 0.5 mg Cohort has
      completed, etc.

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 42 days. Participants will make at least 2 visits to the clinic, including one
      9-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted by telephone 7
      days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

      A decision was made to terminate this study so that emerging data from preclinical studies
      could be further assessed.
