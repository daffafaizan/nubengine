      Primary

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with progressive locally
           advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with DJ-927 as
           second-line treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the median survival time in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      first-line treatment regimen (irinotecan-containing vs oxaliplatin-containing).

      Patients receive oral DJ-927* on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive 1 of 2 selected doses to confirm the previously established maximum
      tolerated dose

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-62 patients (28-31 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 12 months.
