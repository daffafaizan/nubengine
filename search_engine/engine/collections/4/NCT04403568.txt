      investigators will be alerted to the potential candidate and will introduce the study to the
      patient at their standard of care (SOC) appointment or via telephone. Patients will be given
      the option for enrollment and if they agree, informed consent will be discussed and obtained
      provided they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following informed consent, subjects
      will be assigned to one of the following cohorts:

      Cohort 1:

      • Ursolic Acid (150 mg) BID (twice a day)

      Cohort 2:

      • Curcumin (600 mg) BID

      Cohort 3:

      • Ursolic Acid (150 mg) and Curcumin (600 mg) BID

      The study team aim to enroll 10 subjects who will complete the study into each cohort for a
      total of 30 completers. Subjects will be enrolled on a rolling basis with the first ten
      subjects assigned to Cohort 1, the next ten subjects assigned to Cohort 2, and the last 10
      subjects assigned to Cohort 3.
