    
      This study aims to develop 10-year risk prediction models for total CVD and all-cause
      mortality among Chinese diabetic patients in primary care. Risk prediction models for
      individual DM complications including CHD, heart failure, stroke and ESRD will also be
      developed.

      The objectives are to:

        1. Calculate the 10 years incidence of total CVD, all-cause mortality and each major DM
           complication in Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        2. Determine the risk factors that significantly predict total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           each major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        3. Develop and validate risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and each
           major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        4. Develop a risk prediction nomogram and chart for the risk of total CVD, all-cause
           mortality for Chinese DM patients in primary care

      Hypotheses:

        1. Patient socio-demographic, clinical parameters, disease characteristics, and treatment
           modalities are predictive of 10-year risk of total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           individual DM complication as a dependent variable.

        2. The risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and individual DM
           complication developed in this study can have over 70% of discriminating power.
