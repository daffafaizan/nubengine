      Several factors have been recognized as predictors of respiratory failure in adults with
      Guillain Barré Syndrome. They include a time from disease onset and patient admission of less
      seven days, inability to lift head, impaired swallowing and a forced vital capacity of less
      than 60% of predictive value. We reasonned that early mechanical ventilation may prevent
      aspiration which is likely the main cause of pneumonia in these patients.
