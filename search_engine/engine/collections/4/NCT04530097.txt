      To verify the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation combined with melatonin in the treatment of
      stage IA non-small cell lung cancer, and explore new directions for the prevention and
      treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study. Using the same admission
      criteria, it is planned to enroll 260 patients, who will be randomly assigned 1:1. The
      experimental group: radiofrequency ablation combined with melatonin, and the control group:
      radiofrequency ablation combined with placebo.

      Intervention group: Radiofrequency ablation was performed immediately after enrollment, and
      melatonin treatment was given for 6 months after 1 week after radiofrequency.

      Control group: Radiofrequency ablation was performed immediately after enrollment, and a
      placebo treatment program was given for 6 months after 1 week after radiofrequency.
