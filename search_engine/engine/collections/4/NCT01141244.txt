    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of
      temsirolimus administered in combination with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and
      temozolomide every three weeks to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination of temsirolimus, irinotecan and
      temozolomide administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of temsirolimus,
      irinotecan, and temozolomide within the confines of a Phase 1 study.

      II. To collect preliminary data regarding the biologic effects of temsirolimus on proteins
      involved in signaling pathways of interest in pediatric solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 or on days
      1, 8, and 15 and temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
