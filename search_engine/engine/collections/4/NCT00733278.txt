      IUD will be verified prior to elective C-section. After removal of the placenta, the copper
      IUD will be placed through the incision at the fundus and the tail strings will be delivered
      through the cervix. Data will be collected about patient bleeding and possible infection
      during the immediate postoperative period. The visibility of the strings will be verified at
      discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks postpartum. Fundal placement of the IUD will be verified by
      ultrasound at the patient's last visit.
