    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

      In this research study, the investigators are utilizing MRIs of the brain with additional
      post-imaging processing (called Treatment Response Assessment Maps or TRAMs) to try to
      delineate tumor recurrence from radiation changes. The investigators hope to understand
      whether such a test may allow future patients to avoid resection entirely.
