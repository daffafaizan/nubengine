      immunologic response to viral antigens. It is thought that this initial immune response plays
      an important role in determining early and long-term suppression of HIV. However, limited
      information is available regarding the effect of early antiretroviral therapy on immune
      responses. Therapeutic approaches such as Remune, which augment cell-mediated immunologic
      responses, may prove to be beneficial in controlling the progression of HIV infection,
      especially when used in combination with antiretroviral therapy in early infection. Current
      antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the infection of new cells yet seem to suppress early
      cell-mediated immune responses. The question is raised as to whether immune-based therapies
      such as Remune may counteract the suppressive effects of antiretrovirals and slow the
      progression of infection.

      Patients receiving fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy are randomized to add either
      Remune or an Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) control. Vaccinations are administered on Day
      1, Week 12, and Week 24. Blood samples are collected at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, and
      28. Clinical assessment includes lymphocyte proliferative response, cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      (CTL) memory cell activity, chemokine and cytokine measurements, CD4 count, and viral load.
      Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests are performed at Day 1 and Week 28. HIV-1
      specific immunogenicity is coordinated with the response to antiretroviral therapy in
      patients.
