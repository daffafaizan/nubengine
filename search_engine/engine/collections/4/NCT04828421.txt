      moreover in a population that show an altered GM such as elderly population as age-related
      changes. Several studies have shown that ageing alter GM, both in diversity and integrity.

      Probiotics have demonstrated that correct or prevent age-related dysbiosis, in order to
      reduce or prevent intestinal permeability and associated inflammation, inhibit the generation
      of harmful and/or toxic metabolites, as well as promote the production of beneficial
      bacterial components.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a multiprobiotic formulation as a
      therapeutic strategy to attenuate the emotional and cognitive decline associated with ageing
      in healthy adults over 55 years of age. The hypothesis is that administration of a
      multi-species probiotic for 10 weeks will slow and/or ameliorate the decline in emotional and
      cognitive function inherent to senescence.
