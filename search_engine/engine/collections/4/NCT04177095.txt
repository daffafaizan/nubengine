      immunosuppressive regimen can safely be weaned off all non-belatacept immunosuppression
      (mycophenolate, mTORi, prednisone) in a stepwise fashion. To this end, participants will
      undergo monthly "immune monitoring" using the Allosure (dd-cfDNA) and Trugraf (RNA profiling)
      blood tests to determine if they are in a state of immune quiescence. Only patients who are
      deemed to be immune quiescent, will continue to be weaned of non-belatacept
      immunosuppression.
