      provides analgesia following abdominal surgery . The TAP block significantly reduces pain
      after open inguinal hernia repair, regardless of whether it is used as a primary anesthesia
      technique or as a complement to general anesthesia, spinal or local anesthesia .

      The investigators designed this study to compare the postoperative analgesic effect of two
      doses of dexamethasone( 4 mg and 8 mg ) added to bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided TAP block
      for inguinal hernia repair.
