    
      A significant difference was observed between MD, PSD, s-RNFL and m-RNFL levels of groups
      (p<0.05) (Table 3), but when compared with Groups of Vit E and AOF, MD and s-RNFL levels of
      the Group GB were significantly low and PSD level was significantly high in the same group.
      m-RNFL level of the Vit E group was significantly higher than m-RNFL levels of GB, AOF and
      Control groups (p<0.05, p<0.01). In the comparison of Vitamin E with GB, MD values were found
      significantly higher and PSD values were significantly low (p<0.05). No statistically
      significant difference was present between I-RNFL levels of groups (p>0.05). While the
      difference between c/d levels of groups were highly significant (p<0.01) (Table 3), c/d
      levels of Vit E and GB groups were found significantly lower than c/d levels of AOF and
      Control groups (p<0.01). c/d level of the Vit E group is significantly lower than c/d levels
      of AOF and Control groups (p<0.01). No statistically significant difference was found between
      c/d levels of other groups (p>0.05).

      No statistically significant difference was present between s-GCC and i-GCC levels of groups
      (p>0.05). A high statistically significant difference was found between m-GCC levels of
      groups (p<0.01). While highly 201 significant and significant difference were present between
      m-GCC level of the Vit E Group and m-GCC levels of AOF and Control Groups, respectively,
      (p<0.01, p<0.05), m-GCC level of the Group GB was significantly higher than that of Group AOF
      (p<0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed between m-GCC levels of other
      groups (p>0.05).
