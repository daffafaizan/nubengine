      Study I aims to translate and cultural adapt the MISA into Danish occupational therapy
      terminology, to secure equivalency between the original and the translated version, and to
      test its interrater- and intrarater reliability as well as internal consistency.

      Study II aims to investigate the convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive
      validity and the responsiveness of the MISA.

      Study III aims to test the criterion-related validity and the diagnostic accuracy of the MISA
      using the Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) and the Assessment of Motor and
      Process Skills (AMPS) as gold standards; and to compare the diagnostic accuracy for
      aspiration of the MISA compared to the Water Swallow Test, when using the FEES as the gold
      standard.

      Study IV aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of dysphagia in elderly
      medical patients, and to identify its potential associations between comorbidity, disability,
      frailty, length of hospital stay, place of discharge and number of readmissions.
