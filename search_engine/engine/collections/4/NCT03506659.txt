      small-caliber nerve fibers

      Background:

      Sudoscan is a tool developed to evaluate and screen peripheral neuropathies in diabetes. His
      indication has been extended to other neuropathies such as post-chemotherapy, Fabry's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

      Main objective: Evaluation of the relevance of cutaneous electrochemical conductance in
      chronic peripheral neuropathies.

      Methodology :

      Recruitment of 2 groups of 2000 patients Group 1: Patients with chronic neuropathy, during
      clinic bread consultation Group 2: Patients to benefit from scheduled surgery seen during
      anesthesia consultation For both groups filling the central awareness inventory questionnaire

      Analysis of the results after the recruitment has been completed.
