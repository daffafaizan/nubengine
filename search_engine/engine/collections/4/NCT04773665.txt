    
      Phase 1:

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg
      of S protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults of 18-54 years of age.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg of S
      protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults 18-54 years of age.

        -  Group G1 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Day
           1 and placebo at Day 28.

        -  Group G2 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Days
           1 and 28.

        -  Group G3 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28.

      An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data through Study Day
      7, 35 and 56. Enrollment in the Phase 2 will commence once the DSMB confirms that safety data
      through Study Day 56 is acceptable and that stopping rules were not met.

      Phase 2:

      The two co-primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of one- and
      two-dose regimens at two dose levels (5 μg and 10 μg of S protein) of VBI-2902a as compared
      to placebo in healthy adults stratified by age group (18-54, 55-65 and >65 years). The
      optimal dose level and regimen will be selected based on the safety and immunogenicity data
      from Phase 1 and Phase 2, Part 2.1 of the study.

      Phase 2, Part 2.1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a
      one-dose or two-dose regimen of VBI-2902a at the high dose level (10 μg of S protein) in
      healthy adults aged 18 to 54 years and at low and high dose levels (5 and 10 μg of S protein)
      in healthy adults age 55 to 65 years.

      Enrollment will be initiated in a staggered fashion with DSMB confirmation that safety is
      acceptable and that stopping rules were not met before the participants in the higher dose
      and higher age groups start enrollment.

      The lower age cohort will include 60 healthy adults 18 to 54 years randomized at a 2:1 ratio
      to VBI-2902a or placebo:

        -  Group G4 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 10 μg of S protein at Day
           1 and placebo at Day 28

        -  Group G5 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 10 μg of S protein at
           Days 1 and 28.

        -  Group G6 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28.

      The higher age cohort will include 60 healthy adults 55 to 65 years randomized at a 2:1 ratio
      to VBI-2902a or placebo:

        -  Group G7 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Days
           1 and 28.

        -  Group G8 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 10 μg of S protein at
           Days 1 and 28.

        -  Group G9 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28.

      Phase 2, Part 2.2 Based on the pre-specified criteria for primary and secondary safety and
      immunogenicity endpoints, the optimal dose and regimen of VBI-2902a will be selected to be
      tested in Phase 2, Part 2.2. In Part 2.2, a two-dose regimen of VBI-2902a at the selected
      dose level (5 or 10 μg of spike protein) will be evaluated in 600 healthy adults, including
      200 participants in each of the three age cohorts 18-54, 55-65 and >65 years. Within each age
      cohort, participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to VBI-2902a or placebo:

        -  Group G10 - 100 participants age 18-54 years will receive the selected dose of VBI-2902a
           at Days 1 and 28

        -  Group G11 - 100 participants age 55-65 years will receive the selected dose of VBI-2902a
           at Days 1 and 28

        -  Group G12 - 100 participants age >65 years will receive the selected dose of VBI-2902a
           at Days 1 and 28

        -  Group G13 - 100 participants age 18-54 years will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28

        -  Group G14 - 100 participants age 55-65 years will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28

        -  Group G15 - 100 participants age >65 years will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28

      Enrollment in the oldest age (>65 years) groups (G12, G15) will be paused after the first 20
      participants are randomized. The DSMB will perform early review of post-vaccination safety
      data before continuation of randomization.
