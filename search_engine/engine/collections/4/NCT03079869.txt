      Title: Transition to Ferric Citrate among Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A
      Phase 4 "Real World" Experience Study from Kaiser Permanente Southern California

      Short Title: FeCitrate

      Protocol Number: KP FeCitrate

      Study Phase: 4

      Study Site(s): Los Angeles Kaiser Sunset Medical Center

      Number of Subjects: 55

      Study Arms: 1

      Indication: Hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease

      Primary Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of ferric citrate for control of serum phosphorus
      levels and maintenance of adequate iron stores among dialysis-dependent patients before and
      after conversion from traditional phosphate binders in a "real world" environment

      Overview of Study Design: Prospective non-randomized cohort study of 6-9 months duration
      (active study period 6 months).

      Investigational Product Administration: One to two tablets of Ferric Citrate phosphorus
      binder administered by mouth before every meal to prevent dietary phosphorus absorption.

      Study Endpoint: Mean serum phosphorus levels and rate of successful phosphorus control
      (<5.5mg/dl) 6 months before and after treatment with ferric citrate

      Statistical Methods: Not powered to detect statistical significance
