    
      Overweight premenopausal Black and White women are randomized to either diet-only,
      diet+aerobic or diet+resistance exercise training. Diet/behavior intervention, with or
      without the aerobic or resistance exercise training, will be provided throughout the 18
      months of study. Major outcomes will include measures of perceived and physiologic difficulty
      of exercise (cardiac, ventilatory, electromyographic responses to standardized exercise
      tasks); aerobic fitness; strength fitness; and spontaneous free-living energy expenditure
      (all derived from doubly labeled water). The results will provide insight into the
      effectiveness of, and the mechanisms by which, different types of exercise training can
      improve physical fitness, spontaneous engagement in physical activities of daily living and,
      in turn, weight-loss maintenance.

      Time of initial weight loss was defined as the time needed to reach the goal of 25 kg/m2 BMI.
      The women will then be evaluated one year after this time and the amount of weight gain will
      be determined.
