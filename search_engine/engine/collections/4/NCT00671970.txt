    
      Exploratory, Phase II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial regimen
      consisting of erlotinib + bevacizumab among pts w recurrent malignant glioma. Signal
      transduction inhibitors, such as erlotinib, as well as anti-angiogenic agents, such as
      bevacizumab, are expected to exert a cytostatic anti-tumor effect. Primary endpoint of study
      is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. An important secondary objective is
      to further assess the safety of erlotinib + bevacizumab for pts w RMG. Pharmacokinetic
      studies included in protocol will evaluate impact of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs
      (EIAEDs) on metabolism of erlotinib.

      If study demonstrates that combo regimen of erlotinib + bevacizumab is associated w
      encouraging anti-tumor activity among pts w recurrent malignant glioma (RMG), further
      assessment of regimen in additional ph II & possibly ph III studies, will be considered.
