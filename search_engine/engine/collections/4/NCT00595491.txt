      thought to be responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways (Makay
      2001). While the chemokine receptor-ligand systems responsible for immune cell homing to the
      mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract have been clarified, those responsible for
      allergic airway inflammation remain unknown. This work is designed to identify airway factors
      that are responsible for recruiting cells and associate their airway presence with atopy and
      asthma.
