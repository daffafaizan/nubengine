      individuals. This study addresses an important public health issue by assessing an
      intervention that may lead to a more effective application for the treatment of at-risk HIV+
      smokers. The 1-year formative phase of the study will develop an integrated treatment for
      quitting smoking for anxiety-vulnerable HIV+ smokers. The proposed treatment will include
      cognitive-behavioral talk therapy for quitting smoking, a nicotine patch, and
      cognitive-behavioral talk therapy for anxiety. The pilot of the proposed treatment will be
      conducted with a small group of individuals (N = up to 12). This phase will be used to
      establish feasibility of treatment delivery, and participant acceptability before conducting
      a pilot randomized trial of the treatment. Additionally, this phase will monitor smoking
      cessation history through Point Prevalence Abstinence (PPA), as well as anxiety symptoms
      through the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) at the baseline and follow-up assessments. This
      study represents an important step in treating nicotine dependence in HIV-positive
      individuals. This study addresses an important public health issue by assessing an
      intervention that may lead to a more effective application for the treatment of at-risk HIV+
      smokers. The pilot RCT phase of the study (years 2 and 3), will test the developed
      cognitive-behavioral intervention in a pilot randomized-controlled trial format. The outcomes
      for this trial will be to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and
      the potential for an effect on increasing point prevalence abstinence and deceasing
      psychological distress.
