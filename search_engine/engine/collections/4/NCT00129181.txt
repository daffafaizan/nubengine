      on striatal DATscan uptake in early Parkinson's disease. Approximately 120 Parkinson's
      disease subjects will be randomized to receive either carbidopa/levodopa, cabergoline or no
      treatment during a twelve week period. Subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan at
      screening and after 12 weeks. After twelve weeks carbidopa/levodopa and cabergoline treatment
      will be withdrawn and all subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan after 8 weeks (20
      weeks after baseline).
