      carbohydrate-restricted diet (<20 g/day), a serial assessments of liver fat during two week
      diet will be performed. Also, markers of lipid and insulin metabolism, liver function test
      and changes in gut microbiota during rapid metabolic improvement will be assessed.

      The overall aim is to exploit this unique set of human material to determine the specific
      cellular and molecular pathways that are modified in the early stages of metabolic
      improvement and fatty liver regression.
