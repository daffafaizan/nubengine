    
      Ten mg/kg of lidocaine will be infused subcutaneously via a Baxter infusor over a 5.5 hour
      period in ambulatory adult cancer patients with a worst pain score of at least 4 out of 10
      despite therapy with at least one opioid plus appropriate oral adjuvant analgesic(s).

      A clinically useful reduction in pain is defined by either a 2-point reduction (on a 0-10
      scale) in the worst pain experienced over a 24-hour period, or a â‰¥30% reduction in 24-hour
      opioid requirement.

      The secondary objectives are 1) to determine whether any significant toxicities occur as a
      result of the infusion. For this study significant toxicity is considered as any adverse
      event which either leads to the infusion being terminated, or which leads to medical
      intervention, such as prescribing of another medication or equivalent treatment, 2) to
      determine the effect of Lidocaine infusion on QOL parameters as measured by the Patient
      Outcome Scale (POS) Questionnaire and 3) to determine the duration of response to lidocaine
      infusion.

      Subjects will fill out Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Patient Outcome Scale (POS) periodically
      and medication logs daily while on study.

      On Days of treatment the subjects will have vital sign monitoring every 15 minutes for the
      1st hour and then periodically as set out in the protocol.
