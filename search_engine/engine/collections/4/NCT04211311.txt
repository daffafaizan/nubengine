      cord injury. Physical activity at high intensity is known to reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease in other patient groups.

      During aerobic training, combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with voluntary
      arm-work induces a higher oxygen uptake than FES cycling alone and high intensity interval
      training induces higher oxygen uptake than training at continuous intensity. The hypothesis
      is that combining hybrid training with high-intensity induces even higher oxygen uptake
      thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This training modality has not been
      tested before, so before conducting a randomized controlled trial testing the effect of this
      training modality on oxygen uptake, the aim was to asses safety and feasibility of this
      protocol.
