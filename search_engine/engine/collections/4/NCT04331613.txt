      also named M cells, differentiated from clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
      will be expanded, harvested, and formulated at a concentration of 50 x 10^6 cells/mL. CAStem
      will be cryopreserved and transported to clinical site using liquid nitrogen vapor shipping
      vessels (< -150ÂºC). Prior to injection, CAStem will be thawed to liquefy quickly, and then
      reconstituted in normal saline.In the present study, the intravenous infusion dose of CAStem
      will be 3, 5 or 10 million cells/kg.
