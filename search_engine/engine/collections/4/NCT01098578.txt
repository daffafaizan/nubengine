      numerous other acute bleeding conditions throughout the body. The investigators hypothesize
      that Floseal is an effective treatment for posterior epistaxis. If so, then this will also
      lead to significant cost savings in comparison to any other method of treatment of posterior
      epistaxis. The investigators have planned a prospective, nonblinded, nonrandomised study with
      a total of 40 subjects with posterior epistaxis to be included in this study.
