      de-identified, unique identification (ID) numbers. Randomization of these IDs to either low
      or high dose TXA will occur via a computer generated random assignment. Given the variations
      that may exist in surgical technique (e.g. performance of osteotomies), stratified
      randomization will be performed by attending surgeon. Based upon the randomization, the
      pharmacy will prepare TXA for one of two intravenous dosing protocols:

        1. Low Dose (Standard of Care/Control): Loading Dose 10mg/kg given over 15 minutes,
           followed by 1mg/kg/hr via continuous infusion

        2. High Dose (Study Group): Loading Dose 50mg/kg given over 15 minutes, followed by
           5mg/kg/hr via continuous infusion.

      The surgeon, anesthesia team, and operating room staff will be blind to the concentration of
      TXA in the medications received. Treatments may be "unblinded" at the discretion of the
      surgeon and anesthesiologist, in cases of extreme blood loss. If additional
      anti-fibrinolytics are given, the change in dose will be recorded.

      Post-operative care will be the same as any other patient and data collection will be
      information contained in the patient's medical record that is part of routine, standard of
      care.
