      I. Determine if a suitable fraction of patients become NA-NOSE negative within three years
      post treatment. We will test the hypothesis that this fraction is at most 30% versus the
      alternative that it is at least 50%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if patients who become NA-NOSE negative post treatment then become NA-NOSE
      positive prior to clinical recurrence.

      II. Estimate the time post treatment needed to become NA-NOSE negative. III. Estimate the
      lead time gained between a negative to positive NA-NOSE transition and clinical recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo breath sample collection for the NA-NOSE breath test at baseline (2
      pre-treatment samples), and post treatment samples at regularly scheduled follow up visits,
      for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.
