      and dementia, being considered a public health problem especially due to the increase of
      elder population in Brazil and in the World in general. Yet the conclusions of studies on
      pharmacological treatments for this population are still controversial, making imperative to
      invest on new efficient therapies such as non pharmacological interventions aimed at memory
      improvement.

      One training mode that has benefited elders is the association between names and faces, which
      has a compelling clinical relevance considering that one of the main complains among elders
      is the difficulty in remembering names. However, the exact effects of this kind of training
      in elders (i.e. the eventual changes in cognition and in brain activation on Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) are still unclear.

      Therefore, this study aims to verify the effects of memory training (name-face association)
      compared with control intervention - psychoeducation, in 30 elders with amnestic MCI. We will
      request the participants with amnestic MCI to submit to a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in order
      to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Training and psychoeducation will be conducted in 4
      sessions (two per week). To assess the effects, we will use cognitive instruments and MRI
      exams before and after the intervention. Also, one and three months after the conclusion of
      the training patients will again be submitted to cognitive tests.
