      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The treatment option included
      tapering or stop of immunosuppression and or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which may
      restore a full donor chimerism but subsequent GVHD is the major complications. In this single
      arm prospective study, the investigator plan to evaluate the effect and safety of low-dose
      decitabine treatment alone in patients with decreased donor chimerism after allo-HSCT. The
      investigators expect an overall response rate of 80% without serious toxicity such as grade
      III-IV aGVHD, ext cGVHD and lethal infection event associated with low-dose decitabine
      (LD-DAC) treatment. In case of donor chimerism decreasing, 5-day low-dose decitabine (5mg/m2)
      will given every 6 to 8 weeks until full donor chimerism is achieved (>98%). Fast withdraw of
      immuno-suppression or stop of immunosupression is not carried out in the study.
