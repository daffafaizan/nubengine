      comprehensive analysis of family history and CTEPH risk factors in these patients, and in
      controls with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
      Detailed family history interviews will be performed with all patients, and all enrolled
      patients will provide a blood sample for thrombophilia testing and for gene sequencing with
      the goal of identifying novel genetic variants that contribute to CTEPH risk.
