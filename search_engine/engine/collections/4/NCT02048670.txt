    
      Ten consecutive subjects, ages 25-70 years, diagnosed with Chronic Subjective Dizziness (CDS)
      and ten healthy age and gender matched subjects will be asked to perform tests involving
      walking and balance while wearing the BalanceBelt. The BalanceBelt is a lightweight belt that
      will be worn under the clothes around the subjects waist and uses sensitive motion detectors
      and vibrates against the skin at four locations to provide information about posture and
      motion.
