      clavicle fracture treated with to different techniques.

      the first technique was placing a 3.5mm reconstruction plate in the superior side of the
      clavicle and the second one placing the same 3.5mm reconstruction plate in the anteroinferior
      side of the clavicle.

      the patients had the same rehabilitation program and evaluated with Disabilities Arm Shoulder
      and Hand functional outcome score and Visual Analogue Score for pain at 30, 60, 90 and 365
      days after surgery.

      biomechanical studies have demonstrated more stable construct using an anteroinferior plate
      in clavicle fractures and we were trying to find out if it has a clinical relevance in
      patients with midshaft clavicle fractures.
