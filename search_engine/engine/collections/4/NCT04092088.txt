      Rehabilitation outpatient clinic in Suez Canal University Hospital, Ismailia, EGYPT, (2)
      Hiroshima University, (3) Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Juan Ramón
      Jiménez University Hospital, Huelva, Spain, and (4) University of Sherbrooke, Canada and
      diagnosed with CTS according to clinical examination and to the American Association of
      Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) practice recommendations for CTS.

      Study subjects will be divided into four groups:

      Group (1): (active comparator = tDCS-real (r) + TENS-r) will include 45 patients with CTS and
      will receive active anodal tDCS of M1 for 20 minutes, at 2 mA plus active TENS (the cathode
      will be placed on the carpal ligament, and the anode electrodes on the palmar area of the
      hand) for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week) will be completed.

      Group (2): (experimental group= tDCS-r + TENS-sham (s)) will include 45 patients with CTS and
      will receive active tDCS M1 for 20 minutes plus sham TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15
      sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      Group (3): (experimental group= tDCS-s + TENS-r) will include 45 patients with CTS and will
      receive sham tDCS M1 for 20 minutes (the set will be turned off after 30 seconds) plus active
      TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      Group (4): (sham comparator = tDCS-s + TENS-s) will include 45 patients with CTS and will
      receive sham tDCS M1 for 20 minutes (the set will be turned off after 30 seconds) plus sham
      TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      The study sample will be collected from all patients with CTS fulfilling the eligibility
      criteria, will be eligible to join the study (either referred for electrophysiological study
      or presented to the clinic for primary assessment). To make sure that no bias should enter
      the assessment of the results, neither the patient nor the clinicians will be aware whether
      active tDCS/TENS will be applied to a particular case. To ensure this result, one symbol of
      these four symbols (square, circle, star and triangle) will be applied to one group of the
      four groups in the physiotherapy sheet and only the physiotherapist knew the key for each
      symbol. At the end of the study, the four groups will be revealed in order to analyze the
      results according to proper statistical measures.
