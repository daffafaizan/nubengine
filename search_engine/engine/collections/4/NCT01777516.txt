    
      This is a in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and
      its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) and their effects on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic
      acid. The study consist of two parts of in-vitro study as follows;

        -  Part 1 : in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor
           and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of adenosine
           diphosphate(ADP) will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma and
           randomized paired concentrations of ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX.

        -  Part 2 : in vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor
           and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of arachidonic
           acid will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma plus randomized paired
           concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX and the invitro mixtures with blank plasma
           and ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX + salicylic acid.
