      groups, 40 were in DHEA group and 38 were in control group. The DHEA group received DHEA (Lab
      Herculesâ„¢) 25mg three times a day continuing more than 12 weeks prior to the start of IVF
      treatment till the day of egg collection and the control group got without any DHEA
      treatment. All of the IVF women patients were given CC(clomifene citrate)+HMG(human
      menopausal gonadotropin) protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Hormonal profile
      including E2(estradiol),FSH(follicle-stimulating hormone) ,P(progesterone) ,LH (luteinizing
      hormone),T(testosterone),AFC(antral follicle account),serum and follicle AMH(anti-Mullerian
      hormone)levels will be repeated in follicular phase (D2 or 3) of cycle followed by an IVF
      treatment using CC+HMG protocol based on our standard departmental regimen. Improvement of
      ovarian reserve markers would be assessed by the change in serum and follicle AMH levels.
      Cycle characteristics including the dose of gonadotrophins use, duration of stimulation,
      number of oocytes obtained, number of fertilized embryos and good quality embryos will be
      recorded and follicular fluid will be saved for the test of DHEA-S(Dehydroepiandrosterone
      sulfate) and IGF-I. BMP-15 and GDF-9 expression in the follicular fluid were detected with
      western blot.
