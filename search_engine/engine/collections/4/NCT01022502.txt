      improves psoriatic symptoms. However, patient compliance is hindered because the preparation
      is unsightly and stains clothing.

      To improve patient compliance, we have developed a refined formulation in which closer to
      natural skin tones and less prone to stain clothing. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of this refined form of oil extract ointment and compared the results with those
      of the original crude form of indigo naturalis ointment in treating psoriasis.
