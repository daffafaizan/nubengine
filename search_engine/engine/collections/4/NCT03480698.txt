      deficits

      All patients receive acute stroke care according to local treatment standards, not amended or
      influenced by the study:

      Cerebrolysin Group:

      Patients who are treated with Cerebrolysin; dosage, frequency and duration follows local
      clinical practice in accordance with terms of the local marketing authorization

      Control group:

      Patients who are not treated with Cerebrolysin

      Observation criteria:

        -  Signed Informed Consent

        -  Clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke confirmed by imaging

        -  Moderate to severe neurological deficits with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 8 to 15, both
           inclusive

        -  No prior stroke

        -  No prior disability

        -  Patient's independence prior to stroke onset (pre-morbid mRS of 0 or 1)

        -  Reasonable expectation of successful follow-up (max. 100 days)

      The study follows the recommendations of the Principles for Good Research on Comparative
      Effectiveness (GRACE).

      In order to comply with recent calls for high-quality non-interventional comparative
      effectiveness research, a risk-based centralized statistical approach to monitoring is
      introduced in combination with targeted on-site monitoring for ongoing surveillance of study
      conduct, thus ensuring highest standards of data quality and integrity according to the most
      recent requirements of the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP, Amendment R2,
      July 2015), the FDA Guidance for Industry on a Risk-based Approach to Monitoring, and the EMA
      reflection-paper on risk-based quality management in clinical trials.
