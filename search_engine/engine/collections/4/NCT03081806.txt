    
      The study comprises a 14-day Screening Period, a 22-week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a
      30-week Open-label Treatment Period, with an additional 4-week Follow-up Visit.

      During the Screening Period, eligibility will be assessed, including radiographic evaluation
      of the target knee joint space. All subjects who provide informed consent and who meet
      preliminary eligibility criteria will be treated with placebo spray in a subject blind manner
      for 14Â±3 days from Screening Visit to the Day 1 Visit. Subjects with a placebo response
      exceeding 25% improvement in the averaged Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index
      [WOMAC] pain subscale score from Screening Visit to Day 1 will be excluded; those who do not
      have this magnitude of placebo response and have Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2, or 3 on
      radiograph of their target knee per the central radiologist will be eligible for
      randomization into the Double-blind Treatment Period. These eligible subjects will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 active treatment groups (A or B) with a 1:1 ratio
      of active:placebo within each treatment group (i.e., 1 subject to active treatment and 1
      subject to placebo), and stratified based on K-L Grade 2, or 3 and bilateral or unilateral
      knee OA.

      The WOMAC version 3.1 using the NRS will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy
      endpoints. Efficacy endpoints will be assessed at the Screening Visit and at Baseline (Day
      1), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 22, 32, 42, and 52.

      Safety assessments will include assessment of AEs, vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory
      rate, pulse rate, and oral temperature), clinical laboratory tests, physical examination,
      skin irritation, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). In addition, site telephone calls to the
      subject will happen on a routine basis for assessment of AEs between visits.
