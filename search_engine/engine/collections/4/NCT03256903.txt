    
      Open, randomized clinical trial to compare emergency pain relief between methoxyflurane and
      standard of care in patients with trauma and associated pain, treated in Spanish emergency
      units.

      Methoxyflurane is a fluorinated ethyl methyl ether, with the chemical name
      2:2-dichloro-1:1-difluoroethyl methyl ether. It belongs to the fluorinated hydrocarbon group
      of volatile anaesthetics. It is inhaled as a vapour at low (sub-anaesthetic) concentrations
      to achieve an analgesic effect for the management of pain.

      In Europe countries, where methoxyflurane is already marketed, it is indicated for emergency
      relief of moderate to severe pain in conscious adult patients with trauma and associated
      pain.

      On the other hand, current clinical practice includes a variety of analgesic agents, with the
      choice of which to employ based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors of each class of
      drug, as well as the type of pain, its severity, and the risk of adverse effects.

      The main objective of this study is to assess Methoxyflurane's significant advantage in terms
      of anaglesic effectiveness, as it is known as a rapidly acting, non-narcotic analgesic for
      the treatment of emergency pain.
