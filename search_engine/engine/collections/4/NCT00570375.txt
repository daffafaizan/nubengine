      dyslastic morphological features and tendency to progress to acute myeloid leukemia. It is
      estimated that MDS is the most common hematological malignancy in the USA. Several treatment
      options are available for MDS ranging from supportive care, growth factor use, chemotherapy,
      stem cell transplantation, and newer novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
      hypomethylating agents. Each of the different available treatments for MDS work in certain
      subset and relatively small percentage of patients, keeping the door open for novel
      therapeutic strategies to be explored. The NIH has published requests for applications on
      myeloproliferative and myelopdysplastic syndrome emphasizing the need for more research in
      this area.
