      treating even late stage cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) positive B cell
      malignancies. But it has not yet been fully explored in solid tumors. The carcino-embryonic
      antigen(CEA) is widely expressed in cancers like gastric cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. To confirm if CAR T cells still function in
      solid tumors, we have developed anti-CEA CAR-modified T cells. Preclinical studies have
      demonstrated effective killing of CEA target cells. In this study, the CEA CARs, will be
      evaluated in CEA positive gastric cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and
      colorectal cancer patients. The primary goal is to confirm its adverse effects including
      cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting and
      disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
