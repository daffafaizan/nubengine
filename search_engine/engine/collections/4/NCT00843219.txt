      breathing can reduce the image quality of the scan. Minimizing the effects of this motion by
      taking the images and processing the scans differently may improve the image quality.

      The PET/CT Scan:

      If you agree to take part in this study, an elastic belt will be placed around your lower
      chest/upper abdomen before your routine PET/CT scan. This belt is used to track your
      breathing motion. This information will be used to help process the scan.

      Your PET/CT scan will be performed as usual. During the scan, researchers will focus on your
      lower chest/upper abdomen (areas that experience breathing motion). Having to focus on this
      area might extend the scan by up to 10 minutes.

      The additional scan time will not increase your radiation exposure since only PET scanning
      will be performed.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be complete when your scheduled PET/CT scan is
      complete.

      This is an investigational study. The imaging focused on your lower chest/upper abdomen
      during the scan is investigational.

      Up to 26 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
