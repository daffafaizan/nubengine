      is difficult to diagnose asthma as pulmonary function tests can not be performed reliably
      before the age six .

      Wheezing is one of the main symptoms of asthma. Young children with multiple trigger wheeze
      as activities ,laughing and crying are more likely to have asthma compared with episodic
      (viral) wheeze.

      The mainstay of asthma control is daily administration of inhaled corticosteroids, long
      acting beta2 agonists and avoid exposure of asthma triggers as seasonal allergens and
      environmental pollution particularly tobacco smoke exposure.

      Recent studies have found asthma to be associated with overlapping comorbidities including
      gastroesophageal reflux,obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.This studies have introduced
      therapeutic strategies aimed at improving asthma control by management of these coexisting
      conditions.

      Pathophysiological feature of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is presence of increased
      airway inflammation promoting of hypertrophy of upper airway adenotonsillar tissues .

      The latter promotes increased pharyngeal resistance thus predispose the upper airway to
      episodically collapse and cause fragmented sleep that characterize obstructive sleep apnea.

      Surgically adenotonsillectomy is the first line of therapy in childhood obstructive sleep
      apnea and has favorable outcomes ,including improvements of respiratory sleep disturbances
      and in reducing markers of asthma and reduction in the use of asthma therapies.
