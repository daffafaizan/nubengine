      multiple skin locations of humans at multiple time points. The subjects' samples will be
      analyzed using DNA methods in order to identify the types of microbes present on the swabs.
      Other substances such as proteins, RNA, and other metabolites may also be analyzed. DNA or
      other molecular components of the sample will be extracted. Alternately, microbes in the
      sample can be cultured directly. The samples will be explored using molecular analyses. The
      backbone of the analyses will be shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rDNA amplicon
      sequencing. The results of these analyses will be used to identify and describe the
      microbiome of the skin.
