      assign them into intervention and control group. Patients were randomly contacted through the
      epidemiological database of patients with Parkinson' disease of South-Estonia. 44
      participants agreed to come to the baseline assessment including:

        -  Timed-Up-And-Go Test Battery

        -  Four square step test

        -  Physical performance test

        -  Short Physical Performance

        -  10-m walk test

        -  Grooved Purdue Pegboard test

        -  Assessment of range of motion In addition, current disease status was assessed using
           Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Mini Mental Sate Examination. Further, quality
           of life was assessed using PDQ-39, hand-writing was recorded using white, squared and
           striped paper and freezing of gait questionaire (FOG-Q) was administered. Within a week
           from baseline assessment participants randomly assigned to intervention group, started
           physiotherapy intervention. The intervention was carried out in small groups (3 people
           in a group) and was carried out as out-patient physiotherapy during 8 week period.
           During each week 2 sessions with a length of an hour were scheduled. Within a week of
           the last therapy session, second assessment was conducted (for control group the second
           assessment was carried out ten weeks post-baseline assessment.

      Third assessment was assigned one year after (then the same assessment was performed, in
      addition body composition was analysed using DXA), forth assessment an other year later.

      During forth assessment 15 members starting in the intervention group and 10 starting in the
      control group participated.
