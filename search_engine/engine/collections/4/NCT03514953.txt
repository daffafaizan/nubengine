      normal bodily functioning by regulating metabolic and endocrine function. Disturbed sleep,
      defined as any alteration to normal sleep patterns, is highly prevalent, affecting 35% and
      41% of the general population in the United States and has been linked to poor cardiovascular
      health, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Young adults are a population at
      high risk for disturbed sleep-related health outcomes due to negative lifestyle behaviors
      such as alcohol consumption, drug use, study patterns, and excessive screen time that remain
      with advancing age. Due to the importance of improving or maintaining health outcomes through
      adequate sleep quality (SQ), the proposed research will examine the role of physical activity
      (PA) on altering SQ while systematically examining novel mechanisms that may drive changes in
      SQ. Specifically, this study will examine how alterations (increases and decreases) in PA
      impact SQ and how these alterations modify inflammation, oxidative stress, and sympathetic
      stimulation in young adults.
