      Störungen in der hausärztlichen Praxis"-"comprehensive quality management for alcohol-related
      disorders in primary care") systematically investigated three issues: (1) the outpatient care
      system and evidence-base for screening, diagnosis and treatment was examined; it developed
      (2) a comprehensive quality management system (CQM) consisting of documentation material, a
      pathway of care and evidence-based practice guidelines; (3) the effects of the CQM on the
      detection and treatment of alcohol-related disorders were investigated in a randomized
      controlled pre-post design and the results show positive effects of the CQM. In the second
      funding phase (a 3 year bi-center project) the purpose is now to disseminate and transfer the
      CQM into routine care. The two steps are (1) to optimize the CQM approach and (2) to
      investigate the dissemination and transfer into routine care in a randomized trial. (1) The
      paper-based AQAH-practice guidelines are transformed into an interactive electronic version
      with online patient documentation and evaluation, decision support measures as well as links
      to specialists and an e-learning tool. (2) After pilot testing in the AQAH-study-networks, an
      active transfer to the greater regions of Südbaden and Südwürttemberg will be performed in a
      parallel group cluster randomized controlled trial with GP practices as unit of
      randomization. Outcome data will be collected concerning the acceptance of the system and the
      quality of care delivered.

      Comparison(s): (1) Use of the interactive electronic version of the CQM for alcohol-related
      disorders with a special training for general practitioners, compared to (2) use of the CQM
      with additional education for the whole practice team and organizational re-structuring
      advice, compared to (3) a control group who uses the CMQ without any special training.
