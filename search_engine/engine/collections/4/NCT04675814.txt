      fatigue, quality of life and kinesiophobia in patients treated at the ICO in Angers,
      regardless of the type of cancer and the type of treatment.

      A 12-week Adapted Physical Activity program (APA) is proposed to patients included in the
      study with an assessment of fatigue, quality of life, level of physical activity and
      kinesiophobia (fear of movement) at the beginning of the study.

      A second assessment of fatigue and quality of life will be done during the 6-week management.

      At the end of the program, a final evaluation of fatigue, quality of life and kinesiophobia
      will be done.
