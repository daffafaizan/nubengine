      specific germline and somatic mutations and alternative driver growth signaling pathways in
      patients with metastatic disease. Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA-P) is an
      established standard of care for the treatment of participants with mCSPC and is included in
      widely accepted clinical treatment guidelines. Niraparib is an investigational agent in the
      castration-sensitive cancer population and has been approved for the treatment of ovarian
      cancer. The addition of niraparib to the AA-P backbone regimen may improve initial disease
      control and long-term outcomes compared with AA-P alone in a biomarker selected population.
      The study will consist of 4 phases; a Prescreening Phase for biomarker evaluation for
      eligibility only, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. Efficacy
      evaluations include the following: tumor measurements by computed tomography (CT), magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI; abdomen, chest, and pelvis), Technetium-99m (99mTc) bone scans, serum
      prostate sensitive antigen (PSA) evaluations, and patient reported outcomes (PROs). Safety
      evaluations include incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory parameters.
