      efficacy of rhLH (Luveris) administered subcutaneously in follicular development during
      ovulation induction in Chinese female subjects with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study
      was organized on an outpatient basis involving a single cycle of treatment. Prior to entry
      into the study, the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed by history, by
      the presence or absence of specific clinical features and by measuring serum gonadotropin
      levels. Once a subject has signed the informed consent form and after satisfying all
      eligibility criteria, the subject received a combination of daily injection of recombinant
      human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH) 150 international units (IU) plus rhLH 75 IU.
      After adequate follicular response, ovulation induction was triggered by an injection of
      10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Luteal phase function was assessed by serum
      progesterone level determination.
