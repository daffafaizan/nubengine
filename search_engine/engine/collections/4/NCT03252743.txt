      adolescents and associated with impaired quality of life. Our research group have previously
      in a series of efficacy-studies shown that internet-delivered exposure-based CBT leads to
      reduced symptoms and increased quality of life in children and adolescents with P-FGIDs.
      There is therefore reason to investigate how the treatment should be disseminated in regular
      care. This open trial aim to evaluate feasibility and preliminary treatment effects in
      regular care of the internet-delivered CBT-program for children and adolescents with P-FGIDs.

      Method: Open trial with a pretest-posttest-design and no control group. The
      internet-delivered CBT-program is 10 week long and include weekly therapist support,
      consisting of online messages and telephone calls. Assessment points are baseline, weekly
      during treatment, post-treatment and follow-up at 3 months and 6 months after treatment
      completion.

      Analysis: Effect sizes and within-group differences will be calculated in an intent-to-treat
      analysis using Cohens' d and Student's t-test.
