      can regulate autonomic nervous function and promote relaxation. However, the mechanism for
      better immunity and sleep quality is not clear. We postulate that alternative nostril
      breathing might benefit nurses after undergoing shift work. The benefits could be due to
      improvement of autonomic nervous function, sleep quality, and even immune function.

      The study design will include a randomization of two groups, with a control group and one
      experimental groups for 3 months (12 weeks). The control group will do normal breathing. The
      experimental groups will do alternative nostril breathing twice a week (20 minutes/time) for
      3 months.

      The study primary endpoints are 1) to improve autonomic nervous function, 2) to improve sleep
      quality and 3) to enhance human immunity.

      We anticipate to reach the primary endpoints and publish the primary results in one year.
