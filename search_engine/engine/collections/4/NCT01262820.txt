      patients who have progressed on first-line therapy containing bevacizumab. Treatment should
      continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death.
      Patients who progress will be treated at the discretion of their physician. all patients who
      initiate treatment will be evaluated for disease control rate, which is the primary endpoint
      of this study.

      The primary objective is to estimate the disease control rate of pazopanib alone in patients
      with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC who progressed while on bevacizumab. Disease control
      rate id defined as complete (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) lasting
      greater than or equal to 12 weeks as defined by RECIST.

      Secondary Objectives To estimate the combined response rate (CR + PR) of pazopanib according
      to RECIST To estimate the progression free survival (defined as time of enrollment until
      disease progression or death) and overall survival (defined as time of enrollment until
      death) of patients treated with pazopanib.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib using the National Cancer Institute
      Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 To explore potential
      correlations between blood biomarkers and clinical response.

      Pazopanib is dosed continuously throughout the study. Cycle lengths are identified as 21 days
      for purposes of the calendar.

      The treatment dosage and administration for participating subjects will be, Pazopanib, 800 mg
      by mouth daily during a 21 day cycle until disease progression.
