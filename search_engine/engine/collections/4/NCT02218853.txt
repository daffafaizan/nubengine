      spectrum in an effort to observe features both (i) distinctive to and (ii) shared between
      DSM-type categorical diagnoses. Despite the broad range of extra-clinical phenotypes, we had
      limited success finding clinical SZ-BD diagnosis-specific features; instead, most phenotypes
      were distributed continuously across DSM diagnoses. To describe more biologically homogeneous
      groups, therefore, we combined all psychosis probands and implemented a multi-stage analysis
      procedure, beginning with identification of psychosis biomarkers (variables with the largest
      effect sizes for differentiating psychosis and healthy groups) including cognitive,
      electrophysiological, and oculo-motor measures ('classical' endophenotypes). We then
      estimated the number of subgroups that efficiently optimized variance among the biomarkers
      (n=3) and differentiated the individual psychosis cases into these subgroups. Subsequently,
      the subgroups were tested for biological uniqueness using meaningful external validators
      (structural and functional brain imaging, social functioning, and familial data). Given the
      neurobiological distinctiveness of these subgroups, we called them psychosis Biotypes. DSM
      diagnoses were distributed across all Biotypes. Compared to DSM diagnoses, Biotype membership
      enhanced group separations on biomarkers. These results indicate that groups of psychosis
      cases can be generated with homogeneous phenotypic characteristics independent of DSM
      diagnoses. The proposed study aims to further develop Biotype definitions and demonstrate
      that psychosis Biotypes constructed from a dense biomarker panel (i) are replicable, (ii)
      neurobiologically distinctive, and (iii) have unique genetic characteristics.
