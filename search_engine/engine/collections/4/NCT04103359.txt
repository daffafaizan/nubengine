      transfusion- induced increase in Hb have an impaired ability to utilize oxygen at the
      peripheral level. This could be the consequence of impairments in vascular function, mediated
      by endothelial dysfunction as a result of transfusion-induced iron-overload and oxidative
      stress associated with the disease. Taking the current gaps in knowledge pertaining to
      MDS-related fatigue into account, the objective of this study is to improve understanding on
      the aetiology fatigue in MDS patients. To achieve this aim, the study will measure a
      comprehensive group of patient-reported and disease-related outcomes: i) prior to blood
      transfusion therapy when Hb levels are low and; ii) following blood transfusion therapy, when
      Hb levels have been increased. Results from the post-transfusion tests will be analyzed to
      determine which participants remain fatigued despite an increase in Hb, and which
      participants shown an improvement in fatigue.
