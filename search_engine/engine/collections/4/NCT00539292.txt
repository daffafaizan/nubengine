      into the abdomen, when possible,and the abdominal wall defect being closed in the operating
      room. When complete reduction of the eviscerated contents is not possible, a silastic " silo"
      is sewn on the abdominal wall and its contents are gradually reduced into the abdomen over
      several days. Once reduction is obtained, the silo is removed and the abdominal defect is
      closed.

      Current methods of treatment are associated with significant morbidity, prolonged
      hospitalization, and high costs. Gastroschisis closure continues to be accompanied by a
      number of complications ranging from ileus, sepsis, TPN-related liver damage, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, respiratory insufficiency, and death. The optimal timing and method of
      closure, including primary versus secondary closure, continues to be debated. No prospective
      randomized studies to date have examined the routine use of the spring-loaded silo.
