      newborns, symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. Beginning in
      childhood, the person becomes constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2
      diabetes. Also, mild to moderate learning disability and behavioral problems are typical.

      Guanfacine Extended Release (GXR), the investigational drug in this study would be the first
      study to evaluate the drug in patients with Prader Willi Syndrome. "Investigational" means it
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Prader Willi Syndrome.
      However, Guanfacine Extended Released (GXR) is an FDA approved drug used to treat children
      and adolescents with hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). GXR is
      thought to respond to parts of the brain that lead to strengthening working memory, reducing
      distraction, improving attention and impulse control. GXR is generally considered safe for
      children as long as it is used according to the dosing instructions (up to 4mg) of a
      qualified medical professional.
