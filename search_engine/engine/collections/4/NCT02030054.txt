      effect of clopidogrel. The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of
      rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on platelet reactivity in patients with coronary artery disease
      undergone double antiplatelet therapy with new P2Y12 inhibitors. This is a single-center,
      prospective, randomized, crossover study conducted in the Department of Heart and Great
      Vessels "Attilio Reale", Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.
