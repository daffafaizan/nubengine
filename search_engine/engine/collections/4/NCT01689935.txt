    
      This is a pilot study to compare efficacy and side effects i-PDT and ALA-PDT. All subjects
      will receive ALA-PDT and i-PDT. Face or back regions will be divided into two sides, the
      right and left. One half of the face or back will receive ALA-PDT and the other half will
      receive i-PDT. For subjects with back acne, red light and blue light alone will be applied
      for comparison.

      Healthy subjects with difficult to treat moderate or severe acne on the face or back are
      eligible to enroll.

      The investigators will enroll about 35 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) with
      follow-ups 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.
