      mortality ranked first in malignant tumors whether for males or females. At present, VATS
      (Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) lobectomy is still the "gold standard" for the
      treatment of lung cancer. Triportal thoracoscopic lung resection is a routine surgically
      procedure for early stage lung cancer while uniportal thoracoscopic lung resection is
      developing rapidly in recent years. Retrospective study in recent years showed that the
      postoperative complication rate is similar between uniportal thoracoscopic surgery and
      triportal thoracoscopic surgery. Meanwhile, the incision is more pleasing, the inflammatory
      response may be milder and the hospitalization time may be shorter in the uniportal
      thoracoscopic surgery. But until now there is no result of the randomized controlled study on
      the effectiveness and the prognosis between uniportal thoracoscopic surgery and triportal
      thoracoscopic surgery to support this conclusion. The objective of this multicenter
      randomized controlled trial study is to compare the postoperative complications, long-term
      survival, local recurrence, other perioperative variables such as conversion rate, blood
      loss, lymph nodes retrieved and postoperative hospital stay between the triportal VATS
      pulmonary resection and uniportal VATS pulmonary resection on early stage lung cancer.
