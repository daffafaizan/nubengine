      cirrhosis. Compared with conventional endoscopic and pharmacological therapy, transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may further improve the outcomes of portal vein thrombosis
      in liver cirrhosis with variceal bleeding. However, the safety of transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt remains uncertain in patients with portal vein thrombosis.
