      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin-3
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at
      treating patients with CKD.

      This study will consist of a fixed dose of GCS-100 3mg IV push at least every 30 days for a
      total of 1 year with a follow-up 4 weeks after the last dose is administered.
