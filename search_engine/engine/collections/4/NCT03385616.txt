      frequency short duration energy to the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers. The
      energy is delivered via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.

      Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the
      first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session
      (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a
      respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a
      bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anaesthesia. It is
      anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.
      Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the
      two bronchoscopies.

      A third bronchoscopy will be performed three months following the second treatment session
      where treatment is not delivered but a cryo-biopsy will be taken from the airway sites that
      have been treated during the two previous bronchoscopic treatment session to evaluate the
      effect of the treatment on the airways producing excessive mucous.

      Subjects will be required to submit to several tests during the study including two CT scans
      (lung), respiratory function tests, exercise testing.
