      steroid combined with cyclophosphamide versus steroid combined with rituximab in patients
      with acquired haemophilia. The study will test the hypothesis that steroid combined with
      cyclophosphamide is more effective than steroid plus rituximab for FVIII inhibitor
      eradication in acquired haemophilia
