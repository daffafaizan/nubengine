      iron status on skeletal muscle metabolism and exercise physiology. 32 healthy volunteers will
      take part, half of whom will be iron-deficient. The study involves a screening visit and two
      half-day visits during which assessments are performed. 50% of each group will be randomised
      to receive iron-repletion with ferric carboxymaltose at the end of the first experimental
      visit before returning to repeat identical assessments around one week later. This approach
      will make it possible to explore whether baseline differences in skeletal muscle metabolism
      are explained by differences in iron status per se, whilst controlling for any learning
      effect during participation in the study.
