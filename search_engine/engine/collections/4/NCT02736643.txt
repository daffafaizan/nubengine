      of lung cancer may improve cancer survival. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was thought
      to be the best screening tool for lung cancer. However, there is growing concerns about
      radiation exposure, high cost, and high rate of false-positive screening result. Epidemiology
      data for LDCT screening in Taiwan is lacking.

      National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung Branch (NTUHCT) initiated the lung cancer
      screening by LDCT since June 2015. Many people can get the LDCT screening with affordable
      price with the subsidy from enterprise donation. The purpose of this study is establishing
      local epidemiological result via telephone follow-up and patients' medical records
      retrospectively.

      Aim: To establish the local epidemiological data for lung pathology, emphysema,
      bronchiectasis and other lung disease.

      Methods: Since June 2015, more than 6000 LDCT were done at the NTUHCT. Roughly 6 months after
      the test telephone follow-ups about patient satisfactions, self-awareness of CT results,
      medical consultations and other related behaviors, and willingness of coming back for another
      test were routinely done. Retrospective secondary data analysis will be performed on the
      telephone follow-up results to establish local epidemiology data on lung pathology as well as
      information on screening accuracy of LDCT. Customers are also queried about willingness to
      provide their medical records, and linkage to National Health Insurance Database with
      informed consents to provide more advanced information on their long-term outcomes.
