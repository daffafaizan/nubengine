      between 45-80 who are not up-to-date with screening guidelines) will be enrolled in the
      study. Stool samples returned to Geneoscopy's Laboratories by the participant will be
      subjected to the ColonoSight test system, and a result will be generated. The result will be
      compared to an optical colonoscopy to determine: 1) sensitivity for colorectal cancer,
      advanced adenomas, and other precancerous adenomas and 2) specificity for hyperplastic polyps
      and no findings on a colonoscopy. This study will be used for the clinical validation of the
      ColonoSight test.
