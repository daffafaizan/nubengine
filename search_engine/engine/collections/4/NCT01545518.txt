      Phase I: The investigators will screen for evidence of neuronal nuclear, cytoplasmic, and
      cell surface autoantibodies in our population of new onset refractory, imaging-negative young
      adult epilepsy patients. This part of the study involves obtaining a single blood sample,
      equal to about 2 teaspoons.

      Phase 2: If a sufficient number of cases are identified, a double-blind crossover study of
      IVIG treatment will be performed in these patients.
