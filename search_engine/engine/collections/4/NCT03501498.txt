      as faeces. There are different factors affecting this process. Important factors are movement
      through the GI Tract, breakdown of food material and absorption by the body to produce
      energy. The unabsorbed waste material is then excreted by the body.

      Different enzymes are produced by human body which are responsible for digestion of food. One
      important chemical is bile which is produced in the gall bladder. It is important in
      digestion of fatty foods but affects the movement of food material as well. There are
      numerous bacteria present in human GI tract especially in mouth and large bowel which also
      play an important role in process of digestion of food.

      Different conditions of health and disease can affect how food moves through the GI tract
      (known as intestinal transit). It also affects the activity of different digestive enzymes
      and chemicals in body. The bacterial population in the body is also affected by changes
      described above. The purpose of this study is to observe how these different processes
      especially the intestinal transit, bile salts and gut bacteria affect each other. This will
      help to identify mechanisms responsible for different disorders of human gut like irritable
      bowel syndrome. The study is part of an effort to identify new and future treatment of these
      conditions.
