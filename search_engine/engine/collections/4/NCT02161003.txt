      body. Stem cell research in animals has been an ongoing program in the west with fruitful
      results. Current challenges with the use of stem cells in clinical practice will be solve the
      many unanswered queries. To study the potential therapeutic effects of local Mesenchymal Stem
      cell injection in children presenting with fecal incontinence (FI) after posterior sagittal
      ano-rectoplasty (PSARP) operation for high imperforate anus. Children whom suffering from FI
      after PSARP for high imperforate anus will included in this study. Autologous MSC from the
      upper posterior iliac crest bone marrow sample will be extracted from patients under general
      anesthesia, in a suitable clean operation room. Will be Cultured and injected into the
      external anal sphincter defect using direct pena stimulator or ultra sound guidance. Then
      followed up for 180 days post injection, to assess the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to
      induce myogenesis of the anal Sphincter of patients with FI after PSARP.
