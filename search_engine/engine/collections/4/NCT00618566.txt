      groups conducted with WPD to support development of the group therapy program. Phase II will
      evaluate the efficacy of the intervention using a randomized design. Measures to protect
      human subjects include development of detailed safety and referral protocols including 24
      hour access to emergency mental health assessment and intervention as needed.
