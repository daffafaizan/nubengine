      neonate. Prevention of malaria during pregnancy is vital in decreasing maternal and child
      mortality in Africa. There are data from studies that show that intermittent preventive
      treatment (IPT) with two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is safe, efficacious, and
      effective in preventing maternal anemia, placental parasitemia, and LBW. Resistance to SP,
      however, is increasing rapidly in Africa and there is an urgent need to find alternative
      effective, safe and affordable drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria in
      pregnancy.

      The investigators conducted a trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin and
      artesunate combined with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine as treatment against malaria during
      pregnancy.Pregnant women 14 to 26 weeks gestation with P. falciparum parasitemia on
      peripheral blood film were randomly assigned into 3 treatment groups and received two doses
      of:(1) SP (3 tablets) only; (2) SP and azithromycin (1gram/day x 2 days)and (3) SP and
      artesunate 200mg/day for 3 days). The two doses of the study drug were administered
      approximately 4 weeks apart. All study drugs were taken under observation.Blood samples were
      collected on days 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 after treatment and at any visit when the women presented
      with symptoms of malaria. The women were also given an insecticide-treated net (ITN) and
      followed until delivery. Adverse effects were assessed at each scheduled visit, any
      unscheduled visits during the study, and at delivery. Peripheral and placental blood films
      and placental biopsies were prepared at delivery. Newborns were weighed, examined, and
      gestational age was determined.
