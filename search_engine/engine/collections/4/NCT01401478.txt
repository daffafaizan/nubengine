      thirteen sites in Russia. Study drug will be administered per local prescribing guidelines.
      Planned therapy is six months. Intact Parathyroid Hormone will be measured at the Screening
      visit. All participants who meet the inclusion criteria and fail to meet the exclusion
      criteria will be included in the study.

      Adverse events will be monitored throughout the observation period (and up to 30 days after
      the last dose of Zemplar).

      Ability of Zemplar to lower intact Parathyroid Hormone level will be assessed throughout the
      study. Proportion of participants with the level of intact Parathyroid Hormone 150 - 300
      pg/mL was stated as primary endpoint. Calcium and Phosphorus elevation will be also measured
      throughout the study.

      The selected population is representative in relation to those who will take Zemplar in
      routine practice. Participants with contraindications to Zemplar therapy (as per the local
      label) will not be included in the study.
