      are dysregulated in HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome in comparison to HIV+ people
      without The Metabolic Syndrome, and in comparison to HIV-seronegative people with and without
      The Metabolic Syndrome. We hypothesize that dysregulated myocardial fatty acid and glucose
      metabolism is associated with impaired heart function (diastolic dysfunction) in HIV+ people
      with The Metabolic Syndrome. We will use myocardial positron emission tomography, radioactive
      isotope tracers of palmitate and glucose, and echocardiography to evaluate myocardial
      metabolism and function. HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome will receive 16wks of
      exercise training or pioglitazone (Actos), and we will evaluate their potential beneficial
      effects on myocardial metabolism and function.
