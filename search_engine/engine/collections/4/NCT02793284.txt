      following conventional imaging (bone scan, CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis plus
      multi-parametric pelvic MRI) in detecting the prevalence of metastatic disease among men with
      biochemical recurrence after radical radiotherapy treatment to the prostate. Men treated with
      primary radiation with external beam or brachytherapy will be eligible. Eighty (80) eligible
      consenting patients with biochemical recurrence and potentially suitable for local salvage or
      targeted ablative therapies will be registered and imaged with conventional imaging (bone
      scan, CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis plus multi-parametric pelvic MRI) followed by
      investigational restaging with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Characterizing sites of disease identified
      by the combination of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with conventional imaging versus 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT
      alone will be used to explore the potential of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT as a single restaging study
      in men with biochemical recurrence. While further investigation and treatment after restaging
      will be at the discretion of the investigator and the patient, the actual
      treatment/management, treatment outcomes and quality of life will be recorded in an
      electronic database at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after re-staging. Such longitudinal analyses
      of management and outcomes will be useful in characterizing the disease trajectory, response
      to treatment and quality of life for patients whose recurrent disease is managed based on
      comprehensive restaging using the combination of conventional imaging and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.
