      facilitate decision making, and reduce use of ineffective resources in the ICU. We
      implemented an "intensive communication system" to test the effect of regular, structured
      formal family meetings on patient outcomes among long-stay ICU patients

      The design was a pre-post, tandem assignment of patients (n=217) receiving usual care and
      communication, followed by enrollment of intervention patients (n=354), from 5 ICUs. The
      "intensive communication system" included: (1) family meeting within 5 days of ICU admission
      and weekly thereafter; (2) each meeting addressed medical update, values and preferences,
      goals of care; treatment plan, and milestones for judging effectiveness of treatment.

      We measured differences between control and intervention patients in indicators of
      aggressiveness of care or timing of treatment limitation decisions (ICU mortality, LOS,
      duration of ventilation, treatment limitation orders, or use of tracheostomy or percutaneous
      gastrostomy). Difference in outcomes among patients who died or who had treatment limitation
      orders, comparing control and intervention groups, was also examined.
