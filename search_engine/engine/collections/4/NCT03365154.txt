    
      Feasibility Clinical Trial of the Cardio Flow FreedomFlow™ Orbital Atherectomy System to
      Treat Peripheral Artery Disease (FAST Trial) is a prospective non-randomized single arm study
      that will enroll up to 10 patients at 1 - 2 sites. The study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Cardio Flow atherectomy device for plaque removal in de novo target
      lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower extremities. The primary safety endpoint
      is defined as freedom from a composite of new onset major adverse events through the 30-day
      follow-up as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events physician. The primary
      effectiveness endpoint is defined as the ability of the Cardio Flow Device to achieve a
      residual diameter stenosis ≤ 50% without adjunctive therapy, determined by Angiographic core
      lab evaluation.
