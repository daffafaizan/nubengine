      serving lower-income, obese, African American adults. The intervention will involve training
      community health coaches to deliver the intervention. These community health coaches will be
      individuals who are members of the church and who are willing to be trained on how to deliver
      behaviorally-based, empirically proven, lifestyle change interventions. These community
      health coaches will be trained by the staff at Pennington Biomedical, who have experience
      training and delivering these types of interventions. The community health coaches will
      deliver the intervention through their respective church after being trained. Weekly text
      messages will be sent to participants in order to supplement the intervention sessions and
      provide support. The primary aim is to determine if the trained community health coach
      church-based intervention will result in significant weight loss. Secondary aims will assess
      blood glucose, cholesterol, physical activity, food intake, and weight related quality of
      life.
