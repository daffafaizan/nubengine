      I. To develop a mechanism for tracking and retaining patients enrolled on Children's Oncology
      Group (COG) protocols.

      II. To maintain regular, lifetime contact with patients in order to obtain current
      identification and contact information, and self/parent-reported health status.

      III. To locate patients who are lost-to-follow-up for COG (or Legacy Group) protocols
      targeted for follow-up by the Long-Term Follow-Up Center (LTFC).

      IV. To provide current patient contact information and self/parent-reported health status
      updates to the COG Statistics and Data Center (SDC) and to each patient's COG institution.

      V. To facilitate collection of protocol-specific outcome data through collaboration with the
      LTFC Oversight Committee, the SDC, and the member institutions.

      OUTLINE: This is an umbrella protocol for all long-term follow-up at COG institutions.

      Within 3 months of enrollment on ALTE05N1, patients receive a mailed packet introducing the
      Long-Term Follow-Up Center (LTFC). Patients are asked to complete a patient response form,
      verify information provided in packet, and update contact and health status information. The
      Health Status Update Form is a brief document including questions about current health
      status, disease status, and cancer therapy received since the last mailing. Patients may
      respond by use of postage prepaid envelopes, email, or 24-hour toll-free telephone number.
