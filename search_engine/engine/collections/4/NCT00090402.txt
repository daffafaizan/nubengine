    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious condition associated with increased inflammation,
      cholesterol, and oxidative stress (a condition involving an excess of free radicals and a
      decrease in antioxidant levels). Fish oil and alpha lipoic acid, which have few side effects,
      may help relieve these problems; therefore, these supplements may slow the progression of AD,
      particularly when given in combination. This study will evaluate the effect of fish oil and
      alpha lipoic acid on inflammation, lipid levels, and oxidative stress.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive fish oil alone, fish oil and
      alpha lipoic acid, or placebo for 1 year. AD rating scales as well as urine and blood tests
      will be used to assess participants. Participants will have monthly clinic visits during the
      study to monitor adverse events and to undergo various laboratory tests.
