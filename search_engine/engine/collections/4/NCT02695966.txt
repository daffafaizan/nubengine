      It is a lethal disease that typically presents late, metastasises early and is resistant to
      conventional treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. In 2012 there were 8700 deaths in
      the UK from pancreatic cancer, making it the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death.

      Current therapeutic strategies are aimed at extending survival as well as improving symptoms
      and quality of life, but although conventional chemotherapeutic agents have achieved modest
      clinical benefit, the need for novel therapies is great.

      This study proposes to extend our pre-clinical studies to develop an ex-vivo assay for the
      assessment of AMD3100 effectiveness in human samples.

      The research team will investigate the feasibility of assessing primary human pancreatic
      tissue for changes to T lymphocyte function and localisation in the presence and absence of
      AMD3100 through obtaining a blood sample and fresh pancreatic tissue intra-operatively from
      pancreatic tumours located in the head of the pancreas.
