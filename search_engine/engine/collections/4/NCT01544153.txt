    
      This study will compare the efficacy of an interactive, evidence-based smoking cessation
      website (WEB) alone and in conjunction with 1) a theory-driven, empirically-informed social
      network (SN) protocol designed to integrate participants into the online community, and 2)
      access to a 4-week supply of free NRT. Using a 2 (SN integration, no SN) x 2 (access to free
      NRT, no access) randomized, controlled factorial design with repeated measures at baseline,
      3, and 9 months, this study will recruit N=5,000 new members of a Web-based smoking cessation
      program and randomize them to: 1) WEB, 2) WEB+SN, 3) WEB+NRT, or 4) WEB+SN+NRT.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of WEB+SN, WEB+NRT, and WEB+SN+NRT versus WEB
      alone with regard to self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence at the primary endpoint
      of 9 months and at secondary endpoint of 3 months. Hypothesis 1a: All three intervention
      conditions will outperform WEB. Hypothesis 1b: WEB+SN+NRT will outperform WEB+SN and WEB+NRT.

      Aim 2: To examine whether the impact of treatment condition on cessation is mediated by
      greater adherence to problem solving/skills training tools, social support, and
      pharmacotherapy. Hypothesis 2: WEB+SN+NRT will have the greatest impact on treatment
      adherence, which will yield higher quit rates than the other treatments.

      Exploratory Aim: To advance theory and identify the processes through which social network
      integration and provision of free NRT influence treatment adherence. Specifically,
      exploratory analyses will examine whether social support and social norms are active elements
      in the pathway to adherence, along with other known mediators of abstinence such as
      self-efficacy.
