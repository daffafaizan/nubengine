      that reaches nutritional requirements of ERAS protocol for colorectal cancer surgery
      patients, can improve nutritional status so it decreases postoperative complications,
      hospital length of stay and costs, compared to conventional fluid therapy administration
      since patients receive oral nutrition at day 3-5.
