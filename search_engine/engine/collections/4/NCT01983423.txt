      in the cycle preceding IVF increases pregnancy rates, at least in women with recurrent
      implantation failure. Whether endometrial biopsy could promote implantation and improve
      pregnancy rates in the larger population of women undergoing IVF has yet to be explored. The
      present study will address this question and examine the impact of endometrial biopsies on
      IVF outcomes in the context of a randomized controlled trial.

      The optimal timing of the endometrial biopsy in the cycle preceding IVF has not been
      determined, but the majority of the studies have included a biopsy in the mid-luteal phase of
      the preceding cycle. In order to allow an adjuvant therapy to IVF that would be considered
      tolerable to a subject, and applicable to a large infertile women population, it was
      determined that a single endometrial biopsy, performed approximately 1 week prior to the
      start of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in an IVF cycle, would be the simplest,
      most flexible, and generalizable intervention to study its effects on pregnancy rates. All
      other components of the IVF treatment will remain constant with approximately 8-12 days of
      ovarian stimulation, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) trigger being administered in that
      time frame and oocyte retrieval occuring 36 hours later from trigger. The embryo transfer
      will take place either day 3 or day 5 after oocyte retrieval.
