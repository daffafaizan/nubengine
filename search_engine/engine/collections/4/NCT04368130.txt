    
      This is a pilot study of patients with advanced gynecologic cancers and oncology providers
      from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Gynecologic Oncology Program to explore the
      feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone-based real-time behavioral anomaly detection
      system (SIGNAL).

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study interventions
      including smartphone data collection, surveys, and a brief interview once you have completed
      the study to learn more about your experiences on the study.

      Participants will download the adapted Beiwe app for a 6-month period and the investigators
      will collect passive smartphone sensor data and active PRO data bi-weekly.
