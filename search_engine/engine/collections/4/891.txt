speech and reading problems in childhood.the following communicative disordershave been discussed: functional articulationdefects, delayed speech development,stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate,neurological disorders, and reading disorders.these disorders rarely have asingle cause.  they are the result of anintermingling of many factors, some physiologicaland some psychological, someresiding within the child and some in theparents and environment in general.  delayedor defective speech is a cause forgreat concern to most parents and teachers.the public health worker who listenswith an attentive and sympathetic ear mayallay some of this anxiety and thus helpfoster healthy emotional development inthe child.  the existence of a more seriouscondition underlying the presenting communicationproblem, even if sensed by theparents, is frequently denied.  the publichealth worker can assist the parents inthe painful process of facing up to theirfears.  a child with a communication problemis still a child and the public health workerby simply reflecting this to the parentsand advising them on normal child-raisingpractices can, again, be of help to thechild.  children with speech deviations areexposed to an overabundance of well-intentionedspeech correction at home.most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunatelyis harmful.  while the workermay not be in a position to offer specificadvice on a particular child, the mannerin which the parents and teacher are handlingthe child's communication problemcan be explored and damaging practicespossibly eliminated.  the fact that theremay be a diagnostic and treatment centerto which the child can be referred doesnot vitiate the public health worker's role.the public health physician and public healthnurse have a valuable contributionto make in helping the parents, school,and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.
