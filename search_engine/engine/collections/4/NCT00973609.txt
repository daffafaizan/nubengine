    
      Chemotherapy and bevacizumab represent a standard of care in treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Until now, continuation of chemotherapy - and bevacizumab - represents the
      standard of care in colorectal cancer treatment. However, since the OPTIMOX1 trial showed an
      equivalent duration of disease control for a de-escalation / maintenance / reintroduction
      strategy compared with a treatment until progression strategy for oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy, the question is whether this strategy might apply also to bevacizumab in
      combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, with the introduction of bevacizumab, there are
      new options for a maintenance treatment which should be evaluated.

      As the continuation of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab until disease progression has to be
      regarded as standard of care, the question is whether a de-escalation of treatment intensity
      or even withdrawal of treatment ("drug holiday") after a certain treatment period will not be
      inferior with respect to resulting time with tumor control, but allow patients a period with
      less toxicity and gain of quality of life.
