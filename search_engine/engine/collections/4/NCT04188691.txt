      the two groups（6-17-year-old，3-5-year-old） of subjects to vaccinate beyond the window and
      deviate from the experimental plan. After communication between the researcher, the sponsor
      and the statistician, it was decided to restart the Phase I clinical trials of these two
      groups.
