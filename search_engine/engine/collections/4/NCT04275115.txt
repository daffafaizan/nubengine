    
      This study is designed to evaluate the PK of caffeine, montelukast and midazolam following
      multiple doses of foliglurax in healthy subjects. The study is divided into four periods:

        -  Period 1: investigation of the CYP450 probe substrates (caffeine, montelukast,
           midazolam) alone followed by a 2-day washout before start of Period 2.

        -  Period 2: administration of foliglurax for 7 days to reach steady state.

        -  Period 3: administration of the CYP450 probe substrates in combination with foliglurax
           followed by a 7-day washout before start of Period 4.

        -  Period 4: investigation of the effects of foliglurax on the PK of the CYP450 probe
           substrates following washout of foliglurax.
