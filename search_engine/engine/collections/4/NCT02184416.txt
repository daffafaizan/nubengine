      2nd line post Sutent treatment. The possible sequences of treatment under investigation will
      be:

        -  Sutent (prospective) - Inlyta

        -  Sutent (retrospective) - Inlyta

        -  Sutent - not further active treatment (supportive care)

        -  Sutent - other second line treatment (Nexavar (sorafenib), Votrient (pazopanib),
           Afinitor (everolimus), Torisel (temsirolimus), other)) The study will enroll
           approximately 750 adv/mRCC patients at the 1st and 2nd line treatment level. Patients
           will be enrolled when they start a treatment with Sutent in 1st line or Inlyta in 2nd
           line post Sutent treatment. Therefore for some patients there will be a retrospective
           Sutent data collection. The primary endpoints of this study in patients with adv/mRCC
           are PFS and TTF for patients receiving Inlyta in 2nd line, and the combined PFS and TTF
           for patients receiving the Sutent-Inlyta sequence. In this non-interventional real life
           study, the objective is only descriptive and the sample size will rely on the precision
           of the estimate.
