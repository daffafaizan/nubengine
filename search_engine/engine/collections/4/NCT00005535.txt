      The study built upon existing sib-pair methods for multipoint mapping of Quantitative Trait
      Loci (QTL)s. It greatly expanded upon the statistical methodology to identify and localize
      QTLs for complex traits by merging sib-pair methods with a powerful twin design which used
      phenotypic data on monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins to resolve
      phenotypic variability into genetic and non-genetic components, and partition human
      quantitative genetic variation into effects due to loci on specific chromosomal regions. This
      quantitative methodology was applied to risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- one of the
      most pressing health problems in Western society. Population-based samples of Dutch, Swedish,
      and Australian twins had been identified in previous studies, phenotypic measures on lipids,
      lipoproteins, and other important cardiovascular risk factors had been obtained, and blood
      had been banked in a valuable resource which was available for use in this study. In 500 DZ
      twin pairs, a series of 175 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were detected using an
      automated process for detecting fluorescent signals. These data were analyzed using the new
      statistical methods both to confirm the effects of a series of candidate loci and to test for
      the effects of previously unknown QTLs.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
