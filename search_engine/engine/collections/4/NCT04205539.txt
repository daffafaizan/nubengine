      Alzheimer's patients and controls. For Phase I trail, 50 patients of any gender with an age
      range of 18 to 90 who have undergone the outlined procedure will be recruited for inclusion.
      Patients will be examined by the principle investigator. All patients will complete
      neurocognitive testing (QDRS and RBANS) to assess cognitive impairment. A CDR score of 1 or
      above will be considered dementia. Lumbar punctures will be used to determine Alzheimer's
      disease status. Patients will be offered the option of participating in the study and
      provided informed consent for neuroimaging. The subjects will have three fMRI scans:
      structural T1 and two NOODI DTI scans. The scans take around 45 minutes at no charge to the
      patients. The dexmedetomidine will be given to the patient after the first DTI scan. The
      dexmedetomidine dosage will be congruent with patient height, weight, and medical history.
      This medication will be administered sublingually using an LMA Intranasal Mucosal Atomization
      Device, which allows the medication to be administered in the form of a spray. Patients will
      be instructed to keep the medication in their mouth for about 2 minutes, or until fully
      absorbed. Pulse oximetry and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the duration of
      treatment. After the subject is asleep, the second DTI scan will be done.
