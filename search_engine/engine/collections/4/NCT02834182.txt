      which plays an essential role in social communications and interactions between individuals.
      In several recent papers, it was shown that TOM is impaired in schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder. This impairment strongly affects the quality of life in patients suffering from
      these disorders. The investigators study aims to explore the neural correlates of TOM in
      schizophrenic and bipolar patients, in comparison with those of healthy participants. These
      studies will be conducted on 30 schizophrenic patients, 30 bipolar patients, and 60 healthy
      participants, matched on age and educational level to each patient group. The investigators
      expect that the study of combined behavioral (neuropsychological tests) and neuro-anatomical
      data will allow to understand the pathophysiology of the alteration of social cognition
      processes in these illnesses.
