      lower back pain secondary to facet arthritis. The procedure ablates (burns) a small nerve
      that goes to the arthritic joint in the back. This nerve also innervates a muscle called the
      multifidus, thought to be important for lumbar stability. The investigators are conducting a
      study to evaluate if RFA has any impact on multifidi size, spinal stability, and overall
      function. The tools the investigators will be using to assess the multifidi muscles are
      musculoskeletal ultrasound, MRI, physical therapy assessment, and functional questionnaires.
      The goal of the study is to determine if RFA impacts the multifidi in a clinically
      significant fashion, causing atrophy, spinal instability, and/or functional decline.
