      (hypertrophy-strength-power training, versus strength-power-functional training) improve
      participants' physical functions. All testing procedures will take place at the Max Orovitz
      Laboratory on the Coral Gables campus. This study will involve a 1-week baseline testing
      phase, a 2-week familiarization phase, a 9-week intervention phase, and a 1-week post-testing
      window where subjects must report to the lab for 2 sessions.
