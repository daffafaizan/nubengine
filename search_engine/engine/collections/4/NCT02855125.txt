      baseline procedures and is deemed eligible for study entry. Treatment assignment will be done
      centrally using a dynamic allocation method (biased coin) via an interactive voice/web
      response system (IXRS) stratified by:

        -  Geographical region (Region 1: Asian [Japan]; Region 2: Western [Europe and US])

        -  Histological subtypes (nonsquamous cell carcinoma [including mixed] and squamous cell
           carcinoma)
