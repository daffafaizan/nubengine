      metastatic or locally advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma. Oral sunitinib
      (50 mg) will be administered to all patients daily for the first four weeks of a six week
      study cycle, followed by a 2-week rest. Patients will be assessed for response to study
      treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study
      treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression.

      Primary study outcomes include:

      To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib given orally daily for 4 out of every 6
      weeks in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

      To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/
      pheochromocytoma.

      To document effects of sunitinib on markers of biochemical activity of advanced or metastatic
      paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.
