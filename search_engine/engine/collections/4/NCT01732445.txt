      I. To evaluate the efficacy (best overall response) of ruxolitinib (ruxolitinib phosphate)
      and danazol in patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall survival of patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia
      initiating ruxolitinib and danazol.

      II. To evaluate the adverse event profile of ruxolitinib and danazol in patients with
      myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) and European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) with
      ruxolitinib and danazol for patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and danazol PO thrice
      daily (TID) on days 1-56. Treatment repeats every 56 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the treating physician's discretion,
      patients may continue treatment past 6 courses if they are without disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
