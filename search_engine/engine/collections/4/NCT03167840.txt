      adults with MCI aged 60 or above will be recruited. They will be randomly allocated into four
      groups: Physical Training alone (PT), Cognitive Training alone (CT), combined Physical And
      Cognitive Training (PACT) and wait-list group (WG). Assessors blinded to participant
      allocation will conduct pre-test, posttest, and 6-month follow-up assessments.
