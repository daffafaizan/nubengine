      The primary research question is:

      Do muscular strength training programs can improve functional capacity, muscle performance
      and microcirculation in the elderly? Hypothesis: Strength training program will promote
      electromyographic changes during the development of peripheral muscle fatigue and
      microcirculatory blood flow contributing to functional autonomy.

      Secondary Research Questions

        1. Does the strength training program in the elderly improve the standard of
           electromyographic fatigue? Hypothesis: Elderly practitioners of strength exercise
           program showed increased neuromuscular efficiency and electromyographic fatigue index.

        2. Do the strength training program in the elderly improve peripheral microcirculation?
           Hypothesis: A regular program of strength exercise in the elderly increases the blood
           flow in peripheral microcirculation changing the process of muscle fatigue. These
           biomechanical and physiological changes contribute to increased functional autonomy and
           reducing the risk of falls in the elderly.
