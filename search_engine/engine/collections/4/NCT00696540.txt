      when vast numbers of small children line for attention because of respiratory distress caused
      by a probable RSV infection.

      Our study will examine if nebulized salbutamol diluted in hypertonic (3%), instead of normal
      (0.9%) saline, provides better relief in outpatients.

      If hypertonic saline proves safe and effective, the patients could be better managed and the
      pressure for attention diminished at a low cost, by a simple change in the saline ampule.
