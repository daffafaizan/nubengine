      nicotine-dependent smokers. This preliminary study will explore the impact of varenicline
      treatment on smoking cue-induced craving and associated regional brain activation using BOLD
      fMRI. Twenty healthy smokers (10 males, 10 females) will undergo two BOLD fMRI scans with the
      presentation of smoking-related and neutral cues at baseline and after five weeks of
      treatment with open-label varenicline. The investigators hypothesize that participants will
      report reduced urges to smoke on the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief and have less
      activation of the brain areas associated with craving during the fMRI after 5 weeks of
      varenicline and smoking cessation counseling compared to the baseline scan.
