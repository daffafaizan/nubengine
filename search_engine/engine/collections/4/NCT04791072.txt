      treated. It has been reported that pulmonary rehabilitation programs applied in various
      models and in a small number to relieve or reduce these symptoms reduce dyspnea, increase
      exercise capacity and improve quality of life. There is no study reporting the results of a
      pulmonary rehabilitation program applied to COVID 19 patients in our country. The main
      purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation applied by

      have been hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID 19 and underwent IMV, who were
      hospitalized in the service and underwent NIMV or high-flow oxygen inhalation, and whose
      respiratory symptoms persist after discharge. The patients in the study group will be called
