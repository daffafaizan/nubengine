      therapy or oral MTX qw monotherapy plus placebo subcutaneous (SC) q2w in a ration 2:1. To
      maintain blinding, matching placebo SC injections will be dispensed q2w to the MTX
      monotherapy group. All subjects will receive open-label MTX 15 mg qw as oral tablets. All
      subjects will take approximately 5 mg weekly dietary supplement of oral folate throughout the
      study on any day beginning 48 hours after ingestion of their oral study medication. Defined
      as standard therapy oral folate supplementation will be taken in a single dose 24-48 h after
      MTX therapy.
