      less than or equal 0.9 in patients with acute cerebral ischemic event (stroke or transient
      ischemic attack) and determinate the correlation between ABI and internal carotid artery
      stenosis (ICAS) in the acute cerebral ischemic patients.

      The ABI is a non-invasive tool useful for the diagnosis of LEAD. The low ABI is a strong
      marker of generalized atherosclerosis. LEAD is a strong independent predictor for stroke.
      Significant ICAS is prevalent among patients having LEAD. Acute ischemic stroke due to
      significant ICAS has poor prognosis.

      Patients with LEAD may be a suitable subgroup for screening for ICAS using duplex scanning.

      Estimating the relationship between cerebral ischemic event and the ABI value could help
      better guide preventive and risk reduction strategies.
