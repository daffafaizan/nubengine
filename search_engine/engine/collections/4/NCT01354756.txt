    
      OSA can occur in up to 78% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery(1). Moderate to severe
      case will benefit from CPAP therapy, that can help avoiding post-operative complications(2).

      In this population, the investigators propose complete attended in-hospital polysomnography
      (PSG)in patients with a clinical high probability of OSA.

      According to obesity epidemics (3), waiting list for PSG in sleep labs is every day longer.

      The investigators want to assess sensitivity and specificity of a new portable screening
      tool, ApneaLink, to detect OSA in a bariatric population.

      Design:

      monocentric and prospective study

      Methods:

      Patients:

      - OSA suspicion based on :

        -  symptoms and signs (snoring, apneas , neck circumference >38 (women) or 43cm (men))

        -  BMI > 50

        -  BMI > 40, > 40 y

        -  BMI > 35, men, hypertension

        -  increased serum Bicarbonate

        -  Polyglobulia

      Measurements

        -  Polysomnography in sleep lab with concommitant recording performed with Apnea LinkTM
           (nasal flow and oxymétry recording).

        -  between 2 weeks : recording performed with Apnea LinkTM (nasal flow and oxymétry
           recording)at home.
