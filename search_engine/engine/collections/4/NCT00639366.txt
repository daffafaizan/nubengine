        -  To test if prophylactic cranial radiotherapy delivering 30 Gy in 10 fractions will
           significantly reduce (from 35% to 21% at 2 years) the incidence of symptomatic brain
           metastases in patients treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) for metastatic breast
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, type of systemic
      therapy (trastuzumab [Herceptin®] monotherapy vs combination with chemotherapy), hormone
      receptor status, and presence of lung metastases (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive taxane/trastuzumab therapy for 6 weeks. While continuing
           taxane/trastuzumab therapy, patients then undergo 10 fractions of concurrent
           prophylactic cranial radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive taxane/trastuzumab therapy without concurrent prophylactic
           cranial radiotherapy.

      All patients undergo quality of life assessments every 8 weeks for 9 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.
