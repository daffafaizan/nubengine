      prospective randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of EvoskinÂ®) for protecting skin
      compared to Trixiera. To account for individual differences in radiation each subject served
      as her own control, as each was to apply the experimental and control agents to the
      irradiated breast. Each patient was randomly assigned to use Evoskin on the half of the
      irradiated breast and to use the Triexiera on the other half. Dermatitis was graded weekly by
      means of a spectrophotometer.
