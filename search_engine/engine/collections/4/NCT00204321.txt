      After renal transplantation patients are still characterized by their pre-existing
      arteriosclerotic changes [3]. Endothelial dysfunction and disturbed distensibility of great
      arteries are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity [4,5]. Additionally the
      activation of sympathetic nervous system leads to dysfunction of vessel wall[6,7]. There are
      important therapeutic options in improvement of endothelial function [8].

      In addition monocytes of the recipient will contribute to vessel wall changes. [9-11]. Aim of
      therapy - especially of immunosuppressive therapy- have to prevent these fatal vessel wall
      changes.

      Therefore in this study the following topics will be addressed.

      1. Discontinuing of calcineurininhibitors will lead to improvement of vessel wall function 2.
      Sirolimus and Mycophenolat Mofetil affect vessel wall properties in a different way.

      3. There are risk factors, e.g. activity of sympathetic nervous system, which may determine
      the efficacy of discontinuing the calcineurininhibitor concerning the vessel wall function.

      4. Calcineurininhibitorfree immunosuppression reduces the activity of endothelial cells.

      5. Survival of monocytes and release of procoagulatory activity will be changed by the
      immunosuppressive regimen.
