    
      ATN 066b consists of a cross-sectional evaluation of three groups of recently diagnosed
      HIV-infected adolescents including: (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no
      maintenance; and (3) care initiation with maintenance. Social, psychological and behavioral
      factors associated with HIV-related care-seeking will be assessed using an ACASI. Three
      recruitment strategies using a randomized permuted block list of possible sequences for
      HIV-infected youth not in care will be also compared.

      The ACASI instrument will be adapted from previously used instruments intended to
      retrospectively reconstruct the care-seeking process and to assess quality of life, concerns
      and expectations for care, satisfaction with care, and social-problem solving.

      Ideally, the ACASI will be administered during a single session and may take up to 90 minutes
      to complete. Participants who are unable to complete the ACASI in one session will be allowed
      up to 7 days after initiation to complete it. Completion of all study data collection,
      including accrual period, is expected to take approximately 12 months. Outcome measures will
      be classified as (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no maintenance; or (3) care
      initiation and maintenance.

      The assessment of recruitment strategies most effective for not in care youth will include:
      use of usual case-management approaches; snowball sampling and venue-based advertisement.
