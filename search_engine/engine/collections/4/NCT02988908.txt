      Investigators evaluated the short-term and longer-term efficacy and effectiveness of a
      pharmacologic augmentation strategy for a nonpharmacologic treatment to improve memory
      performance in nondemented older adults. Investigators used a randomized controlled trial
      with parallel groups design that compares two Treatments: DONEPEZIL + COGNITIVE TRAINING
      versus PLACEBO + COGNITIVE TRAINING.

      Study 2:

      The second study looked more closely at dosage. Investigators hoped to determine the best
      dosage of the drug donepezil for enhancing the effects of the memory training program.
