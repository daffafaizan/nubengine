    
      Study S187.3.001 (NCT00357994) and Study S187.3.002 (NCT00660387) were 2 identically
      designed, Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,
      multicenter studies recruiting subjects from distinct sites. These studies evaluated the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) in the
      treatment of levodopa-responsive subjects with advanced PD who had persistent severe motor
      fluctuations, despite optimized treatment with oral levodopa-carbidopa, concomitant with
      other available antiparkinsonian medications. Participants were randomized to either LCIG
      active gel + placebo capsules or levodopa-carbidopa immediate release (IR) active capsules +
      placebo gel. Both treatment arms received the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with
      jejunal extension (PEG-J) procedure for gel administration, active LCIG or placebo gel. Data
      from these 2 studies were combined for analysis. The decision to combine the study data for
      analysis was made before enrollment was completed for both studies.
