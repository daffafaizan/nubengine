      fragile NICU patients are frequently exposed to noxious levels of noise from monitoring and
      respiratory equipment alarms, as well as from routine NICU care practices. Particularly
      detrimental to sleep and auditory development are patient exposures to high frequency noises
      that are specifically designed to alert NICU caregivers to important changes in patient
      status. This pilot study will help evaluate the fit, ergonomic design and the ease-of-use of
      a novel hearing protection system (special ear-muffs along with a unique attachment
      mechanism) specifically designed top diminish the transmission of high frequency noises to
      patients within the NICU, while allowing some transmission of low frequency sounds, such as a
      mother's voice.
