      administered to patients with IDA requiring iron therapy. However, there is a need for
      clinical efficacy and safety data within iron deficiency without anaemia which is e.g.
      observed in blood donors. Thus, this study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of
      parenteral iron isomaltoside 1000 with placebo in female blood donors with a p-ferritin below
      30 Âµg/L.
