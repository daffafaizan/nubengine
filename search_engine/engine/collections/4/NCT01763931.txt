      controls the amount of oxygen in cells with what is known as Hypoxia-inducible factor
      (HIF)-1. HIF-1 helps cancer cells grow in low oxygen environments; therefore, if this
      function can be blocked, it may make it harder for breast cancer cells to grow. Digoxin is a
      drug that has been shown to block HIF-1 in lab studies. The investigators want to learn if it
      blocks HIF-1 in human breast cancer tissue. This will be done by comparing the tumor tissue
      from the original diagnostic biopsy to tissue that is taken at the time of surgery. The
      investigators will also be comparing tumor tissue of patients who are not randomized to take
      digoxin.
