      significantly to hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and other health problems.
      Intraoral devices, such as tongue retaining devices, palatal lifting devices and mandibular
      repositioning devices designed to increase the patency of the airway and to decrease airway
      obstruction, are used to treat OSA. To this end, we are conducting a prospective,
      observational, post-market surveillance study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy
      of the iNAP® Lite sleep therapy system (iNAP® Lite), a tongue and soft palate retaining
      intraoral device, in adults with OSA.
