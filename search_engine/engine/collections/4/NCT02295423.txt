      IRB-approved survey and cover letter which will be distributed to anesthesiologists who have
      participated in a non-CME regional anesthesia workshop at VAPAHCS over the past 4 years.
      Prospective subjects will provide consent to participate by completing the requested survey.
      Subjects will not receive monetary remuneration for their participation. Selection for
      inclusion will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status. There will be no
      recruitment of participants from vulnerable populations. Participants will receive a link to
      an online survey and if they prefer an alternate method, the investigators will send the
      participant the survey in Word document format or survey by telephone. The survey will ask
      for the number and types of nerve block procedures that the participant performed, nerve
      localization method (e.g., ultrasound, electrical stimulation, or both), and whether the
      nerve blocks performed were single-injection or catheter-based.
