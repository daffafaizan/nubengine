      with knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) were randomized to receive one intraarticular
      injection of 3 ml HYAJOINT Plus (microbial fermented HA, 20 mg/ml) (N=66) or 6 ml Synvisc-One
      (avian derived HA, 8 mg/ml) (N=66). The primary outcome was change in the visual analog scale
      (VAS) pain (0-100mm) over 6 months. Secondary outcomes included The Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Lequesne index, Timed Up-and-Go test
      (TUG), single leg stance test (SLS), use of rescue analgesics and patient satisfaction.
