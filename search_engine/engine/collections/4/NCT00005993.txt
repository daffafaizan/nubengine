      stem cell factor (SCF) following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or advanced breast cancer. II. Determine the
      effectiveness of filgrastim (G-CSF) and SCF as mobilizing agents in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of stem cell factor (SCF). Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) followed by SCF SC daily for 7-10 days. Beginning on
      the fifth day of G-CSF and SCF injections, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected
      over several days. PBSC are later reinfused and patients receive G-CSF SC daily until
      hematopoietic recovery. At least 30 days but no later than 110 days following transplant,
      patients who did not experience adverse reactions to SCF during mobilization begin
      posttransplant immunotherapy. Patients receive interleukin-2 SC daily and SCF SC 3 times
      weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCF during posttransplant
      immunotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.
      Patients are followed at 1 week, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
