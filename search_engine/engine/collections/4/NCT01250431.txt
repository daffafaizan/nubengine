      the fear response in the brain, especially the limbic system, and most particularly the
      amygdala; that (b) tapping or rubbing acupuncture points (acupressure) can be as effective as
      needling them; that (c) EFTs use of such acupressure is efficacious in reducing anxiety, PTSD
      and other mood disorders; that (d) EFT reliably reduces emotional intensity associated with
      traumatic memories, is safe and low-risk; that (e) all EP studies that included a long-term
      follow-up show that patient gains are maintained over time; that (f) the psychological
      questionnaires used in this study are validated and safe; and that for all these reasons (g)
      EP is a treatment of choice among therapists when dealing with the traumatic memories of
      clients. This study extends these findings by noting changes in gene expression associated
      with the remission of PTSD symptoms.
