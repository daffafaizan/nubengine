      al) has been scientifically studied to provide sustainable weight loss for women with
      overweight or obesity after childbirth. Primary health care centers in Västra
      Götalandsregionen treat adult patients with overweight and obesity. If the LEVA method by
      Bertz et el also produces weight loss to other patient groups than women post partum, the
      method could be used as a treatment alternative.
