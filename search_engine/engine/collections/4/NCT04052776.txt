      individually and in combination. Both buspirone and levodopa can cross the blood-brain
      barrier, and reach the lumbar spinal cord where 5-HT1A receptors are expressed, and levodopa
      can presumably be synthesized by specialized dopaminergic into dopamine. Alternatively,
      levodopa effects might be mediated via noradrenaline, following dopamine metabolization.
      Therefore, it is hypothesized that the combination of pharmacological neuromodulation with
      EES would further improve locomotor functions and lower extremity motor score.

      The primary and safety objective is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of a
      single-dose of immediate-release levodopa/carbidopa, buspirone, the combination
      levodopa/carbidopa and buspirone, and the placebo in individuals with SCI.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the following effects of levodopa/carbidopa,
      buspirone, the combination levodopa/carbidopa and buspirone, and the placebo on the lower
      extremities:

        1. Spasticity

        2. Lower Extremity Motor score (LEMS)

        3. Voluntary movements

        4. Gait patterns and velocity Participants' safety will be ensured with the usage of Rysen,
           which a CE-marked bodyweight support system robot, and the aid of locomotor assistive
           device.
