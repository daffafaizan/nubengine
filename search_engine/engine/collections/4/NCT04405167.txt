    
      Tasquinimod has previously been studied as an anti-cancer agent in patients with other
      cancers, including a phase 3 randomized trial in patients with metastatic prostate cancer
      that showed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival. The side effect profile
      of tasquinimod is well-characterized based on this previous experience. This trial will
      establish a maximum tolerated dose and optimal schedule for administration of tasquinimod in
      patients with multiple myeloma and then investigate the maximum tolerated dose of tasquinimod
      in combination with a standard myeloma regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      (IRd). For both single agent tasquinimod and the combination of tasquinimod with IRd,
      exploratory expansion cohorts will be enrolled to preliminarily characterize the antimyeloma
      activity of each regimen.
