      recommendations have focused primarily on degree of obstruction. Emerging data from
      histologic series and advanced imaging studies suggests that anatomic features related to
      plaque biology, including inflammation, lipid accumulation, and angiogenesis, may be used to
      detect vulnerable plaques more likely to cause clinical effects. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      (CEUS) is a new technique that uniquely visualizes intraplaque neovascularization. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of carotid plaque lipid core and intraplaque hemorrhage has shown
      value in the prediction of future neurologic events. We propose a multimodal approach to
      assess plaque activity in subjects with known carotid disease using CEUS, MRI imaging, and
      serum biomarker evaluation. In subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy, imaging findings
      will be validated by histology. Both imaging and histologic findings will be compared with
      prospective cardiovascular events.
