      association of muscle cramps with liver disease, there is a paucity of information regarding
      treatment in these patients. Many treatment options have been reported in the literature but
      no standard of treatment has been established.

      Oral vitamin E replacement has been used successfully in the management of nocturnal muscle
      cramps in cirrhotic patients. Ropinirole is primarily used for treatment of restless leg
      syndrome. An off label trial of low dose Ropinirole in clinical practice has shown some
      success in providing relief of muscle cramps in patients with cirrhosis. This study will
      compare Ropinirole to vitamin E treatment in a prospective cross-over study.
