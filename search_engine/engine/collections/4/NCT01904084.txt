      Hoffman II bridging external fixation in patients with extraarticular dislocated distal
      radius fractures AO/OTA type A3. On the basis of power analysis a total of 160 patients are
      to be included in this project. The follow-up period is 1 year and evaluation is based on
      x-ray analysis, grip strength, range of motion, pain and satisfaction with the treatment (
