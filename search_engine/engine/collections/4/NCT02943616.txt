    
      After approval of commercial use of Absorb GT1 Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) System
      in over 75 countries as of December 31, 2015, Abbott Vascular has developed a post-approval
      commitment plan that includes the initiation of the ABSORB Post-Approval Clinical Study, a
      single-arm trial that will include approximately 2000 subjects at approximately 265 sites in
      the US and Canada.

      The objectives of ABSORB PostApproval Study are the following:

        -  Evaluate the safety of the use of Absorb in a real world setting following commercial
           physician training.

        -  Observe the effectiveness of commercial physician training on appropriate vessel sizing
           in the use of Absorb in a real world setting.

      The study design allows evaluating low frequency events, effectiveness of commercial
      physician training and education for very small vessels (< 2.25 mm as assessed by
      quantitative coronary angiography [QCA]), and confirmation of generalizability of the
      treatment with Absorb to real-world practice. The estimated follow-up of safety and
      effectiveness will be 3 years.

      Angiographic Subgroup:

      Approximately the first 500 consecutive subjects implanted by operators inexperienced in the
      usage of Absorb GT1 BVS to receive baseline assessment of reference vessel diameter (RVD) by
      the angiographic core laboratory. An inexperienced operator is defined as having performed
      two or fewer Absorb implants prior to commercial approval. The purpose of the angiographic
      subgroup is to evaluate the effectiveness of training in the selection of appropriately sized
      coronary arteries for GT1 BVS implantation. Study staff will be notified after the procedure
      if the subject is in the angiographic subgroup, and instructed to send pre-procedure
      angiogram and supporting materials to core laboratory for assessment.
