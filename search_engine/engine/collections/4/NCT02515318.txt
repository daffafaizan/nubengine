    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading diseases causing mortality
      and morbidity, despite advanced pharmacotherapy and therapeutic management.

      COPD patients suffer frequent exacerbations, defined as 'acute events characterized by a
      worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations
      and leads to a change in medication'. Acute illness and prolonged bed rest are associated
      with loss of muscle mass and a significant decline in functional ability and mobility.
      Interventions to counteract these impairments are indicated.
