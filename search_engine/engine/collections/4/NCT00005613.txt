      patients with high risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease treated with allogeneic
      vs autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Compare the toxicities (short and long term) of
      these 2 regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Cytoreductive therapy: Patients receive 3 courses of salvage chemotherapy (e.g.,
      dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP); etoposide, methylprednisolone,
      high dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (ESHAP); fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone
      (FND)). Harvest: Patients with an HLA identical sibling donor are assigned to the allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation group. Patients without an HLA identical
      sibling are assigned to the autologous PBSC transplantation group. Allogeneic OR autologous
      PBSC are harvested. Conditioning regimen: Patients receive high dose chemotherapy comprised
      of cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3 and carmustine IV over 3 hours and
      etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -4. PBSC are infused on day 0. Patients are followed
      weekly for 3 months, then monthly for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years.
