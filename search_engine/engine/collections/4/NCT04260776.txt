      improve engagement with and effectiveness of a web-based intervention for socially anxious
      smokers. At the outset of the study (Phase 1), participants will receive access to a new
      web-based smoking intervention (MyWebQuit) and will randomized to receive one of two text
      message services: 1) 1-way text messages, or 2) interactive, 2-way text messages. Those who
      disengage with the website in the first 5 weeks will be re-randomized to one of three
      re-engagement strategies: 1) re-engagement emails, 2) re-engagement interactive text
      messages, or 3) no re-engagement strategy. Outcomes include protocol feasibility, treatment
      acceptability, treatment utilization, and smoking cessation.
