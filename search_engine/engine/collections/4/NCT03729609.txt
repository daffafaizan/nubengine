      mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat people with untreated CD30-positive
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the occurrence of
      neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in untreated CD30-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma patients on
      concomitant brentuximab vedotin and AVD in the routine clinical setting. The planned number
      of observed patients will be approximately 100.
