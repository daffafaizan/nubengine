      for children who develop progressive or recurrent disease is poor with < 30% DFS. Novel
      therapies are urgently needed for these subgroups of patients. One potential approach is the
      investigation of a new class of receptor targeted cytotoxic fusion proteins (denileukin
      diftitox{DD}). We have previously demonstrated that > 85% of children with ALCL express CD25.
      The human IL-2 receptor exists in three forms, low (CD25), intermediate (CD122/CD132) and
      high (CD25/CD122/CD132) affinity. DD is a recombinant DNA-derived cytotoxic fusion protein
      composed of the amino acid sequences for diphtheria toxin fragments followed by the binding
      sequences for the interleukin-2 receptor. Malignant cells expressing one or more of the
      subunits of the IL-2 receptor are found in certain leukemias and lymphomas including
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Clinical studies have shown therapeutic efficacy of DD
      alone and in combination with CHOP chemotherapy in CD25 expressing malignancies such as CTCL,
      CLL and lymphoma. We hypothesize that DD will be safe and efficacious in children with
      relapsed ALCL.
