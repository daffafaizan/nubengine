      supplementation (two grams per day for 21 days) enhances the effects of a 21-day Daniel Fast,
      particularly in regards to blood lipids and lipid peroxidation. The investigators were also
      interested in determining if adiponectin and/or resistin change in response to the fast, as
      these adipokines could potentially mediate the favorable glucoregulatory changes the
      investigators observed in our initial investigation of a 21-day Daniel Fast. Finally, the
      investigators sought to determine the changes in macronutrient and micronutrient intake
      during a Daniel Fast, and how these dietary changes affect our selected hemodynamic,
      anthropometric, blood lipid, glucoregulatory, oxidative stress, inflammatory, renal, and
      hepatic biomarkers.
