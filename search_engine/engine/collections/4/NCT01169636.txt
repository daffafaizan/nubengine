    
      Phase I:

      The Study Drugs:

      Panobinostat is designed to block the function of enzymes that are found inside cancer cells.
      These enzymes trigger cells to grow and multiply out of control. By blocking these enzymes,
      it may slow down the growth of or kill cancer cells.

      Ifosfamide is designed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.

      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell
      division, which may cause the cells to die.

      Etoposide is designed to block cell growth.

      Baseline Tests:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed about 7 days before the first dose of the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs (blood pressure and heart rate).

        -  You will have 1 electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity
           of the heart).

        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
           pregnancy test.

      Study Groups:

      You will be assigned to a dose level of panobinostat based on when you join this study. Up to
      2 dose levels of panobinostat will be tested. Up to 6participants will be enrolled at each
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of ICE.

      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 20 extra participants, called the expansion
      group, will receive the study drugs at that dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 14 days.

      ICE Administration:

      On Day 1 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive ifosfamide by vein over 24 hours.

      On Day 1 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.

      On Days 1-3 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1-3, you will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.

      You will also receive mesna to help prevent side effects. On Day 2 (+/- 2 days) of Cycles
      1-3, you will receive mesna by vein over 12 hours.

      You will also receive pegfilgrastim to help prevent side effects. Beginning 24-48 hours after
      the completion of chemotherapy of Cycles 1-3, you will take pegfilgrastim through a needle
      under the skin.

      Panobinostat Administration:

      You will take panobinostat by mouth starting Day -6 of Cycle 1 (6 days before your first dose
      of ICE). You will take the panobinostat on Days -6, -4, and -2 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 3, 5,
      8, 10, and 12 of Cycles 1 and 2.

      If you are in the expansion group, you will take panobinostat by mouth starting Day -6 of
      Cycle 1 (6 days before your first dose of ICE). You will take the panobinostat on Days -6,
      -4, and -2 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycles 1 and 2.

      You should take panobinostat around the same time each day with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.
      You should swallow the capsules whole and not chew them. You must avoid grapefruit or
      grapefruit juice and seville (sour) oranges while on study.

      If you miss a dose of panobinostat, take it as soon as you remember it on the same day.
      However, if more than 12 hours have passed since you were supposed to take the dose, you
      should skip that day's dose. In that case, wait to take panobinostat until the next scheduled
      dosing day.

      Study Visits:

      On Days -6 and -2 of Cycle 1, you will have 2 ECGs.

      Within 7 days before each ICE therapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.

      One (1) time a week, blood (2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have an ECG.

      After Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a CT scan of your head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If your bone marrow was positive at screening, you will have a positron emission
           tomography (PET) scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You be on study for up to 3 cycles (about 42 days). You will be taken off study early if the
      disease worsens or you experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit at which the following will be
      performed:

      You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

      You will have an ECG.

      This is an investigational study. Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      ICE is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of
      lymphoma, including relapsed and refractory Hodgkins lymphoma. The combination of
      panobinostat and ICE for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma is investigational.

      Up to 102 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive ICE.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive ICE and panobinostat.
