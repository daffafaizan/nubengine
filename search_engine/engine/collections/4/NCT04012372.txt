      safety of 28-day hydration with ROSA water in healthy infants aged 6-12 months. The
      participants are apparently healthy children breastfed or formula fed; minimal sample size (n
      = 52) was calculated according to 0.8 power to detect a significant difference in the
      prevalence of diarrhea (G*Power 3.1). Final group of participants will consist of sixty-five
      healthy male and female infants (we presume that 20% of participants will drop-out throughout
      the study). The stopping rules for participants include a refuse to participate in this
      research at any time and significant change of health status. All participants will be
      allocated in an open-label manner to two randomly assigned ad libitum hydration regimens:
      first group will receive ROSA water for daily hydration, and second (control) group will
      receive other water of personal choice (including tap water). All testing including parental
      diary of infant general status (e.g. daily amount of water consumed, number of stools per
      day, nutritional habits) and clinician-reported outcomes (e.g. body weight, clinical
      evaluation of hydration will be conducted at pre-administration (baseline) and at follow-up
      (after 28 days of administration). The study is entirely voluntary and the participants are
      free to stop participating at any time.
