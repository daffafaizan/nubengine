      depressive symptoms, self-management, and systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. The
      hypothesis is that women receiving vitamin D supplementation will report fewer depressive
      symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and will
      have a lower systolic blood pressure compared to those taking placebo at three and six months
      follow-up.

      The secondary aim is to explore the mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      inflammatory biomarkers and their association with depression. Here, the hypothesis is that
      women receiving vitamin D supplementation will have a decrease in inflammatory biomarkers
      which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to those taking placebo at
      three and six months follow-up.
