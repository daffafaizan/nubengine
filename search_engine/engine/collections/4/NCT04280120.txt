      duration of 10-12 days. However, the administration of these drugs produce adverse side
      effect. Therapist use a number of techniques to maintain the physiological properties of
      facial muscles. However, adding a new technique would add to the arsenal of techniques
      available for the therapist. The research is intended to determine the effect of adding
      Neural mobilization in the recovery of Bells Palsy. A randomized controlled trail is intended
      to include 60 participants divided into two groups. Experimental group will receive Neural
      Mobilization with conservative treatment and control group will receive conservative
      treatment only.
