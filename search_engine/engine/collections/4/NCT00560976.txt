      lipocalin (NGAL) are increased in a number of renal diseases, but has not been evaluated yet
      in dialysis patients. Since NGAL is suggested to be related to inflammatory processes and
      iron homeostasis, which are a major problem in dialysis patients, this study aims to assess
      the relation of serum NGAL levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients to iron status, inflammation,
      hemodialysis and intravenous(IV) iron administration. Our hypothesis is that serum NGAL
      levels in HD patients are related to iron status and inflammation and may change following
      hemodialysis and/or acute or chronic IV iron administration.

      The Specific aims are:

        1. To assess the relations between basal serum NGAL levels to iron, dialysis, and
           inflammation related parameters.

        2. To assess the effect of HD on serum NGAL levels and their relation with with iron,
           dialysis and inflammation related parameters.

        3. To assess the effects of weekly 100 mg IV iron in the first hour of HD on serum NGAL
           levels, and the relation of pre IV iron serum NGAL levels with iron, oxidative stress
           and inflammation related parameters. These assessments will be performed in the first
           weekly HD.
