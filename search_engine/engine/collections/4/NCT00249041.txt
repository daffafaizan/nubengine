    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate of anti-etanercept antibody formation in a
      larger sample of subjects on liquid etanercept than the previous study, 20020378, in a
      minimum of 400 subjects receiving etanercept liquid for the first time, with and without
      concomitant MTX therapy. The rate of neutralizing antibodies to liquid etanercept will also
      be assessed.
