      Biophotonics and Bioengineering Laboratory (BBL) surgical navigation prototype, when
      registered with pre-operative imaging (CT or MRI), can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy
      and allow tracking the position of surgical instruments in real-time, using an intraoperative
      non-contact optical imaging system during spinal surgical procedures. This is based on the
      completed preliminary study of 40 spinal procedures. The specific research aim is as follows:
      Validate the ability of the BBL surgical navigation prototype to function as the sole
      navigation system during spinal surgical procedures. The study will focus on testing the
      robustness of the system to appropriately function on a variety of spinal surgeries.
