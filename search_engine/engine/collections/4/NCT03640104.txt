      Health Sciences of Universidad de Sonora. A randomized controlled trial will be carried out
      and participant women will be assigned by simple randomization 1:1 to either the intervention
      or control group, upon signing an informed consent. At baseline (2wk postpartum),
      anthropometric (weight, height, mid upper-arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness)
      and body composition (DXA) measurements as well as the assessment of vitamin A status (serum
      and breastmilk retinol and the modified relative dose response) will be performed. The
      control group will receive only recommendations for a healthy diet in accordance with
      international standards and will be followed up every month to promote adherence and to
      assess their nutritional status. On the other hand, the intervention group will receive an
      individualized macronutrient meal equivalent menu, with nutritional consultations every two
      weeks. The dietary plan will include 1-1.5 g/kg body weight protein, 30% total fat
      (preferably mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids), and vitamin A sources (1300 RAE). After 3
      months of intervention are completed, baseline measurements will be repeated. Statistical
      analysis will include descriptive stats and comparisons between groups (t-tests),
      significance will be defined as P < 0.05.
