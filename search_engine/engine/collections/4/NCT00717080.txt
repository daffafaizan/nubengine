      sub capsular cataract. Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is the preferred method of
      capsulotomy in cataract surgery. Anterior capsular contraction (ACO) is a unique complication
      following cataract surgery. The rate of which is higher in RP patients due to the weak
      zonules and the increased rate of inflammation. CTR has been proven to reduce the rate of
      contraction.

      Study population includes 40 eyes having RP with cataract. 20 eyes will receive CTR and the
      other 20 would not receive CTR. The percentage of anterior capsular contraction would be
      evaluated using EPCO software.
