      Participants are randomized to one of four different treatment arms. The treatment period is
      intended for 12 weeks of use. Based on the clinical investigation plan, participants are
      informed that their stimulation settings can change between the first and second halves of
      the treatment period and that the differences may be perceptually noticeable. Differences in
      tinnitus severity scores will be compared between and within treatment arms.
