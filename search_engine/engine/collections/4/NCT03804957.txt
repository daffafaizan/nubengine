      risk is a goal of those who perform these procedures, particularly a reduction in large
      pneumothoraces requiring intervention (eg, pleural drainage) and hospitalization (Clayton et
      al. 2016). Recently, autologous blood patch injection (ABPI) inside the biopsy track has been
      suggested as an effective mean of sealing the punctured lung thus halting air loss and
      consequently pneumothorax (Graffy et al. 2017).

      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the rate of postoperative
      pneumothorax between standard CT-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) versus CNB followed by ABPI.

      In particular, the main objectives are to compare:

        1. incidence of immediate pneumothorax

        2. incidence of late pneumothorax (2 hrs)

        3. incidence of chest tube placement

        4. duration of the procedure
