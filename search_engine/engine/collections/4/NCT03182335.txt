      recorded at two time points:

        1. prior to awakening from sedation

        2. during the awakening from sedation trial The vasoactive infusion will be titrated to a
           mean arterial pressure as determined by the medical team prior to study enrollment. Each
           enrolled patient will have measurements taken only on the first day of enrollment.
           Enrolled subjects will also have a delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU tool before the
           awakening from sedation trial and during the awakening from sedation trial.
