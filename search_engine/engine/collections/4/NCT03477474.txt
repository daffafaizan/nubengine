    
      This is a prospective, descriptive registry of people with advanced cancer for whom a
      Guardant360 assay has been ordered by their health care providers. The registry is divided
      into modules according to primary cancer diagnosis. Module 1 includes subjects with advanced
      NSCLC with additional modules added later in the study.

      All eligible people for whom blood for a Guardant360 assay has been collected will be invited
      to participate in the registry. Subject demographics and relevant medical history will be
      collected at the time of enrollment. Information on tumor molecular testing, treatment
      decisions, and clinical outcomes from the time of enrollment will be collected in a
      prospective manner. The registry does not require any specific treatments or procedures but
      rather collects information on the treatment journey of each participant. Subjects may
      participate in other clinical studies while also participating in GEODE.
