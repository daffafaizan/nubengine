      Patients receive a phenylalanine restricted diet based on a medical food such as Phenyl-free,
      Lofenalac, PKU 3, or Maximum XP (may be supplemented with tyrosine as needed) to achieve a
      target blood phenylalanine level of 2-6 mg/dL. The diet begins approximately 3 months prior
      to conception and continues until delivery of the baby. Patients are evaluated once a month
      before conception and weekly during pregnancy. Patients also undergo sonographic examination
      at 8, 20, 28, and 34 weeks gestation. At birth, the cord blood is evaluated for plasma amino
      acids. If the baby is found to have an elevated phenylalanine level, blood and urine are
      obtained to determine the baby's genetic status. Phenylalanine and tyrosine levels are
      checked in the baby daily for three days after birth.

      The baby is followed for physical and mental development at 3 and 6 months and then annually
      thereafter.
