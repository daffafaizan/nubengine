      glucose excursions â‰¥ 140 mg/dl in a real-life, home environment. At baseline, subjects
      underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 72 hr of out-patient continuous glucose
      monitoring. They were treated with acarbose (50 mg with meals three times daily) for 6 weeks
      and repeat 72 hr CGMS profiles were obtained at the end of the study.
