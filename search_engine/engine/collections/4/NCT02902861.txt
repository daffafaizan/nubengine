      regimen and to thus optimize the efficacy and safety of MTX treatment for patients with
      moderate to severe psoriasis. In view of the described risk-benefit profile of MTX, an
      initial dose of at least 15 mg per week administered subcutaneously followed by 5 mg folic
      acid p.o. 24 hours after MTX application seems appropriate. Since 20 mg MTX per week has been
      proven to be beneficial in a considerable part of patients, who did not respond sufficiently
      to 15 mg MTX per week, in this study the dosing starts with a dose of 17.5 mg MTX per week,
      administered subcutaneously. At such a starting dose, it was expected to find the highest MTX
      efficacy possible, but with appropriate safety margins. If in a patient, a "50% reduction of
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index" PASI50 response is not achieved in week 8, the dose will be
      increased to 22.5 mg MTX per week. All dosages used in this study lay within the approved
      dosing range of MTX. The study will be conducted in a double-blind, placebo controlled
      manner. Placebo was chosen as control since only this comparator allows a reliable
      interpretation of safety and efficacy data.
