      cosmetic dermatology. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in
      achieving what clinically appears to be permanent reduction in hair density in treated areas.
      We postulate that in order to achieve permanent hair reduction, stem cells located in the
      bulge region of the follicle must be destroyed. Recently, a marker of follicular stem cells
      (keratin 15) has been identified and noted to be detectable using immunohistochemical
      techniques. In addition, several other immunohistochemical markers for various components of
      the hair follicle are available.

      We propose to quantitatively measure the effects of laser hair removal on the
      immunohistochemical staining properties of treated follicles with respect to keratin 15 and
      other follicular markers. We hypothesize that the degree of such staining will be greatly
      reduced following laser therapy, thus providing, to our knowledge, the first biochemical
      evidence to support permanence of the treatment's effects.
