      crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of a newly developed formulation with a conventional formulation in healthy
      subjects.

      For this, a single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, 2-period and 2-sequence
      crossover study with a 14-day washout period was conducted in 26 healthy volunteers. Plasma
      samples for the analysis of finasteride/tamsulosin were collected up to 48 h after drug
      administration. Participants received either reference (in combination of of 0.2mg tamsulosin
      and 5mg finasteride) or test drug formulation (single pill combination of 0.2mg tamsulosin
      and 5mg finasteride) in the first period and the alternative formulation in the second
      period. Plasma concentrations of both tamsulosin and finasteride were determined by validated
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were determined by noncompartmental
      analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using log-transformed Cmax and AUC,
      and the mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. According to
      regulatory requirements set forth by Korea and the US Food and Drug Administration, products
      meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the 90% CIs of the mean ratios for Cmax and AUC are
      within the range of 0.80 to 1.25.
