      like meningitis and blood poisoning. There are ~90 strains, some are more dangerous than
      others in the severity of the disease they cause. Around half of all children carry
      pneumococci at the back of their nose without any ill effect. Pneumococcal vaccines (PCV)
      have been given in the national immunisation schedule since 2006. Vaccines protect
      individuals by making antibodies to be made in the blood and these vaccines help to clear the
      pneumococci from the nose, which helps control disease in the population by stopping their
      onward transmission when children cough and sneeze. This clearing effect is specific to the
      strains that are included in the vaccine. The first vaccines used included seven (PCV7)
      strains and the one used currently includes 13 (PCV13).

      This group has conducted three previous carriage studies, and this will be the fourth. The
      first was before any vaccine was used, the second just after PCV7 was introduced and the
      third after the UK moved to using PCV13. These carriage studies allow assessment of how the
      strains in the nose change over time, in that by clearing some strains away which other
      strains take up those niches in their place both in children and in their close/household
      contacts. This helps to inform the best use of the vaccines available and for future vaccine
      development and which strains would be useful to include.

      All families registered at participating surgeries, with a child aged 1-5 years, will be
      invited to take part. The study involves a single nasopharyngeal swab and a saliva swab from
      the child and as many other household members as are happy to participate. Participants may
      be seen at their GP surgery or in the home if more mutually convenient
