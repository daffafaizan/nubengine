    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of adjuvant AD 32 following complete transurethral
      resection versus transurethral resection alone in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent
      superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. II. Assess the toxicity of AD 32 in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      receive surgery with AD 32 or surgery alone. Arm I: Patients undergo surgery to remove
      bladder tumors. AD 32 is administered by catheter into the bladder within 2-24 hours after
      surgery. Patients must hold the AD 32 liquid in the bladder for 90 minutes. Arm II: Patients
      undergo only surgery to remove bladder tumors. Patients with T1 or Tis disease may receive
      BCG therapy once weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of rest. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 300 patients.
