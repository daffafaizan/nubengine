      by ingestion of eggs from a tapeworm of genus Taenia. Inflammation, seizures, or neurologic
      problems may occur in a patient with NCC. Corticosteroids are the current standard of care
      for NCC patients, but corticosteroids have many side effects. Albendazole is used to treat
      infections caused by worms; however, it is unclear if its use with the corticosteroid
      dexamethasone will decrease seizure frequency in NCC patients. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy of reducing seizure frequency with a short course of dexamethasone
      with tapered dosing when given with albendazole, as compared to standard dexamethasone and
      albendazole treatment, in NCC patients.

      In this open label study, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Group I will
      receive 6 mg dexamethasone daily for 10 days only. Group II will receive 6 mg dexamethasone
      daily for 10 days, then 8 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 weeks with a 2-week taper. Both groups
      will also receive albendazole and omeprazole (a medicine that helps prevent gastroesophageal
      disease [GERD], a side effect of corticosteroid use). There will be 13 study visits over a
      360-day period. Blood collection will occur at most visits. Group II will also undergo sputum
      smears and rapid culture testing on Days 14, 28, and 42. Patients will undergo magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) at screening and on Day 180 and computed tomography (CT) scanning on
      Day 360.
