      the government to provide education and care for patients for a broad range of health issues,
      including diabetes mellitus (DM). However, few CHW are trained for diabetes education and
      little is known about the effectiveness of their interventions. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of a diabetes education program delivered to CHW in improving the
      metabolic control of patients with type 2 DM.

      Materials and methods: the study is a randomized controlled trial conducted in a primary care
      unit. Eight CHW, providing care for 118 patients, are randomized in two groups to receive a
      one-month diabetes education program (intervention group, patients n= 62) or an education
      course in other health issues (control group, patients n= 56). Each CHW is responsible for
      transmitting the acquired knowledge to patients from their respective working areas. The
      primary outcome is change in HbA1C three months after intervention.
