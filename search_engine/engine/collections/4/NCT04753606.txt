      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of obicetrapib as an adjunct to
      high-intensity statin therapy. The screening period for this study will take up to 2-weeks.
      Afterwards patients will be randomized to placebo, 5 mg obicetrapib or 10 mg obicetrapib for
      an 8-week treatment period. After the treatment period, patients will continue for a 4-week
      safety follow-up and a 15-week PK follow-up.
