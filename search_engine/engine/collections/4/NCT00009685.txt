    
      This is a Phase I randomized, controlled, double-blinded dose escalation study to examine
      toxicity, dose and immune response of an HIV plasmid DNA vaccine. The vector used in this
      study has been optimized for improved safety, expression and immunogenicity. We hypothesize
      that this vaccine will elicit immune responses to HIV. All work will be conducted at the
      National Institutes of Health.

      Healthy, HIV-negative volunteers will be recruited and pre-screened to confirm that they meet
      all of the eligibility requirements for participation. Educational materials on DNA vaccines
      will be reviewed with and provided to participants before enrollment into the study. There
      will be 3 groups of 7 volunteers. Each group will receive a constant dose of the vaccine
      pGag(del fs)Pol delta PR delta RT delta IN/h (5 people) or a phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
      control (2 people) by intramuscular inoculation. Once safety has been established, successive
      groups will receive a higher dose. Study groups will receive three immunizations containing
      either 0.5 mg (Group 1), 1.5 mg (Group 2), or 4.0 mg (Group 3) of a DNA vaccine. Dose
      escalation will be initiated 5 weeks after the last volunteer in the previous dose group
      receives their first inoculation, providing there are no significant toxicities.

      Vaccine-related adverse reactions will be evaluated at scheduled study visits and by study
      participant report. Immune response will be evaluated as described in Appendix II. Specimens
      to evaluate immunogenicity will be taken at baseline, and at the time points indicated in
      Appendix VIII. Unless contraindicated, subsequent inoculations using repeat plasmid
      vaccinations will be given 28 and 56 days after the first vaccinations. The estimated
      duration for each volunteer to complete immunizations and follow-up is 12 months.
