      treatment of bulky or advanced stage disease. The primary aim of post-treatment surveillance
      is to detect early recurrences and guide additional therapy. There is no definitive agreement
      on the best practice for cervical cancer surveillance. Most recurrences are detected based on
      patient history and physical exam as there is limited data to support cervicovaginal cytology
      and routine use of imaging in follow up. Novel non-invasive biomarkers are needed to monitor
      disease status, detect early recurrence and guide personalized treatment decisions.
      Biospecimens including urine and blood plasma will be collected from patients presenting to
      the UNC Department of Gynecology Oncology and Multidisciplinary clinics with newly diagnosed
      cervical cancer to assess for HPVDNA. Archived or residual tissue will also be accessed. For
      patients who undergo definitive management with surgery or chemoradiation, a post-treatment
      blood plasma and urine sample will be collected 2-6 weeks after completion and will be
      compared to pre-therapy ctHPVDNA and TrHPVDNA levels.
