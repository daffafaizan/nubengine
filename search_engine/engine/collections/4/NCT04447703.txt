      I. Perform user-testing of an education and patient history collection mobile tool among
      medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and urologists across study practice settings,
      including Veterans Affairs to address genetic referrals needs (n=10 providers).
      (Provider-focused)

      II. Develop multimedia web-based pretest genetic education (WBGE) tool and conduct a
      randomized trial of traditional genetic counseling (GC) (Arm 1) versus (vs.) WBGE (Arm 2) for
      informed and timely uptake of genetic testing for men with lethal/predicted lethal prostate
      cancer (PCA). (Patient-focused)

      OUTLINE:

      ARM I (TRADITIONAL GENETIC COUNSELING): Patients receive genetic counseling with a certified
      genetic counselor in-person, by telehealth, or over the phone (according to patient
      preference). Patients may then undergo genetic testing.

      ARM II (WEB-BASED GENETIC EDUCATION): Patients receive a link to the web-based genetic
      education tool online including all elements of genetic counseling in written modules and in
      a series of professional videos. Patients may then undergo genetic testing. Patients may
      cross-over to Arm I to see a genetic counselor.

      After the completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for up to 5 years.
