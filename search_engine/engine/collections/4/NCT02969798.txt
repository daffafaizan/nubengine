    
      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell
           function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated
           impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): (i) treatment with the renal Sodium-glucose
           co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the
           inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also DPP4, saxagliptin ; (iii) treatment with the
           thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

        2. To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell
           function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated
           impaired fasting glucose (IFG): (i) treatment with the renal SGLT2 inhibitor,
           dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin; (iii) treatment with
           the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

        3. To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell
           function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with combined
           impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) plus impaired fasting glucose (IFG): i) treatment with
           the renal SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor,
           saxagliptin; (iii) treatment with the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment
           with the biguanide, metformin.
