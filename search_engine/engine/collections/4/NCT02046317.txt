      using echo friendly needle is very limited. More so, there is even less information regarding
      ultrasound guided nerve blocks using echogenic versus standard of care needles.

      This study hopes to add to the general knowledge of pain management in the emergency
      department (ED) setting and provide a unique perspective on ultrasound-guided techniques
      using echogenic needles to enhance accuracy and success rate of nerve blocks in ED patients.

      The study design will have two comparative arms; in both arms we use the same local
      anesthetic which is Bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine; in all cases a total of 15 mL will be
      injected around the femoral nerve. Once identified with ultrasound, 5 ml will be injected at
      lateral, medial, and posterior aspect of the nerve. The experimental arm will receive an FNB
      using an echogenic needle; and the control group will receive an FNB using standard of care
      needles.
