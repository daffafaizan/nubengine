      therapy. Vedolizumab is an intravenous infusion given at increasing intervals. The first
      infusion of vedolizumab will be considered baseline. Patients may be enrolled at baseline or
      at colonoscopy prior to the first scheduled infusion of vedolizumab (pre-treatment visit).
      The standard induction protocol for vedolizumab consists of infusions at week 0 (baseline),
      week 2, and week 6. Vedolizumab, as per standard-of-care, is then continued at an interval of
      every 8 weeks following induction therapy. Vedolizumab treatment will be prescribed as per
      standard practice and will be prescribed regardless of participation in this study. Patients
      will not receive medication for the sole purpose of this research. Treatment decisions
      including timing of wash out period between anti-TNf and vedolizumab will be made by the
      subject's physician and not per the research protocol. There will not be a protocolized
      washout period for patients previously receiving anti-TNF therapy because treatment will be
      standard of care and per the directing physician.

      Standard of care laboratory tests will be performed by the clinical laboratory at Mount Sinai
      Hospital. All other measurements will be completed at Prometheus Therapeutics & Diagnostics
      in San Diego, California or at a Takeda identified lab for vedolizumab concentrations and
      antibodies.
