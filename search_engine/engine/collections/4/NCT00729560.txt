      PCOS. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that testosterone increases urinary clearance
      of D-chiro-inositol (uCl(DCI) in PCOS, and that this serves as the explanation for the
      correlation between uClDCI and insulin sensitivity. While we regard this possibility as
      unlikely, it is important that it be tested. To accomplish this, we will assess obese (Body
      Mass Index (BMI) >30 kg/m2) women with and without PCOS at baseline, and again after 4 weeks
      of androgen action blockade with the drug flutamide. Flutamide is an antiandrogen that works
      by blocking the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor.

      We will determine if this pharmacologic blockade i) decreases the renal clearance of DCI, ii)
      increases the circulating concentration of DCi, and iii) enhances the insulin-stimulated
      release of the D-chiro-inositol-containing inositolphosphoglycan (DCI-IPG) mediator during an
      OGTT.
