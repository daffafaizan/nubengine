747. electrode size and tissue po2 measurement in rats exposedto air or high pressure oxygena comparison has been made of values ofpo2 recorded in several rat tissues with60-u or 330-u flexible gold electrodes.although qualitatively both sizes of elec-trodes give similar results, the quantitativevalues of po2 differ.  such large differ-ences as are found in some cases betweenelectrodes varying only in physical di-mensions are thought to reflect the amountof trauma caused in the tissue under in-vestigation due to electrode insertion.errors in po2 estimations due to tissue da-mage are considered to outweigh any othererrors such as those due to electrodecalibration.  soft, highly vascular tissues,such as liver, kidney and spleen, whichshow macroscopic bruising over quite alarge area when electrodes are inserted,show the greatest difference in estimationsof the po2 value.  recordings of tissuepo2 were made while animals breathed airand when compressed to 4 or 5 atm. inpure oxygen, and the pattern of response oftissue po2 to such exposure of the ani-mal to high pressures of oxygen is described.
