      to evaluate clinical safety and efficacy in patients aged 10-17 years. The patients may have
      been treated with Metformin or have had no antidiabetic drug treatment in the previous three
      months.

      Study Hypothesis: Colesevelam oral suspension for pediatric subjects with T2DM is safe, well
      tolerated, and shows improved blood sugar control (as evidenced by a significant change from
      baseline in hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c]).
