      inflammation of the body. For this reason, anti-inflammatory foods such as omega-3 fatty
      acids, which are found in fish and nuts, are used. However, the disadvantage of fish as a
      resource is its limited availability. Therefore, it is of great interest to provide a
      resource-saving diet that still supplies us with all macro and micro nutrients. For this
      reason, microalgae have become the focus of science in recent years. Microalgae not only
      serve as a source of protein, but also contain a large number of nutrients that could have
      possible physiological and preventive effects in human nutrition. These include substances
      from the group of carotenoids and the various polyunsaturated FS found in microalgae.

      The microalgae PT is rich in omega-3 FS eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is otherwise found
      mainly in fatty fish, and could therefore be an alternative or vegetarian source of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids.

      Previous work by U. Neumann has shown that the microalgae P. tricornutum could be used for
      human nutrition. No toxic effects could be observed in vivo and the bioavailability of fatty
      acids and proteins could also be successfully demonstrated. In vitro experiments also showed
      a more anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative effect on human blood cells.
      For this reason, a health-promoting effect is also possible in human nutrition, but this must
      be proven in human studies.
