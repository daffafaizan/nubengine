      may decrease the reproductive function. Many researchers have already proven improvement on
      reproductive function after antioxidant (melatonin) administration. The investigators wish to
      study the relationship between unexplained, young poor ovarian responder and oxidative
      stress.

      This is an randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of melatonin to improve the
      quality of sleep and reduce the oxidative stress. 100 patients will be randomized in to two
      groups, the one with melatonin administration for 2 weeks and the other with placebo
      administration. Each group will be composed of 2 sub groups, poor responders and normal
      responders.

      Then the serum and the follicular fluid will be collected at the time of oocyte retrieval and
      melatonin concentration oxidative stress marker will be measured.
