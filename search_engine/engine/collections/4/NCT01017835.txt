      the fact that hypertension frequently coexists with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes which
      increase the risk of CVDs development, it is advisable to use the optimal combined therapy
      (hypotensive + hypolipidemic + hypoglycemic)in this group of patients. Statins are the most
      effective and widely used drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. According to the
      available experimental and clinical data they may decrease the blood pressure (BP) in
      normotensive and hypertensive patients. However, it is still difficult to determine to what
      degree the reduction of both blood pressure and cardiovascular risk is due to hypotensive or
      hypolipidemic/pleiotropic effects of statins.
