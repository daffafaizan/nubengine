      pneumonia, one group was treated with dexamethasone 6 mg/day by mouth and the other with 4
      mg/day intravenously. The apparent volume of distribution was 1 L/kg in both groups, but the
      half-life after oral administration was approximately 7 hours, and after intravenous
      administration 9 hours. The bioavailability of oral dexamethasone was 81% (95% CI = 54-121%).
      However, the biological half-life of dexamethasone is much longer, of the order of 36-54 h
      compared with 18-36 h for prednisolone.
