    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open, non-intervention clinical study, with estimated
      enrollment of 200 newly diagnosed adult ALL patients. After the first course of treatment
      administered with PLD-contained or DNR-contained VDCLD regimen, CR rate and changes of
      leukemia stem cells in bone marrow, was evaluated; the safety of these chemotherapy was also
      evaluated.

      Study Patients:

      Patients included in this study should be untreated with ALL previously, being in line with
      the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

      Dosage and Administration:

      PLD-contained VDCLD regimen：PLD 36 mg/m2 ivdrip over 60 minutes( d1、15),VCR 1.4mg/m
      iv(d1，8，15，22), CTX 800 mg/m2 ivdrip( d1), L-asp 6000u/m2 ivdrip(d19～28),Dex10mg ivdrip
      (d1～28).

      DNR-contained VDCLD regimen：DNR 45 mg/m2 ivdrip over 60 minutes(d1～3),VCR 1.4mg/m2
      iv(d1，d8，d15，d22), CTX 800 mg/m2 ivdrip(d1), L-asp 6000u/m2 ivdrip(d19～28),Dex10mg
      ivdrip(d1～28).

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint of the study was complete remission (CR) rates after
      the first course of regimen. The proportion of patients achieved CR was evaluated, after the
      first course of induction chemotherapy administered with PLD-contained or DNR-contained VDCLD
      regimen Secondary endpoint: The change of leukemia stem cells in bone marrow, was evaluated
      before and after administered with PLD-contained or DNR-contained VDCLD regimen.

      Safety Assessment:

      In order to adjust the treatment strategy and ensure patients' safety effectively, routine
      blood test, transaminases, and creatinine was monitored on time during the period, while lung
      CT and ECG was performed based on clinical need. Possible adverse reactions and tolerability
      during treatment, such as gastrointestinal reactions, cardiac function, as well as
      discontinuation ratio due to side effects or tolerability of PLD, was recorded.

      Statistical Analysis:

      All the calculations were performed with the SPSS statistical software. The continuous
      variables were performed with T test; categorical variables were performed withχ2 test. After
      acceptance of various observation records sheets, data were unified processed.
