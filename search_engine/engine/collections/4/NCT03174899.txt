      function permits assessment of disease progression, and periodic assessment of renal function
      is necessary for optimal management of a patient with suspected/proven renal disease. Serum
      creatinine (S Cr), blood urea (BU), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived
      from creatinine clearance are useful for monitoring renal function; however, these indirect
      measures of renal filtration are imperfect and cannot assess single kidney function.

      Keeping in view the limitations of serum markers, imaging may play an important role in the
      evaluation of renal parenchymal disease. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomographic (CT)
      scan provide good anatomic images but limited functional information. Although US may show
      changes in renal echogenicity, it suffers from operator dependency and lacks objectivity. In
      addition to exposure to ionizing radiation, computed tomography (CT) scan requires use of
      iodinated contrast material, which is undesirable in patients with renal dysfunction.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the unique ability to show both structure and function
      objectively without any radiation exposure to the patient. Functional MRI techniques such as
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging have potential
      utility in the evaluation of renal function .
