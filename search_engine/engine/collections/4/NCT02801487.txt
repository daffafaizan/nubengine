      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) along with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD in the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be treated with
      CIRT with escalating dose starting from 52.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to potentially
      62.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) along with concurrent chemotherapy (40 mg/m^2, weekly) to
      evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed
      during and within 4 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
      Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is used for the phase I dose
      escalating part of the trial and approximately 25 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD in
      the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD
      will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the
      Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the trial will be a single phase single arm
      study.
