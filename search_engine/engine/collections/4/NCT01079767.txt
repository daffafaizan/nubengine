      Primary

        -  To determine the 3-month disease-control rate according to RECIST criteria in patients
           with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the 3-month objective response rate according to RECIST criteria in these
           patients.

        -  To determine the 1-month metabolic response rate on PET/CT scan in these patients.

        -  To determine the 1-month perfusion response rate on hepatic perfusion CT scan in these
           patients.

        -  To determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess quality of life according to QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires.

        -  To determine the clinical and biological tolerance of this drug in these patients.

        -  To determine the rate of m-TOR pathway activation and VEGF level.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in select patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats once a week
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo
      fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan and
      perfusion CT scan of the liver at baseline and periodically during study treatment.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires (QLC-C30 and QLQ-HCC18) periodically. Some
      patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection periodically for pharmacological and
      laboratory studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 24 months.
