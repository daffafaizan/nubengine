    
      All patients included in the "FRENCHIE" registry (Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients
      hospitalized within 48h from symptom onset) are eligible, and will be asked for their written
      informed consent for this nested study in case of the absence of any non-inclusion criteria.

      Baseline clinical examination and laboratory tests are based on the usual care and are those
      collected in "FRENCHIE".

      A simplified polygraphy is performed during the hospitalization for AMI. Starting and ending
      of the recording will be programmed based on patient interview regarding usual sleep hours.

      Together with the polygraphy, questionnaires will be given to the patient regarding general
      sleep quality

      Polygraphic data will be scored in centralized manner. Results of the polygraphy will be sent
      to the cardiology department with advice for treatment and follow-up. If necessary, the
      core-lab will provide tele-counseling regarding SDB management to centers.

      Follow-up will be performed through the national administrative databases, as in the
      "FRENCHIE" registry.
