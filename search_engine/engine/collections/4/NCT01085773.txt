      Diabetes Mellitus.

      Programs which include physical activity as a component in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes
      as well as other chronic diseases have in Denmark and other countries been based on "Exercise
      on Prescription schemes". In Denmark, these schemes have focused on individual behavioral
      change and an exercise program for 16 weeks. No studies have documented whether "Exercise on
      Prescription" helps patients with Type 2 Diabetes to change their lifestyle behavior or
      whether it has a positive impact on measurements for physical capacity and glucose
      metabolism.

      Nordic Walking is a fitness type of walking; incorporating the use of specially designed
      walking sticks. Nordic Walking focuses on aerobic training where the additional activity of
      the arms increases a person's oxygen uptake and energy expenditure.

      In Denmark, many activity programs and concepts such as Exercise on Prescription and Nordic
      Walking are recommended to patients with Type 2 Diabetes but their efficacy has not been
      demonstrated.

      It is unknown whether one specific type of physical training program is more suitable than
      another, when comparing the physical effects as well as the ability to induce good compliance
      and change in lifestyle.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of two different
      physical exercise programs lasting 4 months aiming at introducing long term life style
      changes in physical activity with a follow-up period of 8 months in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
