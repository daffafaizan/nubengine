      disease is found in 25%-70% of HCC at diagnosis, with a median survival time of only 4.2-7.9
      months due to limited treatment options. To date, sorafenib is the only standard treatment
      shown to extend overall survival for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC). However, low
      response rates, modest survival advantages and high-level heterogeneity of individual
      response, such limitations of sorafenib prohibit its widespread use in Ad-HCC and more
      alternative therapies are highly required at present.

      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) can provide chemotherapeutic agents to liver at
      higher concentration with lower toxicity and has been reported favorable results in advanced
      HCC. However, HAIC provides good but variable outcomes, with a response rate of 7-81% and
      median survival time of 6-15.9 months. The unstable response may attribute to complicate
      combinations based on various drugs, including fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, doxorubicin,
      mitomycin, leucovorin and interferon. FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-FU/leucovorin) was a regimen
      first used in colon cancer with liver metastasis and reported to be effective both by
      systemic and HAIC in amounts of clinical trials. A recent phase II study has shown that HAI
      of FOLFOX (HAIF) was well tolerated and effective in Ad-HCC. To the investigator's knowledge,
      no clinical studies have been developed on comparing the survival benefit of HAIF with
      sorafenib for patients with Ad-HCC. In this phase III trial, the investigators aimed to
      compare survival outcome, response rate and safety of HAIF with sorafenib in patients with
      Ad-HCC.
