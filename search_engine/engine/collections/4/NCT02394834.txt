    
      The drug being tested in this study is called Panitumumab. This exploratory study will
      investigate biomarkers which may be predictors of efficacy and safety of treatment with
      mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab therapy in patients with
      chemotherapy-na√Øve unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.

      Tumor tissue samples obtained from the participants who enrolled in the safety/efficacy study
      of Panitumumab + mFOLFOX versus bevacizumab + mFOLFOX (PARADIGM Study: NCT02394795) and
      provided consent for this additional study will be used. Mutations, amplification and
      rearrangement of predefined tumor-associated genes will be investigated using DNA collected
      from tumor samples used for assessing RAS mutations and plasma free DNA collected before
      administration of cycle 1 and at the discontinuation of the protocol treatment in the main
      study.
