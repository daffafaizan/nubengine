      for lumbar spinal stenosis with a grade I spondylolisthesis. The major question is whether or
      not instrumented pedicle screw fusion should be undertaken when a decompressive laminectomy
      is performed to relieve neural compression. This multi-center, randomized, prospective
      clinical study aims to address this question by testing the hypothesis that adding
      instrumented fusion to a decompression for this spinal problem will improve long-term patient
      outcomes.
