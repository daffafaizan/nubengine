      For example, large scale meta-analyses have reported shift workers to be at increased risk of
      developing type 2 diabetes and of experiencing a coronary event, compared to day working
      employees.

      Shift work causes complex changes in physiology (desynchrony of circadian rhythms) and
      behaviors including activity, sleep and eating patterns. The importance of meal timing is
      becoming increasingly recognized in both chronobiology and nutrition fields, with emerging
      awareness of 'chrono-nutrition', the interaction between nutrition and circadian time.

      Given the importance to the economy of a healthy aging workforce, and the increase in shift
      work prevalence, it is important to establish if diet modification can reduce the health
      disparities between shift and day working employees.
