      Ventricular mass, reversible upon correction of the hypercortisolism. This may be due to
      cardiac steatosis, previously demonstrated in patients with diabetes mellitus. This study
      aims at evaluating the myocardial triglyceride content and cardiac structure and function,
      using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), in
      patients with Cushing's syndrome and in age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy volunteers. The
      patients will be stratified into two groups in function of the presence or absence of
      diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose and will be evaluated twice: before and 6 months after
      efficient treatment of Cushing's syndrome. We make the hypothesis that Cushing's syndrome
      patients compared to healthy subjects have excess lipid storage in cardiac myocytes
      irrespectively of the glucose homeostasis status, and that this lipid content will decrease
      after the correction of hypercortisolism.
