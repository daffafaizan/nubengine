        -  Determine the safety of carboplatin and thalidomide in patients with stage IC-IV ovarian
           cancer.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic effect of thalidomide in this patient population.

        -  Compare the efficacy of carboplatin with or without thalidomide in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 4 weeks
           for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin as in arm I. Patients receive thalidomide orally
           once daily. Thalidomide treatment continues for up to 24 weeks commencing on the first
           day of carboplatin therapy and ceasing 4 weeks after the last course of carboplatin.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
