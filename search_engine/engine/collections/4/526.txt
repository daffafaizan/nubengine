1172. studies on selenium toxicity and chondroitin sulfate and taurinebiosynthesis in the chick embryofourteen-day-old chick embryos were used in in vivo experiments.  a toxicselenite treatment did not cause a reduction in the extent of sulfate-sincorporation into chondroitin sulfate or into taurine or a reduction in theobserved tissue levels of these metabolites.  rather, the taurine level wassignificantly greater with the embryos which received selenium.  the extent ofthe incorporation of selenite-se into the metabolites was low or notsignificant.
