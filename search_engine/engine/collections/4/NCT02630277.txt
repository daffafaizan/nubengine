      treatment of PDR with intravitreal aflibercept injection. Additionally, the study will
      identify biomarker mediators in vitreous fluid present at baseline in patients with PDR and
      will track over the course of a year their profile changes in response to these two dosing
      regimens. The treatment regimens will provide information on the biomarker profile with a
      monthly regimen as well as with a variable regimen. Furthermore, biomarker mediators that may
      be associated with anti-VEGF responders and non-responders may also be identified. 105
      biomarker mediators (cytokines/chemokines) which have been identified as playing a role in
      PDR in published studies will be profiled in patients with PDR.
