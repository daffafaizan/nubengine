      controlled environment in the operating room. The hypothesis is that rapid sequence
      intubation or other urgent airway procedures performed with the biocontainment device will be
      safe and can be performed in an equivalent manner to urgent airway procedures without the
      biocontainment device. Methods to minimize bias include randomizing patients to intubation
      with or without the biocontainment device.
