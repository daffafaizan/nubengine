      determine whether treatment with fosinopril 20 mg/day and/or pravastatin 40 mg/ day will
      prevent cardiovascular and renal disease in nonhypertensive (RR <160/100 mm Hg and not using
      antihypertensive medication) and nonhypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol <8.0 or <5.0
      mmol/L in case of previous myocardial infarction and not using lipid lowering medication) men
      and women with persistent microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion >10 mg/L once in an
      early morning spot urine and 15 to 300 mg/24-hour at least once in two 24-hour urine
      collections). The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENdstage Disease Intervention Trial is a
      single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial
      design. The 864 randomized subjects will be monitored for a minimum of 4 years and a maximum
      of 5 years. The primary efficacy parameter is defined as the combined incidence of all-cause
      mortality or hospital admission for documented (1) nonfatal myocardial infarction, (2)
      myocardial ischemia, (3) heart failure, (4) peripheral vascular disease, (5) cerebrovascular
      accident and/or (6) end-stage renal disease.
