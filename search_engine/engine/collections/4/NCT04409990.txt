      radiology department for pretreatment evaluation.

      During the investigation, patients will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS). During the ERUS, the tissue stiffness of the lesion and
      visible lymph nodes will be measured using the SWE technology.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Tumour stiffness measurement by SWE gives a statistically significantly higher value in
           malignant processes than in benign rectal tumors.

        2. Tissue stiffness measurement with SWE gives a statistically significantly higher value
           in lymph node metastases than in reactive enlarged lymph nodes.

        3. There is a statistically significant correlation between SWE and MRI apparent diffusion
           coefficient (ADC)

      Histopathology report of surgical specimen will serve as endpoint.
