      instructed to brush and immerse their dentures in 4 different storage solutions (S1: 0.25%
      sodium hypochlorite; S2: 0.5% sodium hypochlorite; S3: 10% R. communis; and S4:
      Saline/Control). The interventions were randomly performed in a double blind and crossover
      format with washout periods. After 7 days of brushing and storage, the biofilm formed in the
      inner surfaces of dentures was disclosed and photographed to quantification. Candidiasis
      remission was assessed by scores and the patient satisfaction by a questionnaire.
      Antimicrobial activity of the solutions was determined by counting the Colony Forming Units
      (CFUs) of Streptococcus mutans, Candida spp., and gram-negative microorganisms. For
      collecting biofilm, each complete upper denture was placed in a Petri dish, its internal
      surface was brushed (Tek brush) with saline solution for 2 min, and the biofilm suspension
      was transferred to a test tube. After serial dilutions (100 - 10-3), 50 uL aliquots were
      seeded in Petri dishes containing Mitis salivarius agar base, CHROMagar CandidaÂ® and
      MacConkey agar for detecting S. mutans, Candida spp., or gram-negative microorganisms,
      respectively. After incubation, colonies were counted, and values in CFU/mL were calculated.
