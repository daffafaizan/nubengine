      recruited by family practitioners in the City of Ghent. The recruited patients are randomly
      selected into a control and intervention group. Based on the validated Promis instruments,
      all participants are interviewed face to face on their mental and social health at time 0 and
      after 6 weeks of intervention. Patients from the intervention group are contacted by
      Community health workers after the first interview. Community health workers offer emotional
      support to the patients through at least 8 contacts over 6 weeks. The control group receive
      care as usual and are offered support by community health workers after the second interview.
      In depth interviews (qualitative study) will be conducted among community health workers and
      patients after finalizing the post-intervention questionnaires.

      Research questions: What are the psychosocial consequences of social distancing for at-risk
      groups? Can community health workers reduce the psychosocial impact of physical distancing
      measures isolation?
