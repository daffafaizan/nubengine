      effectiveness of internet delivered Cognitive Beaviour Therapy (iCBT) and Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (iACT) on depressed mood among individuals with chronic pain relative to
      attention control (AC). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT and
      iACT on clinically relevant outcomes endorsed by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and
      Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). Adults with chronic non-cancer pain and major
      depression will be randomized to receive iACT, iCBT, or AC. The interventions comprise 7
      weekly online modules available through Therapist Assisted Online (TAO). Patients will be
      contacted weekly by a member of the study team who will be acting as their personalized
      "online therapy coach."
