growth retardation accompanying diabetes insipidus: an additionalmechanism?from the above considerations, we may divide patients with nephrogenicdiabetes insipidus into at least two categories: (1) those who fail to respondto currently available therapeutic products as well as to their own presumablynormal secretion of adh; (2) those with similar similar unresponsiveness totreatment but with presumably reduced secretion of adh.  the adh-growth hormonetheory may well account in part for growth retardation in the later group.
