      Advisory Panel that includes survivors, family members, health care professionals, and health
      system representatives. This phase of the study aims to conduct a pilot evaluation of the RC
      using a mixed method, single group study with a convenience sample of approximately 35
      survivors of HNC post primary cancer treatment, recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer
      Center HNC clinics. In addition to the RC intervention, participants will be required to
      attend 3 research assessments (pre intervention, post intervention, and 1 month follow-up)
      that are a combination of face-to-face visits and telephone calls.

      Quantitative data analysis will be exploratory and descriptive, and effect sizes will be
      calculated for all outcomes to help plan for a future, controlled trial. Means, standard
      deviations, and Cohen's d effect size will be calculated for normally distributed data. For
      non-normally distributed data, medians, ranges, and a nonparametric effect size r will be
      calculated. For qualitative analysis, all interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed
      verbatim, and analyzed using a two-phased, hybrid approach that is both deductive and
      inductive. Findings will be summarized and reported to the Advisory Panel, who will then make
      recommendations regarding any additional modifications to the RC. The research team will make
      final decisions about RC modifications and will finalize a version for future evaluation.
