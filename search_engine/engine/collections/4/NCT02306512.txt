    
      The aim of this study is to

        1. Determine the feasibility of using melanocytic markers such as Melanoma antigen
           recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) with fluorescence to clear surgical margins when
           compared to conventional MART-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the setting of MMS for LM
           (lentigo maligna type melanoma in situ).

        2. Compare the use of a cocktail of immunofluorescent markers such as, but not limited to,
           Sex-determining Region Y (SRY)-box 10 (SOX10), human melanoma black 45 (HMB-45), and
           Kiel-67 (Ki-67) to sections only stained with fluorescent MART-1 alone.

        3. Explore the value of using other combinations of immunofluorescent markers such as S-100
           with Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), Nestin with Ki-67, and
           HMB-45 with Lamin.
