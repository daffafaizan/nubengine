      most chronic diseases worldwide. Researches have mainly been focusing on the prevention of
      tooth caries with the awareness of this fact. The use of fluorides as well as pit-and-fissure
      sealants are the most common preventive applications against caries progression.Modern
      adhesives combine conventional conditioning, priming and bonding steps (etch-and-rinse
      adhesives) together into one or two bottle (self-etch adhesives) to ease adhesive protocols.
      However, it is still suspicious whether modern self-etch adhesives have equal bonding
      capacity to the conventional etch-and-rinse systems. Therefore, clinical trials are necessary
      to evaluate long-term adhesive performance of self-etch adhesives compared to the
      conventional etch-and-rinse ones.
