    
      The study consists of three parts: a single ascending dose escalation of IT VSV-IFNβ-NIS
      monotherapy, a monotherapy IV regimen selection phase and an expansion phase, designed to
      explore the safety and efficacy of the chosen monotherapy regimen alone or in combination
      with avelumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Monotherapy will also be
      explored in patients with pheochromocytoma and NET.

      Patients are required to have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, and in the
      IT-containing arms this lesion should be amenable for a one-time IT injection of
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS. At least one patient per IT cohort is required to have at least 2 measurable
      lesions per RECIST 1.1, one for a one-time IT injection of VSV-IFNβ-NIS and one to be used as
      a control. Priority enrollment in the IT-containing arms will be granted to patients with 2
      measurable lesions per RECIST 1.1. At least one patient per dose level should have metastatic
      colorectal cancer. In order to fulfil these requirements, at least 3 or 4 patients will be
      required per escalation dose cohort. Other tumor types of particular interest based on prior
      experience with VSV or oncolytic viruses include malignant melanoma and endometrial cancer.
      When more than one cohort is open simultaneously, slot assignment will be determined by the
      sponsor in consultation with the PIs.
