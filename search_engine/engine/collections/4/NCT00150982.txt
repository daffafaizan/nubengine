      drug (alefacept). Subjects enrolled will be given alefacept 7.5 mg intravenously on a weekly
      basis for 12 weeks. Response is assessed by improvement in the PASI score. The responders
      will get no further treatment and the nonresponders will receive additional 4 weeks of
      therapy. Skin biopsies will be obtained throughout the study and T-cell apoptosis will be
      correlated to clinical response. There is no placebo group. The duration of the study is
      approximately 1 year.
