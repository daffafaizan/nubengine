      It's estimated that 43% of pre-school children worldwide are anemic, in Argentina a national
      survey carried out in 2007 (last survey), showed that 34.5% of children less than 2 years old
      were anemic and that 50.8% of children 6 to 9 months old were anemic. Although there is a
      consensus on iron supplementation as a preventive strategy for anemia in infants, there is a
      poor adherence due mainly to mild gastrointestinal adverse effects and low prescription rates
      from pediatricians. On the other hand, the excess of iron can lead to genomic instability
      with structural and functional alterations on proteins, lipids and DNA. Weekly administration
      of iron has been proposed as an alternative of similar efficacy and higher effectiveness in
      older children and pregnant women, but sufficient evidence for infants is lacking.
