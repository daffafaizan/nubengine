      1, n=18 infants ages 9 months to 2 years will be administered an extemporaneous oral liquid
      formulation of HU on a single occasion followed by PK sampling. The dose administered will be
      ~20 mg/kg/day or the infant's usual daily dose. In Arm 2, n=30 children who range in age from
      2 to 18 years will be administered HU, both a sprinkle formulation and capsules (Droxia® 200
      mg), on two separate occasions separated by at least 1 day but no more than 30 days in a
      randomized, crossover fashion. The doses of HU on each occasion will be rounded to the
      nearest 200 mg and will not exceed 35 mg/kg or 2000 mg. We hypothesize that the PK profile of
      the sprinkle formulation will not differ significantly from the PK profile of Droxia®
      capsules in children and adolescents ages ≥2 - 18 years of age. Participants in both arms
      will be followed up to 30 days from receiving last HU dose.
