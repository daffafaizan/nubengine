      reduction of anxiety and stress of patients that was waiting cardiac catheterization. Method.
      This is a randomized clinical trial. The sample consisted of patients that was waiting
      cardiac catheterization who were divided into two groups: intervention group (patients who
      received nursing orientation with a validated guidance manual about this procedure) and
      control group (patients who received the routine nursing orientation). The subjects were
      consulted about the desire to participate, and those who agreed, signed the consent form. The
      patients were randomized to one of two groups (control or intervention), according to the
      sequence determined by the Random System. Randomization was carried out by a teacher who did
      not participate of any phase of this study. After randomization, the patients were instructed
      how to fill out the instruments. The primary end points were the anxiety and stress, which
      was evaluated in two moments (before and after the nursing orientation). The State Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI-state) was used to assess anxiety and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was
      used to assess stress. Subsequent to this first evaluation, the patients, both in the control
      group and in the intervention group, received the intervention by another profissional. After
      the patients were evaluated about anxiety and stress. Prior to the collection, the research
      project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee and the data was collected after its
      approval.
