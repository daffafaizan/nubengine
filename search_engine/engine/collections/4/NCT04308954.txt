    
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      Converging evidence suggests that GABAergic dysfunction occurs in FXS. The investigators wish
      to examine brain distribution of GABA (A) receptors in young adult males with FXS using
      hybrid PET/MRI with [18F]flumazenil. This project will study the distribution of GABA(A)
      receptors in 15 young male adults with FXS (18-30 years old) compared to 15 age-matched male
      subjects with idiopathic intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) as controls. Simultaneous
      PET/MRI acquisition is an optimal technique to study in vivo GABAergic dysfunction and GABAa
      receptor distribution.
