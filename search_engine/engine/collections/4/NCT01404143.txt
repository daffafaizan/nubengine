      between two different methods of subscapularis mobilization in shoulder arthroplasty:
      intra-substance division of the tendon "tenotomy" versus direct detachment of the
      subscapularis tendon from its insertion on the lesser tuberosity "the peel". The primary
      outcome is strength as measured by a hand-held dynamometer in the belly-press position at
      one-year post operative. Secondary research questions include determination of the difference
      in disease specific quality of life between patients who undergo a subscapularis tenotomy
      versus subscapularis peel, as measured by the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      Index (WOOS), Constant score and the ASES score at one year post-operatively. Finally, the
      healing rate of the subscapularis, as measured by ultrasound at 1 year post-operative will be
      determined.
