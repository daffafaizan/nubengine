      physician inertia in the medical treatment of hypertension (HTN). In the current reactive
      physician-centered model, blood pressure (BP) is measured and medical decisions are made in
      the physician office; when deciding whether or not to prescribe new medication for a high
      office BP reading, the physician's default behavior is inaction. The investigators propose
      default medication intensification as a new patient-centered/pharmacist-assisted proactive
      treatment model to eliminate physician inertia. For enrolled patients with office BP>155/95,
      the physician will prescribe a one-month protocol that automatically escalates drug dose and
      drug number each week. The pharmacist will fill the prescription in a blister pack to
      simplify adherence. The patient will measure daily home BP with an iPhone cuff that transmits
      the data electronically to the pharmacist, who will halt the protocol if goal home BP<135/85
      is achieved ahead of schedule. the investigators will pilot test the feasibility and safety
      of self-monitoring plus the new automatic intensification protocol packaged in blisters.
      Default medication intensification could revolutionize HTN treatment and reduce healthcare
      costs.
