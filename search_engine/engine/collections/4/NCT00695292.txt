      extensive-stage disease. The irinotecan/carboplatin doses that will be used in this study
      have been used in two previous Phase II SCLC trials, and were found to be extremely well
      tolerated (Thompson et al. 2005; Spigel et al. 2007). Adding a novel, minimally toxic agent
      to this regimen may further enhance efficacy in this patient population without contributing
      to toxicity. This trial will evaluate the use of sunitinib following 6 cycles of treatment
      with chemotherapy in the treatment of SCLC.

      The trial will be performed under the leadership of SCRI, a community-based, multi-center,
      clinical trial organization.
