      On the same day, the first COVID-19 case reported in Turkey and nationwide quarantine
      regulations started after a spike in case numbers. In the world of sports, the effects of the
      COVID-19 pandemic started with staging games without spectators, gradually all sports events
      and team practices were postponed. Soon later, athletes advised to quarantine at home and
      continue training individually. Similar to previous study results, the COVID-19 outbreak
      expected to cause a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people during
      outbreaks of infection. In fact, preliminary results from a study in China showed a moderate
      to severe degree psychological impact on more than half of the respondents. However, the
      effect of COVID-19 on mental health symptoms in elite athletes has not been investigated.

      In this study, the investigator aims to investigate stress, anxiety, mood, life satisfaction
      measures among elite athletes during COVID-19 and explore the potential relationship between
      these measures and the changes in training characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic.
