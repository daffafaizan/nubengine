      oncology meeting and represents a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. GA is one of the high response rate treatment regimen, the investigators
      considered as a promising treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On the other hand,
      incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were
      significantly higher in the g group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was
      decided to consider the balance of safety and efficacy on survival time as a preoperative
      chemotherapy, the investigators use the NAC-GA regimen includes only two cycles (three times
      weekly and one week rest) of GEMABR regimen. The investigators also evaluate Recurrence free
      survival from the first day of protocol therapy, safety of the protocol therapy(Adverse
      effect), morbidity based on Clavien Dindo classification of more than Grade 3, response rate,
      preoperative/postoperative tumor marker (CA19-9, CEA), rate of mornalization, reduction rate
      of SUVmax value on PET-CT (limited only for PET-CT available institutions), chemotherapeutic
      effect grade based on Evans classification, resection rate, R0 resection rate, surgical data
      (operative time, blood loss, transfusion, postoperative hospital day), the overall morbidity
      rates (Reoperation, rate of re-admission, mortality), number of patient rate in postoperative
      adjuvant therapy (entry rate, completion rate), dose intensity for borderline resectable
      pancreatic cancer.
