      ml throughout the whole study.0.00 (pre-dose), 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 2.00,2.50,
      3.00,3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, and 24.00 hours postdose , Primary
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke,
      tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the 90% confidence
      intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of
      Ke, tmax and t1/2e.

      The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax,
      AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
