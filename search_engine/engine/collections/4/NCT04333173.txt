      feasibility of endovascular therapies in segmental atherosclerotic lesions of the internal
      pudendal arteries among men with erectile dysfunction (ED) and no-response to
      phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for at least 6 months either at increasing dosage or with
      different drugs routinely utilized in this setting) before enrollment. All patients will be
      screened by IIEF-5 questionnaire (IEF-5 Score < 15 points); Penile Dynamic Doppler ultrasound
      with intracavernous injection of Caverject (cut-off for Inflow insufficiency: PSV <25 cm s-1,
      EDV <5 cm s-1, RI > 0.8; cut-off for Venous leakage: PSV > 25 cm s-1, EDV > 5 cm s-1, RI <
      0.8; cut-off for mixed pathology: PSV < 25 cm s-1, EDV > 5 cm s-1, RI < 0.8); and/or positive
      angio-CT scan for stenosis of the penile arteries of venous insufficiency. All patients will
      be treated either by POBA+PES/SES or in case of suboptimal result (angiographic residual
      stenosis > 30%) with DES implantation. All patients will be discharged with dual antiplatelet
      therapy for 3 months and with Cialis 5 mg daily for 30 days. Patients will be followed at 1
      mos with IIEF questionnaire, 3 months with IIE-5 questionnaire, 8 months with IIEF
      questionnaire and Dynamic Doppler ultrasound evaluation, and 12 months with IIEF-5
      questionnaire and Dynamic Doppler ultrasound evaluation. Primary endpoints will be the delta
      of IEF-5 score between basal and 8 months FU (>5 points). Delta PSV (>8 points of cm/sec at
      the Dynamic Doppler evaluation) between basal and 8 mos follow-up. 1. Secondary endpoints
      will be a) Incidence of MAE (Death, MI, Stroke), 2) Binary restenosis and late loss in
      patients who will repeat control angiography if clinically indicated for ED recurrence
      (clinically evaluated by either needs to reintroduce/increase PDEF5i dosage on-demand, delta
      IEF-5 <5 compared to 1 mos FU after 6 mos FU) or in patients with bilateral disease with
      scheduled procedure after 6 mos FU from the index procedure.
