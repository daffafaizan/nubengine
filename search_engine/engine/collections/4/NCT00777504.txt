      criteria are used, in which progressive disease is defined as >20% increase of the sum of the
      longest diameter of the lesions, or occurence of new lesions. However, angiogenesis
      inhibitors have a rather cytostatic than cytotoxic effect compared to chemotherapeutics, as a
      result of which less frequently reduction of tumor volume is being seen.

      Often in the centre of the lesion necrosis is shown. Sometimes accompanied with edema; so
      even tumor volume increase can be the result without real progression being the case.
      Recently, in our clinic, we found a number of patients, treated with oral angiogenesis
      inhibitors, a remarkable quickening of progressive disease and complaints after stopping this
      treatment. Reintroduction of the same or another type of angiogenesis inhibitor subsequently
      lead to a new stabilization. The causality of this phenomenon is unknown. Perhaps that the
      inhibitory effect of the angiogenesis is not fully exhausted at the moment that progressive
      disease on CT is observed. An alternative explanation is contra reaction of longterm
      angiogenetic inhibition through upregulation of proangiogenic factors with subsequent
      vascular expansion and edema. This study means to gain more insight information about the
      optimal treatment policy when progressive disease is found in patients treated with oral
      angiogenesis inhibitors. Because of the increase of patients that is being treated with these
      products, both in trials as in daily clinical practice, this is important to investigate.
