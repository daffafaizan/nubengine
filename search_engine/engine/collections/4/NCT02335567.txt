    
      To utilize a 3D sequence instead of the usual 2D commonly standard industry sequence that is
      supplied by the various manufacturers.

      Patients with greater than 50% stenosis that are 3T compatible are imaged using the two
      sequences to compare which sequences better visualize the plaque and it's characteristics

      The purpose is to validate the ability of the new 3D sequence to detect and measure any
      plaque hemorrhage as well as to identify region sof Type 1 hemorrhage.
