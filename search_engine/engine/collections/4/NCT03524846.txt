      among hemodialysis (HD) patients, and it is responsible for a large portion of the cost of
      any end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program. Intimal hyperplasia at the venous segment of
      vascular access is the characteristic lesion, which leads to dysfunction or failure of both
      arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and prosthetic grafts (AVG). Although percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA) is effective in treating these stenotic lesions, the effect seems not
      permanent and restenosis after PTA remains a major problem. A number of studies have examined
      the clinical, anatomical, and technical factors for restenosis, the causes of restenosis are
      still not fully understood.This highlights a possible role of non-traditional risk factors to
      explain the high restenosis rate at the venous segment of vascular access, which includes
      oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.

      Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a potent antioxidant used for a long time. Hemodialysis patients
      had been shown to be deficient in antioxidant defense, which resulted in increasing
      requirement of ascorbic acid supplement. Currently, intravenous 300-mg ascorbic acid
      supplementation three times a week after hemodialysis had been used to overcome
      erythropoietin resistance in patients with iron deficiency. Theoretically, ascorbic acid
      scavenges reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species and may thereby prevent
      oxidative injuries. Investigators reported that administration of high dose ascorbic acid
      could prevent lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage in patients with ESRD.

      In this study, the investigators investigated whether ascorbic acid could decrease venous
      restenosis after PTA for dysfunctional hemodialysis vascular access.
