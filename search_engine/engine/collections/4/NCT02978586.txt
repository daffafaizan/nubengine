      The primary objective of this pilot imaging study is to determine the feasibility of using
      positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance (PET/MR) with [Ga-68] prostate-specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA) for staging and treatment monitoring of PSMA expressing tumors.
      [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR findings will be compared with standard of care imaging, patient follow
      up, and histopathology if available. [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR will not be used to change the
      patients' treatment plan. Investigators will assess PET/MR test-retest reproducibility and
      compare baseline [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR with PET/MR after initiation (within 2-6 weeks) of
      therapy and evaluate if [Ga-68]PSMA is a suitable biomarker for treatment monitoring and
      assessment of early treatment response.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare early changes in PET biomarker ([Ga-68]PSMA) tumor uptake with treatment
           response assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).

        -  To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment
           response assessed at completion of therapy.

        -  To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with [Ga-68]PSMA uptake.

        -  To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics.

      Study Design Patients, who enroll in this study, will undergo a baseline [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR
      to assess the level of [Ga-68]PSMA tumor uptake. Patients with positive [Ga-68]PSMA tumor
      uptake (defined as [Ga-68]PSMA uptake twice the background activity) who are receiving
      systemic therapy will undergo a further [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR 2-6 weeks after start of
      treatment. Patients with positive [Ga-68]PSMA tumor uptake will also be offered to
      participate in a test- retest study with a 2nd [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR prior to treatment.
      Patients will therefore undergo a maximum of three [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR imaging procedures. The
      first two test-retest Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI will be performed on separate days to allow for
      radioactive decay. There will be no other (e.g. clinically indicated) PET scan performed on
      the same day of [Ga-68]PSMA-PET/MRI.
