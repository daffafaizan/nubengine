      for six consecutive 2 week (13-15 days) intervals with injections administered at weeks 0, 2,
      4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The primary endpoint visit to assess response to sustained q2week
      therapy will be at the week 14 visit. No treatment will be administered at this visit. All
      patients will then return at week 16 for the randomization visit and receive a repeat
      intravitreal aflibercept (2.0mg) injection. For purposes of randomization, patients will be
      separated into the following groups:

        -  Q2 week complete responders: absence of subretinal fluid on OCT at week 16

        -  Q2 week incomplete responders: persistent subretinal fluid on OCT at week 16

      The "q2 week complete responders" will subsequently be transitioned to a treat and extend
      regimen with a minimum inter-treatment interval of 4 weeks through week 24. The "q2 week
      incomplete responders" will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one of two arms:

        -  Continued q2 week treatment: intravitreal aflibercept (2.0mg) injections for an
           additional four consecutive 2 week intervals at weeks 18, 20, 22, and 24

        -  Transition to treat-and-extend treatment: through week 24 with a minimum inter-treatment
           interval of q4 weeks. This arm is identical to regimen for "q2 week complete
           responders."

      Beginning in week 24, all patients (all groups) will undergo treatment delivered on a
      treat-and-extend basis with a minimum inter-treatment interval of 4 weeks through the week
      50. Patient visits will be treated no more frequent than q4 weeks during treat-and-extend
      portions of the protocol.

      All patients will have a mandatory study termination visit at week 52 (-1/+2 weeks). No study
      treatment will be administered after week 50. Patients receiving a study treatment after week
      48 will return 4 weeks after this final study treatment for study termination visit. Patients
      receiving a study treatment at or before week 48 in whom the treat-and-extend protocol would
      dictate a subsequent visit after week 52 will instead return at week 52 for a study
      termination visit.
