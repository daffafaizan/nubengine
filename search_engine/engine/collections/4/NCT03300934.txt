      adolescence many changes occur , physically , socially and psychologically .This may
      influence the metabolic control . This study will evaluate whether the automated closed-loop
      will facilitate and improve the management of diabetes in youth with a poor metabolic
      control.

      It is a single-centre, randomised, two-period crossover study to assess the efficacy /safety
      and acceptability of the automated closed-loop glucose control (CL) day and night, over 28
      days in comparison with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in the home setting
      in poorly controlled type 1 diabetes adolescents.
