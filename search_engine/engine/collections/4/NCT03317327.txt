      inhibitory antibody against Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Nivolumab has shown
      efficacy and mild toxicity when given as monotherapy for HNSCC at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every 2
      weeks, which is the target dose in the present trial.

      Radiotherapy is a powerful inducer of inflammation, and the expression of Programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines, including
      interferon-gamma (IFNg). Experimental evidence from mice models have shown that radiotherapy
      induces increased PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting
      that HNSCC with T-cell infiltration is more sensitive to radiotherapy. There is thus a strong
      rationale for combing PD-1 inhibitors with radiotherapy. However, this potential remains
      largely unexplored in humans. The investigators consider that head-and-neck cancer is a
      particularly attractive entity for investigating this therapeutic combination, because of i)
      the high radiosensitivity of this cancer form ii) the clinical efficacy of Programmed cell
      death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors as monotherapy in early clinical trials iii) the
      availability of tumor biopsies for translational/biomarker research.The RT given in the
      present study gives considerable side effects, related to inflammation that may be enhanced
      by Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade.
