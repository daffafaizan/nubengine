      instrument. The questions in this study are:

        -  what abnormalities can physiotherapists detect when observing a patient walking?

        -  what do they consider the main problem that has a negative effect on the patient's
           walking?

        -  what hypothesis do they generate?

        -  how is the inter-rater reliability for the "main problem" and the hypothesis?
