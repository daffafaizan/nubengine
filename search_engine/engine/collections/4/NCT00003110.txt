      patients receiving bleomycin as salvage therapy for AIDS-related or immunocompetent
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the feasibility and toxicity of treatment for this
      disease. III. Evaluate the quality of life of AIDS and non-AIDS patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, prior
      radiotherapy, and HIV/AIDS status. Patients receive bleomycin by continuous infusion for 72
      hours every 3 weeks. Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles. Patients who achieve complete
      remission receive 2 more cycles. Patients with partial remission or stable disease may
      continue therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Quality of life
      assessments are conducted at beginning of therapy, every 3 weeks, and at completion of
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued.
