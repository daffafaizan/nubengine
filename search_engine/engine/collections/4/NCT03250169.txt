        1. To evaluate the achievement of NEDA using blood and CSF neurofilaments in Alemtuzumab
           treated patients.

           Secondary

        2. To assess prognosis at the end of the study based on neurofilament status.

        3. To correlate neurofilament levels with clinical and MRI markers of disease activity.

        4. To evaluate the effect of Alemtuzumab on the profile of other CSF, blood, urine, faeces
           biomarkers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, neuronal sprouting and synaptogenesis,
           treatment activity and metabolic activity.
