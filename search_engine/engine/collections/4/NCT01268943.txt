      patients less than 70), it is suggested that after radical surgery, patients should receive
      concurrent chemo-radiation. Capecitabine is a widely used chemotherapy medicine under such
      condition. Based on experience, the investigators think this modality can also be tolerated
      by patients over 70, and will increase local control rate as which has been proved in younger
      ones. As the first step to test this hypothesis, we designed this phase I study to seek the
      proper dose of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapy medicine, in postoperative
      concurrent chemo-radiation for stage II/III rectal cancer patients over 70, and to evaluate
      the safety of this modality in this group of patients.
