      second-line treatment options for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. There is no
      standard treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma that was previously treated with
      VEGF targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.To the best of the investigators knowledge, GOLD
      study is the first phase 3 trial in the third-line setting after both VEGF-inhibitor and
      mTOR-inhibitor drugs.From this study,Sorafenib may be option for the third-line treatment.The
      Best trial demonstrated that Bevacizumab/sorafenib had best efficacy in advance renal cancer
      canrcinoma and the VEGF/VEGFR co-inhibition strategy may warrant further investigation
      possibly with more selective VEGFR inhibitors.So investigators conducted a randomized,
      open-label, multi-center phase II study to compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus
      sorafenib for the third-line treatment of patients with Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
