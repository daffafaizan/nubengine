    
      Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion (SARME) can be performed by a osteotomy between
      the maxillary central incisors and by osteotomies between the maxillary lateral incisors and
      canines (bilateral).

      Both techniques treat transverse maxillary hypoplasia, but they do so with different effects
      on esthetics, periodontium, teeth and bone expansion.
