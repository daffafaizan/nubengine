      severe aortic stenosis. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive an Edwards
      SAPIEN XT THV with either transfemoral, transapical or transaortic delivery access. Patients
      in the control arm will receive a surgical bioprosthetic heart valve via aortic valve
      replacement surgery.

      To assure that patients with an STS score â‰¥ 4% have been selected.
