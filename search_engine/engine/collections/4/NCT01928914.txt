      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Medicines for Malaria Venture with the assistance and
      historical support of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Tafenoquine has been shown
      to be effective in the treatment of plasmodial infections in vitro, in pre-clinical models in
      vivo, and during early phase clinical studies for radical cure and eradication of liver
      hypnozoites in patients infected with Plasmodium vivax. This study is designed to compare the
      effects of tafenoquine mono-therapy, administered as a single dose or administered on 3
      consecutive days, on the changes in QT duration to those observed in subjects dosed with
      either Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) or placebo. This will be a randomized,
      single-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study. Parallel group design is chosen
      because tafenoquine has a long half-life, about 14 to 19 days, and therefore a cross-over
      design is not a practical alternative. Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control in
      order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change. Moxifloxacin has been
      shown to prolong the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner in patients and healthy
      volunteers, and the QTc prolongation has been well quantified.
