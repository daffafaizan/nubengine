      at least two research biopsies, paired research stool collections, and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132)

        -  Pembrolizumab (KeytrudaÂ®; MK-3475)

        -  Questionnaires/Data Collection/Sample Collection

      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A: Sacituzumab govitecan
      (IMMU-132) and Pembrolizumab Group B: Pembrolizumab

      Participants will receive study treatment for as long they are benefiting from the therapy.
      Participants will be followed for the rest of their lives. It is expected that about 110

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or a combination of investigational drugs to
      learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease.
      "Investigational" means that the drug or drug combination is being studied. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for your specific disease,
      but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not
      approved Pembrolizumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
