      syndrome (OSAS). The declining of renal function, the fluid overloading and the disturbance
      of ventilation control could cause sleep apneas. On the other hand, the nocturnal hypoxia in
      patients with OSAS has been associated with changes in the renin-angiotensin system and
      sympathetic nervous system and production of reactive oxygen species. These findings are
      relationed with the deterioration of kidney function.
