      assess the efficacy and safety of SD-101-6.0 cream versus placebo (SD-101-0.0) cream on skin
      lesions in participants with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, or Junctional non-Herlitz
      Epidermolysis Bullosa. Epidermolysis Bullosa is a rare group of inherited disorders that
      typically manifest at birth as blistering and lesion formation on the skin in response to
      little or no apparent trauma. In this study, SD-101-6.0 cream or placebo (SD-101-0.0) cream
      was to be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for a period of 90 days.
      Participants had 1 target wound selected at baseline by the investigator. The selected target
      wound was required to have been present for at least 21 days. Photographic confirmation of
      the target wound location was collected at baseline, and the picture saved from the first
      visit was used to confirm location of the target wound at subsequent visits. The participant
      returned to the study site for Visit 2 (approximately 14 days from baseline), Visit 3
      (approximately 30 days from baseline), Visit 4 (approximately 60 days from baseline), and
      Visit 5 (approximately 90 days from baseline) to have the target wound assessed for the level
      of healing. In addition, itching, pain, body surface area, target wound closure, and scarring
      of healed target wound were assessed at each visit. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarâ„¢ was used to
      measure the target wound at all visits.
