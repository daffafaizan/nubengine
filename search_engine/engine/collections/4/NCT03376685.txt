      the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and
      hyperglycemia. Traditional physical activity recommendations suggest that 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity continuous endurance (END) exercise dispersed over 5 days per week is
      sufficient to improve physical fitness in adults. However, given the commonly cited barrier
      of "lack of time," literature has recently focused on time effective sprint interval training
      (SIT), obtaining equivalent increases in aerobic capacity and acute glycemic regulation
      compared to classical END exercise when protocols are work-matched. Despite these
      similarities, END is conducive to daily sessions not feasible of SIT. As improvements in many
      clinically relevant risk factors are transient in nature following exercise, it remains
      imperative to assess the implications of variable frequency exercise regimes performed as per
      general practice (i.e. high-frequency END, low-frequency SIT). Furthermore, improvements in
      cardiovascular outcomes following END have been shown, in some instances, to be absent in
      response to SIT, suggesting END may be more beneficial for cardiovascular health. Therefore,
      the current study aims to assess several markers of cardiovascular (aerobic capacity, blood
      pressure, arterial stiffness, vascular endothelial function) and metabolic (glucose
      tolerance, lipid tolerance, body composition) health following 6-weeks of high-frequency END
      or low-frequency SIT, performed as per general practice. Combined, this research will provide
      important insight into the under-appreciated role of exercise frequency for improving
      cardiometabolic health.
