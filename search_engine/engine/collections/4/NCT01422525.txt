    
      Baseline and postoperative measurement of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
      thickness will be performed using the following spectral domain optical coherence tomography
      (OCT): Cirrus™ HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and Spectralis® Heidelberg-Engineering.

      The main outcome measures will be changes in overall and quadrant RNFL thickness with respect
      to reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), correlation between RNFL thickness and alteration
      in visual field and predictive factors of postoperative IOP-reduction and changes of RNFL
      thickness.
