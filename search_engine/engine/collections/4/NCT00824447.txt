      pollens characteristically result in seasonal rhinitis symptoms commonly termed hay fever.
      The risk of developing asthma has been noted to be higher in patients with rhinitis than
      among the general population (10% versus 3.6%), confirming the fact that rhinitis is often
      the first step of the natural history of asthma.

      Although several drugs effectively manage the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis
      or asthma, they do not represent an etiopathogenic treatment of the considered diseases, and
      do not prevent the reappearance of the symptoms at the end of the treatment.

      Immunotherapy is generally considered to be appropriate for patients in whom rhinitis
      symptoms cannot be controlled by an optimal medication regimen and avoidance of the
      allergens. At present, specific immunotherapy is the only therapy available that acts on the
      main cause of the allergic reaction by modifying or down-regulating the immune response.

      Allergen immunotherapy is the administration of gradually increasing quantities of an
      allergen vaccine (extract) to an allergic subject, to reach a maintenance dose, which is
      effective in reducing the symptoms associated with exposure to the causative allergen.
