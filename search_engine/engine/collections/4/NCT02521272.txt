      conditions and development of breathing parameters of a person breathing in the simulated
      avalanche snow. Presence of an air pocket and its size play an important role in survival of
      victims buried in the avalanche snow. Even small air pockets facilitate breathing, yet they
      do not provide a significant amount of fresh air for breathing. The investigators hypothesize
      that the size of the air pocket significantly affects the airflow resistance and work of
      breathing. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the air pocket volume on gas
      exchange and work of breathing in subjects breathing into the simulated avalanche snow and to
      test, whether it is possible to breathe with zero air pocket.
