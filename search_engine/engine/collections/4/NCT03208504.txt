    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Single Branch
      Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic
      pathologies requiring landing in the Aortic Arch (zone 0, zone 1, zone2). The investigational
      device is the Single Branch Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System and its designated Delivery
      System.

      Subject population: ten (10) subjects diagnosed with thoracic aortic disease involving the
      aortic arch, and who have appropriate anatomy to accommodate the Single Branch Nexus™
      delivery system in an endovascular procedure. The study will be conducted in 2 clinical sites
      in Germany.
