      anthracycline-free short-term regimen (T75C600 x 6 [TC] once every 3 weeks) or a short-term
      regimen (C500E100F500 x 3 once every 3 weeks followed by T100 x 3 every 3 weeks [CEF-T])
      compared with a standard long-term anthracycline-containing regimen (E90C600 x 4 once every 3
      weeks followed by P80 x 12 once every week [EC-P]) in HER2-negative breast cancer. Patients
      were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm after completing the surgical excision of the
      primary tumor.
