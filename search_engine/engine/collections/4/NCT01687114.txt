      nuts, seeds, cocoa, tea, wine, and fruit or vegetable juices may have decreased risk of
      diseases. It is believed that some of these health benefits are due to phytochemicals present
      in these foods and beverages. Phytochemicals are nutrients that are naturally present in
      plant-based foods and beverages. Recently, cranberry containing foods and beverages are
      believed to prevent urinary tract infection. However, how cranberry decrease urinary tract
      infection is not very clear. To better understand how phytochemicals in cranberries may
      benefit health, we want to learn how they are absorbed and eliminated from the body. Thus,
      the purpose of the main study is to see whether we can measure phytochemicals from
      cranberries in health volunteers after they drink cranberry juice.
