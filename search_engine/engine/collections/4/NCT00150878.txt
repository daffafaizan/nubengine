      remain the major causes for treatment-failure in patients with AMl receiving allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      In phase II study, M . Stelljes and coworkers could show, that a reduced dose of total-body-
      irradiation and fludarabine can be safely used in patients with AML at various disease
      stages. The best results could be achieved in patients who had been in complete remission by
      the time of inclusion.

      Therefore this prospective trial was initiated to compare the new conditioning regimen with
      the standard regimen of 12 Gy TBI/Cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg in patients ith AML in first
      remission.

      After having achieved complete remission, and giving informed consent, patients are
      stratified according to marrow cytogenetics, age and type of induction therapy and
      subsequently randomized to receive on of the mentioned conditioning therapies.

      The primary end-point will be non-relapse mortality. The hypothesis would be, that the
      one-year mortality can be reduced from 25 to 15%. Given a power of 0.8 and a first-error of
      5%, 252 patients will have to be randomized.

      Secondary endpoints include:

      3 year overall-and disease-free survival Rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD Rate of grade 3-4
      extramedullary toxicity
