      to become the main cause of mortality for cirrhotic patients. Currently, the incidence of the
      HCC increase in occidental country and hid global prognostic remain very bad. The main
      indication factor for a curative treatment is the size lesion.

      Cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC occurence. In France, HCC screening has been
      establish for cirrhotic patients with hepatic ultrasound and alfa-fetoprotein measurement
      with the aim of detected HCC when the size allows a curative treatment.

      When a nodule is discovered during the follow-up, HCC diagnosis is done following the
      recommendations of European Association for the Study of the Liver (AESL) in 2000, updated by
      the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)in 2005. Diagnostic is
      function of nodule feature on one or two enhanced imaging techniques among CTscanner, MRI and
      enhanced contrast ultrasound.

      This diagnostic strategy raises several questions. First, neither the most efficient dynamic
      imaging association for nodules from 1 to 2 cm, nor the most efficient imaging examination
      for nodules from 2 to 3 cm are known. Second, only few studies have been carried out about
      imaging semiology of the small hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the imprecisions of the
      present recommendations regarding the choice of the best examination technique and the
      difficulties in the diagnosis of benign or malignant nature for small nodule can lead to a
      bad management of these patients.
