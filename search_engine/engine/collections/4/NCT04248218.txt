    
      Specific Aims:

      To compare the risk of prolonged concussion symptoms (PCS) between an active rehabilitation
      and a standard care cohort after an acute concussion.

      To determine if active rehabilitation compared to routine care reduces the risk of PCS for
      high-risk patients.

      This is a prospective randomized control trial of pediatric patients in the emergency
      department (ED) diagnosed with an acute concussion. Patients 8-18 years old with an acute
      concussion diagnosis will be eligible. All patients will receive pedometers to monitor their
      activity levels. If the patient is in the control group the patient will receive standard
      concussion management per the treating ED physician. Patients in the active rehabilitation
      group will receive instructions based on the latest CDC concussion management guidelines that
      specify a symptom-limited progressive return to full activities. This group will be
      instructed to take at least 10,000 steps a day for five days on their pedometers.

      One to five days after the ED concussion diagnosis a trained research coordinator will call
      all subjects to reinforce the management plan.

      28 to 32 days post ED concussion diagnosis, research assistants will contact subjects via
      email or phone call to complete the concussion symptoms inventory.
