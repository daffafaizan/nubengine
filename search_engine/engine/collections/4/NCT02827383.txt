      protocols on glucose control among adults at risk for type 2 diabetes.

      Rationale: Fractionalized physical activity is associated with reduced BMI, glycated
      hemoglobin, lower 2-hr plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity in cross-sectional studies.
      Yet, few studies have examined the effects of fractionalized or intermittent physical
      activity in a prospective manner. Furthermore, the research is limited to patients with
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes, or using exercise of a moderate intensity.

      The hypothesis is that stair climbing, a vigorous-intensity activity, may have a greater
      health effect. However, this has not been tested in short bouts of activity that are spread
      out during a day.

      Implications: Fractionalized physical activity may be more feasible for adults at risk for,
      or with diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are not currently active. These short bouts can
      increase energy expenditure throughout the day, rather than in one long continuous bout as
      currently recommended.
