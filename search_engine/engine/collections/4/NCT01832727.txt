      (MTD), the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oprozomib
      administered orally once daily in combination with dexamethasone, in participants with
      relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme with and
      without step-up dosing. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which fewer than 33%
      of participants had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
