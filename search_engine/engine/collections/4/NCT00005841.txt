      tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) fusion protein when combined with melanoma peptide vaccine
      comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35 antigen
      emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with completely resected stage III or IV melanoma.
      II. Determine the toxicity and safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      immune responses to tyrosinase, MART-1, and gp100 antigens in patients before, during, and
      after receiving these vaccinations.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of filgrastim (G-CSF)-fetal liver
      tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) (G-CSF-Flt3K) fusion protein. Patients receive melanoma peptide
      vaccine comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35
      antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SQ) monthly for 6 months, and then at
      9 and 12 months for a total of 8 vaccinations. Patients receive G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein SQ
      daily for 3 days before, immediately after, and then daily for 6 days after each vaccination.
      Cohorts of 6-10 patients receive escalating doses of G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6-10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months through year 2 after resection, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually
      thereafter until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
