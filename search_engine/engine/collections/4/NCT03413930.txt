      tumors, and its incidence is third in the world. At present，surgical treatments is the main
      means to cure CRC. Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the gold standard for rectal cancer
      surgery. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) was recently developed to overcome
      technical difficulties associated with LaTME and open TME. Most reports are retrospective
      studies. More studies, especially large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to
      establish the best indications for TaTME for mid and low rectal cancer.This is a
      single-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120
      eligible patients will be randomly assigned to TaTME group and LaTME group at a 1:1 ratio. It
      will provide valuable clinical evidence for the objective assessment of the oncological
      safety，efficacy and potential benefits of TaTME compared with LaTME for mid and low rectal
      cancer.
