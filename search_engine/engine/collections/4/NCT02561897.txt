    
      This is a prospective randomized comparative evaluation of Edoxaban and Warfarin for safety
      and efficacy in perioperative use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
      undergoing clinically indicated implantation or replacement of cardiovascular implantable
      electrical devices. This study is a randomized, open label, active-controlled trial with an
      open-label safety extension, designed to compare local and systemic bleeding within 30 days
      of cardiac rhythm device implant among subjects randomized to continuous Warfarin or
      interrupted (<24 hours) Edoxaban. The study will have three phases, a run in phase to
      establish stable warfarin therapy, an acute open label 30 day phase when subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive interrupted edoxaban or continuous warfarin followed by
      an open label follow up phase for an additional 5 months for safety monitoring. Drug
      transitions will be performed according to approved drug labeling.
