      that is delivered by a co-located mental health (MH) clinician to adolescents at the time of
      their first therapy appointment; 2) Guide2Brite, which will guide the co-located MH clinician
      in working with the adolescent to population content onto BRITE; and 3) BRITEBoard, which is
      a clinician dashboard delivered to the MH clinician and PCP.

      Assignment of Interventions: This study will utilize a 1:1 randomization scheme to randomize
      participants to receive BRITEPath intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU).

      Hypothesis: The use of BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidality
      (any self-injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning
      compared to TAU.
