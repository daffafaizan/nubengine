      leflunomide and orotic acid for the treatment of Polyoma BK viruria. In this multicenter
      trial, renal allograft patients with the diagnosis of Polyoma BK viruria as determined by a
      viral level in the urine of 25 million or more copies/mL, and no detectable viremia, will
      complete a screening visit (V1) to determine eligibility for the study based on
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients that meet the entrance criteria for this study will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at Visit (2) and enter a 4 month dosing
      period.
