      because it etiology and pathophysiology is unknown. Also it has different clinical stage. PNF
      techniques often used by physical therapist in adhesive capsulitis aim increasing range of
      motion, improving muscle strenght and decreasing pain. PNF techniques improves neuromusculer
      control of central nervous system via stimulating muscle spindles, golgi tendon organs and
      other receptors in connective tissue. However, there is limited evidence effectivenes of PNF
      techniques in adhesive capsulitis.

      Other technique often used by physical therapist in adhesive capsulitis is manual treatment.
      Manual treatment decreases pain and improves function. It re-arrange glenohumeral joint
      arthrocinematic. It diminishes capsule fibrosis.

      There is no reasearh aimed comparing the PNF and manual treatment. Our aim was to compare the
      effectiveness of manual treatment and PNF techiques in patients with adhesive capsulitis.
