      Primary

        -  Determine the best cytostatic response rate (including complete response, partial
           response, or stable disease) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
           leukemia treated with lenalidomide (CC-5013).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the cytostatic response rate in patients who progress on CC-5013 and are then
           treated with CC-5013 and rituximab.

        -  Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide (CC-5013) once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients with disease progression receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21 and rituximab
      IV on days 1, 8, and 15 during the first treatment course and on days 1 and 15 of all
      subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      further disease progression. Patients who achieve CR receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
