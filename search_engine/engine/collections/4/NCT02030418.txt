      pacemaker system in treating patients with a slow heart rate or irregular heartbeats. The
      Nanostim leadless pacemaker provides bradycardia pacing as a pulse generator with built-in
      battery and electrodes, for permanent implantation in the right ventricle. As a leadless
      pacemaker, it does not need a connector, pacing lead, or pulse generator pocket, but it has
      the same operating principles as a conventional pacemaker.
