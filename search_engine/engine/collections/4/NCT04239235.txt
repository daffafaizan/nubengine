      individual, family, and community. While medication treatment for OUD saves lives, rates of
      treatment drop out are very high. In addition, existing OUD treatments neglect the impact of
      untreated OUD on the family, and ignore the potential role family members and support persons
      (SPs) could have on encouraging long-term recovery. Incorporating the patient's support
      system may be an important way to improve treatment retention. The proposed study evaluates a
      counseling program for concerned family members, spouses, and friends called Community
      Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), which is successful at engaging and retaining
      patients in substance use treatment. While promising, no studies have evaluated whether CRAFT
      can help patients remain on medication treatment for OUD, provided by community health
      clinics. If effective, this could save lives and help both patient and family member health
      outcomes. About 500 patient and SP pairs will be recruited from 12 community health clinics
      throughout northern and southern California. Patients who are starting OUD medication
      treatment will be recruited and randomly assign half of the SPs to receive CRAFT; the other
      half would receive treatment-as-usual. Patients and SPs will be interviewed three and twelve
      months later to evaluate whether patients with CRAFT SPs stay in OUD treatment longer, and
      whether patient and SP health outcomes improve.
