      is no skin changes but varicose veins with or without leg swelling, can be totally
      asymptomatic but also cause various symptoms as pain, aching and discomfort of leg usually
      caused by increased venous pressure. Varicose veins may also cause cosmetic problem.
      Compression stockings relief the symptoms as they normalize venous pressure. In surgical
      treatment, axial reflux is treated usually by removing incompetent superficial veins. The aim
      of the study is to compare conservative treatment with compression stockings with surgical
      treatment of superficial venous reflux. In operative treatment the great saphenous vein or
      lesser saphenous vein are removed after flush ligation by femoral vein and stripping of the
      trunk. If the main trunk has been removes previously, axial refluating veins are removed or
      ligated according to the DUS finding. The patients in both groups are examined at the
      baseline and followed up to two years by ultrasound scanning. Patients clinical
      classification, venous disability score, venous disease severity score, anatomical path of
      reflux as well as quality of life are studied at the baseline, at one year follow-up and two
      years follow-up.
