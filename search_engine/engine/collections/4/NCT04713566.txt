      Listerein mouth wash will be studied on the oral health of socially deprived madrasa girls.
      Girls aged 18-22 years living permanently in a madrasa of Multan city will be recruited.

      guidelines. Participants will be randomized into two interventional groups; A and B and were
      either provided with Salvadora persica oral rinse and commercial Listerein mouth wash
      respectively. Pre, mid and post-intervention examinations will be executed by a blind and
      calibrated examiner using Turesky Quigley Hein Plaque and Loe and Silness Gingival indices.
      Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics and two sample independent t-tests.
