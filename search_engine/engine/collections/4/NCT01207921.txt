    
      Primary Objectives

      -To evaluate the feasibility of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed
      Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant, as measured by dropout rate.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess overall survival, event free survival, and progression free survival.

        -  To establish the adverse event profile of long-term maintenance therapy with
           lenalidomide in this patient population.

        -  To assess the conversion of partial response/stable disease post-ASCT to complete
           response.

        -  To evaluate changes in immune cell number and function and plasma proteins before,
           during, and after lenalidomide therapy (correlative studies).
