      using pharmacotherapy, a cure for DR has yet to be realized. Thus, a conceptual and technical
      breakthrough to identify novel targets, and a strategy to cure this complication is
      paramount. We believe that the recent clinical evidence from large clinical trials
      demonstrating a strong association between lipid abnormalities and DR progression and the
      discovery that activation of the nuclear hormone receptors liver X receptors (LXRα/LXRβ)
      prevents DR in rodent models offers such a breakthrough. The detrimental effect of
      dyslipidemia is not limited to the vasculature but also leads to dysfunction of circulating
      angiogenic cells (CAC) and of macrophages. The endogenous ligands for LXRs are oxidative
      metabolites of cholesterol that serve as intracellular cholesterol "sensors". LXR agonists
      operate, in part, by transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in promoting cholesterol
      efflux and inhibition of cholesterol uptake; and by inhibiting inflammation. Our published
      studies and new preliminary data show that pharmacological LXR activation prevents DR
      development in both T1D and T2D rodent models. In this application, we seek to understand the
      mechanisms involved in this beneficial effect. We put forth the hypothesis that LXR
      activation will restore cholesterol homeostasis in the diabetic retina and correct
      diabetes-induced bone marrow dysfunction to sustain CAC levels and function and to reduce of
      myeloid cell production.
