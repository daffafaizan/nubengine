      Primary

        -  To assess activity of the combination of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate and
           carboplatin in patients with primary advanced or metastatic recurrent carcinoma of the
           endometrium.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicity and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate IV over 1 hour followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-9 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue array and immunohistochemistry analysis are conducted on paraffin-embedded tumor
      blocks of the primarily operated tissue of all patients for different markers (e.g.,
      progesterone-/estrogen receptor, HER2-receptor, soluble L1-molecule, Topo 2a) to examine
      tumor characteristics.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during study treatment, at completion of study
      treatment, and then at 1 year after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
