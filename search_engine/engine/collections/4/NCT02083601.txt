      caregivers of children with spinal cord injury (SCI) ages 7-12. A further objective of this
      pilot study is to identify which outcomes are being affected by the intervention. Past
      research has highlighted psychoeducational intervention (i.e., interventions including both
      educational/skills-building components and psychological support) as most effective in terms
      of impacting caregiver functioning. The current study will recruit 44 caregivers and their
      children with SCI. All caregivers will participate in a 2-day Parent Forum, an in-person
      educational session. Caregivers will then be randomly assigned to receive monthly phone calls
      from a mental health professional ("intervention group") or no additional targeted support
      ("control group"). We expect that caregivers who participate in the intervention group and
      their children will demonstrate better outcomes than caregivers in the control group and
      their children.
