      assigned to three groups. The patients were all on schedule for elective general surgery
      under general anesthesia with duration of at two to four hours. All patients were induced
      with Etomidate (0.2mg/kg), Midazolam (0.05-0.1mg/kg), Sufentanil (0.3-0.5µg/kg) and a bolus
      dose of Cisatracurium (0.15mg/kg). Patients were aged between 20 and 65. The maintenance of
      anesthesia in each group varies as follows: Patients in Group 1 were all maintained with
      Total Intravenous Anesthesia, Group 2 with Sevoflurane at 1% and propofol infusion, Group 3
      with only sevoflurane. Muscle paralysis is maintained using a closed-loop computer gated
      infusion of Cisatracurium which kept T1 <1% by giving increasing the infusion rate
      intra-operatively when required. Analgesia was maintained by intermittent bolus dose of 10-20
      µg of Sufentanil.
