      been widely investigated. However, little is known about the adaptations to longer dietary
      interventions with different glycemic index and their influence on aerobic capacity and body
      composition in runners. Therefore, the purpose of this study was the assessment of the
      influence of low GI vs moderate GI of a 3-week diet on aerobic capacity, endurance
      performance and body mass and composition in endurance-trained athletes in a randomised,
      controlled crossover trial.
