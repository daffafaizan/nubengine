    
      This study was a randomized, open clinical trial.

      Patients undergoing surgery under regional (neuraxial or brachial plexus block) anesthesia
      were randomly assigned into one of two groups.

      Patients in one of the groups (called MDZ) were initially sedated with a 0.05mg/Kg bolus dose
      of Midazolam.

      The ones in the other group (called DEX) were initially sedated with a loading dose of 1
      µg/Kg of Dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 0.2 to 0.8
      µg/Kg/h.

      In order to achieve a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score between -3 and -1, the
      following breakthrough doses were used as necessary:

      MDZ: 0.02 mg/Kg bolus dose of Midazolam plus 0.5µg/Kg bolus dose of Fentanyl DEX: 0.5µg/Kg
      bolus dose of Fentanyl

      Depth of sedation and incidence of complications were recorded during surgery, in the Post
      Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and in the Ward for two days following surgery,
