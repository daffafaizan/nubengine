      have the leftover food in their stomach removed before each feeding, or not have the leftover
      food removed before each feeding. In addition, when a blood drawn is performed as regular
      care an extra amount with be taken. A test to determine how much of the hormones gastrin and
      motilin are contained in the blood will be performed. Stool samples will be collected.
      Participation could last up to approximately 6 to 8 weeks of age.
