      Reuteri ATCC PTA 4659. Simple demonstration that they survive passage is the first step in
      development of potential new probiotics, which is necessary before these strains can be
      considered for continued testing in probiotic food matrices. The aim of this study will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lactobacillus Reuteri in healthy adult subjects.
