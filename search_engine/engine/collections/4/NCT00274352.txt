      impairment. They tend to be hard to treat with most topical therapies and often require
      systemic medications which carry the risk of significant side effects. Often such treatments
      are withheld unless there is a need to use them for visceral involvement. There is thus an
      unmet need for safe and effective treatments for these patients. In addition there is
      essentially no controlled trial data for any treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis. This study
      is intended to determine if adalimumab might offer a viable therapeutic option for this
      condition by comparing the response of cutaneous sarcoid lesions to this drug as compared to
      placebo.
