    
      ATC has potent antiviral activity both in vitro (against wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-1 with
      mutations in reverse transcriptase that confer resistance to NRTIs), and in clinical studies
      in both treatment-na√Øve and treatment-experienced patients with M184V, including in the
      presence of additional NRTI mutations in reverse transcriptase.

      The M184V mutation is most commonly present amongst patients failing regimens containing
      either of the two deoxycytidine analogs lamivudine and emtricitabine. Whilst lamivudine
      therapy is often maintained in patients harboring the M184V mutation in some settings, there
      are no deoxycytidine analogs currently available that effectively suppress replication of
      HIV-1 containing the M184V/I mutation, particularly in the presence of other additional NRTI
      mutations.

      The purpose of this study is to extend the efficacy and safety established in study AVX-201
      of ATC in patients who are HIV-1 infected and have failed treatment with lamivudine or
      emtricitabine and have confirmed M184V/I mutation. Patients to be enrolled will be failing
      their current lamivudine- or emtricitabine-containing regimen and therefore have limited
      remaining NRTI treatment options. This study will investigate whether it is possible to
      improve control of HIV-1 viral replication by including ATC within a treatment experienced
      patient's new optimized background regimen following ART treatment failure.
