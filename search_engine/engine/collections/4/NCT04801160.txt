    
      This is a multicentric, open-labal, randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Radiation-Emitting Metallic Stents (REMS) combined with Trans-Arterial
      Infusion (TAI) versus Uncovered Self-Expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS) Combined With
      Trans-Arterial Infusion (TAI) for Unresectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma. The primary
      hypotheses are that Radiation-Emitting Metallic Stents (REMS) combined with Trans-Arterial
      Infusion (TAI) is superior to Uncovered Self-Expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS) Combined With
      Trans-Arterial Infusion (TAI) with respect to Over survival(OS). The primary endpoint is
      overall survival. The secondary endpoints include quality of life, progression free survival,
      relief of jaundice, patency, and adverse events.
