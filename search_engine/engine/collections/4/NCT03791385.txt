      (ASD) has been documented in many reports. The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS),
      which is a series of pictures that show a structured method and technique for teeth brushing,
      was chosen for this study since it is a proven communication system for children with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD).

      The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a PECS-based tooth-brushing program on
      gingival health in children with ASD and assess parents' perception of PECS.

      This was a prospective interventional study. Using PECS as a pictures/cards series showing a
      structured tooth-brushing method, 37 children with ASD (31 males, 6 females) (average age
      9.49Â±4.10, 4-16 years) and their parents/caregivers were trained on tooth-brushing twice, two
      weeks apart. The pictures were placed in the bathroom, at home and/or at the autism center.
      Data collected after examinations (baseline, 3, 6-months) included gingival and plaque
      indices (GI, PI) and two questionnaires (baseline, 6-months) for demographic data and
      parents' perception of PECS including: difficulty rating (easy, hard, very hard) and whether
      they found PECS useful in teaching their children how to brush their teeth (yes or no).
