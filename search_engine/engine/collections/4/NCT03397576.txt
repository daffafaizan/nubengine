      a 2-arm randomized controlled trial conducted in two phases with HIV-infected prisoners
      recruited from 2 correctional facilities in Jakarta, Indonesia.

      Phase 1: HIV+ prisoners who are already aware of their status will be recruited through
      prison clinics and randomized to receive either the adapted ATHENA intervention or standard
      care as a control. Uniform data collection at baseline will include measures of ART
      adherence, HIV stigma, and drug dependence and CD4+ T-cell and viral load testing.

      Phase 2: Subjects receiving the ATHENA intervention will participate in monthly medication
      adherence counseling sessions within prison, and home visits up to four months after prison
      release, during which intervention staff (nurses and peer educators working in teams) will
      deliver individualized medication adherence counseling based on the Freirian educational
      model.

      Phase 3: Participants in both groups will be followed for 12 months after prison release, and
      asked to complete monthly study visits to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes.
