      patients with incident Parkinson's disease - will fill in the food frequency questionnaire,
      SF-36 questionnaire, HADS questionnaire and the physical activity questionnaire. All subjects
      must have 0-3 points on Hoehn and Yahr scale and more than 22 points on MoCA scale. DNA
      microarray genotyping will be used to process the DNA samples of the participants. The data
      on the composition of the participants' gut microbiota will be obtained through 16S rRNA
      sequencing of their stool samples.
