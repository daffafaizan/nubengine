      biopsy genotype assay and circultating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy. Patients who carry
      actionable EGFR mutation, ROS1 fusion, ALK fusion or MET exon 14 skipping mutation will
      receive TKI treatment according to guidelines. During the TKI treatment, every patients will
      take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. The study will be ended when all the
      patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion.
