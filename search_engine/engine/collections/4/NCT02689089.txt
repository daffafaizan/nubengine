      strategy to reduce TB in a population. Treatment prevents ongoing transmission in communities
      by preventing the development of active TB disease. The current international standard for
      the treatment of LTBI is 9 months of Isoniazid (INH). Adherence to this lengthy regimen is
      one of the greatest impediments to treatment. A recent multi-centered, multi-national
      randomized control non inferiority trial with approximately 4,000 patients per arm
      demonstrated that Rifapentine and INH (3HP) given once weekly for a total of 12 doses was as
      effective as 9 months (252 doses) of daily INH treatment for LTBI.(1) These findings were
      also replicated in the pediatric population through a pediatric cohort (n=905 eligible
      participants) nested within the multi-centered international randomized controlled trial with
      children between ages 2-17 treated with 3HP compared to the INH standard for LTBI.(2) The
      efficacy and safety of this new regimen have been established. Rifapentine was approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December of 2014 for the treatment of
      LTBI but is not yet approved in Canada. The shortened treatment course could increase the
      number of people who complete LTBI treatment which could lead to a decrease in active TB
      cases.
