    
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract. A recent national survey from the CDC estimates that the prevalence
      of IBD in the United States (US) is nearly 3.1 million cases. IBD is often associated with
      debilitating symptoms, hospitalizations, decreased quality of life, frequent procedures
      and/or surgery. Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapies, such as
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines and methotrexate) and anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF) agents. Although they are effective in achieving clinical remission and
      decrease the risk of complications, they also increase the risk for serious infections,
      including herpes zoster (HZ).

      The primary goal is to study those patients with IBD who are thought to be at the highest
      risk for HZ reactivation by evaluating cell mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV.
