      of vascular anomalies is significantly variable. Most of them had a benign course. However,
      complicated vascular anomalies can lead to disfigurement, organ disfunction and
      life-threatening with significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional treatments, including
      steroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and surgery, had limited response to complicated
      vascular anomalies. In the past few years, the inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling pathway-sirolimus has emerged as a treatment for severe vascular anomalies.
      Besides, preclinical studies also showed that the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
      kinase B (Akt)/mTOR pathway play an important role in the development of vascular tumors and
      vascular malformations. However, the exact efficacious rate and complications of sirolimus
      are still unknow in china because of the lack of large scale of prospective studies.
      Therefore, it's important to perform this prospective study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of sirolimus in the treatment of Chinese children with complicated vascular
      anomalies, and this study will also make contributions to the diagnoses and treatments of
      vascular anomalies.
