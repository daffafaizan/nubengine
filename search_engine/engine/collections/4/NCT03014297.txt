      surgical and medical therapies. Most subjects require somatostatin analogs to control the
      symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Subjects who no longer respond to somatostatin and other
      liver-directed therapies, who experience progression of disease and increasing symptoms have
      limited options, including participation in a clinical trial. Recently everolimus and
      sunitinib have been approved for the treatment of subjects with progressive locally advanced
      or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Based on the preclinical data in models of NETs and the
      clinical activity seen in NETS and other tumor types that have existing tumor vascculature,
      this study will examine the effectiveness of fosbretabulin given in combination with
      everolimus in subjects with GI-NETs and PNETs.The vasoconstrictive effect of fosbretabulin is
      potent, though short-lived (4-8 hours), with no cumulative adverse effect. Everolimus
      inhibits angiogenesis, slows tumor growth and has a prolonged half-life (30 hours). Combining
      these two agents with distinctly different mechanisms of action may improve tumor control
      without additional toxicities, and has the potential of reducing drug resistance.
