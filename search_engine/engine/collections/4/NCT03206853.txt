    
      Purpose: Have an evaluation of clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in
      management of complex intracranial aneurysms (CIAs), which could coexists with multiple risk
      factors. Meanwhile, as a new cooperative interventional modality, optimized workflows,
      technical key knots and operation routines will be explored in the study.

      Objects: Patients with CIAs, coincident with inclusion and exclusion criterion and admitted
      in participating organizations.

      Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy
      group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional
      neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management correspondingly.
      Peri-operative mortality rate is considered to be the primary observing indicator, and
      morbidity rate of peri-operative cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event, morbidity rate of
      aneurysmal residuals, morbidity rate of neural functional deteriorations, and health-economic
      indicators are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be recorded in detail
      as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.
