      measures design in which participants with acute ischemic stroke and upper extremity weakness
      are randomized to either drug or placebo, complete therapy, and complete outcomes assessments
      at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks post-stroke. Target enrollment will be 10 patients per group and
      adaptive randomization will be used to assist with equal representation of pre-stroke
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and motor severity (Fugl-Meyer score) in
      each arm. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to measure adverse events, drop-out
      rates, feasibility of trial conductance, and establishment of effect sizes in each group in
      order to power a larger efficacy trial at the University of Utah. An intention to treat model
      will be used during the study.
