      recorded, both in right and left middle cerebral arteries. It was observed in the left artery
      during all forms of training. In the right artery it occurred only during three forms of
      difficult training, and was preceded by significant decrease in blood flow in the first
      minute of the gait with eyes closed. The output values of the rate of blood flow in both
      right and left middle cerebral arteries became progressively reduced in the successive stages
      of gait. Pressure and pulse rates did not correlate with the variables of blood flow velocity
      in middle cerebral arteries.
