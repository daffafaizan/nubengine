    
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a problem in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) all over
      the world. This multicenter, non-randomized, unmasked clinical trial evaluate the efficacy of
      inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the treatment of the preterm infant with developing
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      Infants were followed until death or discharge to home. The trial will compare iNO therapy to
      conventional management strategies (including treatment with nasal continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP), surfactant and high frequency ventilation as adjuncts to iNO therapy) as the
      control.

      During the initial dosing, iNO was started at 5 ppm and could be decreased to 1-2 ppm. The
      Infants would inhale NO until weaned. Infants will be monitored for signs of toxicity due to
      cumulated dosage of NO and its metabolites, such as methemoglobin, and nitrite and nitrate in
      blood and urine, and nitrogen dioxide in ventilator circuit to the patient.
