      Objective - The objective of this protocol is to provide normative data for population
      performance on the NIH Test of Attention, and to compare performance on this test with
      subjects' performance on the traditional Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA). The NIH Test
      of Attention has been developed to provide a modernized test that can be made available to
      researchers, clinicians, and educators free of charge.

      Study population - A screened medically normal population sample containing adults and
      children of both sexes and all ethnicities without frank mental or sensory disabilities

      Design - Subjects will be enrolled by outreach designed to gather a random population sample.
      Subjects will take the NIH Test of Attention at one testing session and the TOVA at another
      session. The population distribution of scores on the NIH Test of Attention will be
      ascertained, the standard descriptive statistics will be calculated, and the correlation of
      NIH Test of Attention scores with the TOVA scores in each subject will be measured. No
      individual identifying information will be gathered, and no test results will be provided
      back to subjects.

      Outcome measures - The outcome will be measured by statistical tests for significant
      differences from the null hypothesis, which is that there is a difference in subject
      performance on the TOVA compared to the NIH Test of Attention. Mean, median, variance, and
      standard deviation of test scores will be calculated. Score distribution and Intra-class
      correlations will be quantified. Correlation of scores on the NIH Test of Attention with TOVA
      scores will be determined using Pearson's r.
