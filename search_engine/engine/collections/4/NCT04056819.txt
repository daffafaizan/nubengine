      deaths due to coronary artery disease estimated to increase from 7.3 million in 2008 to 25
      million by 2020 WHO, 2011.

      The leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with
      suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain.

      Most patients will ultimately develop an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The
      mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or
      fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial
      infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and
      disability.

      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio
      Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its
      effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving
      intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function.
