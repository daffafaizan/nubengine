      intensity, and clinical insomnia has been reported in 53-73% of chronic pain patients.
      Insomnia seems to be correlated with small to moderate impairments in several cognitive
      functions involved in working and episodic memory and in attention tasks, and chronic pain
      has been shown to be associated with objective deficits in memory and executive functioning.
      The aim of the present study is to examine cognitive function in a patient population with
      complex chronic pain to test the hypothesis that insomnia severity on its own predicts
      objective cognitive function, and that a correlation is not better explained by comorbid
      depression or anxiety, morphine equivalent daily dose, or the level of pain itself.

      Inividuals with complex chronic pain are assessed with a neuropsychological test battery
      examining different aspects of memory and executive functioning:

      The Digit Span subtest from Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III): Verbal
      working memory.

      Claeson-Dahl Inventory of Learning and Memory (CD): Verbal retention. The Rey Complex Figure
      Test (RCFT): Visuospatial retention. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST): Cognitive
      flexibility. The Trail-Making Test (TMT): Sustained attention.

      The presence of insomnia is examined with the Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) , and insomnia
      severity with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Present pain level at the time of the
      neuropsychological assessment is quantified using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Pain
      medication is transformed to the morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD). Anxiety and
      depression are assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
