    
      Prospective, open, multicenter study. The high risk BCC lesions will be treated with Metvix
      cream. A biopsy confirming the diagnosis of each BCC lesion should have been taken within 6
      months prior to treatment. The patients will receive one or two treatment cycles each
      consisting of two Metvix PDT treatments 7 days apart (Lesion that show non-complete response
      at 3 months will have a second PDT treatment cycle).

      The primary end-point will be the histologically confirmed complete response rate within a
      patient (No BCC cells in the biopsy taken 3 months after the last treatment).

      Secondary endpoints are safety evaluation during the first 13 weeks or 6 months (if two
      treatment cycles) after the first Metvix treatment, cosmetic outcome and recurrence rates 12,
      24, 35, 48 and 60 months after the first Metvix treatment.
