      but was left to the judgment of each physician within the 18 months period, which defines the
      survey for each participant. For indicative purposes, follow-up of each participant should
      enable approximately 7 visits during this period. These visits will take place at average
      intervals of 3 months, apart from the first visit following inclusion (usually at the end of
      the first treatment month) and apart from visits required because of intercurrent events.
      Participant visits were assigned as follows: Baseline/Day 0 (start of lopinavir/ritonavir
      treatment), Month 1 (day 1 to day 45), Month 3 (day 46 to day 136), Month 6 (day 137 to day
      228), Month 9 (day 229 to day 319), Month 12 (day 320 to day 410), Month 15 (day 411 to day
      501), Month 18 (day 502 to day 593). Each participant is planned to be observed during
      his/her lopinavir/ritonavir capsule containing treatment regimen for a maximum period of 18
      months, and each participant is planned to be observed during his/her lopinavir/ritonavir
      tablet containing treatment regimen for a maximum period of 9 months.
