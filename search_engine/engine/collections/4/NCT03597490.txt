      full-thickness tear, most studies on conservative treatment are associated with
      full-thickness tears. In general, any physical therapy modality alone is not effective in the
      treatment of rotator cuff tears. It has been reported that multimodal physiotherapy may be
      more successful than monotherapy, but evidence in this regard is inadequate. Therefore this
      observational prospective study aiming to investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy in
      the treatment of rotator cuff tears was planned. The null hypothesis of this study is that
      multimodal physical therapy combined with exercise has no effect on pain and function in the
      treatment of partial thickness rotator cuff tears. The alternative hypothesis is the
      opposite.

      Patients will be assessed by standardized measures in terms of pain and function (American
      Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized shoulder form: patient self report section), active
      range of motion (goniometric measurement) and quality of life (Western Ontario rotator cuff
      index) at baseline and first, third and 6th months of follow-up.
