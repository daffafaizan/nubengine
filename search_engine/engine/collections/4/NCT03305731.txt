      study protocol following initial documentation of this study protocol on clinicaltrials.gov.
      The purpose of this delayed baseline design was to assess the baseline stability on the
      primary and secondary outcomes. The addition of this timepoint resulted in a shift of
      post-intervention timepoints as follows: Baseline 1 (week 1), Baseline 2 (week 6),
      Post-intervention (week 11), and Follow-up (week 18). Intervention was delivered between
      Baseline 2 and Post-intervention.
