    
      48 subjects diagnosed with Rutherford Class 4-5 Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) with non-healing
      ulcers and/or ischemic rest pain will be enrolled in this study designed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of JVS-100. JVS-100 will be delivered by direct intramuscular injection
      into the limbs of study subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive a single set of
      direct intramuscular injections of either JVS-100 or vehicle control and will be followed for
      12 months post dosing. Safety and efficacy assessments will be collected at 3 days, 4 weeks
      and 3, 6 and 12 months.
