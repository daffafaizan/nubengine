    
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of efficacy and safety of
      Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) in participants with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin
      lymphoma. This study will enroll approximately 100 participants.

      Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), composed of the human
      monoclonal antibody, HuMaxÂ®-TAC, which is directed against human CD25. The antibody is
      conjugated through a protease cleavable linker to SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer
      cytotoxin.

      For each participant the study will include a screening period (of up to 28 days), a
      treatment period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a follow-up period (approximately every 12-week
      visits) for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.

      Participants may continue treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.

      Additionally, patients benefiting clinically at 1 year may continue treatment after a case by
      case review with the Sponsor.
