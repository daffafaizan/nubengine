      overeating often involves loss of control and compulsive behaviors.

      Hypnosis could increase the ability to control emotional impulses. Self-conditioning
      techniques borrowed from hypnosis (self-hypnosis) increase self-control and self-management
      of emotions. Recent hypnosis techniques with a rapid-induction phase allow the trained
      patients to go into self-hypnosis in a few minutes and to repeat the experience in complete
      autonomy, employing a short time of the day only.
