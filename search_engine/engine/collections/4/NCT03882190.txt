      years. With their permission, they will be randomized into the control group and the
      experimental group when the latter is supposed to receive GNRHa preoperatively and
      postoperatively. And their physical and endocrinic indexes will be monitored. The effect of
      extra use of GnRHa will be observed by comparing these two groups' outcomes.
