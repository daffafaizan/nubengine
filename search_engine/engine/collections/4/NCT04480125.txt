    
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL is a distinct and heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for ~10%. CHOP regimen has been widely used in PTCL
      patients even with unfavourable prognosis, with 5-year overall survival rate of 38.5%.
      Elderly patients seldom benefit from conventional CHOP regimen. A study showed that CR rate
      was only 18.1% in elderly patients (median age of 80 years old, ranging from 56 to 93 years
      old).

      Azacitidine combined with romidepsin has been proved efficient in relasped or refractory
      PTCL, with CR rate of 55%. This prospective, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of azacitidine in combination with Chidamide in treatment of newly
      diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma unfit for conventional chemotherapy.
