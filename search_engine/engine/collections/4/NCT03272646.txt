      host. Particularly the patient's immune and nutritional status have been recently associated
      with short- and long-term outcome in gastric and other cancers. In addition, there is growing
      evidence that systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the carcinogenesis and
      progression of gastric cancer. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and, more recently,
      the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to be independently correlated with
      prognosis in patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery, and preoperative albumin and
      cholesterol levels seem to be adequate mirrors of the nutritional status of the host.

      The investigators have already demonstrated that a new scoring system, which they called
      Naples prognostic score (NPS), based on a composite score of albumin and cholesterol
      concentrations, along with NLR and LMR is a simple tool strongly associated with long-term
      outcome in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.

      The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between the NPS and clinicopathological
      characteristics, postoperative complication rate and long-term outcome in patients undergoing
      surgery for gastric cancer. Furthermore, the new prognostic scoring system will be compared
      with previously developed ones and the current TNM staging system to evaluate its
      performance.

      All patients who underwent surgery for proven gastric adenocarcinoma at the Division of
      Surgical Oncology of the Gastrointestinal Tract of the University of Campania (Naples,
      Italy), from January 2000 to December 2015 will be enrolled in the present study.
