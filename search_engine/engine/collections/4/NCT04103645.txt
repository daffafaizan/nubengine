    
      This is a two-tiered single arm Phase 2 trial of vactosertib (TEW-7197) for the treatment of
      anemia in Ph-neg MPNs. Both tiers use a rule-based, accelerated dose escalation scheme to
      efficiently assess the potential of vactosertib to safely and effectively treat anemic
      patients with Ph-neg MPNs. The first tier of this trial (Tier 1) is an intra-patient dose
      finding study in 12 patients that uses a low starting dose of vactosertib for all patients.
      For each patent, the treatment dose is escalated according to prospectively-defined rules,
      and a toxicity and treatment effect algorithm during the period of 16 weeks (4 treatment
      cycles). If pre-established efficacy and safety endpoints are met (section 5.4, section 9.1,
      section 11.1), then Tier 1 of the study will be followed by a Tier 2 expansion study with an
      additional 25 patients for a period of 24 weeks (6 treatment cycles).

      Vactosertib will be administered as monotherapy and therefore patients must be off
      cytoreductive therapies such as interferon, ruxolitinib, hydroxyurea, DNA hypomethylating
      agents or other cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to enrollment for a period of at least 14 days
      or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer. Supportive care measures including packed red blood
      cell (PRBC) transfusions for HGB <7g/dL, or symptomatic anemia, will be permitted.
      Administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), however, will not be permitted on
      the trial (patients recruited would have serum EPO >125 U/L above which the benefit of ESAs
      is not supported).
