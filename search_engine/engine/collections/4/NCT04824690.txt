      allocated into the control or VR group. The control group received conventional education
      regarding the perioperative process of surgery. The VR group watched a 1.5-minute VR video
      showing the operating theater and explaining the perioperative process. The main finding was
      preoperative anxiety evaluated using the Children's State Anxiety (CSA) before surgery.
      Secondary findings included children's postoperative pain ratings using Wong-Baker Faces Pain
      Rating Scale and parental satisfaction scores using PedsQL Health Care Satisfaction Scale
