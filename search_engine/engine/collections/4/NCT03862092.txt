      cranial nerve, dorsal root, and enteric ganglia. VZV reactivation in enteric neurons (enteric
      zoster) can cause nonspecific abdominal pain and/or serious gastrointestinal dysfunction
      without cutaneous manifestations. Detection of VZV DNA in saliva may be useful for
      identifying enteric zoster. We evaluated the frequency of putative enteric zoster based on
      the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with acute abdominal pain.

      Adult patients who visited the emergency room due to moderate to severe acute abdominal pain
      were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital between May 2019 and November 2019.
      Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) was performed in all patients. Saliva samples were
      collected from all studied patients. Enteric zoster was suspected based on the presence of
      salivary VZV DNA, detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
