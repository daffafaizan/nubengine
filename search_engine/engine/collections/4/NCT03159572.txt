    
      In this study, investigators plan to clarify the frequency of Homologous Recombination
      Deficiency (HRD) in Japanese patients with ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer
      and primary peritoneal cancer).

      And investigators will also investigate whether HRD-positive ovarian cancer patients show the
      clinical characteristics of highly platinum-sensitivity and good prognosis, comparing to
      HRD-negative ovarian cancer patients.

      In addition, it is planned to investigate any association between Progression Free Survival
      (PFS) / Platinum-Sensitivity and germline mutation in Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene
      (BRCA1/2 gene) in ovarian cancer patients who can provide the patients' gBRCA1/2 gene
      information for this study.
