        -  Establish a uniform practice for the management of children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Document the long-term side effects of such management.

        -  Establish whether or not children can be safely managed without staging laparotomy and
           splenectomy.

        -  Establish whether or not chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine hydrochloride, and
           prednisolone (CLVPP) is an effective alternative to mechlorethamine, vincristine,
           procarbazine hydrochloride, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment regimens
      according to disease stage and presence of bulky mediastinal disease.

        -  Involved-field radiotherapy (for patients with stage IA [nodal] disease): Patients
           undergo involved-field radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

        -  CLVPP chemotherapy (for patients with all other stages of disease AND no bulky
           mediastinal disease): Patients receive CLVPP chemotherapy comprising oral chlorambucil,
           oral procarbazine hydrochloride, and oral prednisolone on days 1-14 and vinblastine IV
           on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  CLVPP chemotherapy and radiotherapy (for patients with all other stages of disease AND
           bulky mediastinal disease): Patients receive CLVPP chemotherapy as above. Patients then
           undergo radiotherapy to the mediastinum beginning 2 weeks after completing the last
           course of CLVPP chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 358 patients were accrued for this study.
