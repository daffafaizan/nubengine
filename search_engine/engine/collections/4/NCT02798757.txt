      pressure > 140/90 mmHg will be included. All eligible patients will be given dapagliflozin 10
      mg qd for 3 months. Routine laboratory parameters that will be measured on each visit
      include: 1) for serum samples: glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes (sodium,
      potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate and magnesium and 2) for urine samples: glucose,
      urea, creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate
      and magnesium) and alpha-1 microglobulin. It is well known that alpha-1 microglobulin is a
      low-molecular weight protein that is normally filtered by renal glomeruli and reabsorbed by
      the proximal tubular cells. Increased excretion of alpha1-microglobulin has been proposed as
      a non-invasive marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of early tubular disorders such as
      diabetic nephropathy. In addition, the fractional excretion values (FE) of the electrolytes
      will be calculated using the formula: FEA(%) = (UrineA/SerumA) /(UrineCr/SerumCr) × 100.

      The 1HΝMR spectra of urine samples will be recorded on a 500 MHz spectrometer. In the present
      study, the main low molecular weight (LMW) constituents of urine that will be quantified are
      1) metabolites such as glucose, creatinine, creatine, choline, taurine, dimethylamine,
      betaine, trimethylaminoxide 2) amino acids such as glycine, valine, alanine, leucine,
      histidine, lysine, threonine and 3) organic acids such as citrate, hippurate, lactate,
      acetate, succinate, and formate. In addition, 1HNMR methodology allows for the detection of
      changes in the concentrations of hundreds of metabolites. These substances are normally
      present in traces, whereas in pathological conditions their concentrations can be found
      increased.
