    
      The function of this protocol is to allow the clinic pain research fellows to gain additional
      knowledge in the management of acute and chronic pain. Patients enrolled in this protocol
      will be evaluated and treated according to available procedures and therapeutic modalities
      used in clinical practice. The evaluation and treatment of these patients may lead to ideas
      for future protocols.

      By allowing for the care of persons with a spectrum of pain syndromes, this protocol will be
      valuable for the training of the pain fellow as well. The pain group at the NIDCR is free to
      choose those diseases that interest them.

      Patients in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential
      eligibility in any of the new clinical studies of the Pain and Neurosensory Mechanisms branch
      of the NIDCR as they are developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the
      new protocol. However they will not be required to enter any new protocol and their decision
      to participate will be entirely voluntary.
