      insomnia and use A-B-A-C-A-D design for 9 weeks including the three periods of baseline
      phases for 1 week(A), the music intervention phase for 2 weeks(B), the proprioceptive
      intervention phase for 2 weeks(C) and the combination phase for 2 weeks(D). The main outcome
      measures include the objective sleeping quality measured everyday by the actigraphy recording
      the sleeping performance and physiological data during sleep, and the subjective sleeping
      quality measured every week via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity.
      The secondary outcome measures, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      Scale, Geriatric Anxiety Scale - Chinese Version and WHOQOL-BREF, will be assessed weekly.
      The above results will present in visually analyzing graphed data to compare the performance
      among different phases and to evaluate the impacts of different interventions. This study
      will aim to preliminary investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the music
      intervention, the proprioception intervention and the combination of both approaches on
      improving the objective sleeping performance and the subjective sleeping quality of the
      elderly.
