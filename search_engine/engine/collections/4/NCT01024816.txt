      hypertension and dyslipidemia, occur together and are associated with excessive caloric
      intake and inadequate physical activity. Persons with the metabolic syndrome are at high risk
      of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle and behavioral
      interventions reduce these risks, but many individuals with increased metabolic risk find it
      difficult to achieve and maintain weight loss and increased physical activity.

      We are conducting a rigorous randomized controlled trial at two clinical sites to determine
      if Restorative yoga compared to stretching exercises improves the metabolic syndrome among
      overweight and underactive individuals who meet criteria for the metabolic syndrome.
