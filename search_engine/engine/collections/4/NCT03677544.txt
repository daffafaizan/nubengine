      cystotomie (RC) and to validate significant factors on an external independent cohort.
      Pathological evaluation was performed by 2 well-trained uropathologists in each center (Y.A.
      and C.C). The investigators retrospectively reviewed data of all consecutive RC performed for
      bladder cancer in 2 high-volume institutions. Clinical, pathological, and follow-up data were
      collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. Pathological evaluation was performed
      by 2 well-trained uropathologists in each center. Logistic regression analyses were performed
      to identify predictive factors for final ureteral sections involvement. Significant factors
      in cohort A were validated in cohort B. Receiver operating curve and area under curve were
      modeled to evaluate predictive accuracy of the markers
