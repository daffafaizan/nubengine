      intersecting public health issues for drug-involved men. Low income, Black and Hispanic men
      especially bear the burden of the HIV epidemic and are over-represented in the U.S. criminal
      justice system. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data
      suggest that the health disparity in HIV rates is actually increasing for Black men: current
      estimates suggest 1 in 16 Black men in the U.S. will be infected with HIV in their life time.
      These HIV/STI transmission risks are fueled by high rates of poverty, incarceration,
      unemployment, and lack of access to health care and prevention services. The proposed study
      thus targets an underserved population at the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S.
