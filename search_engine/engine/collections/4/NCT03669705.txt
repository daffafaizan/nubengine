      early invasive BC, clin N0 rose dramatically. Only 10 % or less of these was N+ after
      axillary dissection with a substantial morbidity after the axillary intervention. Omitting
      axillary dissection in a randomized trial was ruled out because of anticipated few events. A
      national cohort was decided for invasive unifocal BC, Screening or clinical diagnosis were
      eligible, only histological grade 1 or 2, T=max 10mm, free margins , clinical node negative.
      No axillary dissection should be undertaken, only radical removal of the breast cancer.
      (Note; This was before the Sentinel Node era). Adjuvant treatment could be given according to
      regional guidelines for early breast cancer as no regular national guidelines existed then
      concerning postoperative radiotherapy and antihormonal treatment. Chemotherapy was not
      recommended to this type of breast cancer. Follow-up was done by the treating surgeon the
      first 5 years including mammography. Then hospital records including mammography and reports
      from Pathology and Oncology and Death register were followed at intervals 5, 10 and 15 years.
      Primary aim: Number of axillary recurrence and distant metastases/ BC specific survival.
      Correlation to adjuvant therapy. Inclusion started in 1997 and ended in 2002. 1584 patients
      were included. If the axillary recurrence rate was more than 1% per year the first five years
      the inclusion should be stopped.
