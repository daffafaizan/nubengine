      of two types of different foot orthoses after foot surgery.

      Therefore we have two groups:

        1. Hallux valgus surgery (Chevron, Austin, SCARF, Akin etc.)

        2. Hallux valgus and additional forefoot surgery (Chevron, Austin, SCARF, Akin etc. and
           WEIL - Osteotomy, Peg-in-Hole, etc.)

      BRT (brake response time) is assessed with commonly used right-sided hallux valgus shoes
      (HVS) and forefoot relief shoes (FRS). We measure the BRT at six different time points: one
      day before surgery without a foot orthosis (normal shoe)and with the orthoses (control run)
      (1) at two days (2), two weeks (3), four weeks (4) and six weeks (5) after the operation with
      a HVS and a FRS and eight weeks postoperative without a foot orthoses (6). The overall time
      frame is about nine weeks; each appointment for BRT measurement takes about fifteen to twenty
      minutes.

      The BRT was assessed using a custom-made driving simulator as used in previously published
      studies. Participants were instructed to apply the brake pedal exclusively with the right
      foot as quickly as possible on a visual stimulus. The time interval until the subject
      operated the brake was measured 20 times, averaged and then taken as BRT value.
