      have indicated that 30 to 66 percent of stroke survivors do not have full arm function six
      months post-stroke. Bilateral arm training has been investigated as a potential
      rehabilitation intervention for individuals not eligible for constraint induced movement
      therapy.

      This training study included 24 hours of treatment over eight weeks. The protocol consisted
      of reaching activities with rhythmic auditory cueing emphasizing the proximal arm. Subjects
      assigned to the bilateral group performed bilateral symmetrical activities while subjects in
      the unilateral group performed the same activity with the affected arm only. The Motor
      Assessment Scale-Upper Limb Item and the Motor Status Scale are used as primary outcome
      measures. The Reaching Performance Scale and strength measures are secondary outcome
      measures. Assessments are administered pre-/ and post-training by a blind rater.
