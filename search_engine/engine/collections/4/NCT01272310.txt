    
      This is a phase I/II, open clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      efficacy data of a fixed dose combination therapy of: HCQ, Peg-IFN alpha-2a and RBV in
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected subjects who failed to respond following a course of
      Peg-IFN and RBV Therapy (SoC). The study is a single center trial to be conducted at the
      Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, at Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.

      Overall, thirty six (36) patients will be recruited. All patients enrolled will have a
      documented history of chronic HCV disease and being non-responder on earlier Peg-IFN based
      treatment lasting for at least 12 consecutive weeks prior to study enrolment.

      The expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is
      in-between six weeks (42 days) up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day at visit 2
      (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory
      results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed twice on the
      first week of the study, once a week during the initiation of the treatment period at weeks
      2,3 and week 4, later during the treatment period once a month at weeks 8-48 and at two
      follow up visits post treatment to take place at week 60 and 72 (allowing a time window of Â±
      5 days for all visits).
