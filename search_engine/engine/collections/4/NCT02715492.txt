    
      Thromboembolism is a well-recognised complication of malignant disease. Clinical
      manifestations vary from venous thromboembolism to disseminated intravascular coagulation and
      arterial embolism. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most commonly observed in
      patients with haematological malignant disorders and those with wide spread metastatic
      cancer, whereas arterial embolism is most commonly observed in patients undergoing
      chemotherapy and in those with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis .

      The goals of using antithrombotic therapy with TACE in HCC are to minimize mortality and to
      improve survival rate without provoking excessive bleeding.
