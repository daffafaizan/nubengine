      non-randomized study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of dose-adjusted
      brequinar in adult subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Active Cohort 2 subjects on
      brequinar alone twice weekly may roll over into brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID.
      Cohort 3 subjects will begin treatment with brequinar alone twice weekly then move to
      brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID as tolerated. Both the brequinar and ribavirin doses
      may be adjusted based on safety, tolerability, and enzyme inhibition levels.
