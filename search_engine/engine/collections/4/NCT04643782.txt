      diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. Our primary hypothesis is that the
      ANNETM One system is non-inferior compared to polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of
      obstructive sleep apnea. Our secondary hypothesis is that the ANNETM One system is
      non-inferior to home sleep apnea tests (HST) in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea for
      patients who qualified for HST. Exploratory objectives include assessment of the diagnostic
      yield of the ANNETM One system worn over multiple sequential nights, repeatability of
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) calculations over multiple nights, and the predictive value of
      pulse arrival time to detect obstructive, central, and mixed apnea and hypopnea events.
