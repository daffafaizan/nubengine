      the exact mechanisms by which exercise prevents falls is unclear. Compensatory stepping and
      grasping reactions are frequently used to prevent a fall to the ground following a loss of
      balance. Age-related impairment in these reactions may be related to an increased risk of
      falling. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate means for reversing
      age-related impairment in compensatory stepping and grasping reactions. A training program
      involving perturbation-evoked reactions will be evaluated.

      Comparison(s): Balance recovery ability before and after a 6-week training program will be
      assessed. Performance of the training group will be compared to a control group not receiving
      stepping and grasping training.
