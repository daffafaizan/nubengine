           medical or surgical ICU, and intubated by the orotracheal route for >6 days, will be
           prospectively enrolled when extubation will be decided. Patients with previous
           swallowing disorders, ENT surgery or chronic persistent vegetative status will not be
           included. All patients will have to fulfill the usual criteria for extubation. Then,
           before extubation, the different components of swallowing functions will be evaluated by
           the trained physiotherapist, using a bedside pre-extubation scale based on 3 tests:
           assessment of 1)- cervical, oral, labial and lingual motricity; 2)- the gag reflex; and
           3)- swallowing. After extubation, the ability to cough and swallow, secretion volume,
           and the need for suctioning will be evaluated immediately, then at 24, 48 and 72 hours.

        -  Expected results : to validate a scale previously devised called " physiotherapist
           evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity before extubation" by
           the mean of a multicentric study. In our hypothesis the clinical parameters studied
           could be predictive of extubation failure. Then, this evaluation could help the medical
           decision in the choice of the good time for extubation. The final objective is to lower
           the mortality related to extubation failure.
