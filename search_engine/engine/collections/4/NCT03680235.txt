      I. Develop appropriate intervention strategies about the "breastfeeding-breast cancer
      connection" appropriate for use by experienced Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Peer
      Counselors (PCs) to disseminate to African-American mothers through a community-based
      participatory research (CBPR) approach including social media..

      II. Assess the comparative cognitive (e.g., knowledge, utility, cost-benefit), affective
      association (e.g., feelings), socioeconomic, familial and intent/outcome (e.g.,
      breastfeeding) measures pre- and post-intervention to determine effectiveness of the content
      to impact cognitive and feeling measures and increase breastfeeding in young African-American
      mothers compared to an existing counseling program.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive standard information about pregnancy and breastfeeding.
      Participants may also participate in a focus group with their partner/spouse or family
      members after the baby's birth.

      GROUP II: Participants receive standard information about pregnancy and breastfeeding as well
      as information about breastfeeding and breast cancer. Participants may also participate in a
      focus group with their partner/spouse or family members after the baby's birth.

      After completion of the information intervention, participants are followed for up to 1 year.
