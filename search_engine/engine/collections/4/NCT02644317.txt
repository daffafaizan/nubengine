      aged children with delayed motor development and to establish standard data, including the
      foot shape, footprint and balance development. The investigators also discuss the influence
      of the shoe insert with balance and flatfoot correction. Flatfoot leads to poor gross motor
      balance and the balance improvement after flatfoot correction has never been studied. The
      investigators findings should provide direct evidence as a reference for clinical workers.
