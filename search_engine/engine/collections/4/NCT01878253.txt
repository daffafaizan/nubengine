    
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy (defined as
      follows) of the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder System in unilateral primary total shoulder
      arthroplasty.

      Safety: Will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of device related adverse
      events or unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) in investigational subjects as well as
      analyzing survivorship using revision or intended revision as an endpoint.

      Efficacy: Will be determined by comparing the overall pain and functional performance,
      survivorship and radiographic success of investigational subjects with those subjects who
      received the control devices.
