    
      2 x 20 patients which are planned for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction are randomised:
      standard-group and LIA-group.

      All patients receive standardised multimodal intravenous analgesia. After standardised
      induction of anesthesia, patient positioning and administration of basic analgetics
      (paracetamol, diclofenac, clonidine and morfine), patients in the LIA-group receive a local
      infiltration in the knee of 10 mL ropivacaine and 10 mL lidocaine.

      Visual Analogue Scores are assessed 15 minutes after awakening from surgery and on Day 1, 2,
      3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after surgery. Postoperative analgesic consumption are registered in the
      first month after the surgery. The quality of recovery after anesthesia is assessed on Day 1
      by the postoperative quality of recovery score (QoR-15).
