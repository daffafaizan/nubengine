      medicines, may help prevent Alzheimer's disease. However, this has not been proven in humans.
      The purpose of this study is to see how simvastatin affects a substance in the spinal fluid
      around the brain called beta-amyloid-42 which is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's
      disease. This study also evaluates whether simvastatin improves regional brain blood flow (on
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), reduces inflammation, and improves cognitive function.

      The ESPRIT study was a 9-month randomized, controlled clinical trial that randomized 100
      middle-aged adults with a parental history of Alzheimer's disease. Participants were
      randomized to simvastatin 40 mg for one month then 80 mg daily or matching placebo tablets.
      Fifty of the ESPRIT subjects participated in the MRI sub-study.

      Participants had the following data collected: fasting blood tests (baseline and months 3 and
      9), medical history and medication questionnaires (each visit), study medication side effect
      review (all visits), lumbar puncture procedure (baseline and month 9), memory testing
      (baseline and months 3 and 9), and MRI (baseline and month 9 in 50 sub-study participants).
