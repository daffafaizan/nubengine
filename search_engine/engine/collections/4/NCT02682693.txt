      development of mouse mammary glands during pregnancy. RANKL functions as a major paracrine
      effector of the mitogenic action of progesterone in mouse and human mammary epithelium via
      its receptor RANK and has a role in ovarian hormone-dependent expansion and regenerative
      potential of mammary stem cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development
      of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models.

      In a retrospective analysis of 601 patients treated in the GeparTrio study with chemotherapy
      (TAC) it could be demonstrated that elevated expression of RANK (immunohistochemical score >
      8.5 using the N-1H8 antibody by Amgen) was found in 14.5% of patients overall, with a
      significant predominance in patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease (33.7% vs 6.4%
      tumors positive for RANK). Expression of RANK was associated with a higher pathological
      complete response rate (pCR) (23.0% vs 12.6%) but with a shorter disease-free and overall
      survival. The ABCSG-18 study showed that adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fractures,
      improves bone health, and can be administered without added toxicity. Moreover denosumab
      improves disease-free survival in postmenopausal woman with hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer.

      It appears therefore reasonable to test denosumab, a clinically available antibody against
      RANKL in patients with hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer as an adjunct to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to increase pCR rate and improve outcome in relation
      to the expression of RANK.
