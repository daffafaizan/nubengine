      the decision-making games. However, behavioral ratings of certainty during the task showed
      differences between groups. Anxiety-disordered participants indicated lower levels of
      certainty during the most uncertain conditions of the task (p < .05). This difference was
      consistent with the study hypothesis. Within-subjects analyses of the decision-making tasks
      showed that subjects responded as expected. Reaction times (RT) during uncertain conditions
      of the HiLo-Game were significantly longer than during more certain conditions (p = .001).
      Diary Task RTs for rating ambiguous situations were significantly longer than ratings of
      unambiguous situations (p = .019). Preliminary Analyses showed a significant correlation
      between Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and RT during the Marble Task (r = -0.54, p < .05).
      Preliminary analysis also showed significant correlation between ratings of level of anxiety
      during the diary task and IU, IS, MASC and the child version of the SCARED. These preliminary
      results were not submitted for publication.
