      Primary

        -  Determine the overall objective response-rate (partial and complete) and stable disease
           rate in patients with HER2/neu positive metastatic breast cancer treated with the
           combination of irinotecan hydrochloride and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) after prior first-
           or second-line therapy with trastuzumab combined with other chemotherapeutic agents.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicities of this combination regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated
           with this combination.

        -  Document development of brain metastases or progression of known metastases in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
