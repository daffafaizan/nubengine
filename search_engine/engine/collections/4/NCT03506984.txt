    
      Training Procedure for group (A):

        1. Each participant had signed a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about
           the procedure.

        2. BMI had been measured body weight(Kg) and height (m2)

           a. BMI= body weight (Kg)/ height (m2).

        3. Resting pulse rate had been measured to the participant three successive times then the
           mean had to be taken.

        4. A blood sample had been taken by a nurse in a heparinized tube and delivered to lab
           within six hours.

        5. The participant had been asked to walk as quickly as he could in a 30-meter pre-measured
           flat walking area with interval markings every three meters for six minutes. Cones or
           brightly colored tape to mark boundaries of the walkway with cones placed at the
           beginning and end of the 30-meter boundary to indicate turns. (Actual distance). (BALKE
           1963)

        6. Teaching the participant had been reached how to perform high interval training
           exercise.

        7. The load had been determined according to maximum heart rate obtained from
           cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed by cardiologist.

        8. high intensity (85% - 95% MHR) and the interval period (60% - 75% MHR) .(Gibala et al.
           2006)

        9. The participant's started by five minutes warming up on the bicycle ergometer with no
           resistance as shown in fig (8).

       10. Then one minute of high intensity training followed by one and half minute of low
           intensity training for 20 to 30 minutes.

       11. Finally, a five minutes of cooling down with no resistance had performed.

       12. Post treatment evaluation had been done using step three, four and step five.

      Training Procedure for group (B):

        1. Each participant had signed a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about
           the procedure.

        2. BMI had been measured body weight(Kg) and height (m2)

           a. BMI= body weight (Kg)/ height (m2).

        3. Resting pulse rate had been measured to the participant three successive times then the
           mean had to be taken.

        4. A blood sample had been taken by a nurse in a heparinized tube and delivered to lab
           within six hours.

        5. The participant had been asked to walk as quickly as he could in a 30-meter pre-measured
           flat walking area with interval markings every three meters for six minutes. Cones or
           brightly colored tape to mark boundaries of the walkway with cones placed at the
           beginning and end of the 30-meter boundary to indicate turns. (Actual distance). (BALKE
           1963)

        6. Teaching the participant had been teached how to use the threshold based Inspiratory
           muscle trainer device.

        7. The load had been determined according to 10 maximum repetitions (10RMax).

        8. The intensity had been 60% to 80% of the participant's maximal effort.(Enright &
           Unnithan 2011)

        9. The Inspiratory Muscle Trainer had been applied for (10 to 15) minutes once daily with
           frequency three times per week for four weeks as shown in fig (9).

       10. Post treatment evaluation had been done using step three, four and step five.
