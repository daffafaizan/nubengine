      contraction (MVC) test of the lower limbs in two dynamometers. One being a low-cost
      dynamometer (S2P-CD), and the other being a gold standard dynamometer (HUMAC). The tests will
      be carried out with 72-96 hours between them. Thereby the investigators will be able to
      assess the validity of the S2P-CD.

      In part 2 of the study, eighteen persons with spinal cord injury will undergo MVC twice in
      the S2P-CD. Participants will be recruited through the Spinal Cord Injury Centre of Western
      Denmark (SCIWDK). The test will be carried out with 30min between them. Thereby the
      investigators will be able to assess the reliability of the measurements of the S2P-CD.
