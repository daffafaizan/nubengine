      treatment in the same arch participated in this study. They were healthy children rated 3 or
      4 according to Frankl behavioral rating scale. They were selected from the clinic of
      Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University.

      A randomized split mouth design was done in which each child received both tested topical
      anesthetics on each side of the arch. The topical anesthetic gel patch or the topical gel
      application was randomly used at the first or second visits. Pain or discomfort was evaluated
      during injection using sound, eye, motor (SEM) scale, and after injection using faces pain
      scale- revised (FPS-R).
