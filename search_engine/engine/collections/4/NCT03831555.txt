      readiness for treatment of Hepatitis C (HCV) and associated interventions based on identified
      barriers can improve treatment adherence and outcomes. HCV remains a leading cause of liver
      cancer and end stage liver disease despite greater than 90% cure rates with new, all-oral
      antiviral medications. While these new medications are easier to tolerate and access than
      previous treatment regimens, medication adherence still remains a great barrier to cure. In
      this study, we will administer the Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for
      Hepatitis C Treatment (PREP-C) tool, a free, online survey developed at the Mount Sinai
      School of Medicine to determine psychosocial readiness for treatment.
