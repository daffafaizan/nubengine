      ventilated by noninvasive and invasive positive pressure ventilation. Nasal cannula is the
      most common pattern of oxygen therapy in mild AECOPD. As a low flow oxygen therapy, nasal
      cannula has many disadvantages: discomfort, low humidity and unstable fraction of inspired
      oxygen(FiO2) in inspiratory gas. Therefore, we design a RCT to explore whether HFNC would be
      better than nasal cannula to prevent the aggravation of respiratory failure and endotracheal
      intubation in mild AECOPD.
