      sorafenib in patients with HCC. Clinical trial and post-marketing data suggest that sorafenib
      dose reductions and discontinuations due to adverse events are common and limit the drug's
      effectiveness. It is our hypothesis that a dose escalation strategy for sorafenib will
      improve the tolerability and allow a greater percentage of patients to remain on drug. The
      primary end-point of the study is the total accumulated and median daily dose of sorafenib
      delivered at month 2 and 4.
