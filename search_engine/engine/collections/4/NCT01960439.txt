      disease activity. Endoscopic images will be obtained from recent large multicenter randomized
      clinical trial and assessed using utilizing CIMS readers using EIs (MMCS, UCEIS, MBS) and a
      VAS (visual analog scale). The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was clinical and
      endoscopic remission at week 6, with a secondary endpoint of endoscopic and clinical
      remission at week 10. For the same subjects, clinical data will be obtained including a
      modified UCDAI (Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index). Central readers are blinded to
      clinical scores.
