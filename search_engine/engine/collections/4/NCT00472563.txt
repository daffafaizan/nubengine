      published protocol (Merten et al.JAMA 2004;291(19):2328-34). Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups of treatment. Group A will receive 1 cc/kg/hour of 0.9% saline
      infusion starting 12 hours before and continuing 12 hours after the procedure. Group B will
      receive 3 cc/kg of sodium bicarbonate solution for one hour prior to procedure, then drip
      rate will be decreased to 1 cc/kg/hour until 6 hours post procedure.

      Phase 2/3 study Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Prevention, Randomized, Open Label,
      Active Control, Parallel Assignment, Efficacy Study.

      Subjects: Consecutive samples of all inpatients who meet the inclusion criteria

      Primary outcomes: Development of contrast induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in
      serum creatinine of 25% or more within 48 h after administration of contrast.

      Secondary outcomes: change in serum bicarbonate; change in serum potassium; change in serum
      creatinine.

      Expected total enrollment: 212

      Allocation Assignment: Patients who meet inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the
      study will be assigned by a random number table to saline or bicarbonate, using closed
      envelopes and stratifying according to history of diabetes and type of procedure (cardiac
      catheterism or others).

      Condition: Contrast Induced Nephropathy

      Intervention: 75 cc of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) mixed in 425 cc of D5W

      Gender: both Age: 18+ years of age Recruitment Status: participants are currently being
      recruited
