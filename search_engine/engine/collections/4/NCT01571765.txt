      support initiative in Bushenyi District, using mixed methods. The study will assess 8 of the
      11 key core MNCH indicators as identified by CIDA as a priority. Other information to be
      collected such as demographics and patterns of health care use, and prevalence of disease
      will help health planners in the districts, and will be helpful in sub analysis and
      interpretation of findings. The main study will use household surveys in both districts at
      baseline, midline and endline. Other tools will include pre and post qualitative surveys
      (FGDs, KII) and analysis of operational data.

      The main study group will be representative communities and health centres within Bushenyi
      District who will receive intervention between 2012 and 2014; Rubirizi District will serve as
      a control area for this study but will received selected MNCH services starting in 2013 after
      midline data are collected.
