      and blood will be collected from infertile individuals referred to our IVF unit at Hillel
      Yaffe Medical Center. Informed written consent will be obtained from each participant.
      Standard semen analysis will be carried out according to World Health Organization protocol.
      An aliquot of semen sample will be used for assessment of sperm motility, concentration, and
      morphology by using computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) and the remaining sample will be
      used for assessment of sperm telomere lengths and telomerase activity. Genomic DNA will be
      extracted from the remaining washed sperm and peripheral blood. Sperm telomere length will be
      determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and telomerase activity will be
      determined by TRAP assay (Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol).
