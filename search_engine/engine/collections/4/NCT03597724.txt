      be free to ask any questions to the doctor/researcher. Once the consent form signed,
      participants will receive the questionnaire and will be asked to complete it. Explanation of
      the task and an example choice task should be provided by a doctor or a researcher but the
      questionnaire is intended to be self-administered. Nevertheless, some level of support can be
      brought if necessary.

      The questionnaire is composed by a general explanation of the purpose of the study followed
      by a definition of sarcopenia and a clear description of the DCE task. The attributes and
      levels are carefully explained in the introduction part of the questionnaire and an example
      of a completed choice set is provided. Each patient will then receive 13 choice sets. After
      completion of the choice tasks, respondents will be asked how difficult they found the choice
      tasks on a seven-point scale. Participants who graded the level of difficulty as "extremely
      difficult" will be removed from the analyses. The DCE task is presented in Appendix 1. The
      questionnaire also asks questions on patients' characteristics.

      The questionnaire has been created with experts during the phase of "Identification and
      prioritization of important outcomes of sarcopenia". Five attributes and different levels of
      consequences have been identified by the panel.
