      tolerated the treatment regimen in Protocol 301012-CS5 (NCT00607373), 301012-CS7
      (NCT00706849) or MIPO3500108 (NCT00794664) and satisfactorily completed the study through to
      Week 28 were eligible for participation in this open label treatment extension study for up
      to 4 years or until mipomersen was commercially available, whichever comes first. Consenting
      participants who had tolerated mipomersen and satisfactorily completed 301012-CS17
      (NCT00477594) through Year 3 may also enroll for up to an additional 2 years of treatment in
      this study or until mipomersen was commercially available, whichever comes first. All
      participants, who entered the study, received 200 mg mipomersen (ISIS 301012) subcutaneously
      (s.c.) every week, including those who were randomized to placebo in their initial study.
      Participants who were originally enrolled in Protocol 301012-CS5 (NCT00607373) and weighed
      <50 kg received 160 mg every week. Dose adjustments (70 mg injections administered three
      times per week, on separate days) were allowed for participants who were not tolerating or
      who had previous issues with tolerating the once a week injections due to injection site
      reactions (ISRs) or flu-like symptoms. Study visits and clinical lab assessments including
      hematology with differential, chemistry, serum lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL-C, very
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
      apolipoprotein B (apoB), apoA-1, triglycerides (TG) and Lp(a), and urinalysis was to be
      performed every 4-10 weeks during the treatment period. Plasma trough mipomersen (ISIS
      301012) levels was to be measured to estimate exposure. Participants who completed dosing or
      who discontinued prematurely from the study for any reason was followed for safety for 24
      weeks (safety follow-up period) after their last dose of mipomersen (ISIS 301012) or longer
      in the case of a significant adverse events (AE) or abnormal biochemical or clinical finding.
      Participants were required to return to the study center for clinical evaluation and clinical
      laboratory tests every 8 weeks during the safety follow-up period.
