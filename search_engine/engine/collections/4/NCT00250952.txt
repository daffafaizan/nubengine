      the quality of the result and the duration of effect on the treatment of upper face rhytides,
      even though the dose remains the same.

      20 female subjects (10 per site), who fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study
      participation were injected with 5 units of Botox (one injection each side) into the crow's
      feet area. The injections were prepared with one side randomly receiving a five fold
      difference in volume for dilution.

      Response to treatment was evaluated at 14 days, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days after the
      injection visit. Standardized photography was taken at each visit.

      Analysis of the photographs of the lateral orbital (crow's feet rhytides) at maximum
      attempted contraction (maximum smile) was done by Canfield Scientific, Inc., using a
      specialized software program created to detect and measure changes.
