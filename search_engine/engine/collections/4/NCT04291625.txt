      lagophthalmos formula method for levator resection in determining postoperative eyelid height
      in congenital ptosis on Egyptian children. The study included 20 eyelids of 17 Egyptian
      children with congenital ptosis with levator function of 4mm or better, they underwent
      levator muscle resection guided by the recent intraoperative lagophthalmos formula.

      Preoperative MRD 1 (Margin-to-reflex distance 1) and levator function were measured, then
      intraoperative palpebral fissure opening was determined from formula: Intraoperative
      lagophthalmos=9.08 - 0.48×Preoperative MRD1 - 0.26× Levator function. Postoperative MRD 1 was
      measured after 1 day, 1week,1month, 3 months and 6 months .Success was defined as
      postoperative MRD 1 ≥ 3 mm and difference between both eyelids height ≤ 1 mm at 6 months.
