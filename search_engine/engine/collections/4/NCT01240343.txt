      specialties and Specialists with each other, outside traditional limits of hospital or
      laboratory departments. The specimens (blood, fluids, and/or tissue samples) that will be
      collected from men, women and children will assist the researchers in a variety of studies on
      human eye diseases.

      Research utilizing these specimens will allow for an increased understanding of the etiology,
      disease process, and response to treatments for various eye diseases, and will provide
      opportunities to subsequently improve our management decisions. Furthermore, projects that
      cross over between subspecialties are sparse and that is a limiting factor for the
      development of research that takes a more comprehensive approach.
