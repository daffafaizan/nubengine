      with ablation therapy. Pulmonary vein isolation along with additional substrate medication is
      commonly performed during ablation procedures is associated with 60-80% success rate for
      maintenance of sinus rhythm. After AF ablation hypertension (HTN) is a strong predictor for
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Drug resistant hypertension can be effectively treated
      with catheter based renal denervation therapy. Our primary hypothesis is concomitant renal
      denervation therapy along with AF ablation is associated with improvement in success rates of
      AF ablation along with adequate control of blood pressure. The specific objectives of this
      study are to prospectively compare success rates, time to AF recurrence, AF burden and blood
      pressure controls in patients randomized to concomitant renal denervation arm when compared
      to patients with AF ablation alone.
