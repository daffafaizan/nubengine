    
      Design:

      Prospective, randomized, -controlled (1:1 randomization), duration-2 single sessions one week
      apart

      Setting:

      University psychiatric hospitals in Tehran including Roozbeh Hospital, Rasool Hospital and
      Imam Hossein General Hospital will refer clients to Iranian National Center for Addiction
      Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

      Patients:

      Fifteen patients with Methamphetamine abuse for at least 2 years plus ADHD are compared with
      a control group of 15 ADHD patients matched for age and gender

      INTERVENTION:

      We administer 2 single doses of methylphenidate tablets (10mg) separated by a week interval.
      A paired pulse protocols will be performed with ten single (unconditioned test pulse) and ten
      paired TMS pulses (conditioning and test pulse) in an intermixed randomized order.

      Short interval cortical inhibition is measured with an Inter-stimulus Intervals (ISI) of 3
      msec and a stimulator output of 80% RMT for the conditioning stimulus and 1mVT stimulation
      intensity for the test stimulus. ICF investigation is measured with an ISI of 13 msec), with
      the condition of an ISI of 50 msec (ISI 50) and both stimuli applied with 1mVT intensity).
      Long Interval Cortical Inhibition (LICI) is measured with ISIs of 100 msec (ISI 100), 200
      msec (ISI 200), and 300 msec (ISI 300); both stimuli with 1mVT intensity.
