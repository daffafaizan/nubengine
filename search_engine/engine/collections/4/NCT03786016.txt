      individuals who are resilient to the stressors of prolonged human spaceflight, thereby
      encouraging the successful completion of exploration missions and the preservation of health
      over the life of an astronaut. This study leverages the National Institute of Mental Health
      (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) heuristic framework to conduct experimental studies to
      identify biological domains (molecular, circuitry, physiology) and behavioral domains that
      relate to individual adaptation and resiliency (as well as behavioral vulnerability) in
      spaceflight-relevant confined environments. This study focuses specifically on differences
      among participants in their tolerance of and adaptability to simulated conditions of
      spaceflight such as confinement, work, monotony, and social/physical isolation that impact
      behavioral health and performance.
