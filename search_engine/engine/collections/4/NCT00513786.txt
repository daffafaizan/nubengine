      combination carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab(Avastin) in patients with advanced stage
      endometrial carcinoma. This is a phase II,open label,single center study. Patients will
      receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab in an outpatient center by intravenous
      administration. The primary objectives is to study the progression free survival at 24 months
      after initiation of treatment and to determine the toxicity profile of the drug combinations.
      The secondary objectives are to estimate the overall survival and tumor response for this
      group of patients.
