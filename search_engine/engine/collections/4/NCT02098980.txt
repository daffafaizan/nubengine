      vitamin D and suggest that it may protect against the diseases through the improvement of
      insulin sensitivity as well as secretion and reducing chronic inflammation. Although some of
      these effects were shown in clinical studies, no study permitted the inference that vitamin D
      can reduce blood glucose and attenuate inflammation. Post-prandial glucose is the most
      sensitive to alterations in insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is rational to examine whether
      vitamin D can enhance oral glucose tolerance in individuals at risk for developing T2DM and
      to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs, i.e. via improved insulin sensitivity or
      improved insulin secretion, or both. Furthermore, identifying a distinct proteomics-based
      signature that can be used to distinguish responders to supplementation from non-responders
      is critical to define the bases for inter-individual variation in response and the effect of
      vitamin D on the prevention of T2DM. Identification of this proteomics-based signature will
      enable us to tailor alternative preventive measures to adjust the vitamin D dose to
      non-responders, leading to more effective and precise intervention protocols.
