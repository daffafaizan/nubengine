      patients with metastatic or locoregionally advanced pancreatic cancer. II. Assess the
      toxicity, response rate, duration of response, time to progression, survival, performance
      status, and weight associated with these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patents are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 21 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 6 weeks until disease progression, and then every 8 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 82 patients (41 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
