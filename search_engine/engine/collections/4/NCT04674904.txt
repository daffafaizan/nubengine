      methods of dry needling, its effectiveness, and physiologic and adverse effects are
      discussed. Dry needling is a treatment modality that is minimally invasive, cheap, easy to
      learn with appropriate training, and carries a low risk. The deep method of dry needling has
      been shown to be more effective than the superficial one for the treatment of pain associated
      with myofascial trigger points. However, over areas with potential risk of significant
      adverse events, such as lungs and large blood vessels, we suggest using the superficial
      technique, which has also been shown to be effective. Questionnaire for assessing the
      improvement in quality of life is by NDI and ranges like neck flexion/extension, side bending
      and rotation will be measured by standard goniometry. Neck disability index will use to check
      the patient's ability to perform his ADL before and after the treatment/control. Data will be
      collected from Riphah rehab center. Assessed patients of UCS of age 20 to 50 will be the
      targeted population of this study. Patients with systematic and bony disease excluded from
      the study. Population having stiff upper back, tight trap and stiff upper thoracic spine have
      UCS. Ethical guidelines will be followed for both treatment and control group. SPSS version
      21 will be use for data analysis with sample size of 34 participants, 17 participants each
      group that will randomly allocated in treatment/control group.
