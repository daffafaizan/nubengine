        -  Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes Day -14 (Loading Dose)

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes, day -7.

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes, days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36.

        -  External beam radiation therapy, beginning on day 1, 4500 cGy to esophagus with boost of
           540 cGy at 180 cGy per fraction for 6 weeks.

        -  Surgical resection of primary tumor and adjacent mediastinal and/or celiac lymph nodes
           by a transthoracic approach after satisfactory hematologic and functional recovery
           within 8 weeks of completion of radiation therapy.

        -  For patients who give their consent, fresh frozen tissue will be obtained per EUS at
           baseline, per EUS 2 weeks after the initiation of cetuximab, and at the time of surgery
