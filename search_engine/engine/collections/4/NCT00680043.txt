      inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin.
      Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other
      nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The presence and severity of anemia
      are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure. Anemia is associated with increased
      mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased
      left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

      Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been established as a treatment for anemia in
      chronic renal failure subjects, and have improved the management of anemia over alternatives
      such as transfusion. Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the treatment of
      anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Peginesatide binds to and activates the human
      erythropoietin receptor and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell precursors in a
      manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

      Eligible participants were randomized in equal proportions to two peginesatide treatment
      regimens, in which participants received peginesatide once every 4 weeks, and one control,
      epoetin alfa, treatment regimen, in which participants received epoetin alfa three times per
      week. Total commitment time of this study was a 4 week screening period followed by a minimum
      of 7 months of treatment.
