      conditions, there is often poorer glycemic control. Published papers conclude that
      periodontal treatment leads to a reduction in hemoglobin A1c; however, other studies show
      limited or no improvement. Some patients do not respond well to professional periodontal
      therapy, even without diabetes, which could be related to poor oral hygiene and/or host
      factors including microbial profiles. There are few published papers investigating the
      efficacy of periodontal therapy in diabetics and fewer that include assessment of the oral
      microbiome. The investigators will examine systemic changes in diabetes status and microbiome
      influences on clinical response to periodontal therapy in a randomized clinical trial. It has
      been shown that chlorhexidine gluconate rinse leads to significant clinical improvement over
      standard periodontal therapy alone, and interdental tooth cleaners remove more dental plaque
      (leading to reduced gingival inflammation) effectively than brushing alone. Therefore, in
      this study, standard periodontal therapy, scaling and root planning (SRP) will be provided
      alone, or SRP plus supportive periodontal therapy (SPT), the use of chlorhexidine gluconate
      rinse (ParoexÂ®) and a rubber interdental bristle cleaner (Soft-Picks), to diabetics and
      non-diabetics with periodontal disease to determine the differences in response between the
      groups.

      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of SRP alone versus SRP+SPT on
      clinical, microbiological and immunological status of subjects with and without type 2
      diabetes and with periodontal disease. A clearer understanding of how periodontal therapy
      affects diabetes status could lead to the development of novel new targeted therapies of both
      periodontal disease and diabetes.
