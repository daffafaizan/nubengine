    
      A retrospective observational anonymized cohort study of follitropin alpha biosimilar
      (Primapur®) as a pre-filled pen injector with a dose adjustment of 5 IU, aimed to investigate
      its efficacy and safety in a nonselected population with indications to assisted reproductive
      technologies (ART) was carried out. The ovarian stimulation (OS) protocols included:

      monotherapy protocols with using only Primapur®; mixed protocols (recombinant and
      urinary-derived gonadotropins); short protocols with using antagonists of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and long protocols with GnRH agonists. The stimulation
      protocols were analyzed with Primapur® application for at least 5 days.
