    
      Descriptive study of spastic cocontraction index before and after botulinum toxin A
      injections during active elbow extension in chronic vascular hemiplegic patients.

      The spastic cocontraction score will be compared between T1 (before the Botulinum toxin A
      injection) and T2 (4 weeks after the botulinum toxin A injection in the elbow flexors).

      There is no control group. The patient is his own witness: the non-paretic side is considered
      as the physiological reference in terms of the level of spastic cocontractions.

      Botulinum toxin A injections are performed in routine clinical practice in the Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, following the recommendations in force. This
      treatment has been shown to be effective on spasticity in several high-level studies. The
      reduction of spasticity, evaluated clinically (Tardieu and Ashworth scale), is a criterion of
      efficacy of botulinum toxin A injections.

      The evaluation of the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A injections on the other components
      of muscular hyperactivity, such as the reduction of spastic cocontraction during active
      movements, is poorly performed in clinical and clinical research. This protocol includes
      specific assessments to evaluate the evolution of spastic cocontraction.
