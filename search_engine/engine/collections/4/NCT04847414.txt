    
      We will conduct an observational cross-sectional study and cluster analysis for patients from
      different Diabetes clinics and tertiary centres located in different governorates in Upper
      Egypt. Our participants in this study will be divided into two groups:

        1. The first group will be as a prospective group, All necessary examinations and
           investigations will be performed for every patient of this group during their clinic
           visit at the time of registration to this study.

        2. The second group will be the retrospective group. Data for those patients will be
           collected from electronic records and/or paper records in collaboration with different
           diabetes centres and clinics scattered in Upper Egypt governorates. We will collect
           clinical and lab data as much as we can. All available data for this group at end of
           this study will be used in the clustering of this group.

      Then we will use the above data from both groups to classify diabetic patients to the new
      clusters and to find the association between those clusters and the incidence of
      microvascular complications.
