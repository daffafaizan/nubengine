      To observe the efficacy of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises applied after the Epley maneuver on
      balance, vertigo symptoms, and quality of life in patients with posterior canal BPPV.

      Study Design:

      Single-blind randomized controlled study

      Sample Size:

      Thirty-six patients were recruited in the study and were randomized equally into Epley
      maneuver (EpleyM) and Epley maneuver and exercise (EpleyM&Exe) groups.

      Study Method:

      All patients were treated with the Epley maneuver, while CawthorneCooksey exercises were
      given to the EpleyM&Exe group as home exercises for 6 weeks. Static and dynamic balance,
      vertigo and associated symptoms, and quality of life were assessed with the Nintendo Wii
      Balance Board, Berg Balance Test, Vertigo Symptom Scale, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory,
      respectively. The assessments were repeated at the 1st, 3rd, and 6th weeks.
