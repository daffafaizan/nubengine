      effective for people with PACS, and in fact some symptoms have been observed to worsen over
      time. This inconsistency in clinical response has created a need for alternative treatment
      options to be explored. CBD presents a novel approach that warrants further investigation.

      After review and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), potential study
      participants will be recruited from on-line support groups who have identified themselves as
      persons experiencing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome also known as (long-haulers syndrome).

      The study will be registered on the www.clincaltrials.gov website and will accept referrals
      from targeted clinics who refer their patients to the investigational site listed and
      individuals can also self-refer to the study center team.

      Subjects will be evaluated weekly using telemedicine procedures. At completion of study,
      there will be a 7-day and 14-day follow up telemedicine visit to assess for continued benefit
      and/or re-emergence of symptoms/relapse.
