      of pregnant women worldwide are anemic .

      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the condition in which there is anemia due to a lack of iron.
      IDA develops when available iron is insufficient to support normal red cell production and is
      the most common type of anemia Anemia has a significant impact on the health of the fetus as
      well as that of the mother. It impairs the oxygen delivery through the placenta to the fetus
      and interferes with the normal intrauterine growth, leading to fetal loss and perinatal
      deaths. Anemia is associated with increased preterm labor (28.2%), preeclampsia (31.2%), and
      maternal sepsis.

      The daily requirement of iron is around 1.5 mg in nonpregnant women. This requirement
      increases dramatically during pregnancy to reach 6-7 mg/day (total 1000 mg) with advanced
      gestational age. Pregnancy causes a twofold to threefold increase in the requirement for iron
      and a 10- to 20-fold increase in folate requirement. The increase in demand for iron is
      mainly due to fetal requirement, placenta, blood volume, tissue accretion, and the
      intra-partum potential for blood loss
