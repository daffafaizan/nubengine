      that might influence Hgb or IVI levels will be documented.

      All main analyses will be pre-defined in detail in a statistical analysis plan. In order to
      analyse the responsiveness to IVI, the change in Hgb levels from PBM clinic to day 0 will be
      analysed using multivariable regression models. The association of change in Hgb and hepcidin
      will be analysed adjusting for potentially confounding factors as age, gender or number of
      days from PBM clinic to surgery. The correlation of hepcidin and standard iron parameters
      will be assessed. Based on the increase in Hgb levels, responders to IVI will be defined. The
      definition of good- bad responder in terms of delta Hgb levels depends on the time between
      IVI substitution and surgery. ROC analyses will be performed and potential predictors (e.g.
      hepcidin, ferritin) will be compared concerning the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
