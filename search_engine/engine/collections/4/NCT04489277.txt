      following endovascular treatment of the aortic arch. The objective of this work was to
      quantify these lesions using the STEP registry.

      Methods. This multicentre retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients treated
      with an aortic endoprosthesis deployed in Ishimaru zone 0 to 3 and brain diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 7 days after the procedure. DW-MRI was performed
      to identify the location and number of new silent brain infarctions (SBI), microbleeds ans
      general outcome of the patients.
