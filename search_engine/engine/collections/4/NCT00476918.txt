      edema. Intravitreal injected Triamcinolone Acetonide (steroid) reduces macular edema and
      increases visual acuity. The duration of its effect is however limited. Therefore, several
      injections are necessary.

      In this study a dosage dependency of triamcinolone acetonide (high dosage vs low dosage) is
      performed. The primary outcome parameters are the number of treatments and the efficacy of
      each injection.
