      BMTP-11 is designed to use a protein to bind to cancer cells, move into the cancer cells, and
      cause the cancer cells to die. This is the first study using BMTP-11 in humans.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of BMTP-11 based on when you joined this study. Up to 2 dose levels of BMTP-11 will be
      tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of BMTP-11 is found.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive BMTP-11 though a needle into your
      vein over 2 hours.

      Before each dose of BMTP-11, you will receive saline (salt water) by vein for over 2 hours.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 7 and 14 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side
           effects.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood
           will also be used to check your heart health.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function.

      On Day 21 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side
           effects.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood
           will also be used to check your heart health.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your prostatic specific antigen (PSA)
           and testosterone levels.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side
           effects.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood
           will also be used to check your heart health.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your PSA and testosterone levels.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on active study for up to 9 weeks. You will be taken off study if you experience
      intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse. Please note that even if the treatment
      has a beneficial effect on the cancer, the treatment cannot be continued for more than two
      cycles due to the very limited supply of drug available.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Between 4 and 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit.
      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side
           effects.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine
           blood draw will include measurement of your PSA and testosterone levels. A part of this
           blood will also be used to see if your immune system reacted to BMTP-11 by forming an
           antibody and to assess your heart's health.

        -  Urine will be collected for 24 hours to test for protein in your urine.

        -  You will have CT or MRI scans of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray.

        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      At 3, 6, and 9 months after the last dose of study drug, you will be called or e-mailed and
      asked how you are doing. This will only take a few minutes. You will be required to have
      blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) for routine testing. This can be done at your local doctor's
      office and results faxed to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

      This is an investigational study. BMTP-11 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At
      this time, BMTP-11 is only being used in research.

      Up to 22 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
