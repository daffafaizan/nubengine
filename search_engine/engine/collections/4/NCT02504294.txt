    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira for maintenance of
      hemoglobin levels in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects on hemodialysis using a
      specified algorithm for the dosing of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA).

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira on the dosing of
      ESA in anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using a specified algorithm for the dosing of ESA.

      Exploratory Objectives: To generate hypotheses regarding maintenance of hemoglobin levels,
      dosing of ESA, intravenous (IV) iron dosing requirements, transferrin saturation (TSAT)
      levels and ferritin levels associated with the switch from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira in
      anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using specified algorithms for the dosing of ESA and for
      the dosing of IV iron, that are standard of care.
