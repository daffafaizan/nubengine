    
      This 4-cohort study was conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 consisted out of 2 Cohorts. In each
      cohort subjects were randomized 10:3 to either receive ESBA1008 (Cohort 1 : 2 injections,
      Cohort 2 : 1 infusion and 1 injection) or 2 Lucentis injections. Stage 2 was conducted
      similarly with a different dosing level for ESBA1008 (Cohort 3 and 4). Subjects had follow-up
      visits at Day 7 and Day 14. All cohorts receiving ESBA1008 on Day 0 also received ESBA1008
      6mg/50 Î¼L via injection on Day 28. After the Day 28 visit (all cohorts), subjects returned
      for follow up visits at Day 42 and Day 56.
