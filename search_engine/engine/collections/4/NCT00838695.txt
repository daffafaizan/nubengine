      examine the local in vivo effect of vasoactive drugs without elucidating systemic
      counterregulatory reflexes. Infusion of incremental low doses of phenylephrine into a dorsal
      hand vein results in increasing local venoconstriction, without systemic effects. Similarly,
      infusion of incremental low doses of nitroglycerin into a preconstricted dorsal hand vein
      results in increasing local venodilation, without systemic effects. Systemic vascular
      responses can be measured by the cold pressor test (CPT),that leads to increase in blood
      pressure and heart rate , or mental stress that is also known to stimulate cardiovascular
      responses. Individuals vary in their local and systemic vascular responses but the genetic
      determinants of these are not clear.
