      Patients who had been admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with AECOPD were recruited for
      this study. Subjects with pneumonic changes on the chest radiographs were excluded. Age and
      sex-matched COPD subjects at stable state (without AECOPD for at least 10 weeks) and healthy,
      non-smoking subjects were recruited as controls.

      Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) EBC was collected using the EcoScreen (VIASYS
      Healthcare, Conshohochen, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EBC was
      stored in 250 microL aliquots immediately at -70oC until analysis. EBC was collected on Day
      5, 14, 30 and 60 after hospitalization for subjects with AECOPD. For the stable COPD patients
      and normal controls, EBC collection was performed once.

      Measurement of TNF alpha, LTB4 and IL-8 The concentrations of TNF alpha, LTB4, and IL-8 in
      EBC were measured in one batch by high-sensitivity sandwich enzyme immunoassays (TNF alpha
      and IL-8 from BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, USA; LTB4 from Cayman Chemical Company,
      Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Intra-subject repeatability
      of TNF alpha, LTB4 and IL-8 was assessed by collection of EBC in stable COPD subjects. EBC
      was collected as described above at the same time (09:00 to 10:00) on 2 consecutive days.
