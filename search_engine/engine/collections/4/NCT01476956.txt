      therapy will be implemented according to 2010 European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      recommendations which state a target of remission (DAS44 <1.6) for patients receiving
      standard DMARD therapy in the setting of early disease and a target of low disease activity
      state (LDAS) (DAS44 ≤2.4) for patients receiving anti-TNFα therapy in the setting of
      established disease.
