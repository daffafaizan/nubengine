      bone augmentation using sandwich osteotomy and inlay bone grafting; to minimize movement of
      the bone segment and allow for new bone formation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      evaluate vertical bone height achieved at the anterior maxilla in vertical segmental sandwich
      osteotomy with simultaneous implant placement versus the same technique using fixation
      plates.

      Description of Sandwich Osteotomy procedure to be done:

        -  A full thickness pyramidal flap with buccal paracrestal incision and two vertical
           releasing incisions slightly divergent to each other will be made. Then the
           mucoperiosteal flap will be reflected exposing the whole buccal cortical plate without
           reflection of the palatal mucosa.

        -  The palatal mucosa will not be reflected to avoid disturbance of blood supply to the
           mobilized segment for proper healing.

        -  With a Tungsten carbide disc - 1 mm in thickness and 10 mm in diameter - the alveolar
           bone will be segmented using a horizontal cut 3 to 5 mm apical to the crest of the
           ridge, and two lateral vertically oblique cuts 1-2 mm away from adjacent teeth roots
           slightly converging toward the alveolar crest or almost parallel to each other; thus
           creating a trapezoid-shaped bone segment pedicled on the attached palatal tissues.

        -  The horizontal and the two vertical cuts will then be revised using a set of graduated
           ridge splitting (fine chisels) osteotomes of sequential width and a light weight mallet
           to ensure that the surgical cuts are down to spongy bone.

        -  The segment will then be mobilized crestally, pedicled on the non-reflected palatal
           tissue.
