      efficacy of a colorectal cancer screening decision support intervention for patients ages 70
      to 84 within a clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the
      intervention will prepare patients for individualized decision making with their providers
      and result in an improvement in appropriate CRC screening decisions and screening outcomes.
      To assess appropriate CRC screening decisions and screening, the investigators will use a
      classification scheme derived from the literature based on age and the Charlson Comorbidity
      Index. Using this scheme, appropriate screening will include screening for those in the best
      health because they are likely to benefit, no screening for those in the worst health because
      they are unlikely to benefit, and evidence of a discussion about CRC screening for those in
      the intermediate health group because the benefit is unclear.
