      the detection of colon polyps. Though colonoscopy is currently the best test for colon cancer
      screening, it remains imperfect. Research has found that about 25% of polyps may actually be
      missed during colonoscopy using standard full spectrum white light imaging. Advances in
      colonoscopic technology hold the potential to decrease the miss rate of colorectal neoplasms.
      A new colonoscope uses narrow band imaging, whereby the colon is illuminated using only a
      subset of the white light spectrum, 415nanometers (blue) and 540 nanometers (green) rather
      than the standard full spectrum white light (red, green and blue). Initial studies by other
      groups suggest that these narrow band images highlight small blood vessels of colon polyps.
      As such, we hypothesized that the use of NBI would improve the identification of neoplasms
      through the color differentiation of precancerous or cancerous polyp (appearing brown) from
      normal colon mucosal lining (appearing green), and potentially lead to a reduction in polyp
      miss rate. We aimed to study the polyp miss rate, and compare narrow band imaging to white
      light examination.
