      hour prior to first contrast administration through 48 hours. These blood samples will be
      processed to plasma at the clinical site, frozen and shipped to Biosite for storage and
      testing of Triage NGAL and serum creatinine. The results of these assessments will be blinded
      to the medical team during the study and will not impact the medical management of the
      subject.

      Any additional serum creatinine measurements obtained by the medical team as part of routine
      care as well as need for dialysis, hospitalization, major adverse cardiovascular events and
      mortality will be recorded through Day 30.
