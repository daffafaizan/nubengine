      (PD-L1) has shown activity in TNBC. Early clinical trials with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy have
      shown that the median duration to response in TNBC is remarkably long (18 weeks) compared to
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Since advanced TNBC is characterized by rapid disease progression,
      most patients with TNBC may not have the opportunity to derive benefit from immunotherapy. We
      hypothesize that by combining atezolizumab with paclitaxel or carboplatin-cyclophosphamide
      the desired rapid tumor control will be obtained with chemotherapy and subsequently
      atezolizumab can result in durable responses in a significant subset of patients. It is
      unknown whether addition of atezolizumab to first line chemotherapy in TNBC is more
      beneficial than adding this antibody to a second line treatment schedule. Because of this and
      because of the poor outcome of patients with advanced TNBC experiencing disease progression
      after first line palliative chemotherapy, patients who were randomized to a chemotherapy only
      arm in this study will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the other chemotherapy
      regimen plus atezolizumab at disease progression.
