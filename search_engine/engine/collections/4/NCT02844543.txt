      Athletes will be tested with the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device prior to the start of an
      athletic practice or competition (pre-test) and then after the conclusion of the
      practice/competition (post-test). The investigators hope to understand if eye-tracking scores
      are effected by exercise and non-concussive bodily contact commonly incurred during athletic
      play.
