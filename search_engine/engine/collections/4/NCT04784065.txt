      Baylor College of Medicine, Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC), and Michael E. DeBakey
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

      Participants of this study are consented for the study, randomized into one of two treatment
      groups for hand osteoarthritis, both expected to improve hand symptoms. At the beginning of
      the study, many questionnaires, a physical exam, photographs of the hands, some x-rays, on a
      limited few people, and MRI will be obtained. Then the participants will be provided
      treatments for hand osteoarthritis based on the group wo which they were randomly assigned.
      One aspect of one of the treatments is viewed as experimental but the risks related to the
      treatment are considered to be low, so the risk-benefit ratio for participation in this study
      are good. We see patients in follow up more frequently during the first month, and then at 3
      months and then 6 months of follow up. At the final visit, we will repeat the xrays and the
      MRIs.
