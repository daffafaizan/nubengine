      participants will have osteosarcoma metastatic to bone, other solid tumors with bone
      metastases, or an unresectable localized osteosarcoma. Because of anticipated prolonged
      myelosuppression, participants will have a peripheral blood stem cell harvest. They will then
      be treated with 2 doses of 153Sm-DOTMP given 7 days apart. Twenty-four days after the initial
      dose, stem cells will be reinfused if needed. The first three cohorts of participants will
      receive only radiopharmaceutical. If Dose Level 3 is not the maximally tolerated dose (MTD),
      subsequent dose levels will include external beam radiotherapy, administered beginning on Day
      15. The dose of external beam radiotherapy will be determined by dosimetry studies performed
      after each administration of study agent, and will be targeted to a tumoricidal dose of
      radiation. All participants will have disease re-evaluation 30 days following completion of
      all study treatments, and then at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months, unless they experience disease
      progression.
