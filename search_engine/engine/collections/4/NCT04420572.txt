      number generator method. Ozone therapy is planned for 30 patients in the first group, and
      steroid injection is planned for the second group in 30 patients, and the study period is
      planned to be 4.5 months. Patients between the ages of 18-75 will be admitted and no
      difference will be made in terms of gender. The child will not be sick. Patients will be
      evaluated by the doctor who made the injection. All patients will also be evaluated before
      the first injection (T0), after treatment (T1) and after the first month (T2) after
      treatment. VAS (visual analog scale), Nottingham Health Profile and Harris Hip Evaluation
      Form will be used to evaluate patients. Our study is a randomized controlled prospective
      study.

      Treatment to be applied to patients will be selected randomly. Steroid injections will be
      administered to patients in a single dose, while ozone injection will be applied in three
      doses (1, 4, 7, 10 days), with a total of 4 doses. In ozone injection applications, while 1st
      dose 25 gamma, 2nd dose 20 gamma, 3rd and 4th dose 15 gamma 10 cc ozone will be injected; 1ml
      betamethasone will be used for steroid injection. The evaluation of the patients will be done
      by a different physician than the physician who made the injections. The financial burden of
      the treatment applied will be borne by the researchers.

      This study is a randomized controlled prospective clinical trial. The sample size is 60
      patients.
