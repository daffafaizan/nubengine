    
      The indication for hydroxyurea initiation was 2-3 vaso-occlusive crisis and/or
      hospitalizations in the last year.

      The study will analyze demographics (age and gender), origin, genotype, clinical phenotype
      (vaso-occlusive or hemolytic), transfusion history (including exchange), and folic acid use,
      average laboratory values up to three years pre-hydroxyurea and for the period
      post-hydroxyurea therapy including total hemoglobin level, fetal hemoglobin level, hemoglobin
      S level, white blood count, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase level, total and direct
      bilirubin levels, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels, and serum creatinine level.

      The incidence of complications pre- and post-hydroxyurea therapy will be also analyzed
      including: stroke, silent cerebral infraction, acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crisis,
      hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, bone necrosis, and kidney injury. Safety
      data included adverse events as reported by the treating physician and the incidence of
      malignancy or death as well as pregnancy incidents and their outcomes will be also pointed
      out.
