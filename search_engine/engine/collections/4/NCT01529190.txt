      until 60 years undergoing nephrectomy will be randomized in two groups. Group 1 patients will
      receive a single dose of 300 mg pregabalin, 1 hour before the surgical incision; group 2
      patients will receive a placebo dose. Pain intensity will be assessed with the numeric rating
      scale. The consumption of tramadol in 24 hours after surgery and the time for the first
      complementation dose will be registered. Blood samples will be collected by 6 hours and 24
      hours after surgical incision, for IL-6 dosage, and maintained at -70 celsus degree. The IL-6
      dosages will be performed by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method. The number
      of patients was calculated by Instat Graph® program. To detect difference in pain intensity
      of 3 between the groups by NRS, with 95% of power (estimated SD= 2.0), when the alpha level
      is set at 0.05, the sample should be of 20. Statistical analyses will be performed with
      parametric and nonparametric tests, considering the variety studied. The statistical program
      that will be utilized is Instat Graph®.
