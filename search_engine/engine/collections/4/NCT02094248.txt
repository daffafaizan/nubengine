      Researches have shown that thrombocytopenia is associated with mortality among those
      patients. Currently, no standard therapy exist for critical patients with Thrombocytopenia.
      In 2012 SSC guideline, platelet transfusion is induced for thrombocytopenia in critical
      patients for reducing the risk of bleeding. However, indication for platelet transfusion is
      relatively strict. No early intervention could be done according to this guideline. Previous
      studies have shown that recombinant human thrombopoietin can reduce severe sepsis with low
      platelet 28-day mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia, effectively improve peripheral
      platelet number, reducing the probability of platelet transfusion.The primary objectives of
      this study are to assess the impact of rhTPO on mortality among severe sepsis patients with
      thrombocytopenia, as well as changes of platelet counts and platelet transfusion rates.
