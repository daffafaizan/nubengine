      breast cancer. The use of adjuvant hormone therapy such as tamoxifen has shown to improve
      local control to a relatively minor amount on its own and does enhance local control of
      adjuvant radiotherapy. There is, however, conflicting invitro and clinical data regarding the
      effects or different sequences on tamoxifen and radiotherapy in terms of both local control
      and enhancement of radiotherapy toxicities.

      Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole are establishing themselves as a class of drug
      superior to tamoxifen for the control of estrogen dependent breast cancers and overall are
      better tolerated with the exception of greater bone loss.

      As the key question is whether the sequencing of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole alters
      local control by acting as an enhancer of the radiation breast cancer cell kill, it is
      therefore the aim of this study to compare 3 months of anastrozole prior to radiotherapy
      versus 3 months of anastrozole after radiotherapy with a specific objective of reducing the
      baseline ratio of in-field radiotherapy failure from 6% to 3%.
