      with high-dose fluorouracil (5-FU) with vs without high-dose leucovorin (CF) vs high-dose
      5-FU/CF/cisplatin. II. Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III.
      Assess the symptomatic improvement in these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and disease stage (metastatic vs
      locally advanced). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 24 hours weekly for 6 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive leucovorin
      calcium (CF) IV over 2 hours followed by 5-FU IV over 24 hours weekly for 6 weeks. Arm III:
      Patients receive CF and 5-FU as in arm II and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29.
      Treatment repeats every 7 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65-135 patients (21-45 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
