      for screening via an online screener. Written consent will be completed in person when
      participants are present to the laboratory. Eligible participants will include anyone over
      the age of 18 years and those who exclusively use combustible cigarettes or those who dual
      use e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. For the exclusive cigarette group, we will allow
      some e-cigarette experimentation. Participants will complete three in-lab study visits (1
      screener visit and 2 study visits) separated by a standard minimum 48-hour washout period.
      They will be offered an Uber or other rideshare service as transportation to each study
      visit, however, they will not be required to use the service.

      Participants will complete an in-person screening visit in which they will be rescreened
      according to the eligibility criteria. Their exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) will be checked
      prior to their visits as well as breath alcohol and urine pregnancy (for females) test will
      be conducted. Participant will also complete baseline assessment measures and Balloon Analog
      Risk Task (BART)- computerized task measuring impulsivity. At visit 2, participants will
      complete a standard 10 puff bout with the three e-cigarette devices and their usual brand
      cigarette. During visit 3, participants will complete three concurrent choice tasks in a
      counter-balanced fashion.
