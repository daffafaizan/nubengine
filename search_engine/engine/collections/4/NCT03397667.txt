    
      The majority of people with Alzheimer's (AD) and Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) are cared for
      in primary care settings and receive significant amounts of care and assistance in activities
      of daily living from family members or friends.

      The ABC ANSWERS intervention will incorporate and integrate the common features of an
      evidence-based collaborative care model for brain care, while also attending to the
      implementation barriers of delivering care and skills to dyads of patients with AD and TBI
      and their family caregivers.

      The study team will conduct a 1-year randomized control trial (RCT) designed to improve the
      Quality of Life (QoL) of Veterans with AD and TBI, and their family caregivers, and decrease
      their family caregivers' burden. The dyads in the intervention group will receive primary
      care plus ABC ANSWERS. The control group will receive primary care.
