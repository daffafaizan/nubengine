      functional impact on activities of daily living (ADLs) and according to some studies in the
      United States and Europe, the percentage of asthmatics who have significant restrictions in
      their ADLs is quite significant. Asthma is characterized as a major public health problem,
      not only in Brazil but worldwide. Currently there are few studies reporting the effects of a
      domiciliary program of deep inspiration associated with positive expiratory pressure in the
      airways of asthmatics. This study aims to analyze the benefits of this program on lung
      function, quality of life and response to exercise.
