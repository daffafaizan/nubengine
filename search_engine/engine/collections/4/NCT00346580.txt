      sepsis, and this will be manifested as improved clinical outcome, as assessed by 28-day
      mortality, APACHE II and III, and SOFA scores. All patients enrolled in the study will
      receive the standard of care for sepsis at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Patients will receive 1250
      mg of Nelfinavir/placebo twice each day for seven days with regularly scheduled blood draws
      (Days 0, 4, and 7).
