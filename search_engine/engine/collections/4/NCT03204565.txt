      hygiene and can be found in more than 90% of patients. Buccal exposure of roots with
      aesthetic impairments and dentinal hypersensitivity The ultimate goal of root coverage
      procedures is the complete coverage of the recession defect with an aesthetic appearance
      comparable to adjacent healthy soft tissues in combination with physiological probing pocket
      depths.Several surgical techniques have already provided good results and have been shown to
      attain root coverage at individual recession sites these different methods.To date,
      connective tissue grafts (CTG) and enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) in conjunction with a
      coronally advanced flap (CAF) have been shown to provide the highest probability of obtaining
      complete root coverage (CRC) in Miller class I and II single gingival recession as compared
      to CAF alone.

      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major component of the extracellular matrix in almost all tissues.
      The primary role of HA is to bind water and to permit the transportation of key metabolites
      and therefore to maintain the structural and homeostatic integrity of these tissues.

      In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that hyaluronic acid have many properties that
      are essential for tissue regeneration and wound healing.

      However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been limited clinical application studies
      in the field of root coverage procedures performed and still no consistent published data
      with longer follow-ups on the usage of HA are available.

      Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was to evaluate the
      potential benefit of the adjunctive use of HA in combination with a coronally advanced flap
      (CAF) and to compare the outcomes with CAF alone, when treating single Miller Class I
      gingival recessions.
