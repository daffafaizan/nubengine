      â€¢ To test the AirGoTM system's respiratory rate recording accuracy at rest and during
      physical exercise, as compared to standard tests.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To test the accuracy of the AirGoTM system's derived respiratory parameters (tidal
           volume, minute ventilation, Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, FEV1 and VO2max) at rest and during
           physical exercise, as compared to standard tests.

        -  To test comfort and subjects' compliance with the AirGoTM system during long term
           recording (24 hours).
