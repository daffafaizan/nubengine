      in patients with bladder cancer.

      The bladder of all patients will be instilled with 50 mL HexvixÂ® 8 mM solution and evacuated
      after 30 minutes. After bladder evacuation, the bladder will be examined under white light
      cystoscopy using the Karl Storz flexible videocystoscope. Tumors visible under white light
      will be mapped. Then the bladder is evaluated with blue light and lesions seen by blue light
      will be mapped. Biopsies of all visible tumors will be taken using both white and blue light
      prior to resection of all lesions.
