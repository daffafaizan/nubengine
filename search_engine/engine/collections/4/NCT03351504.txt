      have focused on kerosene lighting as a source of indoor air pollution. In our preliminary
      studies performed in Uganda, we show that homes using solar lighting have much lower levels
      of indoor air pollution compared to homes using kerosene lighting. The primary goal of this
      study is to determine the extent to which solar lighting will reduce kerosene use and indoor
      air pollution in rural Uganda, whether this intervention improves lung health, and to
      identify the role bacteria in our gut have on determining whether or not people will get sick
      from indoor air pollution.
