      the respiratory microbiome. Their interrelationship will be characterized in a prospective
      observational study design. The observed changes will be correlated to medical (FEV1, CXR/CT,
      mortality, morbidity, symptoms) and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, coagulation,
      bacterial/viral detection). The study aims at the detection of significant changes in
      microbiome in the respiratory tract following incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These
      alterations in the respiratory microbiome will be determined by shotgun metagenomic
      sequencing. Ultimately, this can provide a better understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 and the
      presence of other bacteria and viruses affect the composition of the respiratory microbiome
      and a description of the microbiological etiology of these respiratory tract infections.
