        -  Identify new potential biomarkers of increased gastrointestinal cancer risk using tissue
           and biofluid samples from patients and healthy volunteers undergoing colonoscopy,
           endoscopy, or surgery.

        -  Develop new screening strategies based on substances found in tissue and biofluid
           samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy volunteers undergo colonoscopy, endoscopy, or surgery. Patients and
      healthy volunteers also undergo tissue (e.g., tumor or normal mucosa) and biofluid (e.g.,
      blood, urine, cyst fluids or tumor cells, bile and pancreatic juices, and/or stool) sample
      collection. Samples are analyzed for tumor markers by proteomic methods and protein analysis.
      If candidate biomarkers are identified, samples are stored for future studies involving these
      biomarkers. Information, including demographics, personal and family history of cancer, and
      prior and current colonoscopy, endoscopy, or surgery results, is collected from the medical
      record and stored in the project database.

      Patients and healthy volunteers are followed once a year for up to 5 years to determine if
      biomarkers have a prognostic significance.
