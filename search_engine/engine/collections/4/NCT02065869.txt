    
      This is a Phase II extension study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501 T cells
      infused after partially mismatched, related, TCR alpha beta T cell depleted hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) in pediatric patients. The purpose of this clinical trial is to
      determine whether BPX-501 infusion can enhance immune reconstitution in those patients with
      hematologic disorders, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration severe acute
      graft versus host disease (GvHD).

      The trial will also evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of dimerizer drug
      (AP1903/rimiducid) in those subjects who present with GVHD who progress or do not respond to
      standard of care treatment.
