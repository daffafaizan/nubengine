    
      Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1): Patients will have complete history and physical (H&P), complete blood
      count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP) and electrocardiogram (EKG) on day 1. Each cycle
      is 28 days. The C1D1 EKG can be omitted if the patient has no new cardiac symptoms and has
      not starting taking any medication known to affect QT corrected for heart rate (QTc)
      prolongation. Any residual toxicity from prior therapy for cancer will be recorded. Blood
      will be drawn for assessment of serum markers. The patient will begin dasatinib at the
      starting C1D1 on a daily basis.

      Cycle 1 Day 10-20 (C1D10-20): Patients will have a second biopsy to obtain additional tumor
      material to examine biological effects of dasatinib on signaling pathways. Dasatinib will be
      taken first thing in the morning and the patient will log the time. Blood will also be drawn
      for pharmacokinetic assessments of dasatinib levels in plasma and the time recorded. Four FNA
      aspirates and 2 core biopsies can be obtained either at the bedside for palpable lesions or
      through appropriate image-guided techniques (CT or US) at the discretion of the treating
      physician in consultation with radiology. The time of the biopsy will be recorded. One core
      biopsy should be immediately fixed in formalin and the other core biopsy should be snap
      frozen in liquid nitrogen.

      Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1): Patients will be seen by the treating physician and have complete H&P,
      CBC, and CMP. Blood will be drawn for assessment of serum markers. Toxicity of dasatinib will
      be assessed. The patient will continue to take daily doses of dasatinib on a daily basis.

      Cycle 2 Day 22 (C2D22): Patients will undergo reevaluation for tumor measurements. This
      assessment can occur on C2D22 Â±7 days.
