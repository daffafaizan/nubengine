      it is commonly associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, type 2
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and endothelium
      dysfunction.

      Abnormal endothelial function, expressed as lower vasodilatation through flow-mediated
      vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery in response to an increase in blood flow, is
      considered an index of subclinical atherosclerosis, and an early hallmark of cardiovascular
      disease, with a strong prognostic value for future cardiovascular events. Changes in diet,
      level of physical activity and behavior are well known key elements influence endothelial
      function. Recent studies seem to show that Mediterranean diet has beneficial role on
      cardiovascular risk. It could protect against the development of coronary heart disease also
      through a possible effect on body weight and obesity.

      At the best of our knowledge, the effect of Mediterranean diet on endothelial function in
      obese subjects has not been definitely established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      evaluate the impact of Mediterranean diet on anthropometric parameters (body weight, BMI and
      waist circumference), lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)], triglycerides (TG),
      fasting glucose and endothelium function, evaluated by FMD, in a group of obese and
      overweight subjects. In particular, subjects were invited to follow a standard Mediterranean
      diet for a short (3 months) or a longer (18 months) period. The specific role of some
      components of Mediterranean diet (olive oil or non fried fish or nuts) was also investigated.
