    
      One hundred sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four arms (placebo/placebo,
      placebo/Botox, Botox/placebo, Botox/Botox). In the first of two phases, randomized subjects
      will blindly receive either Botox速 (study arms Botox/placebo and Botox/Botox) or placebo
      (study arms placebo/placebo and placebo/Botox) injection into the lumbar paraspinal muscles.
      The subjects will be assessed using validated scales for pain and disability prior to
      injection and monthly thereafter for four months. In the second phase, a second set of lumbar
      injections will be administered based on the initial randomization and will blindly receive
      either Botox速 (study arms placebo/Botox and Botox/Botox) or placebo (study arms
      placebo/placebo and Botox/placebo) injection into the lumbar paraspinal muscles. The subjects
      will again be assessed using the same validated scales for pain and disability, prior to
      injection and monthly thereafter, but for six months to extend the monitoring period to
      better define the limits of duration of effect.

      This will result in half of the subjects being crossed-over from Botox速 to placebo (study arm
      Botox/placebo) or vice versa (study arm placebo/Botox) and one quarter of subjects receiving
      two courses of either Botox速 alone (Botox/Botox) or placebo alone (placebo/placebo). All
      subjects will continue to receive medication and/or physiotherapy per standard of care but
      those treatments will be recorded and controlled for in the data analysis.
