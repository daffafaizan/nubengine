      regions involved in both appetite and reward such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
      orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, hypothalamus, insula, amygdala and hippocampus. 16
      healthy participants (8 males) were scanned on two separate test days, before and after
      eating a meal to satiation, or after not eating for 4 hours (satiated vs. pre-meal). fMRI
      BOLD signals to the sight and/or taste of the stimuli were recorded. Participants were given
      questionnaires to complete about their mood state and appetite before and after all scans.
