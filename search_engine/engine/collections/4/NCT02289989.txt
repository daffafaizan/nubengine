      conducted to determine the effects of an oregano extract in aqueous solution versus 1%
      hydrocortisone in the treatment of acute-subacute pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD). We
      suspect that topical oregano will serve as an effective, non-steroidal AD therapy,
      simultaneously offering extra benefits to pediatric patients as oregano is a natural product
      with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties that lacks reports of
      adverse effects associated with steroids, which children have been noted to be more
      susceptible to.
