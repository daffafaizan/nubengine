    
      Hypothesis The results of HepQuant in patients with CHD will correlate with outcomes of
      cardiac surgery (namely morbidity as defined by complications such as ischemic hepatitis,
      survival, need for heart transplantation, improvement of liver function post revision), and
      thus can be used for prognosis in this condition, either alone or in conjunction with other
      clinical, physiological, and laboratory prognostic scores, thereby giving clinical guidance
      concerning the need for heart transplantation and simultaneous liver transplantation..

      Primary Aim To assess the relationship between HepQuant testing results and clinical outcomes
      in patients with liver disease secondary to congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing Fontan
      revisions.

      To assess the clinical outcomes of patients with liver disease secondary to acquired
      cardiomyopathy or valvular disease that will undergo extensive heart surgery or heart
      transplantation.

      Secondary Aim To assess whether HepQuant testing predicts clinical outcome in patients with
      Liver Disease and CHD when used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as MELD,
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), liver stiffness measurement (US with ARFI), and Fibrotest
      (Fibrosure).

      Study population Male and female Subjects (age 18 to 70 years) with liver disease secondary
      to congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy.
