    
      Patients of 3 months to 18 years of age at the time of enrolment who have unexplained
      transaminase elevation (serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels > 1.5 times the upper
      limit of normal) for more than 3 months and/or unexplained hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly
      and/or obesity- unrelated hepatosteatosis and/or biopsy-proven cryptogenic fibrosis and
      cirrhosis and/or liver transplantation for cryptogenic cirrhosis will be included.

      Potential participants will be invited for LAL enzyme analysis. Written informed consent will
      be obtained from the parents or guardians of the participants at the time of enrolment.
      Prospective and retrospective data will be collected. Complete family and medical history,
      physical examination and previously existing laboratory findings will be recorded on standard
      case reports form and up to 0.25 ml of blood will be drawn for LAL enzyme analysis. The blood
      obtained from participants will be spotted on filter paper, and dried blood spot sample (DBS)
      will be prepared. Finally, the dried blood spot sample will be sent to reference laboratory
      (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, England) for LAL enzyme measurement within 1 week.
