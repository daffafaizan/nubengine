      To evaluate the effectiveness on the quality of life and various predictive factors of
      mortality (BODE index, six-minute walk distance, FEV1, dyspnea, and body mass index) and the
      economic impact of a Standardized Respiratory Physiotherapy program conducted in Primary Care
      (FREAP) in patients with moderate COPD at 6 months after its implementation.

      METHOD

      Design: Randomized controlled trial

      Location: Tarragona-Reus Primary Care Area of the Catalan Health Service. 14 primary care
      centres were involved in the project (8 from the Reus-Altebrat Primary Care Service and 6
      from the Tarragona-Valls Primary Care Service) and 8 units of physiotherapy.

      Participants: 129 patients with moderate COPD treated by primary care teams.

      Intervention: FREAP program for 6 months. It consisted of an initial health education session
      conducted in the primary care health centre, three sessions a week for three weeks of
      breathing exercises and aerobic, physical training in the primary care health centre and a
      monthly monitoring appointment for the breathing exercises and training for five months in
      the patient's home. Altogether, 10 sessions in the primary care health center and 5 sessions
      at the patients' house. Patients randomized in the control group continued with their usual
      clinical practice.

      Main effect measures: Quality of life (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire -SGRQ-).
      Predictive factors of mortality (BODE index, six-minute walk distance, FEV1, dyspnea, and
      body mass index). Economic cost of implementing the FREAP program.
