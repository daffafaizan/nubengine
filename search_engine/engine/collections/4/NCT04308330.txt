      chemotherapeutic backbone without developing a DLT. The baseline disease evaluation will be
      obtained following hematologic recovery from the first cycle of chemotherapy, after which
      combination therapy with vorinostat will be given in subsequent cycles (2-12) w/
      modifications if needed. Vorinostat dose escalation in subsequent patient cohorts will occur
      based on DLT to determine a MTD.
