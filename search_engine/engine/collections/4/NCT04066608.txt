      (communicable) disease were the main contributors to morbidity and mortality, today
      non-communicable diseases (NCD) exhibit a dramatic increase and have reached epidemic
      proportions, even in developing countries. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are
      the most frequent NCDs and the underlying risk factors including Insulin resistance,
      dyslipidemia and obesity have been increasing over the last decades. The current study
      explores the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in an HIV-infected outpatient study population.
