        -  change of red blood cell indices in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease
           receiving hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis when administering GX-E2
           intravenously/subcutaneously

        -  change of reticulocyte indices in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease receiving
           hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis when administering GX-E2 intravenously/subcutaneously

        -  safety of GX-E2 when administering intravenously/subcutaneously

        -  incidence of blood transfusion in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease receiving
           hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis when administering GX-E2 intravenously/subcutaneously

        -  Immunogenicity in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease receiving
           hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis when administering GX-E2 intravenously/subcutaneously
