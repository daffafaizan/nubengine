      the coagulation system in small babies involves drawing significant amounts of blood
      (especially in premature babies). Non-invasive testing can help assess and treat term and
      preterm neonates at risk. Recently, a non-invasive device to assess the blood coagulation
      status was developed - The Thrombo-Monitor (ThM). The objective of this study is to assess
      the reliability of this new non-invasive device among term and preterm babies by comparing
      the result of the ThM reading to coagulation analysis from blood.
