      chronic exposure to repeated low-level blast overpressure. Previous studies show converging
      evidence for a neurophysiological effect from cumulative exposure to blast, which is
      consistent with subjective reports of cognitive impairment by individuals trained to use
      explosives to gain entry to structures (breachers). This study will expand on these findings
      by examining a larger cohort of experienced breachers and artillery personnel who may be
      incurring a cumulative effect of low-level blast exposure over the course of several years.
      We will evaluate up to 20 participants from each of three groups: breachers, artillery
      personnel, and unexposed individuals. Additionally, we will ask each of the above to bring a
      close companion for a set of questionnaires and an interview to capture changes in
      functioning that participants may not be able to self-assess. Participants will travel to the
      NIH for evaluation of cognitive and neurophysiological measures. The procedures include
      neuropsychological testing, blood analysis for biomarkers, vestibular and auditory testing,
      and neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging,
      perfusion imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and, where there is evidence of a
      sleep disorder, polysomnography. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Naval
      Medical Research Center (NMRC) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) under a
      Research Collaborative Agreement. The complementary DoD protocol will be reviewed by the DoD
      IRB and includes this NIH protocol. The complementary DoD protocol includes data collection
      at field settings, activity NIH is not engaged in and not described in this protocol.
