    
      Primary Objective:

      To compare the time profile of appearance and disappearance in CSF of pulse deuterium-labeled
      chromogranin B, sAPPα and β-Trace in AD and PSP subjects compared to healthy controls.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To measure body water enrichment of deuterium in saliva and plasma (2H-enrichment (%))

        -  To explore the effect of age on the kinetics of deuterium labeling of CSF biomarkers

        -  To assess intra and inter subject variability of deuterium-labeling of chromogranin B,
           sAPPα and β-Trace

      Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility prior to heavy water
      (2H20) administration. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1.
      On Day 1, subjects will ingest small doses of 2H20 during their inpatient stay. They will
      also drink 2H20 for 7 more days. Subjects will undergo two lumbar punctures (LPs) for CSF
      samples. Subjects will return to the study site approximately 7 days after the last LP (or
      early termination) for a follow-up assessment and discharge.
