    
      This research study is assessing the feasibility and safety of implanting and retrieving a
      'microdevice' that releases up to 20 drugs directly within the prostate cancer lesion as a
      possible tool to evaluate the effectiveness of several approved cancer drugs against prostate
      cancer.

      Participants will be identified with confirmed prostate cancer whose treatment plan includes
      surgery as a component of standard-of-care treatment.

      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:

        -  Implantation of a MR-guided microdevice .

        -  It is expected that about 35 people will take part in this research study; 5 in the Ex
           Vivo Cohort and 30 in Surgery Cohort.

             -  Ex Vivo Cohort will undergo placement of microdevice in the prostate after its
                surgical removal.

             -  Surgery Cohort will undergo percutaneous placement of several microdevices in a
                selected tumor prior to surgery.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining
      this study intervention. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the
      implantation of the microdevice for this specific disease, but usage of this has been
      approved for other uses.
