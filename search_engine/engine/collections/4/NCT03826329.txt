      of ASD that required another surgery. A multivariate competing risk survival model,
      Kaplan-Meier survivorship, and average time to events were calculated.

      2.1. Data source and ethical concerns The study used the National Health Insurance Research
      Database (NHIRD), a national database containing 26 million administered insurants
      accumulated from January 1997 to December 2013, provided by the National Health Research
      Institutes of Taiwan. Due to the unique social-welfare health insurance system operated by
      the government, it is mandatory for every resident in Taiwan to be enrolled. Thus, the NHIRD
      has covered 99% of the population since its launch in 1996. The monopolistic national health
      insurance also offers unrestricted access to any healthcare provider of the patients'
      choices. The statistics, therefore, gathered by the NHIRD represent a sound cohort for
      investigation of the natural course and subsequent management of diseases. It is particularly
      good for studies that need longitudinal observation for repeat treatment (i.e. surgery for
      ASD) because it allows for the capture of events, even though they may occur in multiple or
      different institutes and hospitals. The universal coverage and comprehensive follow-up
      provided a valuable chance to study ASD.

      All the personal information had already undergone a de-identification and encryption
      process. Individual and hospital identifiers are unique to the research database and
      researchers therefore cannot trace individual patients or health service providers.
