      negative and who have previously progressed after receiving standard therapy will receive a
      nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide
      and fludarabine and then will be treated by the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes reactive
      with shared antigens on their tumors. This study will evaluate the toxicity, immunologic
      effects and potential therapeutic role of this treatment.
