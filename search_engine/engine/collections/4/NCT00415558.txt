      with symptomatic (PAF) for at least 6 months prior to study entry. Patients will be qualified
      for the study if they meet stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, signing an informed
      consent and agreeing to return for followup visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. All study
      patients will receive microwave ablation to treat their symptomatic PAF. The Microwave
      Ablation System will be used during a MIS procedure on a beating heart in order to ablate a
      specified lesion pattern.
