      with acute myeloid leukaemia. Patients with nucleoside transporter deficiency (hENT1) seem to
      have less benefit from cytarabine compared to those with a high expression of the
      transporter. Preclinical studies indicate that elacytarabine is independent of this
      transporter. Therefore, patients with low expression of hENT1 and treated with elacytarabine
      are anticipated to have a better outcome compared to patients treated with ara-C. The main
      objective of this study is to assess the biological activity of elacytarabine in combination
      with idarubicin in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. In addition, the correlation
      between hENT1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) and overall survival will be
      studied. Patients will be treated with elacytarabine plus idarubicin independent of their
      hENT1 status. Determination of the patients' hENT1 expression level will be done
      retrospectively. This study will also explore the safety profile of elacytarabine in
      combination with idarubicin.
