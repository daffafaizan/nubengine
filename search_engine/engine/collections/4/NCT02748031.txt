      important to find a method of recording, classifying and monitoring cataract morphologies
      that is feasible and safe in a large cohort of children with congenital cataracts, including
      uncooperative children. Photography is considered as one of the most important means to
      promote evidence-based medical practice in pediatric ophthalmology.

      In this study, the investigators studied congenital cataract morphological classifications
      and monitoring using slit-lamp-adapted anterior segmental photography and evaluated its
      safety and feasibility in pediatric cataract patients registered in the Childhood Cataract
      Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health.
