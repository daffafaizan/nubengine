      polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) begin in childhood. While ADPKD causes the continued growth
      of multiple kidney cysts that ultimately result in loss of kidney function, the leading cause
      of death among patients with ADPKD is cardiovascular disease. Treatment options to prevent
      cardiovascular disease in adults with ADPKD are limited, thus childhood may be an important
      time to reduce risk. Curcumin is a safe, naturally occurring substance found in the Indian
      spice tumeric, which is in curry powder. The proposed research will determine the
      effectiveness of curcumin for improving the health and function of arteries in children and
      young adults with ADPKD. The study also will provide insight into how curcumin improves
      artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved and
      offer exploratory evidence if curcumin can slow kidney growth. This will be done by comparing
      these measurements in children and young adults who are randomized to receive either curcumin
      or placebo for 1 year.
