      therapy with sodium nitrite and isoquercetin on endothelial function and inflammation among
      patients with chronic kidney disease. Investigators will recruit 70 albuminuric CKD patients
      and randomly assign participants to combination therapy with sodium nitrite and isoquercetin
      or placebo for three months.
