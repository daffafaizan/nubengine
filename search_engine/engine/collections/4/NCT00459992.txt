      Therefore, research focusing on compounds that affect energy balance through novel mechanisms
      is warranted. Preliminary human and animal data suggest central nervous system histaminergic
      tone is important in the regulation of food intake. We therefore propose to study the effects
      of betahistine hydrochloride, a histamine analogue which has agonist activity at the
      histaminergic H1 receptor and antagonist/reverse agonist activity at the H3 receptor. Prior
      animal studies have suggested that betahistine suppresses food intake and reduces body
      weight, but there are sparse human data assessing the effects of betahistine on metabolism.

      Betahistine s effects on women s food intake and metabolism will be evaluated through an
      inpatient randomized double-blind placebo controlled dose-ranging study. We will examine the
      acute effects of betahistine on food intake, hunger, and satiety, resting energy expenditure,
      and on hormones and substrates relevant for body weight regulation. If results suggest
      betahistine has salutary effects on food intake or metabolism in humans, these studies will
      lay the groundwork for additional investigations to assess the efficacy of betahistine in the
      treatment of obesity.
