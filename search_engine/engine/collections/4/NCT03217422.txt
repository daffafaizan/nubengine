      hepatitis. The study population consists of female and male adult autoimmune hepatitis
      patients with incomplete response or intolerant to standard treatment of care. The diagnosis
      of autoimmune hepatitis has to fulfill the IAIHG criteria and must be confirmed by liver
      histology.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to different doses of VAY736 or placebo. The primary
      analysis is planned at 24 weeks. A subsequent study part will then test the efficacy and
      safety of VAY736 in a parallel group design. For this part of the trial a new group of
      autoimmune hepatitis patients will be enrolled.
