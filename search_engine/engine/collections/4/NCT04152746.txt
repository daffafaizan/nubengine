      prospectively. Patients that were scheduled to undergo adenoidectomy were included in the
      study group (adenoid group). The control group comprised of 20 healthy children who had
      previously been treated for anemia in the out-patient clinic of the Pediatrics Department and
      were clinically healthy with normal complete blood cell counts at their follow-up visits.

      Serum samples were obtained from the two groups. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5
      minute and stored in -80 oC for later analysis of periostin levels. Adenoid tissue and normal
      mucosal tissue samples were obtained from the adenoidectomy patients and stored in -80 oC for
      later homogenization and measurement of periostin levels.
