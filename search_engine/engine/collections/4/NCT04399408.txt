    
      Study includes women carrying a singleton fetus at 14 to 40 gestational weeks. Women with
      multiple gestations, non-viable fetus at recruitment and those with a major fetal anatomical
      malformation or genetic syndrome are excluded. Each participant receives the device for a
      self-use period of 7-14 days, instructed to preform 1-3 scans a day. Each participant
      completes a self-assessment questionnaire which aims to evaluate satisfactory and usability
      (user experience and satisfaction). Each scan will be evaluated for the possibility to
      properly view fetal heart activity, amniotic fluid volume, fetal tone, fetal body and
      breathing movements.
