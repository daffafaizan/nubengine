      Previous studies have reported good safety and tissue adequacy with both the needles, but the
      head-on comparison between these two needles is lacking.

      This is a prospective randomized trial comparing the biopsy specimen adequacy of 19Gauge
      versus 22Gauge core needles for EUS-LB.
