      The first "pre-implementation" phase will include assessment of healthcare utilization costs
      of tracheostomy patients currently and nursing perspective on current caregiver tracheostomy
      knowledge.

      The second "protocol" phase will include assessment of the necessity, acceptability,
      feasibility, fidelity, safety and effectiveness of a standardized pathway and assessment of
      the caregiver's activation.

      The third "post-implementation" phase will involve assessment of post-implementation
      tracheostomy-related healthcare utilization costs and nursing perspective on caregiver
      tracheostomy knowledge.
