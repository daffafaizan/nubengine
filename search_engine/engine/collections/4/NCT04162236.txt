      dysfuntion and remodelin in women at risk and in established PE. M&M: placental dysfunction
      markers (angiogenic factors (PlGF) and anti-angiogenic factor (sFlt1) and cardiovascular risk
      variables (BMI, BP, arterial stiffness, copectin, proBNP, high-sensitivity troponin, carotid
      intima thickness and echocardiography parameters) would be evaluated in 280 patients at risk
      of PE according to first trimester screening and 100 controls. Additionally, cardiac
      dysfunction parameters would be evaluated in women with established PE (n=60) and common
      transcriptomic signatures between cardiovascular disease and preeclampsia would be
      investigated in placental samples from 10 PE and 10 controls. It will provide evidences to
      evaluate and characterize the association between angiogenic factors and cardiac dysfunction
      and remodeling in PE.
