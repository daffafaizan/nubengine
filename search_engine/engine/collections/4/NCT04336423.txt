      of microbiomes among healthy smokers and COPD patients form the respiratory samples or lung
      tissues. In the previous study, distinct difference in composition of microbiome in lung
      tissue between healthy smokers and COPD patients was reported. This study is to build a
      microbiome cohort by collecting sputum and fecal samples every few months for three years
      from healthy smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who are being
      followed up by Asan Medical Center. The aim of this study is to analyze the composition of
      microbiome of various samples (e.g. sputum, feces) and describe the difference between
      healthy smokers and COPD patients. This study would help establishing gut-lung axis model in
      humans.
