    
      This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will compare the safety, immunogenicity
      and clinical efficacy of Sci-B-Vac™ with topical ointment pretreatment among 5 groups. Group
      1: Intradermal Sci-B-Vac™ with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment; Group 2: Intradermal
      Sci-B-Vac™ with topical aqueous cream (placebo) pretreatment; Group 3: Intramuscular
      Sci-B-Vac™ with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment.

      Vaccination Regimen and Data Collection Enrolled patients will be randomized into 3 groups
      after written informed consent. Each patient will receive a 3 doses Sci-B-Vac™ regime at 0, 1
      and 6 months. Group 1 will receive a total of 10μg intradermal HBsAg each time with topical
      imiquimod ointment pretreatment; Group 2 will receive a total of 10μg intradermal HBsAg each
      time with topical aqueous cream pretreatment. Group 3 will receive a total of 10μg
      intramuscular HBsAg each time with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment.

      The primary outcome measurement will be the seroprotection rate of the HBVv at 12 months
      after the first dose of vaccination and the secondary outcome measurements will include the
      seroconversion rate, the GMT fold increase and the safety of the intradermal Sci-B-Vac™ with
      topical imiquimod treatment at other time points.
