      cross-sectional, epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of breakthrough cancer
      pain and characterize breakthrough cancer pain in an non-selected, representative cohort of
      cancer outpatients with or without pain.

      The study enrolled 3765 patients. This multicenter trial will be conducted in Spain. Data
      from participants will be collected through questionnaire and medical history in a single
      visit (up to 1 month).
