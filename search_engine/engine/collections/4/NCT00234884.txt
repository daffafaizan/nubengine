    
      This was a multicenter, uncontrolled, 5-year observational study of adalimumab in the
      treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had received adalimumab for at least
      3 months in NCT00448383 (Study M02-497), an interventional study that ended when adalimumab
      became commercially available for the treatment of RA. Participants had to have been
      receiving ongoing adalimumab treatment at the time NCT00448383 (Study M02-497) ended and been
      prescribed commercial adalimumab, and could have received commercial adalimumab for up to 1
      year afterward prior to enrollment in NCT00234884 (Study M03-634).

      Physician investigators were encouraged to treat participants as they would any other patient
      with RA in their routine clinical practice, and were free to determine the appropriate
      therapy for each patient. Concomitant treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs), including methotrexate, could be continued while receiving adalimumab. If treatment
      with adalimumab was permanently discontinued for any reason, participants were discontinued
      from the study and the reason was recorded. Investigators were asked to record adverse events
      up to 3 months after last administration of adalimumab.
