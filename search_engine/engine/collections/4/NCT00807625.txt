      assigned to one of two treatment groups: IUD or Depo Provera. The study builds on findings
      from a previous study which examined the safety and acceptability of hormonal contraception
      and IUD among HIV-infected women. Secondary analyses from the previous study indicated that
      women who were assigned to the hormonal arm appeared to have faster disease progression based
      on death and decline in CD4+ count as compared to women assigned to the IUD arm. With the
      current study, investigators seek to understand potential mechanisms for the effect of
      hormonal contraception on hastening HIV disease progression. Enrolled women will be asked to
      use the assigned contraception method for a period of six months, and various indicators of
      disease progression will be collected at four follow-up visits after randomization.
