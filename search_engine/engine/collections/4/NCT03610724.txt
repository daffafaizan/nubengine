      design includes r/r B-cell NHL subject population with poor prognosis, lack of approved
      effective therapies in this setting. Subject population will include aggressive subtypes of
      B-cell NHL and will be allowed to receive "bridging therapy" of investigator's choice After
      assessment of eligibility, subjects qualifying for the study will be enrolled and are allowed
      to start lymphodepleting chemotherapy as recommended in protocol after which a single dose of
      tisagenlecleucel product will be infused. The efficacy of tisagenlecleucel will be evaluated
