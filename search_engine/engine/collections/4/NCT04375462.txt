      groups). The study group will undergo AspireAssist gastrostomy tube placement and the control
      group will undergo standard decompressive percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.
      Individuals who present for venting gastrostomy placement in clinic or as consults will be
      approached for inclusion. Gastrostomy tubes will be placed 1-2 days after enrollment to allow
      for thoroughly consideration of inclusion by potential participants. Gastrostomy tube
      placement will be completed endoscopically in the standard "pull" method in both the
      AspireAssist and PEG groups. Questionnaires will be completed at 7 and 30 days.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate to compare healthcare utilization,
      including major and minor tube related complications between the two groups. Secondary
      objectives of this study are to compare changes in the ability to eat and drink after
      placement of the gastrostomy tube and to evaluate changes in quality of life before and after
      gastrostomy tube placement.
