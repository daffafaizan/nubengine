      dietary quality. The two interventions to be evaluated in SuperWIN will utilize either an
      in-store POP education strategy or a combined online/in-store POP education strategy in
      participants with at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor. The POP education
      interventions will be enhanced with sophisticated, provider- and participant-facing,
      food-purchasing metrics, a novel counseling tool that here-to-fore has not been studied in
      regard to changing food shopping behavior. The primary outcome measure is the Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, a measure of adherence to the DASH dietary
      pattern. The study is well-powered to test at Day 90: 1) whether any POP education
      intervention strategy (both intervention arms pooled) improves the DASH score compared to the
      control arm and 2) whether an improvement in DASH score depends on the POP education strategy
      utilized.

      Both POP education strategies will be delivered within a supermarket-based retail clinic and
      will utilize the aisles and products of the supermarket. The interventions will be delivered
      by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). The online portion of the combined
      online/in-store education POP strategy will include online grocery shopping, online recipe
      resources, a grocery pickup or home delivery service, and a phone application to better
      select healthy foods.

      Both strategies will be offered in addition to a "standard of care" medical nutrition therapy
      session. The DASH dietary pattern has been empirically tested and shown to favorably modify
      blood pressure, blood cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, and weight status.
