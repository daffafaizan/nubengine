    
      Design: Prospective, monocentric, comparative, randomized, semi-blind.

      There will be 30 subjects in each arm, who will be followed 15 months after surgery.

      Half of the patients will receive standard laparoscopic excision of the endometriotic lesions
      only. The other half, after the excision of the endometriosis foci, will receive 10 cc of an
      antiadhesion agent which contents hyaluronic acid gel (HyalobarrierÂ®).The subjects will be
      hospitalized after surgery for at least 2 days.

      A Vas-Scala will be given to the subjects to estimate the pain before, after surgery and one
      year after treatment. The participants will record the values each three months after
      surgery.

      All subjects will be asked by telephone for the VAS-scala values and for pregnancy (Date of
      Initiation, clinical evolution)

      The participation ist voluntary and an Informed consent must be signed before surgery.
      Subjects are free to withdraw their consent anytime.
