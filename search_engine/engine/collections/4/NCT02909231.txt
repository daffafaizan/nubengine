      services at the Foothills Medical Centre (FMC) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). The
      investigators will survey participants with pen-and-paper surveys at three, six and twelve
      months following discharge from hospital. The survey instrument being used is the Trauma
      Outcomes Profile, which has been previously validated in this population, supplemented by a
      supplemental survey to help further describe resources this population has access to in their
      recovery. The results of these surveys will be compared with pre-injury health status, injury
      types, mechanisms, and discharge medications and treatments. The investigators anticipate
      enrolling 500 participants starting in October 2016. At the conclusion of the study the
      investigators will have a better understanding of patient reported functional outcomes after
      trauma and will be better positioned to design trauma rehabilitation systems to service this
      population.
