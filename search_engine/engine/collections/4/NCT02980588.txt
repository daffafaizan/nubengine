      trial.

      Study population: Adult general ICU patients with sepsis and assumed to require at least 3
      days of intensive care were recruited. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criterion of
      glucose≥9.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned using serially numbered to either the intervention
      group (BG control by SGC) or the control group (conventional empiric BG management). The both
      group aim to establish the BG levels 5.8-8.9mmol/L.

      Study protocol: BG measurements were performed using glucometer to test the fingertip
      capillary blood sample for the BG levels. As for patients with shock or required vasopressor,
      arterial BG was sampled to measure through the glucometer. Insulin was infused intravenously
      applying the standard perfusor of the ICU. Average glucose, glucose variability, SOFA score,
      APACHE II score, and HLA-DR were recorded. All trial-related activities were carried out
      until the end of the patient's ICU stay, or for a period of 72 hours. Meanwhile, enteral and
      parenteral nutrition was administrated to patients according to their condition.

      Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The percentage of values
      in the target range (5.8-8.9mmol/L) was defined as primary end point for the assessment of
      glucose control. Data are reported as mean±SD values if not otherwise indicated. Data
      analysis was performed using SPSS19.0.
