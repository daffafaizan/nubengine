    
      The overarching goal of this study is to pilot test a peer-delivered decision support
      intervention (in the form of decision coaching) that is designed to enhance emerging adults'
      treatment decision-making and service engagement after enrollment in a coordinated specialty
      care (CSC) program. Based on an experimental therapeutics approach, this mixed methods pilot
      trial will assess feasibility, acceptability, and the intervention's potential impact on key
      decision-making needs (i.e., decision-making targets). We will track feasibility data related
      to study and intervention procedures, and collect acceptability and outcome data from 20
      emerging adults who will participate in the intervention after enrollment in the CSC program.
      Quantitative analysis related to decision-making targets will provide preliminary evidence
      regarding whether the intervention impacts these targets, while qualitative analysis will
      explain how it may do so. Merged results from these two sets of data will inform intervention
      refinement by providing a nuanced understanding of the intervention's potential to engage
      decision-making targets from the perspective of emerging adults.
