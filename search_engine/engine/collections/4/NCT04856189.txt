      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with
      standard-dose pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who are
      cisplatin-ineligible or platinum-refractory. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the objective
      response rate (ORR) of selinexor in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced
      urothelial carcinoma who are cisplatin-ineligible or platinum-refractory. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination of selinexor with
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

      II. To further evaluate the efficacy of the combination of selinexor with pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma as defined by progression-free survival (PFS).
