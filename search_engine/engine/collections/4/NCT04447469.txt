      mavrilimumab relative to placebo (standard of care) in participants who have tested positive
      for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with x-ray/computed
      tomography (CT) evidence of bilateral pneumonia and active or recent signs of
      hyperinflammation (fever or clinical laboratory results indicative of hyper-inflammation).
      The Phase 3 portion is intended to confirm Phase 2 efficacy and safety findings. In both
      Phase 2 and Phase 3, participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include
      non-intubated, hospitalized participants who require supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) â‰¥ 92% (ie, "non-ventilated" participants); Cohort 2 will include
      hospitalized participants for whom mechanical ventilation was recently initiated (ie,
      "ventilated" participants). Following Screening, enrolled participants in each cohort will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of 2 mavrilimumab dose levels, or placebo as a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion (Day 1). Participants will undergo primary study assessments
      through Day 29 and will be followed for safety through Day 90.
