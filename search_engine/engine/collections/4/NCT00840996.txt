      surgeries were done in 1999. This represents close to 65% of the procedures performed by
      neurosurgeons. Furthermore, the number of hospitalizations related with spine surgery has
      significantly increased since 1970.

      IV PCA is considered the standard of care for postoperative pain control after surgery.
      Intravenous opioids have significant side effects such as respiratory depression,
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and sedation. Furthermore, they cause delayed return of
      bowel function and ileus.

      There is the possibility of surgically inserting a catheter into the epidural space at the
      end of surgery. In general epidural analgesia provides excellent pain relief after surgery
      and decreases opioid consumption significantly und thus opioid related postoperative
      complications. Furthermore epidural anesthesia affects the surgical stress response and might
      decrease inflammatory responses after surgery, thereby improving postoperative recovery and
      mobilization of the patients.

      Intravenous local anesthetics have potent anti-inflammatory properties. They also decrease
      postoperative opioid consumption. Clinical studies have shown that perioperative local
      anesthetic administration significantly reduces the incidence of thrombosis and postoperative
      pain, shortens postoperative ileus and decreases duration of hospitalization.
