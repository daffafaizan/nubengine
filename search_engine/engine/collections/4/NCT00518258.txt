      Studies show that approximately 40 percent of PD patients are depressed. There is evidence
      that these patients have deficits in neuropsychological function relative to non-depressed PD
      patients. Despite the widespread toll on emotional health posed by PD, few studies have
      undertaken a comprehensive examination of the neural underpinnings of Parkinsonian
      depression. In this project, we will compare depressed versus non-depressed Parkinson
      patients to a sample of demographically-matched healthy controls using neuropsychological
      assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To investigate possible effects of
      anti-Parkinsonian medication on mood, cognitive function, and neural response, PD patients
      will be tested both off and on Parkinsonian medications.
