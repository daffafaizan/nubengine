      2 diabetes mellitus, and is one of the most commonly prescribed oral hypoglycemic drug
      worldwide. MF has shown to posses bone forming and bone sparring actions. The present study
      was designed to investigate effectiveness of MF, 1 % in an indigenously prepared
      biodegradable controlled-release gel as, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in
      treatment of chronic periodontitis subjects with intrabony defects.

      Materials and Methods: Sixty five subjects were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP
      plus 1% MF and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6
      months; they included plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth
      (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic
      assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software.
