    
      DESIGN: A007 is a randomized, two-arm study evaluating the effectiveness of standard drug
      addiction counseling with buprenorphine/naloxone to enhanced motivational drug counseling
      with buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment for opioid addiction in an integrated and
      nonintegrated HIV care setting.

      DURATION: Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 48 weeks. Chart
      abstractions will continue for up to four years.

      SAMPLE SIZE: This study will enroll 60 subjects (30 per arm) over 72 weeks.

      POPULATION: HIV-1 infected opioid dependent men and women â‰¥18 years of age who initiate
      buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence and who are receiving primary care for
      HIV-1 infection.

      STRATIFICATION: Subjects will be stratified at screening based on HIV care setting
      (integrated HIV care vs. nonintegrated HIV care)

      INTERVENTON At entry subjects will be randomized to one of the following:

      ARM A: Standard drug addiction counseling + buprenorphine / naloxone

      ARM B: Enhanced behavioral motivation counseling + buprenorphine / naloxone

      The three primary outcomes are:

        1. Cessation of illicit opioid use

        2. Reduction in high risk behavior

        3. Improved HIV therapy adherence
