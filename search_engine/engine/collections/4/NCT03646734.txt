      Regeneration, GBR, with autogenous block graft and GBR with particulate autograft plus
      xenograft) in terms of efficacy, complications, operational parameters (cost of the materials
      used, time for patient preparation, time for surgery, fatigue of the physician caused by
      surgery) tolerability by the patient and patient comfort. 30 systemically healthy individuals
      with inadequate alveolar bone crest width who requested implant placement (15 Female and 15
      Male) participated in this study. After an initial examination, 15 patients were assigned to
      GBR with block graft (GBR-BG) and 15 were assigned to GBR particulate autograft plus
      xenograft (GBR-AX). Bone thickness was recorded before surgery and at a post-operative 6th
      month. Complications as Bleeding, Hematoma, Flap dehiscence, Infection, Numbness were
      evaluated. Patients were requested to record pain and swelling via visual analog scale (VAS)
      at 3rd, 7th and 14th days after surgery. The swelling was also recorded by an experienced
      clinician at 3rd, 7th and 14th days after surgery. Cost, time for patient preparation, time
      for surgery, fatigue of the physician caused by surgery were also determined.
