      predictors of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk in the context of increased numbers
      of sexual partners, comparing those participants with one sexual partner to those with 4 or
      more sexual partners during the past year. (2) To define the prevalence of infection with
      Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, genital herpes, and HIV in women reporting
      one sexual partner in the past year compared to women reporting 4 or more sexual partners
      during the past year.
