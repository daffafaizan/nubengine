      Participants will complete cognitive training exercises on their home or clinic-provided
      computers for 60 minutes per day, 5 days per week. Compliance and performance will be
      monitored on a weekly basis and at completion of the study. Outcome measures will be
      collected one week before initiation of the intervention and within one week completion of
      the intervention. Neuropsychological functioning, including tests of processing speed,
      attention, and executive functioning, will serve as primary outcome measures. Patient
      reported outcomes, including measures of overall QOL and disease-specific QOL, and
      support-person reported outcomes (if applicable), including measures of overall QOL and
      caregiver burden, will be secondary outcome measures. This pilot study promises to evaluate
      computer-based cognitive training in a novel population and expand access to cognitive
      rehabilitation services, and is designed to improve cognitive functioning and QOL among a
      wide range of individuals with PD.
