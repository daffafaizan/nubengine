    
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of
      evolocumab in Chinese Subjects with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Subjects who
      have signed the informed consent form (ICF), will have fasting lipids measured and all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria assessed. Subjects should maintain their current diet and
      exercise regimen. Treatment and follow-up period will be 12 weeks with an additional phone
      call or other subject contact at week 14 for subjects receiving investigational product Q2W.
      The EOS for subjects on QM investigational product is at the week 12 visit which must be at
      least 30 days post last dose of investigational product.

      Evolocumab and placebo will be administered by self-injection under the skin at the study
      site or in an appropriate non-clinic setting (e.g., at home) by spring based prefilled auto
      injector/pen (AI/Pen). Subjects must tolerate an injection of placebo with a prefilled auto
      injector/pen device to be used during the study prior to randomization.

      Approximately 40 sites in China will participate in this study. The overall participants to
      finish the study will be approximately 450 randomly added to one of 4 groups using a 2:2:1:1
      ratio.

      Evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W-150 subjects total) Evolocumab 420 mg once a month
      (QM-150 subjects total) placebo every 2 weeks (75 subjects total) placebo once a month (75
      subjects total) The dose frequencies of every 2 weeks and monthly will not be blinded but the
      identity of investigational product Evolocumab or placebo will be blinded.
