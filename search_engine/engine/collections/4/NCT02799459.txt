      Anesthesia's field. There are few studies about this new anesthesia tool. The latter showed
      that it's possible to substitute GA by hypnosis. This tool could have many positive such as
      reduced pains, anxiety or post operative vomiting nausea (POVN). Hypnosis in conization also
      allows time reduction in post operative security monitoring room (SSPI), speedier hospital
      discharge and greater patient satisfaction. Most studies involves 1 or 2 practitioners and
      few patients. There is no reliable research which compare Hypnosis in conization costs and GA
      costs. Since 2010, anesthesia's team of Grenoble Mutualist Hospital group (GHM) realized many
      Hypnosis in conization surgical procedures. Half of the team had been trained to Hypnosis in
      conization and use it for several types of surgeries for a lot of surgeons. It's the case for
      conisations. Currently, the 7 gynaecologists surgeons of the team achieved between 150 and
      200 per year , some of this used GA, others used Hypnosis in conization, and unusually they
      used " rachianesthesia ". Thus, it gives us the opportunity for studying Hypnosis in
      conization, without practitioner effect, for a relatively cohesive group of patients (vast
      majority of patients are between 30 and 50 years and they haven't any particular medical
      history).
