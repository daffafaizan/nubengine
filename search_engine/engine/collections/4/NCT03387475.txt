    
      Patients will receive the number of DFX tablets (Exjade, cp film-coated, 90mg or 360mg), in
      relation to their body weight to be closer to 3.5mg / kg / d for 12 months.

      At one month and six months of treatment, the residual plasma levels of DFX will be measured
      in patients (sent to the Bordeaux laboratory of Biochemistry, Pr Molimard) to allow the
      dosage to be adjusted (plasma objective of 3 μM).

      At inclusion (J1) and at 6 months of treatment, a dosage of NTBI and hepcidine will be
      performed.

      If patients become transfusion-dependent (≥) 2 packed red cells (RBP) per 2-month period
      evaluated over 6 months, they will stop low-dose DFX and go out of protocol to receive DFX at
      20mg / kg (according to EMEA authorization) for iron chelation.
