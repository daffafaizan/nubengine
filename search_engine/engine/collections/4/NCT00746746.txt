      HyperAcute® Vaccine with PEG-Intron®. It is hoped that the immune system's response to these
      genetically engineered melanoma cells and PEG-Intron® will cause a reaction that will make it
      react to and attack and kill the melanoma cells and keep it from growing, possibly causing
      the tumors to shrink.

      Patients that are eligible are 19 years or older and have been diagnosed with advanced,
      treatment resistant or recurrent melanoma, an aggressive usually pigmented form of skin
      cancer.
