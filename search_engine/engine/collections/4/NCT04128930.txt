      apnea (OSA) is only reimbursed in Belgium after in-laboratory overnight titration.
      Nevertheless, in a recent clinical practice guideline of the AASM, it is recommended that PAP
      therapy can be initiated using either in-laboratory titration or auto-titrating CPAP (APAP)
      at home in OSA patients without significant comorbidities. Indeed, several studies evaluated
      the impact of titration with APAP at home in these patients and showed that the outcome is
      comparable with in-hospital titration. Up to now, evidence for home titration with fixed CPAP
      (and follow-up via telemonitoring) is very limited. The use of sleep laboratory space is
      costly and limits access for diagnostic studies. This study aims to evaluate whether CPAP
      titration at home with fixed CPAP produces outcomes equal to those following APAP titration.
