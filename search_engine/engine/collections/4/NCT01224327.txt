      hepatic artery in the treatment of liver cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis were
      randomly separated into two groups. Umbilical cord MSCs were infused to patients using
      interventional method via hepatic artery for One group. After the catheter placed at proper
      hepatic artery was confirmed by angiography, umbilical cord MSCs were infused slowly for
