      systems were developed and used to classify patients to appropriate risk groups. According to
      risk classification, different diagnosis and treatment modalities can be used and help
      physicians manage diagnosis strategies and treatments. Purpose of this study is to develop a
      clinical decision support system for patients presenting to emergency department with the
      help of statistical machine learning.
