      subjects with oropharyngeal or mechanical dysphagia, gastroparesis and known or suspected
      anatomical abnormalities. In addition, ingestion of a wireless capsule endoscope may be
      challenging in the pediatric population. The PillCam® Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery
      System is intended to provide physicians with the capability to place capsules in the
      proximal duodenum using the accessory channel of a standard endoscope.

      The PillCam™ SB capsule to be used in this study was cleared by the FDA in August 2001 for
      small bowel evaluation. It has been ingested to date by more than 1,000,000 people worldwide
      and is well accepted by subjects and physicians as well as the professional societies.

      Further details of the PillCam®Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System can be found in the
      device description section.

      This study is designed to evaluate the performance and safety of the Capsule Endoscopy
      Delivery System in subjects indicated to undergo a standard Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
      endoscopy
