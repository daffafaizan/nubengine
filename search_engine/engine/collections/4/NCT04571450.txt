      problem nowadays. In this sense, healthy eating and regular physical activity have
      demonstrated a relevant role maintaining health while ageing. Information and Communication
      Technologies (ICTs) have been shown as a useful way to promote health, improving motivation
      and overcoming difficulties to maintain a healthy lifestyle. ICTs also reach a wider audience
      at a lower cost, due to their good cost-benefit relationship and the possibility of
      increasing the efficiency of interventions.

      This research will constitute a 3 years follow-up which includes a re-assessment and
      re-intervention of obese or overweight adults with hypertension, recruited from a
      hypertension unit of a public hospital, that already participated in a similar program 3
      years ago. At the same time, the aim of the study is to analyze the effects of the current
      program, which will take 3 months and promotes lifestyle changes focusing on healthy eating
      and increased physical activity in their 9 modules, comparing the results obtained in 2018.
      These patients will be allocated into one experimental group. Assessment will include: Blood
      Pressure, Body Mass Index, Physical Activity levels, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
