      EA for women with pure SUI. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to EA group or sham
      EA group in a 1:1 ratio via a central randomization system by acupuncturists. Participants,
      outcome assessors and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. Subject blinding is
      achieved via the aid of adhesive pads used in both groups, placebo needle with a blunt tip
      and sham EA electrode lines. Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a 20%
      drop-out, a sample size of 36 would be needed for each group. The investigators expanded the
      sample size to 80 cases (40 cases per group) to increase the reliability of the study. The
      investigators performed statistical analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. All
      patients accepting randomization were included in the analysis. Missing data were filled in
      by the last observed value. Student t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used for the
      comparison of continuous variables; chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests or Kruskal-Wallis
      H tests were used to compare categorical variables, as appropriate. For measures collected at
      two time points, paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used as appropriate. A
      statistically significant difference was set at P<0.05.
