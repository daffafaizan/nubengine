      I. Determine efficacy of single agent cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib) in women
      previously receiving one line of chemotherapy for metastatic endometrial cancer or with
      progression within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy, with co-primary endpoints of
      objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and
      progression-free-survival at 12 weeks (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of clinical response with baseline molecular status of archival tumor
      (hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-met] amplification & mutation status) and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks or every 6
      months.
