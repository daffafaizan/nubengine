      developed by World Health Organization that can be delivered by trained lay people. PMP
      systematically teaches four strategies: stress management through breathing exercises,
      problem solving, behavioral activation, and skills to strengthen social support at individual
      level. The current study plans to adapt PMP to develop the PMP for Immigrants (PMP-I) for a
      family setting to address immigrant's multiple social and emotional stressors while adjusting
      into the new multi-cultural environment of the United States. The rationale to adapt PMP is
      based on our intervention model that demands integration of social and emotional stressors;
      promising results of PMP; strong evidence of family and community ties in health care
      process; and growing consensus among community, scientists, and policymakers on the need for
      family-based care models that are sustainable. PMP-I is a 5-week, peer-led, culturally
      tailored mental health promotion program that includes psychoeducation, behavioral
      activation, and problem solving (90 minutes/session/weekly), and breathing exercises and yoga
      (90 minutes/session/weekly) in a family setting. Participating families will be randomly
      allocated into two groups (N=116 families; 58 families per intervention (PMP-I) and control
      (CSS)) with assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention with
      trained community facilitators in collaboration with church leaders.
