      the world adult population are affected by hypertension in industrialised countries.
      Development of a pharmacogenomic approach to the therapy of primary hypertension give new
      opportunities for the treatment of hypertension. This approach consists in the identification
      of the genetic-molecular mechanisms responsible for hypertension in a given subset of
      patients, and in the development of drugs able to interfere with such mechanisms, thus
      leading to very selective therapeutic interventions with enhanced efficacy and reduced side
      effects.
