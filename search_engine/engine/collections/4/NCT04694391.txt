      2010 and Dec 1, 2020 were collected retrospectively. Recurrence tumor tissue is collected
      between Dec 31, 2020 and Dec 31, 2022 prospectively. Blood and preradiotherapy tumor tissue
      were also collected to be as contrast. A total of 100 paired blood, preradiotherapy tumor
      tissue and relapse tumor tissue were collected. What is more, a total of 100 paired blood and
      preradiotherapy tumor tissue with diagnosis of no recurrence were collected. All samples were
      conducted with whole exome sequencing.

      Here the investigators define recurrence period as within 2 years and no recurrence period as
      more than 3 years after radiotherapy.

      Criteria of relapse: (1) pathologic diagnosis is squamous carcinoma before radiotherapy;(2)
      received radiotherapy; (3)pathologic diagnosis is also squamous carcinoma after radiotherapy;
      (4) clinical symptoms including feeding obstruction etc; (5) imaging evidence showed disease
      progression.
