      recommended, however, there is an associated increase in the level of embolic events which
      confers morbidity and, occasionally, mortality.

      The RIA is a single device which is able to ream the medullary canal, irrigate the canal and
      subsequently aspirate the reamed medullary contents in order to get rid of medullary fat and
      other contents responsible for these adverse embolic events.

      A novel Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator (RIA) (Synthes, Inc) will be evaluated in a randomized
      study, to determine its effect on the incidence of fat emboli events during reamed IM nail
      fixation of consecutive femoral shaft fractures as measured by intra-operative
      transesophageal echocardiogram and pulmonary function.
