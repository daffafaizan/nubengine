      are the next logical step in the attempt to improve tumor response rates and prolong
      survival. Oral capecitabine is a convenient way to deliver drug a 5-fluorouracil analogue. In
      addition, vinorelbine is a newer vinca alkaloid chemotherapeutic agent with improved efficacy
      and probably improved toxicity over its predecessors in the treatment of breast cancer. We
      propose combining these two agents. As these two drugs have non-overlapping toxicities and
      differing mechanisms of action, we anticipate being able to deliver both drugs in near full
      dose.

      Secondary purposes include assessing whether there is a correlation between intra-tumoral
      enzyme levels and prognosis.
