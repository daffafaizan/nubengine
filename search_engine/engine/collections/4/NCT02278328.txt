      abnormalities (specifically, delays) in auditory evoked neuromagnetic responses (e.g. M100 -
      see Roberts et al., 2010, and mismatch field, MMF - see Roberts et al., 2011) as well as
      abnormalities in the oscillatory behavior of auditory cortex, especially in the gamma band
      (30-50Hz), at rest and in response to simple auditory stimuli (see Gandal et al., 2010 and
      Cornew et al., 2012; Edgar et al., 2013). The local circuitry underlying such evoked activity
      and oscillations, and synaptic transmission in general, requires an appropriate balance of
      excitation and inhibition, mediated by glutamate and GABA, respectively. One model of the
      neural oscillatory deficits in ASD suggests that impaired regulatory control by inhibitory
      interneurons onto pyramidal cells underlies abnormal auditory latency and oscillatory
      electrophysiological measures. As such, electrophysiological deficits are interpreted in
      terms of local circuitry abnormalities, with inferences at the molecular level of imbalances
      in the activity of glutamate and GABA.

      A candidate therapeutic for ASD has been developed - STX209, a GABA-B agonist. Since this
      pharmaceutical targets synaptic activity that has clear electrophysiological correlates, one
      goal of this proposal is to assess the responsiveness (sensitivity to change) of MEG measures
      to acute administration of STX209 at various doses in adolescents on the autism spectrum. The
      study also aims to establish the nature of the putative relationship between such
      electrophysiologic markers and GABA and glutamate levels using MEGAPRESS spectrally-edited
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
