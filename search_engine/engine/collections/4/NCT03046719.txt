      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study
      and randomized into two groups. Intravenous (IV) cannule with Ringer Lactate fluid,
      non-invasive blood pressure monitor, electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse-oxymetry were set on
      the subjects in the operation room. Co-induction was done with midazolam 0,05 mg/kg and
      fentanyl 2 mcg/kg. Induction was done with propofol 1-2 mg/kg, followed by Laryngeal Mask
      insertion facilitated by atracurium 0,5 mg/kg. Maintenance was done with sevoflurane 1-2
      vol%, O2:H2O = 1:2, flow 2 liter/minute. Surgery started. After final stitching, Group 1
      received subconjunctival bupivacaine 0,5% 2,5ml in between stitches; Group 2 received
      subconjunctival NaCl 0,9% in between stitches. Both groups received paracetamol 20 mg/kgBW IV
      as post-operative analgesics. Hemodynamic, pain degree (using Visual Analog Scale / VAS), and
      nausea/vomiting incidence, and the time for first requested additional analgesia were
      recorded. Data was analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientist), for
      numerical data using unpaired T-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, for categorical data using
      Chi-square test or Fischer Exact's Test. Data normality was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      test. Significant value is p<0.05.
