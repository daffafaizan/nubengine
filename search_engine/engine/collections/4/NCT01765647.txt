      following a gluten free diet, continue to have mild to moderate symptoms of gluten exposure
      despite the diet, and have a history of biopsy proven celiac disease. Those meeting this
      criteria will then have a baseline visit which will include a short physical exam and
      additional lab work for safety measures, and quality of life questionnaires. They will record
      their diet and symptoms for 2 weeks, and then return to receive the study medication, which
      will be taken with all meals. The first dose will be taken in clinic to facilitate
      observation of any adverse effects. The next visit will be 2 weeks later for blood work and
      clinic visit, and then again 2 weeks later for the final visit. Participants will be prompted
      to report any adverse events that occur during the trial period and at the completion of the
      trial. During the trial period, the study coordinator will phone participants to remind them
      to complete their questionnaires and to inquire about adverse events. All participants will
      receive AGY capsules (500 mg per capsule), and will take 2 capsules with each meal.

      Outcome measures The primary outcome variable will be the safety (adverse events, lab
      results, symptoms), which will be measured throughout the study.

      The secondary outcome will be ATG antibody levels, which will be measured at each visit.
