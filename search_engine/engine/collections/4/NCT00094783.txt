      such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting. These procedures generally can be conducted
      on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional
      open surgery. Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by
      physician manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic
      x-ray.

      We have developed minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time
      magnetic resonance imaging. These procedures have the advantage of excellent imaging without
      surgery and without ionizing radiation exposure or toxic contrast agents (dyes). Moreover,
      because real time MRI can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood, and of
      three-dimensional structures, it may be possible to guide minimally-invasive procedures not
      possible even with invasive surgery.

      A state-of-the-art combined X-ray and MRI interventional suite has been constructed and
      equipped with real-time MRI image reconstruction for interventional experiments, patient
      monitoring and transport equipment for dual imaging modalities, and large-mammal preclinical
      simulation experiments. Preclinical experiments in a porcine model of surgical aortic
      coarctation have shown that real-time MRI guided percutaneous intervention can be conducted
      using entirely commercially-available devices approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration.

      The goal of this protocol is to test clinical peripheral artery revascularization procedures
      guided wholly-or in part by real-time MRI.
