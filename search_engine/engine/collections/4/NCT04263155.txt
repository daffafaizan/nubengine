      methods that increase engagement with care offer a promising approach to improving the mental
      health and wellness of young women. This study aims to implement and evaluate the Body
      Project, a 4-hour dissonance-based program designed to address body image concerns and
      prevent eating disorders with high school young women using a peer delivery model. This study
      will evaluate the impact of the Body Project on key eating disorder risk factors and relevant
      social and self-constructs at three time-points (pre, post, and one-year follow-up). Young
      women will be recruited from two high schools and will be randomized to receive the Body
      Project program or to the control group. The Body Project will be facilitated by college-aged
      young women who have been trained to deliver the Body Project.
