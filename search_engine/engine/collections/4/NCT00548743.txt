    
      A randomized controlled trial of screening and management of postpartum depression that
      includes a second phase assessing the maintenance of the intervention in the original
      intervention sites and a switch from usual care to intervention in the control sites.

      Planned enrollment includes 29 family medicine practices and 3000 women over a period of four
      years. All follow up and management is initiated within the family medicine practices to
      improve generalizability and likelihood for dissemination.

      In addition to the patient centered outcomes, exploratory analyses will look at the uptake
      and degree of implementation and maintenance of the intervention based on characteristics of
      the practice including size, location, affiliation with larger group, type of practice and
      whether or not the practice is a community health center or residency practice.
