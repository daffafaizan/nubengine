      consciousness and is the acute episodic form of orthostatic intolerance(OI). Postural
      tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the common chronic form of OI. Both are defined by
      debilitating symptoms and signs while upright relieved by recumbency. Pathophysiological
      mechanisms have remained elusive although our past work shows that excessive upright central
      hypovolemia results from splanchnic pooling due to defective splanchnic arterial and venous
      constriction. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that production of nitric oxide (NO) is
      enhanced in these patients resulting in reduced sympathetic noradrenergic neurotransmission
      at pre-junctional and post-junctional sites. Our approach is two-fold: 1) We will use
      intradermal microdialysis and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to delineate the microvascular
      mechanisms of NO modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission free of confounding systemic
      reflex changes. 2) We will systemically apply this mechanism to a model of orthostatic
      stress, lower body negative pressure(LBNP), while measuring cardiac output by inert gas
      rebreathing, regional blood volume, and regional blood flow using plethysmographic techniques
      focusing on splanchnic changes, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity by peroneal
      microneurography. We will study synaptic peripheral neurotransmission of Norepinephrine and
      how it is affected by supplemental NO and by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.
