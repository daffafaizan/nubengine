      of local anesthesia might be reduction in cardiac and pulmonal complications, reduction of
      surgical time, and reduction of hospital stay. On the other hand it has been postulated that
      intraoperative seizures are avoided by general anesthesia and that brain tumor surgery is
      perceived in the public as psychological and physical stress.Therefor we postulate that
      patients undergoing stereotactic biopsies in local anesthesia show a higher stress level than
      patients operated under general anesthesia.
