      system of Hepatolithiasis based on 3D digital conformation. And we hypothesized that it could
      predict a more precise construction of this disease, hence, typing by 3D conformation will
      improve the outcome of surgical treatment.The investigators will use a multicenter
      ambispective cohort study to test this hypothesis. In this cohort study, two group will be
      enrolled to compare the outcomes.
