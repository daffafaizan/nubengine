      beginning with screening occurring within the waiting room which will yield decision support
      guidance delivered and followed by the PCP at the same visit.

      Assignment of Interventions: This study will randomize participants to one of three
      conditions in a 2:2:1 randomization scheme to either receive "screening as usual" (n=20),
      Screening Wizard 2.0 (n=40), or Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA (n =40)

      Hypothesis: H1: Screening Wizard 2.0 will result in more referrals compared to "screening as
      usual" (increase >30% compared to "screening as usual")

      H2: Screening Wizard 2.0 will result in higher rates of follow-through with mental health
      services compared to "screening as usual" (increase >30% compared to "screening as usual")

      H3: Screening Wizard 2.0 will have higher patient satisfaction compared to "screening as
      usual" (SW satisfaction > "screening as usual" satisfaction)

      H4: Adolescent and parents in Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA will have less negative attitudes
      about psychotherapy, higher depression literacy, and a higher readiness for treatment as
      compared to Screening Wizard 2.0 alone or "screening as usual"

      H5: Adolescent and parents in Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA will result in higher rates of
      follow-through with mental health services (defined as attendance at an initial appointment)
      compared to Screening wizard 2.0 alone (increase >10%) and "screening as usual" (increase
      >40%)
