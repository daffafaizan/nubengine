    
      The study will be a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre,
      multi-national, parallel-arm study comparing a placebo group to a DP-b99 group treated
      intravenously with 1.0 mg/kg twice daily for 2 consecutive days.

      The study will enrol 30 patients at high risk of developing severe pancreatitis, as assessed
      by the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score of 3 or more at study
      entry.

      The primary study endpoint is the effect of DP-b99 on systemic inflammation in acute
      pancreatitis as reflected by C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels. The secondary endpoints
      are the safety of DP-b99 in this population of patients (through routine safety laboratory
      tests, physical examination and vital signs monitoring, ECG and adverse event reporting),
      DP-b99's effects on other plasma inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, matrix
      metalloproteinase 9, tumor necrosis factor alpha) as well as its effects on the clinical
      course of pancreatitis (based on changes in the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
      (SIRS) and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, and on
      contrast material-enhanced abdominal Computerised Tomography (CT), versus placebo.

      Clinical trial material administration will begin within 48 hours of acute pancreatitis
      symptoms onset. Subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either DP b99 or
      placebo. The serum levels of DP-b99 at the end of each 2-hour infusion will also be
      monitored.

      The study duration per individual subject will be 14 days, consisting of a screening
      evaluation followed by a 48-hour double blind treatment period, which will be part of an
      in-hospital observation period of at least 6 days, and a follow-up final visit on Day 14.
