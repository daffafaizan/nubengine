      over the course of 12 months. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 3 initial monthly
      anti-VEGF injections (Bevacizumab 1.25mg in 0.05ml of solution-AvastinÂ®) and were followed
      monthly until year 1. Re-treatment was performed if needed (pro re nata-PRN) as previously
      reported.
