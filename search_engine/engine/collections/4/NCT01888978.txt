      parts of the body). The purpose of this study is to determine whether molecularly tailored
      therapy can improve the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy combinations for patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. A series of special tests will be performed on a sample of
      tumor, and based on the results subjects will be assigned to one of seven chemotherapy
      treatments, with each being the combination of two standard chemotherapies. Each of these
      combinations has been safely used in patients with pancreatic or other types of cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to to determine the ability to personalize therapy in this manner,
      and to determine how many patients a larger study would need. A second purpose is not to
      determine if one doublet is better than another. Rather, this second purpose is to show that
      for all patients enrolled in this protocol who have been assigned a doublet based on their
      tumor's molecular analysis (molecular tailoring), treatment response will be better than
      would be expected compared to patients who have been treated in the past with no molecular
      tailoring.
