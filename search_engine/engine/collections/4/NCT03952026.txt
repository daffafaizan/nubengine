    
      The German Pelvic Registry of the German Trauma Society is a multicenter prospective registry
      which collects data of patients with pelvic injuries since 2003. Beside demographic data
      (including concomitant injuries) allowing for epidemiological evaluations of the development
      of surgical care in these patients, namely the operative care is focus of this registry.
      Beside the chosen procedure or surgical approach, this includes both intraoperative data like
      time until operation, duration of the procedure or intraoperative blood loss and reduction
      parameters (pre- and postoperative fracture steps). The clinical course is recorded also
      including overall morbidity, overall mortality and osteosynthesis-related complications.

      The influence of a concomitant abdominal trauma on the quality of care regarding operative
      parameters like reduction quality or the clinical course in pelvic injuries has not been
      investigated yet.

      The investigators therefore retrospectively analyze the prospective consecutive data of
      patients from the multicenter German Pelvic Registry of the German Trauma Society in the
      years 2003 - 2017. Demographic, clinical and operative parameter were recorded and compared
      in two groups (isolated pelvic fracture vs. combined abdominal/pelvic trauma).
