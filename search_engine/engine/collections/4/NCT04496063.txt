    
      Main endpoint:

      The primary endpoint will be combined remission at week 12 defined as:

        -  100% of the fistula tracts without any drainage by the external openings (occurring
           spontaneously or after gentle finger compression) And

        -  absence of collections >2 cm of the treated perianal fistulas confirmed by masked
           central MRI Patient requiring UST optimization will be considered in failure but will be
           followed until week 48

      Secondary endpoints:

      Definition

        -  Clinical remission: 100% of the fistula tracts without any drainage by the external
           openings (i.e, absence of any drainage by all fistula openings occurring spontaneously
           or after gentle finger compression)

        -  Clinical response (closure of at least 50% of all treated external openings that were
           draining at baseline)

        -  Radiological remission: absence of collections >2 cm of the treated perianal fistulas
           confirmed by masked central MRI

        -  Combined clinical and radiological remission at week 24 and 48.

        -  Clinical remission (i.e, absence of any drainage by all fistula openings occurring
           spontaneously or after gentle finger compression) at week 12, 24 and 48

        -  Absence of collections >2 cm of the treated perianal fistulas confirmed by masked
           central MRI at week 12, 24 and 48

        -  Evaluation of the magnetic resonance novel index for fistula imaging in CD at week 12,
           24 and 48

        -  Clinical response (closure of at least 50% of all treated external openings that were
           draining at baseline) at week 12, 24 and 48

        -  Combined clinical response and radiological remission at week 48

        -  Perineal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at week 12,
           24 and 48

        -  Quality of life will be assessed with the Inflammatory Bowel Disease questionnaire
           (IBDQ) scores at week 24 and 48

        -  Correlation between response and remission and UST trough levels and antidrug (UST)
           antibodies at week 12, 24, 48

        -  Clinical response of UST optimization at week 48 (closure of at least 50% of all treated
           external openings that were draining at week 12)

        -  Clinical response at week 48 of UST introduction at W12 (closure of at least 50% of all
           treated external
