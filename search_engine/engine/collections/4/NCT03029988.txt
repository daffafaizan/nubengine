    
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, comparator study of IV injected Tc 99m
      Tilmanocept in the localization and detection of liver metastases in subjects with confirmed
      colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The study will be divided into two cohorts.

      If it was determined that additional enrollment would not provide meaningful data, for
      example no metastatic liver lesions were visualized by Tc 99m tilmanocept for any of the
      subjects in the cohort, enrollment into Cohort 2 would begin and 3 subjects would be enrolled
      followed by a review of the imaging and safety data.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tc 99m tilmanocept
      administered intravenously. SPECT/CT imaging of the subject's abdominal cavity will be
      reviewed to establish concordance with FDG PET imaging.
