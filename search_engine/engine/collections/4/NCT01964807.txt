      cardiovascular risks of other popular tobacco products (smokeless tobacco), new tobacco
      products ( e-cigarettes) and proposed products (reduced nicotine cigarettes) are not
      adequately understood. The FDA will need information about the cardiovascular safety of these
      products to inform their regulatory decisions. While long-term clinical outcome studies of
      the cardiovascular risks of these tobacco products would be optimal, they take too long to
      provide the data that the FDA needs now. Disturbances in the function of vascular endothelium
      (the lining of arteries, which plays an important role in regulating vascular function) and
      the activation of the autonomic nervous system, as well as increased inflammation, oxidative
      stress and propensity to thrombosis (clotting), are key mechanisms in the progression of CVD
      and validated biomarkers of CVD risk. These biomarkers form the basis for our model to assess
      the CVD risks of tobacco product use and secondhand smoke exposure. We will conduct
      controlled, short-term exposures of human subjects to test products that provide a wide range
      of nicotine, particle, and other cardiovascular toxin concentrations to determine how these
      components associated with tobacco use adversely affect cardiovascular risk.
