      favored by many attempts to avoid complications encountered with radiating the immediately
      reconstructed breast. The timing of delayed reconstruction is however not known. The goal of
      this proposal is to study the gross, structural and vascular changes in radiated mastectomy
      skin in addition to possible structural and flow changes of the underlying internal mammary
      vessels over time. We plan to use these objective findings as a basis for determining an
      ideal time frame for delayed autologous breast reconstruction.

      Sequential mastectomy skin specimens will be obtained from 20 patients undergoing
      post-mastectomy radiation therapy over a 24 month period and these specimens will be
      evaluated histologically. These same patients will also undergo serial examinations and
      photographic documentation of gross skin changes. Skin perfusion will be assessed by laser
      Doppler imaging and internal mammary vessel structure, and flow characteristics will be
      assessed by color Doppler sonography.

      Based on these studies, we will elucidate short and long term changes in radiated breast
      skin, showing inflammatory, structural and perfusion patterns that can be correlated with
      optimal conditions for reconstruction. This has the potential to dramatically change practice
      patterns of delayed reconstruction for many reconstructive surgeons and more importantly
      restore what patients loose with mastectomy in a consistent, timely fashion. There is also
      potential for improved outcomes of delayed breast reconstruction by decreasing the number of
      reconstructions performed too soon after completion of radiation.
