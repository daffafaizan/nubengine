      response who undergo IVF / ICSI treatment cycle at Royan Institute will enroll in this study
      and will randomly be divided into two groups of 100 patients. This study has been approved by
      Royan ethics committee and written consent will be obtained from each patient.

      The patients will be randomized to one of two groups of Flare Up or Microdose GnRh agonist
      flare up.

      Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Estradiol, will be evaluated on
      day 2 or 3 and when follicle size become >14.

      2 weeks after embryo transfer, the patients will be tested for serum Î²-hCG for assessing the
      pregnancy. The clinical pregnancy will be clarified by the number of women with gestational
      sacs on transvaginal sonography at 4-6 weeks of gestation. In the calculation of
      implantation, the number of gestational sacs will be considered.
