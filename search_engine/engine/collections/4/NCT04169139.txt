    
      The Trial is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, parallel arm trial of REPaiR therapy
      (experimental treatment) versus MIST (control therapy) in a maximum of 2 qualifying
      periodontal study teeth will be treated in each subject. Qualifying teeth will have PPD ≥ 6mm
      and intrabony vertical ≥ 3 mm, with base of defect ≥ 3 mm coronal to the tooth apex, and
      defect angle ≥ 25°.

      For Subjects already in maintenance therapy and having completed scaling and root planing
      within the previous 6-months, up to 3 Study Teeth will be selected and SRP conducted on just
      these teeth, and subjects will be randomized to either Test or Control Therapies (Visit 3).
      For patients already in maintenance therapy and NOT having completed SRP within the previous
      6-months, up to 3 qualifying teeth may be selected, and localized SRP in the study teeth
      quadrants (Visit 2) can be followed after 4-6 weeks by Visit 3 Therapy on up to 2 Study
      Teeth. Other subjects not in maintenance therapy and with up to 3 qualifying teeth will be
      selected at the Screening Visit; then 4-6 weeks following SRP, up to 2 Study Teeth will be
      selected, and subjects will be randomized to either Test or Control Therapies. Follow-up
      assessments will be conducted on all subjects by a blinded examiner over a 12-month period.
