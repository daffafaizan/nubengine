      perform tracheal intubation by using the NOL index as the criterion measured to determine the
      failure (painful intubation) or the success (pain free intubation) of the assessed procedure.

      Objectives: To determine the ED50 and ED95 of remifentanil bolus to perform tracheal
      intubation without NOL index variating over threshold for nociceptive response (determined as
      a NOL index going over 20 - peak value of maximum 20) using the Macintosh blade when
      obtaining good conditions of intubation in anesthetized patients. Good conditions of
      intubation will be determined as obtaining a Cormack-Lehane grade I and II.
