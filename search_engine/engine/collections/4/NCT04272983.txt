      celiac disease, which is due to the genetic intolerance of gluten - a protein found in wheat,
      rye and barley. When a person with celiac disease consumes gluten-containing foods, his
      immune system damages the mucous membrane of the small intestine. Inflammation develops and,
      as a result, the absorption of vitamins, minerals and other vital nutrients is disrupted.
      Studies have shown that timely diagnosis of celiac disease is important for the treatment or
      prevention of its complications. Left untreated, the disease can lead to impaired growth and
      development, diabetes, cancer, or other diseases. In Europe and the USA, celiac disease is a
      chronic disease that occurs in approximately one in 100 and one in 22 who have risk factors.
      There are frequent cases of an erased or low-symptom course of celiac disease. Unfortunately,
      ninety-seven percent of cases remain undiagnosed and, accordingly, do not receive proper
      treatment. A screening program will increase knowledge about the disease and contribute to
      the early detection of the disease.
