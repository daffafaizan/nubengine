      more rapid wound healing, more stable corneal biomechanical properties and less surgically
      induced astigmatism (SIA). With the development of phacoemulsification and foldable
      intraocular lenses (IOL) during recent decades, the size of clear corneal incisions has been
      reduced from 3.2-mm (coaxial small incision) to 1.4-mm (bimanual micro incision). Micro
      incision cataract surgery (MICS), including bimanual and micro coaxial phacoemulsification,
      has attracted much interest recently, due to its safety and ease of learning. However, the
      superiority of coaxial micro incision cataract surgery as compared conventional coaxial
      cataract surgery is still not certain, because micro incision phacoemulsification may result
      in longer ultrasound time (UST), the use of more ultrasonic power and consequently higher
      endothelial cell loss (ECL).

      In our previous studies of the OZil Torsional phacoemulsification system (Infinity, Alcon),
      we reported that the safety and effectiveness of cataract surgery are influenced by many
      factors, including the blade used to create the incision, the phacoemulsification apparatus,
      and the IOL and mode of IOL delivery, which together constitute a surgical system, whose
      outcomes are restricted by the best performance of each component. Today, micro coaxial
      phacoemulsification is in wide use for cataract surgery, but the lower limits of incision
      size should be understood in the context of the various components of the surgical system.

      In this study, we compared the safety and efficacy of three different incision-size-dependent
      phacoemulsification systems, 1.8, 2.2 and 3.0 mm, and evaluated the relationship between
      incision size and SIA.
