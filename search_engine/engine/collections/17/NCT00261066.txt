      patients undergoing various types of orthopaedic surgery. These data will yield a valuable
      database that can be used to address future research questions. For example, there are three
      common surgical treatments for medial osteoarthritis of the knee: tibial osteotomy, Oxford
      partial knee replacement, or total knee replacement. No clear guidelines exist regarding
      which treatment options are optimal for which patients. By gathering functional data from
      patients who have undergone these treatments, we will have a basis for devising such
      guidelines.
