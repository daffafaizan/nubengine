      following the Week 4 evaluation of approximately the first 12 subjects. A dose adjustment may
      be implemented based on these results. A preliminary review of the Week 4 pharmacokinetics of
      the first 6 subjects will occur to monitor exposure. If a dose adjustment is required,
      pharmacokinetics will be repeated for the first 12 subjects enrolled at the new dose
      (subjects 13-24).
