    
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which
      subjects with IC will be randomized to receive a single treatment of VLTS-934 (84 mL, or a
      total of 420 mg poloxamer 188) or placebo (84 mL saline) administered as 21 intramuscular
      (IM) injections of 2 mL each, bilaterally into the lower extremities during one procedure to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential activity of VLTS-934 as compared with a
      saline placebo.
