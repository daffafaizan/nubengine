      receive active study drug but will receive tablets with no active ingredients (a placebo).
      This is a dose-ranging study, investigating 3 different dosing regimens. It will be
      double-blinded, meaning that the sponsor, the study doctors, the staff, and the patients will
      not know whether a patient is on active study drug (or the dose) or placebo.
