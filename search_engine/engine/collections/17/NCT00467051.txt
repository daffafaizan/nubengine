      I. Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with recurrent or resistant malignant
      germ cell tumors (GCT) treated with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. To Collect tissue for the
      tumor bank that will aid in the identification of the biological characteristics of recurrent
      GCT.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and
      ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Beginning on day 6, patients receive filgrastim
      (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV once daily until blood count returns to normal. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
