      insulin activity and resultant hyperglycemia. Individuals' differing genetic predisposition,
      level of physical activity, and age all contribute to variations in the onset and severity of
      type 2 diabetes. However, progression of this disease typically follows a characteristic
      pattern that begins as a reduced sensitivity of hepatic and peripheral-tissues to circulating
      insulin (ie, insulin resistance). The body's decreasing ability to produce adequate insulin
      to overcome insulin resistance (ie, insulin deficiency due to beta-cell insufficiency)
      results in impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately overt diabetes. In the United States, an
      estimated 17 million people have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes occurring in approximately
      90% to 95% of cases.

      The goal of treating type 2 diabetes is to control blood glucose and thereby prevent
      long-term complications. Adequate glycemic control is paramount in attempting to avert
      chronic complications, including blindness, renal dysfunction and resultant dialysis or renal
      transplantation, neuropathy, and nontraumatic amputations. Intensive glucose management in
      the early stages of diabetes may help forestall complications.

      Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. Glyburide,
      is an oral antidiabetic agent of the sulfonylurea class. The primary purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of pioglitazone versus glyburide when administered to
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild cardiac disease

      Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 1 year and 2 weeks.
