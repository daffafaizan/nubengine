      disabling. They can lead to serious depression and suicidal behavior, which justifies the
      development of innovative therapeutic options. Current management is essentially based on
      psychological therapy and / or prosthetic, to improve for hearing loss that can be frequently
      associated. In fact, the main objective is habituation for these patients, but when the
      tinnitus is too intense, it is impossible. Three recent publications in functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) have reported a novel physiopathological hypothesis to explain the
      appearance of subjective tinnitus. They highlight the prominent role of the right operculum 3
      (OP3), a deep opercular region (parieto-insular junction) in the emergence of this symptom.
      The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of this region using high frequency stimulation
      could, significantly improve the intensity of the symptom and consequently their quality of
      life in this selected population.
