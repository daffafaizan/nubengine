    
      This is a clinical study for investigating the influence of lactulose on the composition and
      metabolic activities of the intestinal microbiota. We will recruit 40 healthy volunteers.
      Subjects will be randomized and receive either 50g lactose (intervention group) or 50g
      sucrose (control group).

      Subjects will donate fecal samples 24h before and after (1-2d, 14d) lactulose ingestion.
      After ingestion H2-in expiratory air and symptoms will be followed for 3 hours.

      Frozen samples will be analyzed for their microbiota composition and key metabolites.
