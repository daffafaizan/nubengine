      cancer, resulting in a high mortality rate. The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease at home and abroad is a major social and economic burden. However, there is no cure
      for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recently, intestinal axis theory related to the
      development of chronic liver disease and microbial community has emerged. Intake of
      probiotics is known to play a role in regulating gut microflora. Improvement of non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease can be expected through administration of probiotics.
