      neurological features and erythrocyte acanthocytosis. Most have a skeletal myopathy as
      indicated by persistently elevated plasma creatinine kinase, and about 60 percent of the
      patients have an unusual cardiomyopathy with increased risk of sudden death. The molecular
      causes of the syndromes have very recently been defined. However, cardiac and skeletal muscle
      involvement and outcomes have been poorly described and causes of sudden death are unknown.
      We propose to (1) describe the cardiac and skeletal muscle findings of NA and to identify
      potential mechanisms of sudden death; (2) correlate the molecular causes of NA with its
      cardiac and skeletal expressions; and (3) define the specific phenotype, if any, associated
      with the heterozygous state.
