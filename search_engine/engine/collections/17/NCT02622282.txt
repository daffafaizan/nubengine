      (PAD) defined as a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the legs.
      Approximately 40% have at least one risk for PAD (i.e., aged 70 years and older, diabetes,
      high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or smoking). Persons with at least one risk
      factor and who are physically inactive are more likely to suffer from severe PAD. Physical
      inactivity is highly prevalent in Latinos and a major risk factor for PAD. Physical
      inactivity affects 50% of Latinos aged 60 years and older.

      Participation in this study will last for about 3 months. Participants will be randomized to
      one of two groups. One group will receive text messages, brief telephone calls, and a
      handout. The other group will only receive the handout. The study will be looking at how the
      different groups respond to the different interventions used in the study.
