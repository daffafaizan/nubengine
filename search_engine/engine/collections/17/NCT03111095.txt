      to record and submit their daily blood pressure and weight measurements to a mobile health
      nurse and research team. Subjects will be provided with the kit (Honeywell tablet, mobile hot
      spot, blood pressure cuff, and scale) at no cost. Subjects will participate in video
      telehealth visits at 48 hours and 7 days after discharge to help provide management for
      hypertension related issues.
