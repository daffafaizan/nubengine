      classification) in the first 2 weeks of injury.

      After topical anesthesia, all patients initially will receive first aid therapy; which
      included irrigation with normal saline to normalize ocular surface PH and removal of early
      particulate maeuil and debris. After complete examination and obtaining informed consent, the
      patients will be randomized using a treatment assignment list to either AMT with conventional
      medical therapy (group A) or medical treatment only (group B). In the patients with bilateral
      injuries the eyes will be randomized separately. AMT will be performed within 24h of
      presentation. amniotic membrane will remain in place for 7-14 days. The patients will be
      examined at days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and then biweekly until 3 months and monthly until
      (1 year in every visit, visual acuity (by sneillen charts), reduction of pain (subjectively)
      size of corneal epithelial defect (by fluorseein satiny extent of corneal vascularization and
      opacity, and symblepharon formation will be assessed. Digital photographs at each visit will
      be obtained.
