      vasoproliferative processes is the basic pathophysiological mechanism in the development of
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) production
      of endothelin-1 (ET-1) is increased and elevated ET-1 plasma levels correlate with PH
      severity As recently shown Autoantibodies against the Endothelin-1 Typ A and Angiotensin II
      Typ-1 Receptor, which have a high Incidence in PH-Patients, may also play an important role
      in the pathophysiology of PH (Dandel et al.).

      The concept of this study is that the elimination of these autoantibodies by Immunoadsorption
      with protein A may improve haemodynamics and patient wellbeing. Immunoglobulins are
      substituted after Immunoadsorption to minimize infection risk.
