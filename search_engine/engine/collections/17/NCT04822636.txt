      may lead to improved mental health treatment initiation and engagement among publicly-insured
      youth. Publicly-insured youth have high rates of mental health symptoms relative to youth in
      the community, and are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, only perpetuating
      disparities in this population's mental health access and engagement. The proposed project
      will develop and test a family-based navigator intervention, the Family Mental Health
      Navigator (FMHN), a natural fit for improving publicly-insured youth's mental health service
      and clinical outcomes. The study will start with identifying the feasibility and
      acceptability of the FMHN intervention. Then, the study will determine whether the FMHN
      intervention improves publicly-insured youth mental health treatment initiation and
      engagement, relative to standard of care (not participating in FMHN intervention). Finally,
      the study will characterize patterns of pre- and post-service outcomes along the behavioral
      health services cascade of care, to further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary impact of the FMHN model.
