      associated with amyloid fibrils deposits in the myocardium. Two types of amyloid commonly
      infiltrate the heart: immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid (AL), and transthyretin-related
      amyloid amyloidosis (ATTR). Cardiac imaging is currently used for the diagnosis of ATTR,
      including planar scintigraphy with bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals, cardiac magnetic
      resonance and echocardiography with global longitudinal strain assessment.Although
      semi-quantitative methods have been suggested to evaluate the amyloid burden, there a need
      for quantitative methods for longitudinal assessment of the disease.
