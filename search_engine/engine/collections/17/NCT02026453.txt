      errors and patient harm.

      Objective: To quantify AMH error reduction achieved when pharmacy staff obtain AMHs before
      admission medication orders (AMO) are placed.

      Design: Three-arm randomized clinical trial. Setting: Large hospital with community and
      trainee physicians. Population: 306 enrolled patients with complex medical histories.
      Interventions: In one intervention arm, pharmacists, and in the second intervention arm,
      pharmacy technicians obtained initial AMHs prior to admission. They obtained and reconciled
      medication information from multiple sources. All arms, including the control arm, received
      usual AMH care. This included common process variation occurring in: accuracy of pre-existing
      medication histories; nurses' ability to obtain AMHs at hospital admission; and admitting
      physicians' efforts to verify and order from prior AMHs.

      Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was severity-weighted mean AMH error score.
      To detect AMH errors, all patients received reference standard AMHs, which were compared with
      intervention and control group AMHs. AMH errors and resultant AMO errors were independently
      identified and rated by â‰¥2 investigators as significant, serious or life-threatening. Each
      error was assigned 1, 4 or 9 points, respectively, to calculate severity-weighted AMH and AMO
      error scores for each patient.
