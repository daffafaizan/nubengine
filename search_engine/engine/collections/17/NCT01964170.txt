    
      This study consists of two parts. The purpose of PART 1 is to test non-inferiority of ASP3550
      to goserelin acetate with respect to the cumulative castration rate in terms of serum
      testosterone when ASP3550 or goserelin acetate is administered for one-year in patients with
      prostate cancer.

      The patients assigned to receive ASP3550 and completed the treatment in PART 1 are eligible
      for the treatment in PART 2, and will receive ASP3550 maintenance dose subcutaneously for
      additional term. The long-term safety, efficacy and PK of the continued ASP3550 treatment
      will be assessed in PART 2.
