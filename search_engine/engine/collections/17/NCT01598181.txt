      neuroimaging techniques have identified functional differences in cerebral pain processing in
      patients with FIM, as compared to healthy controls. This may support that FIM do have a
      functional CNS component.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe method for inducing
      changes in cortical excitability. Previous studies showed that anodal stimulation of M1 may
      change pain perception, possibly by modulating functional anomalies in the FIM brain. The
      present study has two main goals:

        1. To investigate if tDCS may provide FIM patients with symptom relief due to reduction of
           pain.

        2. To investigate tDCS induced functional changes in the brain by using fMRI.
