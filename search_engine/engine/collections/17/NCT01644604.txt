      the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in subjects with uncontrolled hypertension.
      Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the MDT-2211 renal denervation system - a
      percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the luminal surface of
      the renal artery.
