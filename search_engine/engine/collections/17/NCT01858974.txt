      clinical samples from ventilated critically ill patients could be a fast and accurate
      alternative to conventional microbiological diagnostic methods in the identification of human
      pathogenic microbes in the setting of pneumonia. Therefore aspiration samples from intubated
      and ventilated critically ill patients, which are suspected to develop such an infection,
      will be collected and analyzed by using a multiplex PCR application situated on the intensive
      care unit. The samples will be investigated for DNA sequences that are known to be specific
      for pneumonia causing microbes. Analyses will take place in a point of care setting and will
      be carried out by intensive care physicians. According to the standard protocols of our
      intensive care units, conventional microbiological investigations, including MALDI-TOF, will
      be carried out parallel to the Multiplex PCR analyses.
