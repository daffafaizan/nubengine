      dental organ. The masticatory deficit engendered will have repercussions on the general state
      of the subject and on his quality of life (pains, difficulties of feeding which can cause
      nutritional deficiencies ...). The systematic review of the literature, despite low levels of
      evidence, shows that there is an influence of Parkinson's disease on oral health. Our goal is
      therefore to determine the impact of implementing appropriate oral hygiene measures on
      improving the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease.

      This is a 40-patient, interventional, preliminary study that will rely on indicators of oral
      health status (DMF, Periodontal Index, presence of pathogenic bacteria), as well as a
      questionnaire measuring impact of oral conditions on patient well-being (OHIP-14). These data
      will be collected before and after the implementation of the hygiene measures, within a
      period of 6 months.
