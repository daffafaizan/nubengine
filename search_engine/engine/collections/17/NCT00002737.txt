      without isotretinoin in patients with bidimensionally measurable progressive metastases from
      renal cell cancer. II. Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in this patients
      population. III. Determine the overall survival of this patient population treated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive interferon alfa subcutaneously daily. Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa as in
      arm I plus oral isotretinoin daily. Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 296 patients will be accrued for this study.
