      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the use of pharmacological agents that inhibit bone
      resorption such as bisphosphonates, and sometimes calcitonin. Although bisphosphonates have
      been found to reduce osteoporosis, clinical use for these drugs has been limited because of
      its potential to produce serious side effects, such as mandibular osteonecrosis and atypical
      femoral fractures. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis are needed.

      This study will assess the effectiveness of the allogeneic mesenchymal cell from umbilical
      cord. Patients who have received mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSC) are expected to have
      positive effects such as reduced pain sensation in the back assessed by Visual Analog Scale
      (VAS), improvement in the range of motion (ROM), improving the quality of osteoporosis
      patients's bone proven by the results of Bone Mass Density (BMD) and improvement in patients'
      quality of life.
