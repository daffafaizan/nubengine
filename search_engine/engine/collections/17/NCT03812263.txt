    
      This is a pediatric non-randomized open-label Phase I/II clinical trial. The Phase I portion
      will include a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic
      gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral
      vector carrying the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe LAD-I. CD34+ cells will be transduced
      ex vivo with the therapeutic vector followed by cryopreservation. If the number of CD34+
      cells that are available for infusion is at least 2x10e6 total CD34+ cells/kg, subjects will
      undergo myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. Subjects will then receive
      infusion of gene-corrected hematopoietic cells approximately 24 hours following the final
      busulfan dose.

      The active agent is a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying the therapeutic ITGB2
      gene, encoding for the human CD18 receptor (Î²2 integrin subunit). The therapeutic product is
      the subject's autologous hematopoietic stem cells that have been transduced with the
      lentiviral vector.
