      altered, most commonly due to antibiotic use. Clostridium difficile is non-invasive and
      localized to the lumen of the colon. Once established, it produces 2 potent toxins, A and B.
      The principal reservoir for Clostridium difficile is the hospital environment, with the risk
      of acquiring Clostridium difficile increasing in direct proportion to the length of hospital
      stay.

      Patients with CDAD typically present with profuse watery or mucoid diarrhea and cramping
      abdominal pain. Additional symptoms include fever, nausea, anorexia, malaise, and bloody
      stool. More severe cases may be complicated by dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, ileus,
      and peritonitis. Systemic manifestations may include prerenal azotemia, sepsis syndrome, and
      toxic colitis. White blood cell counts (WBCs) also may be markedly elevated with a shift to
      immature forms. Extreme presentation of fulminant colitis may require a colectomy and even
      result in death. Symptoms of CDAD may begin a few days after initiation of antibiotic therapy
      or up to 8 weeks after its discontinuation.
