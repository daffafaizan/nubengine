      I. To find a safe and tolerable interleukin (IL)-12 (recombinant interleukin-12) dose for use
      in combination with cetuximab in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
      (Phase I) II. To determine the response rate to the combination of IL-12 and cetuximab.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the immunologic effects of IL-12 when administered in combination with
      cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of recombinant IL-12 followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1 and recombinant
      interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2 and 5 beginning in course 2. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving clinical response or stable disease may continue with therapy until
      disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
