      pituitary surgery) or who are newly diagnosed but are unsuitable for early surgery or wish to
      defer surgery. It will also include patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome (either occult, after
      surgery failure, or inoperable or metastatic) and patients with Cushing's syndrome from
      adrenal causes.

      The ability of metyrapone to normalize urinary free cortisol levels will be assessed during
      up to 36 weeks (9 months) of treatment. Patients participating in this study and who are
      controlled or close to the target at the end of a 3-months period may continue with an
      optional extension period of 6 months in which the long-term efficacy and safety profiles of
      metyrapone will be assessed. This extension study is intended to provide new findings to
      consolidate existing efficacy and safety data on metyrapone in the treatment of Cushing's
      syndrome.
