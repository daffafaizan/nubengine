      hematologic malignancies who planned to receive all oncology care at the Oncology Institute
      of Hope and Innovation from 11/1/2015 through 9/30/2016 were enrolled in the program. The
      program consisted of a 12-month telephonic program in which a lay health worker (LHW)
      supervised on-site by a registered nurse practitioner (RNP), assessed patient symptoms after
      diagnosis using the validated Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) with the frequency of
      symptom assessment varying based on patient risk. We evaluated feasibility, defined as
      monthly LHW documentation of symptom assessments, and change in patient-reported satisfaction
      and overall and emotional and mental health with validated assessments at enrollment and
      5-months post-enrollment among patients in the intervention. We compared healthcare use and
      costs to a historical cohort of similar Medicare Advantage enrollees diagnosed between
      11/1/2014-10/31/2015 (control). We assessed differences in demographic and clinical factors
      between the two groups using chi-square and t-tests and used generalized linear models to
      evaluate differences in healthcare use and costs.
