      evaluating the safety and tolerability of two doses of TRU-016 administered in combination
      with bendamustine to patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the
      randomized Phase 2 stage of the study, the efficacy and safety of the selected dose of 20
      mg/kg TRU-016 combined with bendamustine was compared to bendamustine alone. The
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TRU-016 and the development of antibodies to TRU-016
      were evaluated in both phases of the study.
