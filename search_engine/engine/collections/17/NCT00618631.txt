    
      Objective: To determine whether nicotine, at the dose delivered through a cigarette (1-2 mg),
      will increase the release of endogenous opioids, measured by the displacement of the
      mu-opioid PET receptor radioligand [(11)C]carfentanil and to determine whether smokers have
      adaptations in the opioid system compared with nonsmokers.

      Study Population: 20 current, daily smoikers and 20 never-smokers who have smoked between 1
      and 20 cigarettes in their lifetime.

      Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design.

      Outcome Measures: 1) displacement [(11)C]carfentanil binding, secondary to the release of
      endorphins by nicotine; 2) upregulation of [(11)C]carfentanil specific binding in smokers
      compared with nonsmokers; 3) [(11)C]carfentanil specific binding as a function of the
      mu-opioid receptor A118G polymorphism; and 4) correlation between self-report measures of
      nicotine effect and [(11)C]carfentanil binding profile.
