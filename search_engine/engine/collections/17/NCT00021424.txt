        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of recombinant
           fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral
           cavity or oropharynx or nodal or dermal metastases.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical activity of this regimen, in terms of inflammation at injection
           site(s) and disease regression or stabilization, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine (rF-TRI) intralesionally once on weeks 0,
      3, and 8. Beginning on week 16, patients may receive additional rF-TRI once every 8 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rF-TRI until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
