    
      The iATP PAS is a global, prospective, observational, multi-site registry study. Patients
      enrolled in the iATP PAS will be prospectively followed in the registry until registry
      closure, patient death, or patient exit from the registry (i.e., withdrawal of consent).

      Patient and device status will be assessed at least annually or as prompted by reportable
      adverse events. Remote device data transmissions are recommended to occur at least quarterly.
      Primary objective analysis will occur when 241 iATP-treated eligible ventricular episodes in
      the fast ventricular tachycardia (FVT) zone have been collected and reviewed by the study
      episode review committee (ERC). The total study duration is approximately 5 years.
