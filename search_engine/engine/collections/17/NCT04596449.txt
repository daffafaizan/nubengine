      directly involved in cognitive processes such as memory, language, reasoning, learning,
      intelligence, problem solvingâ€¦. Sleep deprivation affects most cognitive processes. More
      specifically, it is the sleep microstructure and in particular the sleep spindles that are
      specifically linked to memory, learning and cognitive abilities. Sleep spindles are
      grapho-elements that characterize NREM sleep. They exhibit high inter-individual stability
      and variability, depend on the genetic heritage and correlate with anatomical properties of
      the brain. Sleep spindles can therefore be considered as an electrophysiological
      "finger-print" as one of the most heritable traits of humans. Studies support the notion that
      sleep spindles are electrophysiological markers of high-level cognitive abilities. It remains
      to be seen whether the sleep spindles can predict interindividual variations in attention and
      executive functions.
