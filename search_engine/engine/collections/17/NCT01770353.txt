    
      This study is conducted over two phases.

      Pilot Phase: This study will enroll approximately 12 patients, up to 20 in total in the Pilot
      Phase and 30 patients in the Expansion Phase. The first three patients that are enrolled in
      the Pilot Phase can have any solid tumor type; however subsequent patients must have
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Colorectal cancer (CRC), Triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) positive breast cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or head
      and neck cancer. No more than three patients with ER/PR positive breast cancer can be
      enrolled in the Pilot Phase and similar restrictions may be placed on other tumor types to
      ensure a heterogeneous population.

      Expansion Phase: The expansion will enroll patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer
      into three cohorts of 10 patients each depending on sub-type of breast cancer:

      Cohort 1: ER and/or PR-positive breast cancer Cohort 2: TNBC Cohort 3: BC with active brain
      metastasis
