    
      This study in patients with mesenchymal or mixed epithelial mesenchymal tumors of the ovary
      or uterus is designed as a prospective single-arm, open - label, multicenter phase II study
      to evaluate the efficacy of PegLiposomal Doxorubicin and Carboplatin combination
      chemotherapy.

      40 patients will be recruited to receive PegLiposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) in a continuous i. v.
      infusion of at least 60 minutes at a dose of 40 mg/m2 on Day 1, followed by a 30-minute i. v.
      carboplatin infusion according to AUC 6 (formula devised by Calvert et al).

      Patients will get outpatients treatment. At screening the patients' eligibility will be
      assessed, their baseline and demographic characteristics obtained, and baseline values for
      the effect variables collected. Patients with measurable lesions, non-measurable lesions or
      histological documentation will be included into this trial. Measurable lesion and
      non-measurable lesions will be documented by x-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography or MRI.

      The patients' safety will be monitored during therapy until recovery of toxicities.

      In patients with measurable lesions at baseline, the (post)-treatment values for effect
      according to the RECIST criteria will be collected as shown in table 6. CR, PR and SD have to
      be confirmed by a repeat measurement after an interval of at least four weeks.

      Follow-up is scheduled every three months during the first two years after the end of
      treatment.

      As from year 3 the follow-up takes place outside the study in the context of general
      aftercare.
