      crucial in order to be able to follow the difficult airway algorithms.

      Studies have show a high failure rate when anesthesiologists rely on palpation.

      In this study Anesthesiologists get an e-learning course, get literature to study , and get a
      theoretical course and a hands-on course in using ultrasound for localizing the cricothyroid
      membrane. . Thereafter their ability to localize the cricothyroid membrane with either
      palpation or ultrasonography, in a randomised fashion, is tested.
