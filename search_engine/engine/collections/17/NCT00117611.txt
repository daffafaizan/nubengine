      the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects all age groups, including 17% of people above the
      age of 65 years. On the basis of national population surveys and insurance-reimbursement
      claims, sinusitis is one of the most common health problems in the U.S. Thus, each year,
      billions of dollars are spent on direct medical costs for the treatment of this enigmatic
      illness.

      Despite the enormous cost of the problem, there are no definite studies of treatment and
      management. There are some data indicating that intranasal steroids are effective, and
      recently Nasonex was approved for the treatment of nasal polyps. All other treatments are
      empirically based.

      There is evidence that IgE antibodies play a role in chronic sinusitis. The investigators
      have shown that total IgE levels correlate with the severity of sinusitis, as assessed by CT
      scan. Staphylococcus enterotoxins cause local increases in total IgE in over 50% of nasal
      polyp patients. Allergies occur more frequently in patients with chronic sinusitis than in
      the general population. Elevations in total IgE have been shown to occur in patients with
      allergic fungal sinusitis and the levels of total IgE decrease with successful treatment.
      Thus, the investigators speculate that IgE contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of
      chronic sinusitis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with the anti-IgE antibody, Xolair,
      will improve objective and subjective evidence of chronic sinusitis.
