      encountered, occurring in 2-6%. The substantial negative effect of CHTN on pregnancy includes
      a consistent 3- to 5-fold increase in superimposed preeclampsia and adverse perinatal
      outcomes (fetal or neonatal death, preterm birth -PTB, poor fetal growth and placental
      abruption) and possibly a 5- to10-fold increase in maternal cardiovascular and other
      complications (death, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary edema and acute renal failure).
      Mild CHTN (BP <160/110) contributes to a large proportion of these adverse outcomes. While
      antihypertensive treatment of CHTN is standard for the general population, it is uncertain
      whether treatment during pregnancy reduces maternal or fetal complications, and there are
      concerns that decreased arterial pressure may reduce fetal blood flow and cause poor fetal
      growth or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Some authorities, including the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Society of Hypertension (ASH)
      recommend withholding antihypertensive therapy for mild CHTN, particularly if BP is
      <160/105-110 mmHg. The recommendation to withhold antihypertensive treatment in pregnancy
      conflicts with the broader public health goal to reduce BP in those with CHTN and there is no
      evidence that discontinuing therapy during the brief period of pregnancy affects maternal
      outcomes (other than reducing the severe hypertension). For over a decade, authorities have
      consistently called for well-designed and powered trials to delineate the benefits and risks
      of pharmacologic therapy for CHTN during pregnancy.

      Therefore, our multicenter consortium proposes the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP)
      Project, a large pragmatic randomized trial with a primary aim to evaluate the benefits and
      harms of pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN in pregnancy.
