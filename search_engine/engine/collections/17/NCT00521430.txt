        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of non-T-cell depleted, HLA-haploidentical related
           donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a reduced-intensity conditioning
           regimen comprising busulfan, fludarabine phosphate, anti-thymocyte globulin, and
           methylprednisolone in patients with hematologic cancer, recurrent or metastatic solid
           tumors, or other diseases.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV 4 times daily on
           days -7 and -6; fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -2; and
           methylprednisolone IV over 30 minutes followed by anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4
           hours on days -4 to -1.

        -  Donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Patients receive donor peripheral blood
           stem cells IV over 1 hour on days 0 and 1.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2-4
           hours or orally twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 60, followed by
           a taper in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 2, 4, 7,
           and 12.

      After the transplant, patients are followed periodically.
