      complications after surgery and may affect elderly patients in particular. Prior studies
      found risk factors for POD and POCD which are present preoperatively, e.g. older age and
      pre-existing cognitive impairment. However, the preoperative risk of postoperative adverse
      cognitive outcomes (POD and POCD) is often not screened in routine clinical practice as it is
      time-consuming and requires trained personnel.

      In 2014, the application for tablet computers "Delirium Risk Profile" (DRP) was developed at
      the University Hospital Basel to assist preoperative screening in surgical patients. The
      application was later renamed CogCheck as the scope of the tool was extended to POD and POCD
      risk assessment.

      The aim of this study is to provide normative data for the application. Ultimately, the
      objective is to assist health care providers in the evaluation of patients' cognitive
      functions by routinely using the application in preoperative clinics.
