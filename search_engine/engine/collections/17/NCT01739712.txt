      functioning. Further, data support that individuals with diabetes have more sleep
      disturbances and compromised neurobehavioral functioning than individuals without diabetes.
      However, the joint impact of sleep and glucose on neurobehavioral functioning in youth with
      type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is not yet known. Therefore, our primary study aims are to: (1)
      determine the relative contributions of various sleep disturbances on glucose control in
      youth with T1DM; (2) examine the joint impact of glucose control and sleep disturbances on
      neurobehavioral outcomes in youth with T1DM; and (3) determine if increasing sleep duration
      relative to youth's typical schedules contributes to changes in glycemic control and
      neurobehavioral performance. These aims will be achieved by following 120 youth with T1DM
      ages 10 through 16 for six days of naturalistic sleep using polysomnography, actigraphy, and
      questionnaires to assess sleep; continuous glucose monitors and hemoglobin A1C values to
      assess glucose control; and standardized cognitive tasks and behavior rating scales to assess
      neurobehavioral functioning. Further, the proposed study is innovative in that it will extend
      existing research by moving from correlational findings to an experimental paradigm by
      randomizing youth with T1DM to either a Sleep Extension or Fixed Sleep Duration condition for
      an additional six days. Once our aims are achieved and a causal link is established, the
      proposed Sleep Extension intervention will advance knowledge about the role of sleep in
      diabetes management and provide a beneficial intervention to help youth with T1DM.
