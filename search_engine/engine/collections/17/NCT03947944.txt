      old, who visited Severance hospital and Eyereum eye clinic for SMILE surgery with myopic
      astigmatism. The participants who satisfies criteria, and who can be monitored at all times
      during each period of observation after surgery are included in the study.

      Methods: The subjects are randomly divided into two groups. One group underwent SMILE surgery
      using manifest refraction based planning, and the other group underwent SMILE surgery using
      vector planning. Before surgery, all patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological
      examination that included evaluation of logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)
      uncorrected-distance visual acuity (UDVA) and CDVA, manifest refraction, slit-lamp
      examination (Haag-Streit, KÃ¶niz, Switzerland), keratometry, and Scheimpflug-based corneal
      topography (Pentacam HR, Oculus). Dynamic corneal response (DCR) parameters were examined
      using Corvis ST. Corneal wavefront aberrations were measured using Keratron Scout (Optikon
      2000, Rome, Italy). All examinations were repeated at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery.
