      gastrointestinal malignancies among others. Though advances in treatment techniques have
      reduced treatment-associated morbidity and mortality, normal tissue toxicity still limits
      dose escalation and treatment tolerance. Over 50% of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic
      radiation therapy (RT) develop clinically meaningful toxicity. Pharmacologic strategies to
      reduce normal tissue damage represent a tremendous unmet need in RT. Investigators propose a
      novel application of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as a therapeutic to reduce incidence and
      severity of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity from RT. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty
      acids with fewer than six carbon atoms ingested or formed during bacterial fermentation of
      partially- and non-digestible polysaccharides carbohydrates. Patients who are enrolled will
      be randomized to receive SCFA supplements or a placebo, and will start taking it everyday one
      week prior to starting RT through 1 week after completing RT. Patients will keep a log of
      daily administration during the entire time while taking the study drug, and will complete
      patient reported outcomes (PROs) involving toxicities starting at baseline through 3 months
      post RT. The patient's treating physician will also complete an assessment of the patients
      toxicities starting at the baseline through follow up visits up to 5 years post RT, which
      will be used to compare to the PROs.
