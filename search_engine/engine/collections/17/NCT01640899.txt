      activities, causes a negative effect on productivity and increased costs for social
      insurance. This pain is often the outcome of structural deformities or work-related foot pain
      often occurs in workers whose occupations include standing or walking for a long time.

      One of the most common reasons for prescribing insoles is to enhance functioning by reducing
      nonspecific pain in the foot, leg or low back pain. Reduction of pain is expected to improve
      quality of life in daily activities such as work and recreational activities.

      Persons actual use of the insoles, is a prerequisite for any effect it may have. It can be
      hypothesized that the use of the insoles is related to what the user thinks about their
      comfort, appearance, the amount of foot perspiration they induce, and other factors.
