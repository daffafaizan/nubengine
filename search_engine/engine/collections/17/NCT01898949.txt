      Phase 1: baseline testing. This phase takes place at the beginning of the study to establish
      several physical, physiological and metabolic studies and includes measures of height,
      weight, body composition, sedentary and resting metabolic rate in a metabolic chamber as well
      as your metabolic and cardiac responses to cold.

      Phase 2: cold exposure (treatment) phase. This phase is initiated immediately after phase 1
      and will last 4 weeks. Each work day (Monday to Friday) subjects will have to spend 20
      minutes in a cold room wearing light clothes.

      Phase 3: post-treatment testing. The same physiological and metabolic studies measured at
      baseline will be repeated over 3 days.
