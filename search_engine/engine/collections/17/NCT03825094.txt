      angiography and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.
      Patients with chronic kidney disease have greater odds of developing CI-AKI. Guidelines for
      CI-AKI prevention include screening for risk, volume expansion, and minimizing contrast media
      volume (CMV) to the patient during angiography; however, hospitals face barriers to
      implementation in the real-world setting and therefore consistent care delivery for at-risk
      patients remains a modern clinical challenge. DyeVert Systems provide real-time CMV
      monitoring and minimization during angiography procedures thereby reducing total CMV to the
      patient and total CMV relative to baseline renal function, two known risk factors for CI-AKI.
      The DyeMINISH Registry is designed to evaluate ongoing real-world clinical performance and
      safety of commercially available DyeVert Systems among a large, real-world population of
      patients undergoing coronary and peripheral angiography.
