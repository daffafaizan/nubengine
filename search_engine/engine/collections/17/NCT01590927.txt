      standing and supine position with 3 repetitions. The TrakSTARTM, Ultrasound, surface EMG and
      Accelerometer will measure the PFM movements and activation simultaneously. The Ultrasound is
      measured from one tester (to guaranty a high intratester reliability) (Sherburn et al.,
      2005).

      TrakSTARTM, surface EMG and Accelerometer will measure 3 Trampoline jumps. The measurements
      will be done once during one hour. The women will insert the vaginal probe by themselves and
      stay dressed during the measurement procedure. The measurements will be done in a
      standardized way. All the arrangements are made to ensure the hygiene requirements.
