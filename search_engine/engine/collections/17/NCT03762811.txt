    
      NanoFUSE® is indicated to be placed into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are
      not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure (i.e. the posterolateral spine and
      pelvis). These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created
      from traumatic injury to bone. NanoFUSE® must be used with autograft as a bone graft extender
      in the posterolateral spine and pelvis. This product provides a bone graft substitute that
      remodels into the recipient's skeletal system.
