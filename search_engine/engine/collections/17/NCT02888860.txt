      The CIC will be determined on admission and then once a week during hospitalisation. This
      will be carried out on a fixed day for all patients; we will avoid determining the CIC any
      closer than 2 days apart. It is not planned in this study to modify the therapeutic strategy
      of the ICU services. The strains isolated will be stored in glycerol solution at -80Â°C. The
      specimens for genetic and serological analysis will be stored centrally in a local mycology
      laboratory.

      Genotyping of lectin genes and TLRs:

      Two tubes containing 6 ml of blood in EDTA will be taken from each patient for extraction of
      DNA

      Serological study, detection of antibodies to yeast glycans:

      10 ml of whole blood will be taken from each patient on the day of inclusion and over the
      duration of hospitalisation (maximum total quantity of 40 ml). This will be done on a fixed
      day for all patients; we will avoid sampling any closer than 2 days apart.

      Functional tests on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) Taking into account the fact
      that the results of genotyping will not be available in real time and the need to work with
      freshly collected cells, a group size of 50 patients in group 2 (negative CIC over the
      duration of hospitalisation) and 50 patients in group 3 (negative CIC at admission but
      positive at hospital discharge) will be analysed.

      Stimulation tests will be carried out in the presence of whole yeasts or yeast extracts on
      sub-populations of cells isolated from 20 ml of peripheral blood in EDTA.
