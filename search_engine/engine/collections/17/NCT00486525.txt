      Primary

        -  To determine if the yoga intervention will decrease inflammation, fatigue, and
           depressive symptoms relative to the waiting-list controls in women who are stage 0-IIIa
           breast cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to stage of cancer (stage 0 vs stage I vs stage II
      and stage IIIA) and prior radiation therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (waiting-list control): Patients are encouraged to perform usual activities, but
           asked to refrain from any yoga practice or other related activities. After a six-month
           observation period, patients undergo yoga intervention as described in arm II .

        -  Arm II (yoga intervention): Patients participate in a Hatha yoga intervention session
           comprising body postures and breath control techniques for 1.5 hours twice a week for 12
           weeks. Patients are encouraged to practice Hatha yoga at home. Patients complete daily
           diaries on home Hatha yoga practices and submit them at each session.
