      COPD patients and assess the potential for these physiological parameters as a novel
      phenotyping method using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe
      gas.

      The study will additionally quantify regional ventilation and gas transfer response to
      glycopyrrolate/formoterol in GOLD II and III COPD patients.
