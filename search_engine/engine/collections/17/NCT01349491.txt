      associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although a rhythm control
      strategy offers no survival benefit over a rate control strategy, elective electrical
      cardioversion is still recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability for
      symptomatic relief. However, recurrences are frequent after cardioversion and antiarrhythmic
      medications are required to maintain sinus rhythm. Nonetheless, the use of antiarrhythmic
      medications is problematic because of the risk of serious potential adverse effects,
      including drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias.

      Ranolazine is a novel antianginal agent, which inhibits the late inward sodium current and
      produces antiischemic effects without reducing heart rate or blood pressure. Additionally,
      recent preclinical as well as preliminary clinical data suggest that ranolazine exhibits
      distinct antiarrhythmic properties. However, there is no controlled data for the use of
      ranolazine to prevent recurrence of AF after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF.

      The investigators hypothesize that ranolazine would decrease the incidence of recurrence of
      AF after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. Patients with persistent AF who are
      candidates for electrical cardioversion will be randomized to either placebo or ranolazine
      after successful electrical cardioversion. They will be followed at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6
      months for clinical evaluation and electrocardiography for the detection of recurrence of AF.
