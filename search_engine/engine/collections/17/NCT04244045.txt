    
      Forty five university undergraduate female students volunteered to participate in the study,
      age = 18-25 years old, body mass index 18-25 kg/cm square.

      All subjects were free from injury or disease expected to affect hamstring length or ability
      to perform the exercises Design of the study was single-blind randomized clinical trial. The
      subjects were randomly assigned in to one of the three methods of treatment, which are group
      1 (study group1): suboccipital muscle inhibition plus passive stretch of hamstring muscle,
      Group II: ( Study groupII): received neural slump test position plus passive stretch of
      hamstring muscle, Group III (control group): received only passive stretch of hamstring
      muscle.

      Treatment Procedures:

      Passive stretching of hamstring muscle:

      Patient in comfortable supine lying position and therapist stride standing beside the
      dominant side of the patient. The patient was asked to flex his hip joint with complete knee
      extension and ankle in neutral position. The therapist stretches the hamstring of the
      dominant side; distal hand of the therapist on planter surface of foot for dorsiflexion to
      increase flexibility of hamstring muscle and proximal hand on the knee to increase the length
      of the muscle, maintain this stretching for 60 seconds then relax (8)

      Sub occipital muscle inhibition:

      The Patient is in comfortable supine lying position with eye closed - for more relaxation-
      and the head out of the bed resting on therapist hand to manipulate the sub occipital area.
      The therapist stretch the sub occipital, flexes the head of the patient to get the chin to
      the manibiurim sternii, maintaining this position for 60seconds then relax (9)

      Neural dynamic slump stretch:

      Patient in comfortable short sitting position at the edge of the bed with the trunk in an
      millitary straight position then ask the patient to slump the flex his neck and street the
      knee joint in complete extension the at the end of the procedure do active dorsiflexion at
      the tested foot .(10)
