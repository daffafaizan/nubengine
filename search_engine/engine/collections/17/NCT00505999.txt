      In this study, researchers are trying to learn about factors that may be associated with MM.

      For this study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire asks
      questions about your demographics (for example, age and sex), any chemicals you may have been
      exposed to, your medical history, family history of cancer, your diet, and your history of
      smoking and/or alcohol use. It should take around 30-40 minutes to complete the
      questionnaire.

      Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. You will spit into a collection container in
      order to provide a sample of your saliva. The blood and saliva samples will be used for
      special tests to look for any biological factors associated with MM.

      If you live in Houston or the surrounding area, study personnel can arrange to collect the
      samples at the time and place of your convenience. If you do not live in the Houston area,
      sample collection instructions and supplies will be mailed to you. The blood sample may be
      drawn at your doctor's office, or at a clinic or hospital of your choice. All mailing costs
      will be paid by the study. No travel to M. D. Anderson will be required.

      You will be considered off-study after the data that is collected has been processed.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 500 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
