        -  To assess if full doses of enzastaurin hydrochloride and temozolomide can be used in
           combination for the treatment of patients with primary gliomas.

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride once or twice daily on days 1-28* and oral
      temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *During the first course only, patients also receive enzastaurin hydrochloride on day
      -1.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection on day 22 of course 1 and on day 5 of course 2 for
      pharmacokinetic studies of enzastaurin hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
