      variety of refractory and recurrent tumor patients. The latest research shows that it is not
      all cancer patients would respond to Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs. At present, immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) is still a common method to screen patients that will benefit from this therapy by
      detecting the expression level of PD-1 and PD-L1. However, the results of IHC were not very
      exact because of limitations of IHC such as the heterogeneity of expression, the influence of
      host cell PD-L1 expression and the changes in the course of the disease. Moreover, the tumor
      tissue used in IHC must obtained through the invasive method. It is difficult to dynamically
      monitor the expression level of PD-1 / PD-L1 during the treatment. Immuno-PET molecular
      imaging By radiolabeling Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs with radionuclides can be used to noninvasive
      assessment of biodistribution of monoclonal antibodies and provide a new strategy for patient
      screening.

      In this study, 18F-WL12 or 68Ga-WL12 PET / CT imaging will be performed in patients with
      solid tumors to access the potential of 18F-WL12 or 68Ga-WL12PET / CT to screen patients who
      can benefit from JS001 treatment.
