      I. Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with persistent or recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
