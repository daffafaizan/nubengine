    
      A randomized prospective study of patients with HC-BPPV. Patients with apogeotropic type of
      HC-BPPV were randomized to one of each three treatment groups at their first clinic visit.
      These groups included the Gufoni maneuver, head-shaking maneuver, and sham group in
      apogeotropic HC-BPPV. Responsiveness of treatment maneuver was determined by positioning
      maneuver immediately after each treatment method based on resolves of vertigo and positional
      nystagmus.
