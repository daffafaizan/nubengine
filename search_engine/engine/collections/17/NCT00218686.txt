      suggesting that peer educator programs can have significant effects on the risk-related
      behaviors of both the educators and the peers whom they educate. Specifically, through group
      and individual focused sessions, participants learn and practice skills designed to reduce
      drug and sex related risk behaviors. Furthermore, individuals and their main risk partners
      attend a training session that focuses on risk reduction within their relationship.
