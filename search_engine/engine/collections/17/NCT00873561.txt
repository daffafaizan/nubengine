      placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses
      of an altered peptide ligand, NBI-6024, in adult (18 to 35 years of age) and adolescent (10
      to 17 years of age) patients with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      Study drug was administered subcutaneously a total of 26 times over a 24-month period. The
      first three doses were administered every 2 weeks (induction phase); all subsequent dosing
      occurred monthly (maintenance phase). Patients returned to the study center to receive study
      drug and have efficacy and safety assessments collected. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      the 2-hour peak C-peptide at Month 24. Other secondary analyses included AUC C-peptide,
      prescribed insulin usage, AUC blood glucose, HbA1c, hypoglycemic events, and hyperglycemic
      events.
