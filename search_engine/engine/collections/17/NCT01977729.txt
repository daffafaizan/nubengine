      adaptive treatment' approach for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. All youth
      patients in this two site study will first receive CBT and all then will be re-assessed at
      mid-treatment (8 sessions). Patients who show a partial response or no response following 8
      sessions of CBT will be randomized to either a switch to SRT alone or CBT augmentation with
      SRT.
