      undergoing FET in reproductive medicine renter of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital will be
      recruited who should not be elder than 40 and had more than 3 frozen embryos. They will be
      randomized to receive either the OI-FET cycle (group OI-A) or the HRT-FET cycle (group
      HRT-B). In group OI-A, the follicular development is supported by Letrozole(LE) 2.5mg,once
      daily,is introduced on cycle day 3 .And on cycle day 10 , a Vagina ultrasound is introduced
      to monitor the development of the follicular ,following by intramuscular gonadotrophin
      37.5~75 IU/d until there is a Luteinizing Hormone(LH) surge or ovulation .On the day
      appearing Luteinizing Hormone surgeï¼Œpatient is always introduced intramuscular human
      chorionic gonadotrophin(HCG) 10000 IU.If there is sill no Luteinizing Hormone surge when the
      follicle is 20-24mm ,the ovulation will be induced by HCG.Then the luteum is supported by HCG
      2000-2500 IU/3d.Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 3 days after ovulation is
      observed. In group HRT-B, oral estradiol, 2 mg, once daily, is introduced on cycle day 3 with
      an increasing doses protocol. If the endometrial thickness is greater than 7mm, progesterone
      40-60 mg in oil will be administered via intramuscular injection. Transfer of thawed embryos
      will be performed 3 days later.
