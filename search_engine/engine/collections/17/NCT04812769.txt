      embedded pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (ePCT) to reduce the duration of
      antibiotic therapy and number of antibiotic prescriptions among nursing home residents with
      AD/ADRD. With the support of three independently owned and operated nursing homes that are
      unaffiliated with an academic medical center, we have developed the multicomponent
      intervention, eCARE-ID (Electronic Consultation for AD/ADRD Residents Experiencing Infectious
      Diseases). eCARE-ID consists of three components: 1) Tele-ID video clinical consultation
      services for nursing home residents; 2) electronic consultation (e-consultation) services for
      healthcare personnel at participating nursing homes; and 3) Tele-ID video antibiotic
      stewardship services for healthcare personnel including pharmacists at participating nursing
      homes.
