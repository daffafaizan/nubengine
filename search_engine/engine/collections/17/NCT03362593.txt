    
      MEDI7219 is being developed for the potential treatment of type 2 diabetes. The study is a
      first in human, single and multiple ascending dose study that will try to identify the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of MEDI7219.
      The study will also look at the impact of changes to the formulation as well as differences
      related to the route of administration. The study will consist of 6 parts involving
      approximately 198 healthy male and female subjects (and up to 146 additional subjects). In
      Part A, 6 cohorts of 10 subjects each (with an optional 2 cohorts) will be randomized to
      receive MEDI7219 or one of two placebos. Each cohort will receive a different formulation of
      the study drug. In part B, a single cohort of 16 subjects (with an optional second cohort)
      will receive a different formulation of MEDI7219 per period in up to 5 periods. In Part C, up
      to 12 subjects will be dosed with MEDI7219. In Part D, one cohort of 30 subjects (with an
      optional second cohort) will be randomized to receive MEDI7219 or placebo. Subjects will
      start on a dose based on data from previous parts and will receive ascending doses for 35
      days. In Part E, 2 cohorts of 6 subjects each (with an optional third & fourth cohort of 12
      subjects each) will receive a different formulation of MEDI7219 per period. Part E, cohort 5
      12 subjects each period (2 periods) has been added to assess 2 different formulations In Part
      F, two cohorts of 16 subjects each will be randomized to receive MEDI7219 or placebo.
      Subjects will start on a dose based on data from previous parts and will receive ascending
      doses for 35 days.
