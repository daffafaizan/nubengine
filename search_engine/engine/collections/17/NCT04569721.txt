      million adults worldwide. The incidence of T2D is increasing in most countries and it is
      predicted that by the year 2045, 629 million adults will be diagnosed with T2D worldwide.
      Chronically elevated sympathetic activity has been shown to contribute to the development of
      metabolic syndrome and T2D. Overweight/obese individuals demonstrate elevated noradrenaline
      and metabolite levels relative to lean healthy individuals - this is particularly concerning
      since long term prospective studies have shown that noradrenaline levels predict future risk
      of T2D. Furthermore, dysfunctional sympathetic response to glucose loads is demonstrated
      amongst those with T2D compared to pre-diabetes. Since the greater splanchnic nerve is the
      main source of sympathetic input to the viscera, the researchers postulate that denervation
      of the splanchnic nerve would lead to decreased sympathetic tone, thereby improving glycemic
      control in patients with T2D. To the researchers' knowledge, this would be the first study to
      evaluate the role of splanchnic cryoablation as a potential therapeutic for T2D and insulin
      resistance.
