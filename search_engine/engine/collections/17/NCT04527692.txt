    
      An information letter will be distributed to the children and parents and their non
      opposition to their participation will be sought (or assent for the child via a written
      document adapted to the age) will be systematically requested.

      Several instruments will be used by the members of the paediatric teams during their routine
      home or hospital visits to children and their families: the CPOS (Downing 2018), the KINDL
      (generic questionnaire on quality of life validated for healthy children, Erhart et al.
      2009), the QOLLTI-F v.2 (questionnaire on quality of life for parents, Cohen 2007, 2015).

      The interviews will therefore be semi-directed interviews with children/adolescents and their
      parents who have agreed to participate in the study. The interviews will be conducted by the
      care teams themselves. In addition to the CPOS, KINDL and QOOLTI-F, socio-demographic data
      are collected.
