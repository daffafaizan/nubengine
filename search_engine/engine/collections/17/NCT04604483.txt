      received topical treatment and stool softeners and have all been evaluated by experienced
      proctological surgeons. The treatment will be given for 10 consecutive work days and then
      evaluated at 3 and 12 months. If the patients symptoms are unimproved at 3 months alternative
      treatments will be offered.
