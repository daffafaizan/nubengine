    
      a prospective study of 30 patients suffering from IBD referred from tropical department from
      Tanta University Hospital

      -Patients demographic data e.g., sex, age, concomitant systemic diseases will be recruited.
      Presenting symptoms, physical examination results, laboratory and imaging findings, and
      received treatment of IBD will be recorded. Accurate grading of disease severity will be
      carried out by gastroenterology specialist.

      All patients will be subject to Full ophthalmologic examination and fundus imaging. Imaging
      will include OCTA and fundus photography. OCTA will be performed using cirrus OCT (Zeiss,
      Inc., USA). High-quality 6 x 6 mm OCTA macular scans and 3 × 3-mm papillary scan with strong
      signal-noise ratio and adequate centration on the fovea and optic nerve head respectively
      will be selected. Segmentation will be used to evaluate superﬁcial and deep capillary retinal
      plexus projections in addition to the choriocapillaries. If errors in segmentation were
      detected, manual correction would be performed. The superﬁcial retinal capillary plexus (SCP)
      will be delineated with an inner boundary at the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and an
      outer boundary 10 µm inside the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The deep retinal capillary
      plexus (DCP) will be segmented with an inner boundary 10 µm inside the IPL and an outer
      boundary at 10 µm beneath the outer plexiform layer (OPL).

      The vessel density metric from enface OCT angiogram will be used as an indicator of macular
      retinal and papillary perfusion. Vessel density (VD) analysis computes the percentage of area
      occupied by OCTA detected vasculature in a measured area. Choriocapillaries flow voids will
      be computed to assess choriocapillaries circulation
