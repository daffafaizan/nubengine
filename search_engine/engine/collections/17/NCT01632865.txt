      of intracranial veterbrobasilar occlusion. Acute veterbrobasilar artery occlusion is a
      devastating disease with high mortality without successful treatment. A subset of patients
      can survive the acute phase and develop subacute or chronic veterbrobasilar artery occlusion.
      Due to the adequacy of collaterals, some patients can live without any or just very mild
      symptoms. On the contrast, lack of enough collaterals, another patients still presented with
      recurrent ischemic events and progressive disability despite intensive medical therapy.
      Prognosis is extremely poor. It is in this cohort that subacute or chronic revascularization
      is often considered. The optimal treatment in this cohort with non-acute veterbrobasilar
      artery occlusion is unknown, and there is little literature to guide therapy.
      Extracranial-intracranial bypass may revascularize the intracranial artery occlusion.
      However, bypass procedures are technically challenging and are associated with significant
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Recurrent ischemic symptoms despite best medical treatment
      be indication for endovascular revascularization and stent remodeling. This study was to
      evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and treatment effects of recanalization and
      stenting for veterbrobasilar subacute-chronic intracranial artery occlusionã€‚
