      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation (bovine lactoferrin supplement) on
      self-reported taste and smell disturbances in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation
      byproducts in saliva in cancer patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive
      substances (TBARs) assay.

      II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of cancer patients to
      generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron-containing
      solution.

      III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of
      life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in cancer patients with
      established chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances.

      IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients with chemotherapy
      induced taste changes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bovine lactoferrin supplement orally (PO) three times daily (TID) for 1
      month.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and 1 month.
