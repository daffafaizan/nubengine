      interstitial fluid glucose levels in patients ages 18 and older with insulin dependent
      diabetes mellitus for the purpose of improving diabetes management. The System is intended
      for use by patients at home and in health care facilities.

      The FiberSense system is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not
      replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices.

      The FiberSense system aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia,
      facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these
      excursions.
