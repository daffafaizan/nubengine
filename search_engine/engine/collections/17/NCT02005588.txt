      treatment of iron deficiency anemia with pregnancy. a total of 300 pregnant women will be
      randomly divided into two equal groups (each containing 150 pregnant woman). one group will
      receive amino acid chelated iron and the other group will receive iron salt (ferrous
      fumarate). All pregnant women attending the obstetrics outpatient clinic of kasr al aini
      hospital at 14-18 weeks gestation will be submitted to complete blood picture and serum
      ferritin. those who prove to have iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin less than 11g/dl and
      serum ferritin less than 12ug/l) will be included in the study. All eligible women will be
      followed up at 22-23, 29-30 and 36-37 weeks' gestation for the change in hemoglobin level and
      ferritin level. all women will be also enquired about different side effects during treatment
