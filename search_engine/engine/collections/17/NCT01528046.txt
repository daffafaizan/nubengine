      (AMPK). Recent data from in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as epidemiologic
      retrospective analyses, suggest that metformin has anti-cancer activity. Vincristine,
      irinotecan, and temozolomide (VIT) is a combination of chemotherapeutic agents that have
      different mechanisms of action as well as disparate side effect profiles. Two recent phase 1
      trials have demonstrated that this regimen is safe and well-tolerated in children with
      relapsed and refractory solid tumors.
