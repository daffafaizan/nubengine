      bronchopathies seems to decrease re-intubation rate.

      High Flow Oxygen, thanks to its properties (oxygen, humidification and heat with high flow)
      could be useful in this population in ventilatory weaning. Compared to oxygen conventional
      therapy with high-concentration mask, High Flow Oxygen seems to be as efficient and better
      tolerated . A recent study shows that High Flow Oxygen is non-inferior to Non Invasive
      Ventilation in post-extubation in patient with high risk of re-intubation.

      Furthermore, oxygenation in post-extubation should be optimized to avoid hypoxemia and
      hypercapnia in this patient at risk of hypoventilation.
