    
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heart disease characterized by hypertrophy of the left
      ventricular myocardium and is most often caused by mutations in sarcomere genes. The
      structural and functional abnormalities cannot be explained by flow-limiting coronary artery
      disease or loading conditions. The disease affects at least 0,2% of the population worldwide
      and is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young people and competitive
      athletes due to fatal ventricular arrhythmia, but in most patients, however, HCM has a benign
      course. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to properly evaluate patients and identify
      those who would benefit from a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.

      This study assesses the accuracy of the HCM SCD-Risk Calculator, recommended by European
      Society of Cardiology guidelines, in patients treated in the Ist Department of Cardiology of
      Poznan University of Medical Sciences from 2005 to 2018.

      The study group consisted of 252 patients aged 20-88 (mean 53,8 Â± 15,1, median 54); 49,6%
      were men. The protocol consisted of medical history collection (including a questionnaire),
      physical examination and additional tests such as echocardiography with the assessment of
      global longitudinal strain and average strain, cardiac magnetic resonance, ambulatory ECG
      monitoring, control of implantable devices and exercise testing.
