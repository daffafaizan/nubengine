      laboratory test errors. Among preanalytical errors, hemolysis is the most frequent error of
      sample rejection. Recollection of blood from the patient causes extra suffering, increased
      turn-around-time hence delayed treatment, and unnecessary extra costs for the health care
      system.

      Here is a novel method for hemolysis point of care detection (H-POCT) evaluated. The single
      use test is attached to the blood sample in direct conjunction to the sampling process.

      Patients will be selected by consecutive selection at the emergency department if blood tests
      ordered by the physician meet the inclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized into one of
      two groups. All health care professionals participating in this study has attended in a
      standard education program in operating H-POCT.

      If Allocated into the control group, n: 750, nurses and enrolled nurses will perform blood
      sample according to routine.

      If allocated into the intervention group, n: 750, nurses and enrolled nurses will perform
      blood sample according to routine and screen all Lithium Heparin vacuum tubes. (for one or
      all of the analyzes: Liver status, Electrolytes and Troponin T.)

      If the hemolysis point of care test (H-poct) indicate a positive test result the Lithium
      Heparin vacuum tube and the attached H-poct will be discarded and a new sample will be
      collected and screened for hemolysis until the user receives a negative sample that is not
      hemolyzed.

      This study takes place in a county hospital with 430 beds and the emergency department treats
      59000 patients yearly.
