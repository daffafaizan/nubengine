      room in the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC). Individuals will drive in the
      car as if they are driving in real life and the whole experience is like playing a car video
      game with a big animated screen. The driving results will be compared to similar aged
      patients who don't have CMT 1A and have also taken the driving test. If patients with CMT 1A
      do have driving difficulties compared to those who do not have CMT 1A, the results of the
      study will try to help patients with CMT1A drive better by ultimately creating devices that
      might help them use the steering wheel or brake pedal in a safer way.
