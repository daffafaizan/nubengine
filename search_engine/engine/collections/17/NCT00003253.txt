      resistance to paclitaxel using the Extreme Drug Resistance (EDR) Assay in patients with
      previously treated metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess response to paclitaxel therapy in
      patients who have undergone a pretreatment EDR assay. III. Assess time to tumor progression
      during paclitaxel therapy in patients who have undergone a pretreatment EDR assay. IV.
      Determine prospectively the predictive value of the EDR assay relative to clinical outcome by
      correlating assay results with clinical tumor response and time to tumor progression during
      paclitaxel therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, blinded study. Patients' tumor tissue samples are
      collected by excisional biopsy, core biopsy, or malignant fluid aspiration, then tested by
      the Extreme Drug Resistance (EDR) Assay to determine probability of drug resistance to
      paclitaxel. After successful completion of the EDR assay (approximately 7 days), patients
      receive paclitaxel by intravenous infusion over 1-3 hours; treatment is repeated every 3
      weeks. Treatment continues until there is documented evidence of tumor progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients' clinical response to paclitaxel therapy is compared with the
      response predicted by the EDR assay.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 100 patients will be accrued to this study.
