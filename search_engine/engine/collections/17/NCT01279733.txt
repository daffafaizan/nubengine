    
      Specifically, the aims are as follows:

        1. Demonstrate the performance of microarray analysis as a clinical method for prenatal
           cytogenetic diagnosis with regard to:

             1. Accuracy in the detection of the common autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploid
                (trisomies, 13,18,21, 45,X, 47,XXY, etc.)

             2. Ability of microarray to diagnose less common, but clinically significant,
                cytogenetic aneusomies (e.g. DiGeorge, Williams, Smith- Magenis, Prader-Willi
                syndrome, etc.) currently not detected by conventional karyotype.

             3. Evaluation of the utility of microarray in specific clinical scenarios such as
                ultrasound detection of congenital anomalies and fetal growth disorders.

        2. Evaluate the appropriate construction of prenatal diagnostic microarray devices to allow
           maximal detection of clinically relevant information with minimal detection of
           unexpected and difficult to interpret findings which have no clinical significance but
           might provoke patient anxiety.

        3. Evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using microarrays as a primary
           prenatal diagnostic tool.

        4. Evaluate approaches to integrate microarray into clinical prenatal cytogenetic
           diagnostic practice.

        5. Develop a prenatal diagnostic tissue repository (TDR) to facilitate the further
           development of microarray technology. This will be used to investigate the molecular
           etiologies of specific fetal anomalies and to test newer technologies, such as higher
           resolution microarrays.
