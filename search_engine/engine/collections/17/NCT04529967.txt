    
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition resulting in high levels of
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased risk of premature coronary artery
      disease in men and women. Child-parent screening for familial hypercholesterolemia has been
      proposed to identify persons who are carriers of FH mutations and with high risk for
      inherited premature coronary artery disease. The investigators will conduct a cross-sectional
      community-based screening in children of 2 years old to detect FH children cases using finger
      blood TC test first and followed by serum TC test and mutation test, and to identify and
      diagnose their affected parents. This study aims to established the Child-parent screening
      program and technique issues for early diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia families
      for future early intervention.

      Child-parent screening strategy in our study consists three steps: i. Apillary blood total
      cholesterol test of children aged around 2 years; ii. re-test for children with
      cholesterol>95th percentile in the first step; iii. WES (whole exome sequencing) test for
      >P99 in the first two steps. iV: TC test and mutation test to the parents of the child FH
      cases. The investigators will determine FH families based on the program. Children's Hospital
      of Fudan University will provide treatment further.
