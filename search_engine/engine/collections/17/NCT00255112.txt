      Recent research indicates that anxiety disorders in childhood and in particular Separation
      Anxiety Disorder (SAD) increase the risk of mental disorders in adulthood. Despite these
      results research on SAD is still limited compared to the vast research activity on adult
      anxiety disorders. The proposed research program will close a gap of current international
      research: It will test the efficacy of a family based cognitive behavioral treatment program
      specific for SAD.

      The research program consists of two parts. One study is aimed at children with SAD aged 5 to
      7. 40 children are randomly allocated immediately to SAD-specific family-based treatment or
      to a wait list. For the second study 60 children with SAD (8 to 13 years old) are randomly
      allocated to either SAD-specific family-based treatment ("SAD-CBT") or a well established
      global CBT program for childhood anxiety disorders ("global CBT").

      In both studies treatment success is tested at the end of treatment as well as 4 weeks and 1,
      2 and 3 years after treatment.
