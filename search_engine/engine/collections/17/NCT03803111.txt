      is recommended. In iron-deficient HFrEF patients iron supplementation by ferric
      carboxymaltose (FCM) is recommended. Both treatment options (ET and iron supplementation)
      affect oxidative metabolism.

      In this study iron-deficient HFrEF patients are included and randomly assigned to two study
      arms:

      Study arm A: Intravenous iron supplementation with FCM, subsequent (after 2 months) ET
      program.

      Study arm B: ET program, subsequent (after 2 months) intravenous iron supplementation with
      FCM.

      Primary study endpoint is exercise capacity (Peak VO2). Secondary endpoints are 6-minute
      walking distance, NYHA class, echocardiographic parameters and the combined endpoint
      cardiovascular hospitalizations and death.
