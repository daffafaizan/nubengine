    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of antibiotic treatment versus placebo after
      incision and drainage of skin and soft tissue abscesses less than 5 cm in pediatric patients.
      Eligible patients whose parents/guardians consented them to enrollment were randomized to
      receive one of two interventions: oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or placebo
      after incision and drainage. Every attempt was made to make the placebo capsules and
      suspensions appear in all aspects like the true drug (was done by the investigational
      pharmacy department at our institution). Equal numbers of subjects were randomized at the
      outset to both study groups. Randomization, also done by our investigational pharmacy
      department, was done in blocks of 20. Patients were followed up in our emergency center at 24
      to 48 hours to have any packing removed and to have their clinical/wound status assessed.
      They were not charged for this visit, and their valet parking was validated. If an individual
      patient, or an individual patient's wound, was felt to be not improving adequately, that
      patient was started on formal antibiotic therapy at the treating attending physician's
      discretion.

      Primary outcome:

      1. Abscess resolution by parental report 7-10 days after incision and drainage

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. Admission to the hospital because of worsening infection

        2. Receipt of antibiotics (placebo arm) or change in antibiotics (antibiotic arm)
