      during one year period will be screened for possible inclusion in this study. In this
      prospective observational study, demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients
      who fulfill inclusion criteria will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done
      for patient management routinely. ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and
      Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
      score will also be recorded. ICU survivors will be followed up in their routine ICU follow up
      clinic visits.

      Sample size was estimated at 10% incidence rate of reactive thrombocytes, two sided 95%
      confidence interval and 4.5% margin of error of the incidence rate, sample size came out to
      be 171. Finally in this study investigators have targeted to include at least 180
      participants. Sample size was estimated using software power analysis and sample size, 2008
      (PASS-8).
