      recurrence after surgical removal of the tumor mass. The standard Whole-brain radiotherapy
      (WBRT) demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence without improving survival. At the same
      time WBRT have substantial acute and late toxicity. Preliminary experiences with Stereotactic
      radiosurgery or hypofractionated radiotherapy of the resection cavity indicate promising
      local control and good tolerance. This attitude was only partially explored in prospective
      trials. In this research patients with limited number of brain metastases and controlled
      systemic disease will be treated, with such a stereotactic irradiation, at the same time with
      evaluation of the local control (Primary endpoint) by repeated MRI and of quality of life,
      neurologic functionning (with a battery of thsts, e.g. MMSE, QLQ-C30, EORTC BN-20) as well as
      overall survival as secondary endpoints.
