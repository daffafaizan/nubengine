    
      Male and female ambulant patients complaining of a sore throat caused by acute viral
      pharyngitis. Every patient may be included in the trial only once. A total of 250 male and
      female ambulant patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years will be enrolled. Approximately
      8 centers will be recruited each enrolling approximately 30-32 patients.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The two-sided test hypothesis, that the results of the active treatment group with 20 mg
      Ambroxol and the placebo group do not differ with regard to the primary endpoint (null
      hypothesis (H0) will be tested against the alternative (H1) that they are not equal.

      Comparison(s):

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:

      Indication of pain on the VRS (PI)-verbal rating scale (pain intensity)-in the first 3 hours
      (the patient rates his/her pain on a six-point verbal rating scale).

      SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S):

        1. Patient's assessment of effectiveness and tolerance. The patient assesses the
           effectiveness and the tolerance of the test medicine for treating his sore throat at the
           end of the first and second day of treatment, by means of a verbal rating scale.

        2. Participating doctors assessment of tolerance.
