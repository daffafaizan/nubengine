      hysterectomy is 20-40%. The open abdominal hysterectomy ratio is 75% of all hysterectomy
      operations in our country. We know that the reasons of postoperative acute and chronic pain
      is multifactorial. One of them is smoking which affects the postoperative pain. The best way
      of measuring the level of cotinine is assesing the urine of the patient. We collect the first
      urine after induction.

      In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between the levels of urine cotinine
      and the acute and chronic postoperative pain in hysterectomy patents.
