    
      This phase III international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial is an
      equivalence study with the hypothesis is that Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) is
      associated with equivalent disease-free survival when compared to the standard treatment of
      Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) for women with apparent Stage I endometrial cancer.

      The secondary hypotheses are:

        -  TLH is associated with equivalent or improved Quality of Life (QoL) at 6 months;

        -  TLH is associated with reduced treatment-related morbidity;

        -  TLH is associated with shorter hospital stay;

        -  TLH is associated with less analgesic consumption;

        -  TLH is cost effective;

        -  TLH is associated with improved pelvic floor function.
