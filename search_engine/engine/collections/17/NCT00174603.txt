      an antipsychotic. However, there are limitations to this approach. The rate of response is
      still lower than in other forms of major depression (Janicak et al., 2001). The rate of
      noncompliance is higher in this group; and the incidence of adverse effects related to the
      antipsychotic is increased (Janicak et al., 2001). As a result, studies have examined
      alternative treatments. The present study proposes to examine quetiapine's antipsychotic and
      mood stabilizing properties for the treatment of a major depressive disorder with psychotic
      features Subjects will be randomized to either quetipine monotherapy, quetiapine and
      citalopram; or haloperidol and citalopram.
