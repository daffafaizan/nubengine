      I. Test the effects of a palliative care intervention (PCI) on patients' quality of life
      (QOL), psychological distress and satisfaction with communication, comparing the experimental
      versus control groups.

      II. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' symptom intensity and symptom interference with
      daily activities, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

      III. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' hospital and palliative care resource utilization
      and clinical trial retention rates, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

      IV. Test the effects of the timing of PCI initiation (early versus delayed) on patient
      outcomes, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

      V. Describe patients' satisfaction with the PCI.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive part I of the PCI comprising quantitative surveys, comprehensive
      palliative care assessment by the Research Nurses, and goals of care discussions beginning
      prior to administration of the first dose of phase I treatment. Patients then receive part II
      of the PCI comprising recommendations from the interdisciplinary team, patient educational
      sessions, and supportive care referrals following the first dose of phase I treatment and is
      completed within one month of the first treatment.

      ARM II: Patients receive usual care until 12 weeks post-treatment initiation. Patients then
      receive both part I and II of the PCI.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.
