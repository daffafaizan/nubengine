      Study Duration: Accrual will take place over the course of 16 months. Patients will be
      treated until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression (expected on average for 6 months)
      and then followed for one year thereafter.

      Objectives: Phase I: To determine the the recommended phase II dose of eribulin in
      combination with Durvalumab

      This study will evaluate the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2D) of eribulin with
      durvalumab. If two or more out of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at
      dose level I or II, the dose level below that level will be considered the RP2D. If all 3
      patients enter dose level-I and experience DLT, the study will be terminated. If the highest
      level has been reached and < 33% of patients have experienced DLT, that will be considered
      the RP2D.
