      standard of care control arm (Group 1), IV placebo infusion (Group 2), and IV furosemide
      infusion (Group 3).Patients in Group 2 and 3 received a comprehensive Heart Failure (HF)-care
      protocol that included bi-weekly clinic visits for dose-adjusted IV-diuretics, medication
      adjustment and education. Patients, nurses and treating physicians were blinded to the
      randomization. Patients in Group 1 received standard of care treatment per heart failure
      guidelines at the discretion of the primary cardiologist involved in the patient's care.8
      Patients in Group 2 received IV saline infusion (20-40 ml) concentrated by the pharmacist to
      minimize fluid intake. Patients in Group 3 received IV furosemide calculated by the
      pharmacist to be equivalent or higher in dose compared to the patient's home oral dose. The
      dose assignments were categorized into low dose (20 mg bolus with 20 mg/hour infusion
      sessions and 2 ml saline), intermediate dose (40 mg bolus with 40 mg/hour infusion sessions
      and 4 ml saline) and high dose (80 mg bolus with 80 mg/hour infusion sessions). The infusions
      were continuous over 3 hours, biweekly over a one-month period. Infusions were held at the
      discretion of the physician utilizing a written protocol (creatinine 25% above baseline,
      Systolic Blood Pressure(SBP) <80 mmHg or symptoms of presyncope). Patients in both Groups 2
      and 3 resumed all of their oral home medications for HF post infusion visits per standard of
      care.
