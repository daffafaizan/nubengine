      Primary

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell
           carcinoma treated with sunitinib and irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes.

      Secondary

        -  Determine rates and kinetics of clinical/radiographic response in these patients.

        -  Determine toxicities associated with treatment in these patients.

        -  Assess stable disease at 6 months in these patients.

        -  Assess overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning with
      course 2 of sunitinib malate, patients also receive irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes IV over
      1 hour every 8-16 weeks for up to 6 infusions in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 60 days.
