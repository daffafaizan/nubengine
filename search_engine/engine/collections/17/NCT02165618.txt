      population, associated with increase health care expenditures, morbidity and avoidable
      adverse events .

      The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a systematic medication evaluation by a
      geriatric consultation team (GCT) using the RASP (Rationalisation of drugs on admission by an
      adjusted STOPP-list in older patients) list could reduce inappropriate prescribing for older
      admitted patients, admitted to non-geriatric departments. The GCT could offer the ideal
      format to deliver the intervention to a broad older hospitalised population.
