    
      Herpes simplex keratitis is a leading cause of corneal opacification in the United States,
      other industrialized countries, and developing nations throughout the world. An estimated
      450,000 people in the United States can develop recurrent episodes of the disease and about
      46,000 episodes of HSV eye infection every year. Herpetic eye disease is the most common
      infectious cause of corneal blindness in this country.

      Despite the availability of antiviral agents that are effective in treating herpes simplex
      epithelial keratitis, inflammation in the corneal connective tissue and iris that can lead to
      corneal scarring and visual impairment develops in many patients. Prior to the HEDS-I trials,
      the role of topical corticosteroids in the management of HSV stromal keratitis was uncertain;
      some animal and human studies suggested there was a benefit to treatment whereas others
      suggested harm. The value of adding an oral antiviral agent to treatment with topical
      corticosteroids and topical antivirals also was unknown.

      The HEDS-I trials were developed to assess the efficacy of topical corticosteroids and oral
      acyclovir in treating HSV stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis.

      HEDS-I consisted of three randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The organizational structure
      consisted of a data coordinating center and eight clinical centers.

      All patients received the topical antiviral trifluridine as prophylaxis against recurrences
      of HSV epithelial ulceration. Patients were evaluated weekly for 10 weeks, every other week
      through week 16, and again at 6 months. The primary outcome was the time to development of
      preset criteria for treatment failure during the 16-week period of examination.
      Protocol-specific descriptions of the three trials follow.

      Herpes Stromal Keratitis, Not on Steroid Trial (HEDS-SKN): Patients with active HSV stromal
      keratitis who had not used a topical corticosteroid in the preceding 10 days were randomized
      to treatment with topical prednisolone phosphate drops or topical placebo drops. A treatment
      schedule, starting with 8 drops a day of 1 percent prednisolone phosphate for 7 days, was
      progressively decreased over 10 weeks in such a way that patients received 1 drop per day of
      1/8 percent prednisolone for the last 3 weeks of treatment. Placebo drops were given by the
      same schedule.

      Herpes Stromal Keratitis, on Steroid Treatment (HEDS-SKS): Patients with active HSV stromal
      keratitis who already were being treated with a topical corticosteroid were randomized either
      to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to
      the identical dose of placebo capsules. Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate
      in the dosage schedule described above for the SKN trial.

      Herpes Simplex Virus Iridocyclitis, Receiving Topical Steroids (HEDS-IRT): Patients with
      active HSV iridocyclitis were randomized either to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir
      capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to the identical dose of placebo capsules.
      Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate in the dosage schedule described above
      for the SKN trial.
