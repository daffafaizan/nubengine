    
      Primary Objectives

      - To estimate progression free survival (PFS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate local control of sites previously progressive on erlotinib following
           stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) followed by erlotinib

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in
           EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy

        -  To characterize the toxicity of SRS

        -  To characterize the toxicity of erlotinib when preceded by SRS

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To explore if VeriStrat results at initial progression are associated with longer PFS or
           OS after study treatment

        -  To explore if VeriStrat results following completion of SRS are associated with longer
           PFS or OS after re-initiation of erlotinib

        -  To explore whether "poor" VeriStrat signatures ever turn to "good" signatures with the
           study therapy, and to explore PFS and OS of patients whose signature changes
