      technologies to bring necessary medical expertise to children with special health care needs
      living in rural and underserved communities. This model of care will be implemented in eight
      school-based Medical Therapy Units (MTUs) in northern California using a randomized design.
      The investigators hypothesize that this model of care will result in 1) equal satisfaction of
      the care received in-person from pediatric physiatrists and increased satisfaction of the
      care received from non-pediatric specialists; 2) equal adherence rates to an evidence-based
      hip surveillance program when compared to children who receive care from in-person pediatric
      physiatry care and better adherence than children who receive care from non-pediatric
      specialists; and 3) cost savings when compared to medical direction provided in-person by
      pediatric physiatrists and non-pediatric specialist providers.

      The first 6 months of the project will be a "ramp-up" period during which the protocol will
      be re-reviewed during MTU site visits and necessary contracts and approvals will be in place.
      The last 6 months will be reserved for data analysis, study closeout, and manuscript
      preparation. The intervention phase will include various designs of implementation. For those
      schools currently without pediatric physiatry services, the investigators will provide MTU
      services using telemedicine and add in-person clinics. For those schools where medical
      direction is provided by non-pediatric physiatrists, the investigators will augment current
      services using telemedicine to provide medical direction to some children using pediatric
      physiatrists. For those schools where pediatric physiatrists travel long distances to provide
      medical direction during scheduled clinics, the investigators will similarly add additional
      telemedicine services such that an augmented mixed model of in-person and telemedicine
      pediatric physiatrist medical direction will be provided.
