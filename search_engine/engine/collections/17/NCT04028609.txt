      co-occurring medical and mental health conditions by community health workers designed to
      avoid 30-day readmissions following medical hospitalization. Adult inpatients of a university
      hospital will be randomly assigned to the intervention plus services as usual versus services
      as usual alone, and assessed at baseline and 30 days following discharge. Chi square will be
      used to assess the primary outcome of admission within 30 days of discharge and changes in
      patient activation, mental health symptoms, medication adherence, and perceived competence
      for health maintenance. Also examined will be study condition differences in post-discharge
      inpatient service utilization and cost.
