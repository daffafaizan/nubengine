      weight, overweight, and obese. Growth hormone levels will be correlated with body weight,
      body composition, and markers of cardiovascular risk. In overweight or obese women and men
      with increased visceral adiposity and below average IGF-1 levels, growth hormone versus
      placebo will be given for 6 months. Effects of growth hormone treatment on weight, body
      composition, insulin resistance, lipids, and cardiovascular risk markers will then be
      assessed. Study subjects will be followed for an additional six months for these endpoints.
