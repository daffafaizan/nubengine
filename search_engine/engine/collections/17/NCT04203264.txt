      gastric examination, with high sensitivity and specificity of 90.4% and 94.7%, respectively.

      Therefore, a real-time auxiliary system based on convolutional neural network deep learning
      framework was developed to assist clinicians to improve the quality in MCE examinations.

      Patients referred for magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) in the participating
      center were prospectively enrolled. After passage through the esophagus, physician will
      finish the gastric examination under magnetic steering with the real-time auxiliary system.
      Professional operators guarantee the integrity of the examination and the diagnostic results
      of professional endoscopist was used as the gold standard. The system diagnosis results was
      recorded at the same time. The sensitivity, delay time, specificity of lesions and anatomical
      landmarks will be analyzed.
