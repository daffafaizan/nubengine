      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids and epidural analgesia.

      No international recommendations regarding the use of either of these techniques have yet
      been written. Epidural analgesia is superior to intravenous morphine, including during
      mobilization and coughing. It also reduces respiratory complications and optimizes
      postoperative rehabilitation. Nevertheless, mortality is not improved with this technique.
      Few publications exist on the optimization of the duration of hospitalization in the
      intensive care unit.
