      of HIV. Nevirapine works with zidovudine (AZT) and is active against strains of the virus
      that are resistant to AZT. Studies of the drug in HIV-infected adults showed no serious
      adverse effects.

      Two doses, given by mouth, are evaluated: Three patients receive the lower dose, and 7 days
      after the third patient receives the lower dose, three additional patients receive the higher
      dose. After dosing, blood is drawn at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 168 hours to measure blood
      levels of the drug.
