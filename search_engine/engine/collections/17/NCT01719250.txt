    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or
      standard disease [SD] >= 6 months) with BKM120 (buparlisib) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and
      duration of response.

      II. To describe the toxicities associated with BKM120 in lymphoma. III. To evaluate
      prognostic factors for aggressive lymphoma and whether there's a correlation with clinical
      benefit.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess serum cytokines before and after BKM120 therapy. II. To assess
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway member expression on paraffin-embedded tumor
      samples pre-treatment.

      III. To assess on paired fresh tumor tissue obtained from consenting patients pre- and
      post-therapy the change in activation of PI3K pathway members.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
