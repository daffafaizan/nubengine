      (conducted in more than one center) in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer. The trial consists of 3 phases: screening period, treatment period of
      approximately 4 months, and a follow-up period (Week 1, 4, 8 and 12 after the last dose) of
      up to 12 weeks after the administration of last dose. The participants will receive carlumab
      at the dose of 15 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) by intravenous (into a vein) infusion (a fluid
      or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) at a constant rate over a 90 minute
      period once every 2 weeks until disease progression. Efficacy of the participants will be
      primarily evaluated by composite response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
