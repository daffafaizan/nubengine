      virologic failure and resistance and infant HIV or HIV-free survival.

      The investigators will determine correlates of maternal loss to follow-up and virologic
      failure and correlates of infant HIV in the overall study and stratified by trial arm. In the
      bidirectional SMS arm, the investigators will determine the rate of SMS interactivity, impact
      of critical time-points on messaging, and characteristics of high and low 'interactors'.

      The investigators will determine cost-effectiveness of unidirectional and bidirectional SMS
      interventions. These data will contribute a potential scale-able strategy to improve
      PMTCT-ART as programs aspire to 'virtual elimination' of infant HIV.
