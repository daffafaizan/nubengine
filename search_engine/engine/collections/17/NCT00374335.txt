      infants. While most hemangiomas are benign in behavior and involute spontaneously, some can
      cause significant morbidity due to their location and size. In addition, some hemangiomas may
      be associated with extracutaneous hemangiomas that result in significant morbidity. Certain
      "high risk" hemangiomas of infancy, specifically multiple cutaneous hemangiomas or a solitary
      large hemangioma, have been associated with hepatic hemangiomatosis; however, the exact
      number or size of the cutaneous lesions at which the risk increases and the protocol for
      evaluating these patients remain controversial. The true prevalence of hepatic
      hemangiomatosis is unknown since there have been no large scale prospective studies
      evaluating clinically asymptomatic patients with cutaneous hemangiomas for the presence of
      hepatic hemangiomatosis.

      One of the primary objectives of this study is to determine the incidence of hepatic
      hemangiomatosis in patients with hemangiomas of infancy by comparing hepatic ultrasound
      imaging results of patients with 1-4 cutaneous hemangiomas, 5 or more cutaneous hemangiomas,
      or at least 1 large hemangioma >30 cm2 versus imaging results in patients without cutaneous
      hemangiomas. The study will also attempt to identify specific risk factors associated with
      the development of hepatic hemangiomatosis and to identify associated risk factors in
      patients with clinically symptomatic hepatic hemangiomatosis.
