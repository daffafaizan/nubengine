      with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day +3 and day +4 after bone marrow transplantation, and
      150 patients will receive the usual combination of methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitor.
      The study was designed to last for 4 years. The primary endpoint is the rate of patients
      alive, in remission and without immunosuppression, one year after transplant. The assignment
      for each arm of the study will be done through simple randomization.
