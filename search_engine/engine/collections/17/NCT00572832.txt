      a large percentage of women in this age group are attending college, a good place to access
      them would be through the student health services on college campuses. However, the HPV
      vaccine schedule of 0, 2, and 6 months is likely to be difficult to implement in a college
      calendar year and the immunogenicity of alternative schedules is unknown. If the
      immunogenicity of an altered schedule is good, then higher vaccination rates may be
      achievable.

      Aims:

        1. Determine if delay in the third dose is immunologically non-inferior to the standard
           administration schedule (1 month post-dose 3).

        2. Determine the side effect profile of a delayed third dose, in comparison to the standard
           schedule
