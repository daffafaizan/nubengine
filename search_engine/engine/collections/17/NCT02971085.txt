      worldwide. Early diagnosis and definitive therapy seem to improve oncological outcomes in men
      with high-risk disease, but significant concerns exist in terms of the overdiagnosis and
      overtreatment of patients with lower-risk tumors. In this context, active surveillance (AS)
      has recently emerged as a alternative treatment strategy in PCa patients with low risk
      cancers. However, published data are based on Western population with different protocol, and
      therefore; well-controlled data with well-organized and prospective cohort are urgently
      needed in Korean patients with low-risk PCa because Korean patients have significantly
      different tumor characteristics compared to Western patients. Here, the investigators have a
      plan to establish the Seoul National University Enrolled Registry for Prostate Cancer with
      Active Surveillance, and finally provide the concrete evidence for the clinical outcomes of
      active surveillance program as the primary therapeutic strategy for low-risk PCa in Korean
      men.
