      analgesia thereby reducing the requirement of postoperative supplemental analgesics. The
      incorporation of adjuvants also lowers the overall dose of local anesthetic and hence
      associated side effects. Morphine has been used widely to alleviate various types of pain and
      to supplement general anesthesia. On the other hand, morphine has been reported to possess
      some immunosuppressive effects. Postoperative immunity is also important in conjunction with
      defence against malignant tumour. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2 agonist with
      analgesia, sedation, anxiolysis, and sympatholysis as its useful pharmacological actions. The
      extended analgesic efficacy of IT dexmedetomidine (ITD) in the postoperative period has been
      shown in a few clinical studies. In addition, current insights have identified that
      dexmedetomidine has a capacity in inhibiting the overproduction of a variety of inflammatory
      molecules including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in several acute inflammatory animal models.
