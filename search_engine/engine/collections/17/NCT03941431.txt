      life of patients. Both Chinese medicine and Western medicine have many methods for treating
      psoriasis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but the pursuit of green and
      effective treatment programs is still the focus of the work of specialists and researchers.
      How to combine the existing safe and effective Chinese and Western medicine methods
      organically, and to achieve the purpose of improving efficacy under the premise of ensuring
      safety, is the motivation for carrying out this research.

      The treatments involved in this study include cupping, phototherapy, and Chinese medicine.
      All three methods have sufficient literature to confirm their effectiveness in treating
      plaque psoriasis. The research team hopes to obtain a best combination of three treatments
      for plaque psoriasis by using a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial.
