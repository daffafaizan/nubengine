      (compared to a control non-exercise condition) on neuroplastic potential in depressed and
      non-depressed subjects. To accomplish this aim, the investigators will have subjects ride a
      cycle ergometer at intensities set to elicit 35% (low) and 70% (high) of heart rate reserve
      (((220 - age) - resting heart rate) x 35% or 70%) + resting heart rate). Prior to, and
      immediately after exercise participants will have their neuroplastic potential tested via
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), blood specimens sampled, and mood changes assessed
      (methods detailed below). These assessments will occur at these time points and then every 15
      minutes for 1 hour after exercise.

      Neuroplastic potential will be assessed using TMS. TMS-induced motor evoked potentials
      (MEP's) will be recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis as a way to measure changes in the
      excitability of the corticospinal tract in response to exercise and paired associative
      stimulation. Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cortisol levels will be
      obtained through blood specimen samples in order to examine the potential exercise-induced
      changes in known stress- and neuroplasticity-related biomarkers. Mood and affect will be
      surveyed using the Activation-Deactivation Checklist (AD ACL), feeling scale (FS), and felt
      arousal scale (FAS). These measures will permit the assessment of exercise-induced changes in
      mood and affect.
