    
      This phase II randomized study is to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of fractional
      thoracic radiotherapy combined with albumin bound paclitaxel and nedaplatin twice a week in
      the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer compared with weekly
      chemotherapy.

      Radiotherapy:

      All patients will receive intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once a day, 5 days a week.
      The first stage: DT 3000 cGy / 6 FX; the second stage, DT 3500 cGy / 7 FX. Or: the first
      segment: DT 4000 cGy / 10 FX; the second segment DT 2400 cGy / 6 FX. The interval between two
      stages of radiotherapy was 4 weeks.

      Concurrent chemotherapy:

      The patients were randomly divided into two groups and received one of the following
      concurrent chemotherapy regimens:

      Group A: during the same period of radiotherapy, 30 mg / m2 albumin bound paclitaxel was
      intravenously infused twice a week for 0.5 hours, and nedaplatin 10 mg / m2 twice a week for
      0.5 hours.

        1. When the radiotherapy dose was 3000 cGy / 6 FX + DT 3500 cGy / 7 FX, the infusion time
           was D1, D4, D8 of the first stage of radiotherapy; D1, D4, D8 of the second stage of
           radiotherapy.

        2. When the radiotherapy dose was 4000 cGy / 10 FX + DT 2400 cGy / 6 FX, the infusion time
           was D1, D4, D8, D11 of the first stage radiotherapy, and D1, D4, D8 of the second stage
           radiotherapy.

      Group B: during the same period of radiotherapy, albumin bound paclitaxel (50 mg / m2) was
      intravenously infused once a week for 0.5 hours; nedaplatin (25 mg / m2) was intravenously
      infused once a week for 0.5 hours. The infusion time was D1, D8 of the first radiotherapy and
      D1, D8 of the second radiotherapy.
