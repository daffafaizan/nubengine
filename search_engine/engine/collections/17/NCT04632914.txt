      2%-5% and a prevalence of 13% after the age of 75 years. Heart valve surgery can be a
      lifesaving procedure for patients with severe symptomatic heart valve disease. Nevertheless,
      following the surgery, up to 27% of patients may require readmission within 30 days after
      discharge. Following heart valve surgery, some patients report anxiety and worries related to
      readmission and reoperations, postoperative complications, and deconditioning which may
      prevent or delay return to work and limit activities of daily living Trunk stabilizing
      exercises train and activate the abdominal and anterior thoracic cage muscles to assist in
      stabilizing the bisected sternum, thereby decreasing the undue motion in both sagittal and
      transverse planes during trunk movement. Patients' complaints of pain and discomfort
      associated with sternal instability post-cardiac surgery may be managed by diminishing the
      degree of this undue motion between the edges of the divided sternum, and thus provides a
      conservative treatment for sternal instability forty female patients will be divided into two
      groups. group A received trunk stabilizing exercise and group B will receive routine cardiac
      rehabilitation; three times/week for four weeks. the outcome variables were sternal
      instability and sternal separation and measured before and after completion of treatment
