      understanding of tic generation is thought involve the cortico-basal-thalamic-cortical
      circuit. At this time, only two medications are FDA-approved for tic treatment, while many
      more are used in an off-label fashion with only partial success. Despite multiple approaches
      for tic suppression, patients with severe tics are often left with inadequate relief.
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (RTMS) is a new technology which allows for
      noninvasive stimulation of the brain. In few pilot studies, RTMS reduced tic severity when
      targeting the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). In this study, we propose to use a specific
      paradigm of RTMS called Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) over SMA to treat pediatric
      and adult patients with tics. We will utilize functional MRI (fMRI) to identify each
      subject's SMA for individualized stimulation. We hypothesize that this stimulation technique
      can reduce tic severity when compared to sham stimulation. This proposal is novel because 1)
      cTBS is offered as a new RTMS paradigm to reduce tics and 2) combination of RTMS and fMRI
      allows us to investigate the effects of cortical stimulation on the neural correlates of tic
      generation.
