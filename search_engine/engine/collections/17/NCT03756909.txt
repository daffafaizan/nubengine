      ASA I-II, elective adenotonsillectomy and adenoidectomy under general anesthesia were planned
      to be included in the study. The number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets will be
      taken from the hospital registry system taken preoperatively and the NLR and PLR ratios will
      be calculated.

      All patients in the operating room will be started with routine monitoring and anesthesia.
      Hemodynamic data during surgery will be recorded. The entrance to the operating room (T1), 5
      minutes after the start of anesthesia (T5), 15 minutes (T15), 30 minutes (T30) and 45 minutes
      (T45) will be recorded in the follow-up form of the anesthesia. The fasting period of the
      patients and the drugs and fluids applied during surgery will be recorded from the anesthesia
      form. At the end of the operation, the patients who were taken to the recovery room at the
      end of the surgery will be evaluated with 1 point, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours
      and 6 hours vomiting using the 4 point nausea scale.

      Introduction to recovery room using Modified Eastern Ontario Children's Hospital Pain Scale
      (mCHEOPS), postoperative pain at 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr and 4 hr. Analgesic requirement will be
      recorded. Bronchospasm, agitation, etc. will be recorded by evaluating whether there are
      complications.
