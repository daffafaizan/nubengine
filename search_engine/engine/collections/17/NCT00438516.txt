      were enrolled in a randomized trial of a program of prenatal and infancy home visitation by
      nurses that was epidemiologically and theoretically grounded. The sample enrolled was
      composed of low-income women who had no previous live births and who were largely African
      American (92%), unmarried (98%), and adolescent (67%) at the time of registration during
      pregnancy. In earlier phases of assessment, the program was found to improve the quality of
      care patients provided to their children, to reduce children's health-care encounters in
      which injuries were detected, to increase children's sequential processing skills as measured
      by the KABC, to reduce the number of dysregulated aggressive and violent themes expressed in
      their response to the MacArthur Story Stem Battery, and so to improve maternal life-course as
      reflected in fewer subsequent pregnancies, reduced use of welfare, and increases in the
      marriage and cohabitation with the biological father of the child. Many of the benefits in
      the area of parental care-giving and child functioning were concentrated in those children
      and their mothers who had few psychological resources (where psychological resources was
      defined as the absence of mental disorder symptoms, adequate intellectual functioning, and
      belief in their control over their life circumstances).

      The project will determine whether the beneficial effects of the program on maternal, child,
      and family functioning extend through the early elementary school years, giving particular
      attention to maternal life-course and children's emerging antisocial behavior. Assessments of
      the children will be based on both mother and teacher reports. Teachers are independent,
      natural raters of the children's adaptation to an important social context. There are
      numerous reasons to expect that, from a developmental perspective, the effects of the program
      will increase as children experience the increased academic demands associated with entry
      into third grade. In addressing these questions, the current study will determine the extent
      to which this program of prenatal and infancy home visitation by nurses can produce enduring
      effects on maternal and child functioning (giving particular attention to the prevention of
      early-onset disruptive behavior disorders) in urban African Americans that are consistent
      with those achieved with whites in a central New York state county in a separate trial of
      this program conducted over the past 20 years.
