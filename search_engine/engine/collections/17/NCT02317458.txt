    
      Patients with chronic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy being on standard of
      care will be screened per the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients
      will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either standard of care and C3BS-CQR-1 injection
      (treatment group) or standard of care undergoing a sham procedure (control group). Patients
      randomized to the treatment group, for which C3BS-CQR-1 production met release criteria, will
      undergo endoventricular injection of the C3BS-CQR-1 using injection catheter.
