    
      This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in
      respiratory failure due to COVID-19.

      Clinical Trial setup:

      Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. Briefly, 50 patients with
      COVID-19 and respiratory failure who meet criteria and agree to participation in the study
      will be placed on losartan 25 mg daily on study day 0. If parameters are met the dose of
      losartan will be increased to 50 mg once daily on study day 3. Participants will continue
      losartan until they experience resolution of respiratory failure (normal oxygen levels on
      room air), are discharged from the hospital, meet stoppage criteria (detailed below) or
      complete 14 days of therapy.

      Patients and/or surrogate decision maker who do not give consent to treatment will be asked
      to allow collection of data from their medical record for use as a control group.

      Stoppage criteria for losartan

        -  Hyperkalemia (persistent values >5.5 mM recorded on at least 2 readings).

        -  Worsening renal function (Cockcroft-Gault <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or urinary output <20
           mL/h.

        -  Skin rashes, palpitations or other moderate or severe adverse events (interference with
           usual daily activities) without clear explanation should warrant immediate cessation of
           treatment and notification of study personnel.

        -  Development of sustained hypotension defined as SBP <90 mmHg, DBP <60 mmHg recorded on
           at least two readings 30 min apart or use of norepinephrine >0.1 Âµg/kg/min.

        -  Any change in monitor lab parameters deemed significant and potentially related to study
           drug by the Investigator.
