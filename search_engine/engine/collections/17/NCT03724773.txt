      closed reduction and immobilization. Immobilization techniques include long-arm casting,
      short-arm casting and sugar-tong splinting. At the time of injury casts are usually split
      into two using a cast saw, known as bivalving, to allow for swelling and are overwrapped at a
      later time. By design sugar-tong splints allow for swelling and are overwrapped or converted
      to a cast at a later time. Traditionally long-arm casts have been used as the standard mode
      of immobilization for forearm fractures. Recent evidence demonstrates that long-arm casting
      is equivalent to better tolerated short-arm casting as an immobilization choice for distal
      third forearm fractures.1 Further work has shown that sugar-tong splints are also appropriate
      for treatment of distal third forearm fractures. No study has compared the efficacy of using
      a long-arm cast versus a sugar-tong splint for treatment of forearm shaft fractures.
