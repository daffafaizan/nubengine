      standard/usual/typical care from their primary gynecologic care provider. We hypothesize
      that, compared to COCs, the LNG-IUS will be more effective at improving bleeding-related
      quality of life at 6 months and one year. To test this hypothesis, we plan to enroll 59 women
      from several sites who present for gynecologic care and self-report heavy menstrual bleeding
      into a RCT comparing LNG-IUS to COCs. The eligible study population includes women with heavy
      menstrual bleeding secondary to ovulatory disorders (AUB-O) or endometrial hemostatic
      disorders (AUB-E). Women meeting study eligibility will be randomized to receive LNG-IUS or
      COCs. Main study outcomes will be obtained at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
