      The data collection efforts and cross-sectional analyses were carried out among approximately
      3800 males and females during the scheduled 1991-1994 Cycle V Framingham Offspring/Spouse
      study. The secular trend and longitudinal analyses also included data that were collected
      during the Cycle III Offspring/Spouse studies in 1984-88. Of particular interest were dietary
      variables which play a major role in serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein regulation.
      Additional dietary variables which were associated with major cardiovascular risk factors
      ((elevated) blood pressure, glucose (in)tolerance, (excess) body weight or physical
      (in)activity, and smoking) or that may predict CHD endpoints were included in the analyses.
      The potential confounding effects or interactions between dietary and risk factor variables
      were considered. Separate analyses were carried out in males and females.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
