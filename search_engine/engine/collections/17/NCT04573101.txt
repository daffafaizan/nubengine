    
      This is the first clinical study involving Music in Qatar and the Gulf region, and the first
      study to explore Arab Music Scales using a combination of EEG and self-reported assessements.

      Using EEG, investigators will analyze the full brain activity of brainwaves produced by up to
      100 subjects in response to the audio musical stimuli. 24 different audio recordings have
      been designed to investigate on different acoustic cues:

        -  with versus without quartertones

        -  known music versus improvisation

        -  Maqam Saba (sad) versus maqam Kurd (happy)

        -  3 different Middle Eastern instruments: Ney, Oud and Qanun

        -  Two pitches: from Re or from Sol

      The presentation of the audio stimuli clips will be randomized by the SuperLab5 software and
      EEG brainwaves will be recorded using the Power Lab (AD instrument). Between every audio
      clip, recording will be paused to ask the subjects to self-report on their emotional and
      anxiety states using a self-evaluation questionnaire. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      morning of afternoon sessions of recording.

      Using bioinformatic tools, investigators will perform a correlation study between EEG
      results, emotional self-report from the PANAS-X questionnaire, as well as answers to another
      questionnaire asking for their age, gender, ethnicity, right or left handedness, musical
      preferences, and if the subject plays an instrument.

      The outcomes will have direct applications on the development of personalized Music Therapy
      in the region for treatment and management of mental health conditions, neurodegenerative
      diseases and other conditions that are of high prevalence in the region.
