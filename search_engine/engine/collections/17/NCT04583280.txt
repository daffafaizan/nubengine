      to the Pneumoviridae family, is considered the most important cause of acute lower
      respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and young children. In most patients, RSV
      results in upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) eliciting "common cold"-like symptoms,
      which might last up to 2 weeks, and are usually self-limiting. RSV-related LRTI is a major
      cause of hospital admissions and death in young children worldwide. Rilematovir is an
      investigational, small molecule, RSV fusion inhibitor. This study aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of rilematovir in hospitalized infants and children (greater than or
      equal to [>=] 28 days to less than or equal to [<=] 5 years) and, subsequent to the
      completion of the substudy, in hospitalized neonates (born at term, less than [<] 28 days of
      age) with RSV infection. The study will include a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a
      Follow-up Period. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 36 days
      (Screening included). The efficacy assessments include evaluation under the RRS and the
      safety assessments include evaluations of physical examinations, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse events.
