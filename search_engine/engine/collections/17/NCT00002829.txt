      body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation for patients at high risk for disease
      progression. II. Determine the value of monitoring the quality of remission by PCR assessment
      of BCl-2. III. Evaluate the efficacy of alpha interferon for patients with evidence of
      residual or recurrent lymphoma. IV. Evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow purging by PCR
      assessment of BCl-2.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a brief 2-3 cycles of intensive chemotherapy to achieve minimum
      disease state. Etoposide is administered intravenously on day -8. Cyclophosphamide is infused
      intravenously over 2 hours daily on day -7 and -6. Patients receive mesna beginning 1 hour
      after initiation of the cyclophosphamide treatment. Total body irradiation is received on
      days -4, -3, -2 , and -1. On day 0 allogeneic or autologous bone marrow is infused
      intravenously. Patients with residual or recurrent lymphoma receive interferon alpha daily.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 35 allogeneic and 40 autologous patients are expected to be enrolled.
