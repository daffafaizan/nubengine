    
      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to test the
      hypothesis that camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor shown to inhibit SARS-COV-2
      replication in vitro, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in early stage, laboratory-confirmed,
      COVID-19 ambulatory patients.

      Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor used primarily for treating postoperative
      reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis. This drug, with more
      than 15 years clinical experience in Japan with a very safe clinical track record, will be
      studied as a repurposed drug based on published in vitro virus inhibition data and in vivo
      protective effects in a mouse model of SARS.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether camostat mesylate reduces
      SARS-COV-2 viral load in early COVID-19 disease.
