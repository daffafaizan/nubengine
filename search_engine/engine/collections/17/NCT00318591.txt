      Spinal cord injured (SCI) constitutes a large group of patients suffering from neurogenic
      bladder dysfunction, which is often managed by intermittent catheterization (IC).
      Intermittent catheterization is accepted as a safe and effective method for maintaining
      bladder and renal health in individuals with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. However, IC
      several times a day places an individual at risk for urethral trauma, hematuria, and
      particularly symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI).

      Attempts to control UTI with prophylactic antibiotics or sterile technique have not been
      overly successful but more recent advances in catheter technology, such as the
      hydrophilic-coated catheter, offer potential benefit. The hydrophilic-coated catheter has a
      slippery, pre-lubricated surface (along the entire length of the catheter) when soaked in
      water, allowing smooth insertion without the need for additional water soluble lubricant. Two
      proposed advantages over uncoated catheters are 1) reduced incidence of symptomatic UTI, and
      2) reduction of urethral irritation or urethral trauma, and lowered risk of urethral
      strictures. Currently, while there are trends in favour of hydrophilic-coated catheters with
      respect to UTI overall evidence remains inadequate for clinical decision-making for choice of
      catheter type. Randomised trials to date have been limited by short follow up, heterogeneity,
      attrition, imprecise outcome measures, and varying definitions of UTI5. Conclusions of the
      Cochrane group in 20076 were echoed in a recent comprehensive re-view of all studies on
      hydrophilic-coated catheters - there is modest evidence favouring hydrophilic-coated catheter
      in reduction of UTI, but further robust research is required.
