    
      This Phase IIB, proof-of-concept, dose-range finding clinical study is being conducted to
      evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of MEDI6570 and its effect on surrogates for
      atherosclerotic and heart failure (HF) events in patients with a history of myocardial
      infarction (MI). The results of the Phase IIB study will inform future clinical development
      options and precision medicine strategy for future clinical studies.

      Participants will be randomized in a 3:3:3:1:1:1 ratio, with 198 participants in each of the
      3 MEDI6570 groups and 198 participants across the 3 placebo groups.
