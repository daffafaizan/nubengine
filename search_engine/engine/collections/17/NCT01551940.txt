      placebo (NaCl 0.9 %) and will be followed up in consultation at 4, 12, 16 (if reinjection)
      and 24 weeks. He will be contacted by telephone in 2 and in 8 weeks (percentage of decrease
      of functional embarrassment, percentage of decrease of salivary secretion rate). He can be
      able to benefit in the open label phase of a botulinum toxin type A injection at the 12-week
      follow up if he estimates that first injection was not effective or if the efficiency of the
      first injection began to become blurred. After the 6 months of the study, the patient will
      benefit again from the usual follow-up as advised by the French consensus conference in
      November, 2005.
