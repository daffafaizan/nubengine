      scant long-term outcome data. The treatment of inadequate weight loss, weight recidivism, and
      most severe technical complications after primary bariatric surgery remains refractory to
      non-operative treatment. Failure rates have been reported up to 20% and 35% for the morbidly
      obese (MO) and super obese (SO), respectively at 2 to 3 years after surgery. The indication
      for further surgical intervention remains controversial, as does what type of revisional
      procedure, both operative and endoscopic, to recommend. Furthermore, there is no
      standardization of the limb lengths, pouch size or the use of prosthetic reinforcement.
      Therefore the approach to these patients must be as individualized as their original
      operations. We formally analyze our experience with all laparoscopic revisional strategies
      for Inadequate Initial Weight Loss after failed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass(RYGB).
