    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) with T-DM1 and tucatinib is
      superior to the iDFS in the control arm (T-DM1 + placebo) when administered to high risk
      patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and residual disease after neoadjuvant
      HER2-directed therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether treatment with tucatinib plus T-DM1 compared to treatment with T-DM1
      alone (T-DM1 plus placebo) improves the following:

      Ia. Breast cancer free survival (BCFS). Ib. Distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). Ic.
      Brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Id. Overall survival (OS). II. To evaluate whether
      treatment with tucatinib plus T-DM1 compared to treatment with T-DM1 alone (T-DM1 plus
      placebo) reduces the incidence of brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive T-DM1 intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and placebo
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 14
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive T-DM1 IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and tucatinib PO BID on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 14 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months
      for 10 years.
