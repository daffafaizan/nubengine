      Despite decades of research, few therapeutics have emerged. Treatment is based on the
      treatment of ARDS cause, if possible and on protective ventilation, curare use and prone
      position. For more severe cases, nitric monoxide inhalation and extra-corporeal membrane
      oxygenation can be considered. Nevertheless, no treatment specifically addresses lung
      inflammation. Lung microbiota has been shown to be associated with lung inflammation in
      asthma, chronic obstructive disease and cystic fibrosis. Lung microbiota also plays a role in
      lung immunity. Regarding specifically ARDS, one study correlated lung microbiota with the
      occurrence of non-infectious ARDS in trauma patients. Thi study therefore aims to analyse the
      correlation between lung microbiota at admission to ICU for ARDS with mortality.
