      increase blood pressure. The main indication is orthostatic hypotension but there are other
      clinical conditions where this medicament is often used like hypotension by dialysis,
      hepatorenal syndrome and after carotid artery stenting.

      Vasoplegic syndrome coul be interpreted as a variant of orthostatic hypotension that happens
      usually after surgical interventions. It produces a loss of systemic vascular resistance due
      to inflammatory reaction without any signs of infection.

      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized, double-blind, single-center,
      placebo-controlled study of midodrine in patients who present postoperative vasoplegia with
      no active signs of sepsis but need of vasoactive drugs (Noradrenalin).
