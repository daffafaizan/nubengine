      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) and VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS). VRC01LS is designed to have a
      longer half-life than VRC01. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of VRC01 and VRC01LS in the serum and mucosa of
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults into five groups. At various time
      points during the study, participants in Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive intravenous (IV)
      infusions of VRC01, and participants in Groups 3 and 5 will receive IV infusions of VRC01LS.
      Participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will attend 13 to 14 study visits over about 1 to 1 Â½
      years; participants in Groups 4 and 5 will attend 7 to 9 study visits over about 6 months to
      1 year. At certain time points, study visits will include physical examinations, blood
      collection, urine collection, and interviews and questionnaires. At other time points,
      depending on group assignment and gender, visits will also include collection of
      cervicovaginal secretions, rectal secretions, and semen; and cervical, vaginal, and rectal
      biopsies.
