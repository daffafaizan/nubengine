      fibrillation. Moderate/light physical activity seems to be associated with a lower incidence.
      The underlying mechanisms are uncertain. In order to examine the effect of training in this
      population, the investigators will perform a randomised controlled study with aerobic
      interval training in patients with paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation.
