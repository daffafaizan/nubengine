      22 or 19 gauge (G) needles. Randomized trials have shown that all three needles are safe and
      perform equally well. However, in a retrospective study, the diagnostic sensitivity of
      EUS-FNA for pancreatic masses that measured more than 35mm was less compared to smaller size
      masses. This is because larger size tumors have more necrosis and it is difficult to identify
      cancer cells in them to make a diagnosis. Therefore, more biopsies must be performed in
      larger size tumors to establish a diagnosis. In previous studies it has been shown that the
      larger 19G needles procure larger and better quality tissue. Therefore, our hypothesis is
      that, when a larger 19G needle is used to FNA tumors more than 35mm, a diagnosis can be
      achieved with fewer passes.
