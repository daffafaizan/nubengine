      is recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and is now part of the prophylactic
      treatments for migraine. Brain activations/de-activation via acupuncture lead to a
      modification of haemodynamic responses in the brain which may impact the sensorial, cognitive
      and affective dimensions of pain. Randomized studies on patients who suffer from migraine
      without aura have shown that the painkilling effect of repeated acupuncture sessions on the
      cerebral substratum, compared with simulated sham-type acupuncture, make it possible to
      reduce the frequency of bouts of migraine, the number of days of headaches, and the intensity
      of the bouts.

      Following repeated sessions of acupuncture treatment for pain, modifications occur in the
      white matter (WM) and in the grey matter (GM) and these may be observed by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) which is a highly sensitive technique and very often used to detect functional
      brain changes and/or subtle abnormalities.
