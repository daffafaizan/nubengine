      The presence of herniated disc is generally considered as the leading cause of sciatica.
      However, recent findings indicate that the presence of this mechanism is not sufficient to
      explain all the clinical signs of radiculopathy and that inflammatory mechanisms contribute
      also to the pathophysiology of sciatica. Indeed, herniated discs contain large amounts of
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) which can induce acute and chronic inflammation and pain.
      It has recently been demonstrated that TNF-alpha inhibitors (infliximab or etanercept) were
      able to prevent the occurrence of pain in an experimental model of sciatica. In addition, two
      independent preliminary studies have shown that patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors
      had better evolution than an historical control group. This study has been designed to verify
      the hypothesis that TNF-alpha has a major role in human sciatica and that anti-TNF-alpha
      agents are interesting therapeutic approaches in severe sciatica.
