      investigative sites in Tucson Arizona1. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      device, CATS tonometer prism, measures intraocular pressure significantly differently than
      the current standard of care tonometer prism (Goldmann) before and after a corneal
      crosslinking procedure. This difference would be a measurement of the amount of corneal
      biomechanical changes made due to the cross-linking procedure.
