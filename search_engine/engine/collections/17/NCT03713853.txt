    
      This is a multicentre observational cohort study, involving academic institutions affiliated
      with the Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (COTS).

      The study aims to compare two surgical treatments of acetabular fractures in patients 60
      years of age and older. Patients who consent to participate will be included in the study and
      followed up as per standard of care up to 24 months after surgery. Participants will be
      treated for their acetabular fracture with either acute primary total hip arthroplasty (THA)
      together with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in the same surgery or ORIF alone as
      per surgeon discretion.

      After surgery, patients will be assessed using patient-reported outcomes oxford hip score,
      which is a valid, reliable, responsive measure of pain and function during short-term and
      long-term follow-up for hip osteoarthritis and THA.

      The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), will be used to assess the patient's
      quality of life and health status. The questionnaire is short and easy to use and shows good
      responsiveness in orthopaedic patients who undergo a hip replacement.

      Timed Up & Go Test (TUG) measures functional mobility (in seconds), and is a well-validated
      predictor of mobility and falls in patients who undergo orthopaedic surgery and hip
      replacement.

      All patients will be followed as per standard of care for their follow up visits at 6 weeks,
      3, 6, 12 and 24 months.
