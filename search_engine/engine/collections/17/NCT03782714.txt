      procedure with the formocresol (FC) being the gold standard for the last 60 years. Nowadays,
      low-level laser therapy (LLLT) becomes a technique of interest, due to its many
      characteristics. However, the literature available on its success in pulpotomy is limited and
      reported conflicting results.

      Aim of the study: To assess and compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of LLLT
      and FC for pulpotomy in human primary teeth.

      Materials and methods: Utilizing split-mouth technique, the sample consisted of 106 primary
      molars from 36 children aging five to eight years. The teeth were selected based on specific
      clinical and radiographic inclusion criteria and randomly assigned into two equal groups;
      LLLT group and FC group. All the 106 primary molars were indicated for pulpotomy, where 53
      teeth were treated using FC and 53 teeth were treated with LLLT. Teeth were evaluated
      clinically and radiographically at 3, 6 and 12 months.
