      over-estimation of myopia and subsequently inappropriate prescriptions. Therefore, the
      rationale for cycloplegia is to inhibit the accommodative response in order to obtain a true
      measurement of the refractive error.

      Different cycloplegic agents have been in common use for the last five decades.
      Cyclopentolate is widely used and is commercially available in concentrations of 0.5% and 1%.
      Tropicamide is another widely used cycloplegic agent and is available in 0.5% and 1%
      concentrations.

      The advantages of a non-cycloplegic technique would be firstly, the avoidance of any possible
      harmful effects from the cycloplegic agents used. Secondly, it would vastly reduce waiting
      times for parents and children and allow for a much more efficient clinical service. Finally,
      there may be a significant cost-saving feature involved if these cycloplegic agents are no
      longer required.

      This will be a prospective clinical audit/survey involving children between the ages of 4
      years and 13 years who attend the paediatric ophthalmology clinics in KK Women's and
      Children's Hospital as well as the Singapore National Eye Centre.

      All eligible children will have had a cycloplegic refraction and a non-cycloplegic refraction
      with fogging. A survey of children between the ages of 4 and 13 years who have had refraction
      with both these techniques will be undertaken and the difference in spherical error between
      the 2 techniques will be recorded for each child. We aim to accumulate 15 children from each
      age group.
