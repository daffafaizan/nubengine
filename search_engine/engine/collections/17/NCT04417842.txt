    
      1. Specific Aim #1: Compare the performance of the flow-volume test device to standard
           pulmonary function measurements.

           We hypothesize that measurements of inspiratory capacity with the Respimetrix test
           device will:

           A. Accurately measure the inspiratory capacity as assessed on standard pulmonary
           function tests, and will B. Correlate with other measures of pulmonary function
           including spirometry (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and lung
           volumes (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity and residual volume).

        2. Specific Aim #2: Examine the ability of the flow-volume test device to track changes in
           standard pulmonary function measurements after the administration of an inhaled
           bronchodilator.

      We hypothesize that the Respimetrix test device will:

      A. Accurately measure changes in inspiratory capacity in response to a standard dose of a
      short acting inhaled beta-agonist (4 puffs albuterol), B. Correlate with immediate changes in
      pulmonary function parameters including spirometry (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume
      in 1 second) and lung volumes (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity and residual
      volume).
