      The following parameters will be collected at ICU/burn centers: Hemodynamic parameters;
      sepsis organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, Glasgow Coma scale; Medical history /
      comorbidities; Concomitant treatment; Burn wound bacterial colonization; Biological
      parameters.

      The inclusion and randomization will be performed as late as possible before the first
      surgical procedure.

      Randomization: Burn patients with deep burn between 5 to 40% TBSA requiring at least one
      excision surgery graft will be randomized to receive antibioprophylaxis (or placebo) 30
      minutes before the incision with either first generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) (if
      absence of colonization to Pseudomonas aeruginosa); or piperacillin-tazobactam (if the burned
      area is colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We chose to target specifically Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa because it has been associated with significant morbidity and risk of graft lysis
      in burn patients.

      No specific exams are required during the 7 days, 28 days and 90 days follow up visits.

      The end of research visit is the 90-day follow-up visit. If the patient has been discharged
      from the hospital, the 90-day visit will consist of a telephone contact with the patient if
      he or she has been discharged home or with the medical team of the healthcare structure if
      the patient has been discharged to another structure.
