      admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). When the patients are admitted in the
      surgical ICU, the study staff will determine eligibility based on the protocol inclusion
      criteria. Due to the nature of the disease, there is a high likelihood that patients are
      either unconscious, of limited mental capacity and/or have been intubated therefore when
      appropriate the legally authorized representative will be utilized to obtain research
      consent.

      To meet study inclusion, transcranial Doppler (TCD) testing will be ordered as part of the
      standard of care for these patients. The test will not be ordered solely for research
      purposes. There are no known side effects from the non-invasive measurement of cerebral blood
      flow using ultrasound

      Three different TCD technicians will do triplicate readings on 3 consecutive days on up to 12
      patients already undergoing TCD as ordered by their treating team. Standard of care on
      specific neuro critical care patients (such as cerebral aneurysms) is to undergo daily TCD
      monitoring to assess for possible vasospasm. Patients will be in the supine position while
      measurements are obtained. The probe will be placed in the preauricular region of the
      temporal window
