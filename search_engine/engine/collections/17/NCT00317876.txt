        -  Decrease the conditioning-related toxicity of cyclophosphamide without decreasing the
           engraftment rate to < 90% in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
           for Fanconi's anemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-finding study of cyclophosphamide.

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -5
           to -2.

      Cohorts of 5-10 patients receive decreasing doses of cyclophosphamide until the optimal dose
      (OD) is determined. The OD is defined as the dose at which â‰¥ 4 of 5 patients achieve
      engraftment and < 1 of 10 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT): Patients undergo allogeneic BMT on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine orally or IV
           twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 49, followed by a taper on days
           50-180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
           and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
