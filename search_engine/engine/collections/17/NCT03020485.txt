      Chinese, Indians, Malays and Caucasians. This will be a single intervention. Up to fifty
      participants, consisting of at least ten Chinese, ten Malays, ten Indians, and ten Caucasians
      completed data sets, aged between 21 and 40 years will be recruited from the general public
      in Singapore. Participants will be asked to attend two test sessions for this study.
      Participants will consume either a sucrose drink or an isomaltulose drink (each containing 50
      g of available carbohydrate).
