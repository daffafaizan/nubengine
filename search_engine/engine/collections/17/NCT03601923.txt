      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Niraparib belongs to a class of anti-cancer agents known as PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase)
      inhibitors. PARP is a protein in the body that repairs damage to DNA (one of the building
      blocks of a cell). In cells that are rapidly growing, such as cancer cells, blocking repair
      of DNA may be of benefit, since it will cause the cell to die.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to test the effectiveness of niraparib
      in patients with pancreatic cancer. The trial is focused on pancreatic cancer patients that
      have marker, a mutation in a DNA repair gene, suggesting that their cancer might be
      susceptible to niraparib.
