    
      In Part 1, 12-18 participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Patients
      receive APG-115 orally once every day (QD) with meal on Days 1 to 5, and 23 days off in the
      28-day cycles.

      In Part 2, the recommended starting dose of APG-115 in combination with APG-2575 in Part 2
      will be determined by pooling available dose, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy
      data of Part I, and the consequent results of conducting an integrated dose-response and
      exposure-response analyses on the data from Part 1, after discussion between the sponsor and
      investigators. APG-2575 will be administered orally once every day (QD) with meal (low fat
      meal preferred) in a 28-day cycle following a daily ramp-up schedule.
