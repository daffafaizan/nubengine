      and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these patients compared to no
      treatment. Moreover, TACE can be performed safely and may improve the overall survival of
      patients with HCC and major branch of portal vein invasion. Sorafenib, already approved for
      HCC, could lead to significantly improvement in tumor control and survival in patients with
      advanced stage HCC. So far there are no head to head comparison reports about the efficacy of
      Sorafenib and TACE. Here the investigators evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib and TACE in
      advanced HCC with major branch of portal vein invasion.
