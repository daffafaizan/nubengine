    
      This Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate safety and immunogenicity of both
      non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted VEE VLP vaccine in three dose groups (2 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg)
      given as a 2-dose primary series IM injection (Days 0 and Week 4 [Day 28]) followed by a
      booster dose injection (Week 20 [Day 140]). Each group will consist of 30 subjects, for a
      total of 90 study subjects. Each group of 30 subjects will be randomized to receive either
      non-adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup A; n=15) or adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup B; n=15). Subjects
      will be blinded to receiving the non-adjuvanted versus adjuvanted vaccine, but will not be
      blinded to the vaccine dosage. Enrollment will utilize a sentinel dose design, with only one
      subject receiving a vaccine dose the initial day, 2 subjects the following day, and 3
      subjects the subsequent day, before proceeding with further enrollments in that group.
      Subjects in each Group will be randomized to receive the vaccine dose either without adjuvant
      (Subgroup A) or with adjuvant (Subgroup B).
