    
      In this pilot study, 21 women with severe endometriosis-associated pain and a rectovaginal
      nodule, at least 1 cm in diameter on clinical examination, were randomised in a 2 to 1 ratio
      to receive intravenous infliximab (n=14) or placebo (n=7) in the three months prior to
      laparoscopic laser excision of the nodule.

      After a 1 month observation period, all women received three infusions of infliximab (5mg/kg)
      or placebo over the course of 6 weeks. Surgery was performed 3 months later and follow-up
      continued for a further 6 months. The primary endpoint was the total pain burden
      (dysmenorrhoea, deep dyspareunia and non-menstrual pain) rated on a daily basis by the
      patient using standard pain scales and analgesic intake as the outcome measures . Secondary
      endpoints included the volume of the endometriotic nodule assessed clinically and on
      transvaginal ultrasound, the amount of pelvic tenderness on clinical examination and the
      presence of other endometriotic lesions at laparoscopy.
