      bronchoscopic biopsy techniques for sampling lung lesions: either image-guided
      electromagnetic navigation or conventional bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy. The diagnostic
      yield and adverse events of participants prospectively randomized to either arm will be
      evaluated. This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study.
