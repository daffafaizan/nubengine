      defined the backbone, belong to the nucleosidic analogues class (NRTI). In the last years,
      drugs of this class have been associated to several long-term adverse events of HAART such as
      lipoatrophy, cardiovascular diseases, bone and kidney toxicity. Furthermore the need of a
      triple drug regimen has recently been questioned as maintenance therapy in well controlled
      chronically treated subjects. In this setting, less drug regimens (LDR) have been proposed.
      LDR would allow a reduced exposure to drugs and eventually limit drug-drug interactions,
      drug-related toxicities and would allow treatment simplification so to enhance HAART
      acceptability, tolerability and persistence.
