    
      This project will recruit 360, current daily Marlboro, non-menthol, red (n=180) or gold
      (n=180) cigarette smokers to a 50-day protocol using a randomized factorial design with two
      factors: (1) cigarette pack color manipulation (within subject: red, gold, plain packaging)
      and (2) warning label manipulation (between subject: graphic vs. standard text). The
      randomization will be stratified by own brand cigarette. To evaluate effects of changes in
      cigarette package coloring, participants will smoke commercially available cigarettes that
      may or may not be similar to their preferred brand of cigarettes throughout the study, but in
      different colored packages during three 15-day study periods (i.e., one period will be
      Marlboro plain (tan-olive) packs, one will be Marlboro gold packs and one will be Marlboro
      red packs; order counterbalanced). Participants will visit the Center every 5 days to
      complete assessments (11 total sessions).
