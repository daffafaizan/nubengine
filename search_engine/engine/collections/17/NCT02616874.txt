      virus from the reservoir (Kick and kill strategies) hold the promise to achieve functional
      cure and viral eradication of HIV infection. The present project consists of a
      proof-of-concept clinical trial in a cohort of 24 early treated HIV-1 infected individuals
      rolled-over from the BCN01 vaccine clinical trial in which participants received the most
      immunogenic vaccines tested to date, ChAd and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA).HIVconsv
      vaccines. All individuals will be given a booster immunization with MVA.HIVconsv in
      combination with romidepsin (RMD), a potent histone deacetylation inhibitor (HDACi) and will
      later undergo a monitored antiretroviral pause. HIVconsv vaccines have specifically been
      designed to stimulate a broad and potent cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response towards the most
      conserved viral regions of the HIV-1 proteome, which have recently been suggested to have a
      crucial role when targeting HIV variants harboured in the latent reservoir with mutations to
      escape T-cell immune responses. The study includes the development of a population
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) substudy to analyse the in vivo effects of RMD in the
      induction of HIV expression in resting cells, deeply investigate any unintended effect on the
      CTL function as well as predict the relationship between RMD exposure and such effects. The
      investigators' results will allow investigators to optimize RMD dosing, to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy of this eradication strategy after the cART interruption and to identify
      better correlates of control of rebound viremia after cessation of treatment.
