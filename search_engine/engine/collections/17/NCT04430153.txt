      daily-life UL activity profile of patients in the chronic phase post stroke. A sample of 60
      community-dwelling patients more than six months after stroke will be recruited and will be
      investigated with both standardized clinical, patient-reported and sensor-based UL
      assessments. Our sample will include three groups of 20 patients with (1) both low observed
      and perceived function; (2) both good observed and perceived function; and (3) good observed
      but low perceived function, i.e. the mismatch group.

      To better understand this mismatch group, it is pivotal to investigate daily arm and hand use
      in patients in the chronic phase after stroke as the investigators expect patients in the
      mismatch group to have significantly reduced arm and hand use throughout the day. After all,
      stroke rehabilitation interventions intend to improve patients' performance in daily life,
      but the objective evaluation of this aim is a challenge. Standardized assessments performed
      in the rehabilitation environment or patients' home do not validly reflect daily-life
      upper-limb use. To achieve insight into the observed upper limb function, apart from using
      internationally accepted observation-based assessments such as the FMA and SIS hand function,
      monitoring patients after stroke will also be performed using sensor-based systems.

      The investigators hypothesize the mismatch group will show a comparable daily-life UL
      activity profile compared to patients with both low observed and perceived function. However,
      when compared to patients with good observed and perceived function, the mismatch group shows
      significantly reduced daily-life UL activity by means of sensor-based evaluation.
