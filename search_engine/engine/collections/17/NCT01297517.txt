      Screening/Eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and
      the Treatment phase, which included 3 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, and
      Month 3. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1.
      Patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized
      (1:1:1) to receive treatment with 1 of 3 study drugs for 3 months. Study drug instillation
      began the morning after the second eligibility visit.
