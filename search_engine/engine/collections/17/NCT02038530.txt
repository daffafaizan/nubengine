    
      This is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study that will assess a new diagnostic management
      strategy for suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis in outpatients. The new diagnostic strategy is
      designed to reduce the use of ultrasound testing on the day of presentation, and reduce
      repeat ultrasound testing a week after an initial normal test. Less ultrasound testing will
      be performed because: i) more patients will have deep vein thrombosis excluded by
      combinations of Clinical Pretest Probability and D-dimer results on the day of presentation;
      and, ii) in those who still need an ultrasound, a repeat ultrasound a week after a normal
      result will only be performed if the D-dimer result is markedly abnormal at initial
      presentation. The safety of this management strategy will be established by demonstrating a
      very low rate of proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism during 90 days follow-up
      in patients who had anticoagulant therapy withheld in response to negative diagnostic
      testing. Diagnostic test utilization will be assessed. All clinical outcomes will be
      adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee that will be blind to initial
      D-dimer measurements and patient management.
