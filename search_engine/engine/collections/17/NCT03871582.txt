      number of meals with adequate protein intake (>30 g, >0.4 g/kg). Functionality was assessed
      with self-reported questionnaires about daily living activities (Barthel), and instrumental
      activities of daily living (Lawton). Subjects were categorized according the number of meals
      with adequate protein intake (zero meals, one meal, two or three meals), and their
      functionality score for both questionnaires (high, middle, and low scores).

      With multinomial logistic regression, the investigators assessed if consuming zero or one
      meal with adequate protein intake could be associated with lower functionality in comparison
      with consuming two or three meals with enough protein. The logistic regression was adjusted
      for covariables (age, sex, BMI categories for the elderly, number of diagnosed diseases,
      inadequate protein intake per day [<1.2 g/kg/d]).
