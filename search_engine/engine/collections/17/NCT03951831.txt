      to the long duration of follow-up required, as well as the focus on time-to-event end points,
      i.e. overall survival, in clinical trial design. These landmark trials (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE,
      LATITUDE), which used overall survival as their endpoints, required, on average, 10 years
      from start of trial to first peer-reviewed publication. Given the challenge of using
      traditional measures of response (RECIST criteria) when designing prostate cancer clinical
      trials, the Prostate Cancer Working group 2 (PCWG2) made trial-design recommendations. One
      was to separate treatment outcomes into early measures of response and later time-to-event
      measures of progression. The goal is to shift the trial objective to capture and reflect the
      actual effect of the tested treatment and, in doing so, provide a more timely drug
      development milieu for the metastatic patient. These early measure of response end points,
      such as undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery, are now being actively integrated into
      clinical trial design.
