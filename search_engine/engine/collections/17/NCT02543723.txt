      cancer patients on oral chemotherapeutic agents who are at high-risk of non-adherence.

      The investigators are proposing a randomized multi-arm intervention study of 150 subjects
      with two intervention arms and a control arm (50 subjects per arm). The
      Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model of Adherence and the results of specific aim 1
      will guide this aim. Intervention Arm 1 will receive a Medication Event Monitoring System
      (MEMS) with feedback. Intervention Arm 2 will receive the MEMS plus a tailored nurse coaching
      component. Controls will receive standard-of-care from the Cancer Center. Specifically, the
      investigators want to test whether a tailored nurse coaching intervention component will
      significantly improve medication adherence at higher rates as compared to the MEMS alone. The
      MEMS is a medication bottle with a cap that is equipped with a microchip that registers the
      date and time of each cap opening (dosing history). Currently, there is no gold standard for
      measure of medication adherence but the MEMS device has been demonstrated to be a valid and
      objective method to assess medication adherence. The nurse coach intervention component will
      involve an individualized barriers/facilitators screening tool and regular contact with
      cancer patients via telephone calls across a six-month period. The investigators hypothesize
      that although both telehealth strategies will be effective at increasing medication
      adherence, Arm 2 will have a significantly greater effect on adherence. This hypothesis is
      supported by existing medication adherence literature that suggests a tailored intervention
      using multiple adherence strategies can potentially have a significant impact on increasing
      medication adherence.
