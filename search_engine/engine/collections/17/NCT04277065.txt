      resection became the dominating resection surgery approach. December of 2014, laparoscopic
      hepatectomy was carried out in our department, extracorporeal Pringle maneuver has been
      applied in most laparoscopic liver resections which need to block the hepatic inflow, cotton
      tape was the frequently used tourniquet. We used to blocked the hepatic inflow by
      extracorporeal Pringle maneuver method with cotton tape for its validity , softness and no
      visible damages for vessel, but it was always difficult for clamping in a two-dimensional
      view to encircle the hepatoduodenal ligament , and it delayed operation time for freshmen.
      Bulldog has been widely used in urinary surgery for vascular occlusion, but bulldog in
      hepatic surgery has rarely been mentioned, this is the first report to formally demonstrate
      the clinical application in hepatic surgery. However, it is not clear that whether the
      bulldog for vascular occlusion is useful and easy to implement in laparoscopic hepatectomy.
      In this study, we will compare the cotton and the bulldog for vascular occlusion during
      laparoscopic hepatectomy
