    
      Primary Objective:

      Phase 1b: - To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of intratumoral SD 101 in
      combination with ibrutinib and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphoma . - To determine the safety and tolerability of SD 101 in combination with ibrutinib
      and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma

      Phase 2: -To evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral SD 101 in combination with ibrutinib and
      radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma by assessing overall
      response rate

      Secondary Objective:

      Phase 2: - To evaluate progression free survival after treatment with intratumoral SD 101 in
      combination with ibrutinib and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphoma

      - To evaluate the induction of tumor-specific immune responses by treatment with intratumoral
      SD-101 in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory B
      cell lymphoma
