    
      In this study, pharmacokinetic of rocuronium at 1 mg/kg will be evaluated at each point of
      Train of Four Response (TOF) and Post Tetanic Count (when TOF=0) troughout the period of
      anesthesia and surgery.

      Time 0 is the time of rocuronium injection, Time 1 is the time when post tetanic count is >
      5-7 and TOF=0, Time 3 when TOF >0 response, Time 4 when 4 reponses of the TOF and Time 5 when
      TOF > 90 %
