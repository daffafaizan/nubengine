    
      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 study of
      MG01CI (1400 mg once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio of 300 adults
      with ADHD. The study comprises a Screening Visit at which initial assessment will be made and
      then a Washout Period during which prospective subjects must discontinue ADHD medication for
      14 days (for psychotropic medications other than fluoxetine) or for 28 days (for fluoxetine)
      before randomization into the study. The Washout Period is 14 days, but may be extended to 28
      days for a fluoxetine washout. Subjects requiring either a 14-day or a 28-day Washout Period
      will have an Interim Visit (off drug) on or about Day -8 (Day -10 to Day -3) for CAARS-Inv
      assessment after the Washout Period. The Baseline CAARS Inv assessment will be conducted on
      Day 0. If there is a ≥25% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Interim Visit (off
      drug) assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return for the
      Baseline CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. For subjects not needing
      washout, if there is a ≥25% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Screening Visit
      assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return for the Baseline
      CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. Following the Washout Period for
      those requiring a washout, or following the Screening Visit for those subjects who do not
      require a washout, eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments and be randomized on
      Day 0 to MG01CI 1400 mg or to matching placebo and begin the Double-blind Treatment Period.
      The Double-blind Treatment Period will be 6 weeks in duration. There will be a 2-week
      Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early termination.
