      physicians who are already treating the patient. Support and adequate training of the mobile
      application and the research protocol will be provided by the Study Coordinator.

      The patient/family caregiver be asked to check their vision at home via their mobile
      application at regularly scheduled intervals as determined by their ophthalmologist. Patients
      will be expected to review postings of their visual acuity and office visits at a minimum of
      once a month intervals.

      A staff member from the physician's office will post pertinent data from each office visit
      using a template. The ophthalmology template will include visual acuity, intraocular
      pressure, treatments given (if any), and uploaded retinal images. The non-ophthalmology
      physicians will post their office visit data in a free-form text box. Data entry can be
      performed by office staff and does not have to be done by a physician. Physicians will have
      access to view visual acuity records and physician postings from their own patients.

      The research coordinator will collect health psychology data by administering validated
      health psychology questionnaires to assess patient depression, knowledge regarding diabetes
      and complications of diabetes, motivation to carry out diabetes care, reaction to increased
      knowledge of specific tests for diabetes and diabetic complications, and quality of life at
      4-month intervals throughout the Clinical Trial.
