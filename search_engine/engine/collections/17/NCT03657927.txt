      start and continue surgical operations. Endotracheal intubation has many important reasons
      such as ensuring airway control safely during surgical procedure, increasing the depth of
      anesthesia, need interventions for surgical or anesthetic complications, reduction of dead
      space, reduction of respiratory effort and prevention of aspiration risk.

      Mask ventilation and tracheal intubation in morbidly obese patients can be difficult with the
      anatomical changes caused by obesity. Reduced functional residual capacity in morbidly obese
      patients makes it difficult to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation at normal limits.
      Videolaryngoscope, developed in recent years and beginning to take place in the algorithms,
      facilitate difficult airway management and hence intubation.

      The use of videolaryngoscope in patients with difficult intubation such as morbid obesity,
      has been frequently reported in the literature. McGrath videolaryngoscope has a
      high-resolution video camera, a length-adjustable angle blade, and a light source at the tip
      of the blade. At the same time, the C-MAC videolaryngoscope is another advanced
      videolaryngoscope with a better quality video and camera system and improves the performance
      of videolaryngoscope with some technological changes.

      In this prospective controlled clinical study, the purpose is to compare C-MAC
      videolaryngoscope and McGrath MAC videolaryngoscope in respect to duration of intubation,
      haemodynamic response, and adverse events associated with intubation of morbidly obese
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
