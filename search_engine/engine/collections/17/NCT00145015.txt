      consumption on cancer risk and gastrointestinal cancers in particular. Further evidence to
      support the idea that fish consumption is protective in relation to cancers of the GI tract
      is now emerging from the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).

      The FISHGASTRO project is headed by the Institute of Food Research and includes groups from
      the University of East Anglia, the University of Wageningen, Netherlands and the University
      of Jena, Germany. The project focuses on assessing the impact of fish consumption on a range
      of markers of gastrointestinal health associated with ulcerative colitis or colon cancer and
      on looking at bio-accessibility of a range of nutrients from fish. We aim to recruit a total
      of 270 patients with gastrointestinal problems in the UK and Netherlands and take biopsy and
      blood samples before and after asking them to eat two extra portions of fish per week. One
      group will receive oil rich fish such as salmon while another will be asked to eat white
      fish. Changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory markers, gene expression and
      plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids will be compared to a control group only given standard
      nutritional advice.
