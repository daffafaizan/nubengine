      administered subcutaneously at bedtime. Both insulin formulations consisted of cartridge
      containing 3 ML of either insulin preparation. Oral antihyperglycemic agents were continued
      at the prestudy dosages. No dietary advice was given beyond reinforcement of standard
      guidelines. The initial bedtime insulin dose was 10 IU for all patients with the goal to
      achieve a target FPG of < 100 mg/dL in both groups. The insulin dose was titrated weekly
      according to daily self-monitored fasting blood glucose measurements that provide values
      corresponding closely to laboratory measurements of plasma glucose. The patients were taught
      to increase their insulin dose by 2 IU if FPG was greater than 100 mg/dL, and by 4 IU if FPG
      was greater than 180 mg/dL on three consecutive mornings. Before the start of insulin
      therapy, and at weeks 12, 24 and 36, blood was withdrawn for measurements of full blood
      counts, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes and lipids. Insulin doses, self-monitored
      plasma glucose (SMPG), and any events associated with signs or symptoms of hypoglycaemia were
      recorded in diaries.
