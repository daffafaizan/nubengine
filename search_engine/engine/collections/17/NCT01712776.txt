      standard for establishing safety and efficacy data. Active treatment vapocoolant spray (Pain
      Ease Medium Stream) spray) will be used. There will be a placebo (sterile water) in this
      study. The population selected for this study, adults (excluding the very old, > 80 years
      old) represents a patient population that may benefit from vapocoolant spray. This is a
      patient population that according to the treating health care provider already requires
      venipuncture for "blood draw" but not intravenous cannulation. Because venipuncture is a
      painful procedure, vapocoolant may confer benefit for the relief of pain.
