      centre (Danderyds University Hospital). The protocol was approved by the Ethical committee
      for human studies.

      With a primary outcome that perioperative care at the hotel would be valued 15-20% higher
      than care in a general ward, a power analysis, two-sided with α = 0.05, indicated that a
      sample size of 150 was needed to attain a power of 80%.

      The patients were randomised to receive pre- and postoperative care either in a general
      surgical ward or at a patient hotel by using a sealed envelope method.

      To evaluate the patients' experiences of the care provided at the ward and the hotel,
      respectively, the Swedish validated version of the adult inpatient survey of 2005 (IN2005-E)
      was used.

      Adjacent to the discharge from the ward or hotel, the patient was provided with the IN2005-E
      questionnaire, which was filled out before the patient left the facility. The filled out form
      was sealed in an envelope by the patient herself and thereafter sent to a separate institute
      (Indikator) for further analysis. Indikator is responsible for the majority of the
      statistical analysis of patient surveys in Sweden.

      Patient characteristics were compared using a confidence interval of 95%. The SF-36 was
      analyzed with a two-sample t-test. The IN2005E was analyzed by a cross-tabulation of the data
      using the χ² test in SPSS 17.0. The significance level was set to < 0.05.
