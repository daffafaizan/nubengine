      and disability. Many patients with OA know very little about treatment options and are not
      well equipped to make informed decisions regarding these treatments. Further, there are
      racial and gender disparities in perceptions of the risks and benefits of total joint
      replacement, which also highlights the need to improve facilitation of informed treatment
      choices in these patients. Decision aids have great potential to improve patient
      satisfaction, safety, and outcomes for patients with OA, but there is no evidence base
      regarding best formats for delivering this information. This project will compare patient
      decision-making outcomes immediately following viewing of DVD and web-based versions of the
      Health Dialog DAs for hip and knee OA, as well as three days and one month later. Patients
      with symptomatic knee and hip OA (n=200) will be enrolled from a primary care and orthopedic
      clinics. Participants will be randomized, with stratification according to health literacy
      level, to view the DVD or web-based DA. Outcomes will include: Knowledge about OA and
      Treatments, Decisional Conflict, Preparation for Decision-Making, Decision Self-Efficacy,
      Stage of Decision Making, Acceptability and Usability of the DA, and home use of the DA. This
      project will make a novel contribution with direct clinical applicability, providing
      information regarding best methods for disseminating tools to enhance informed
      decision-making among patients with hip and knee OA, with particular attention to patients
      with low literacy.
