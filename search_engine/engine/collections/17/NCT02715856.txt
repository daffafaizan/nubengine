      I. To develop and evaluate the feasibility of a method that enhances surveillance in cancer
      survivors by using mobile devices in addition to face-to-face visits following surgery for
      bone metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate how well the face-to-face follow-up format can be adapted to using mobile
      devices for remote surveillance.

      II. Limited efficacy testing of the remote surveillance program. III. To obtain information
      on acceptability of the mobile surveillance format by patients and clinicians.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CONTROL): Patients undergo standard face-to-face follow up visits at 2, 6, 12, and
      24 weeks after surgery. Patients also undergo a physical activity assessment over 15 minutes.

      GROUP II (MOBILE SURVEILLANCE): Patients undergo standard face-to-face follow up visits as in
      Group I. Patients also undergo mobile surveillance comprising use of a mobile device
      application to send photos and videos to study staff and engage in video conferences at 3, 7,
      13, and 25 weeks after surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-25 weeks.
