      women who have recognized risk factors. For example, 30-50% of women who have a clinically
      recognized risk factor report anal incontinence, fecal urgency, dyspareunia and perineal
      pain. Despite this, a study found that less than 50% of women with anal incontinence voice
      those symptoms unless directly asked about them.

      Some authors discuss how women may not share these symptoms with their care providers out of
      the belief that it is a "normal" effect of childbirth. A review of the literature shows that
      antenatal educational workshops can be an effective means to provide pregnant women with
      information regarding pelvic floor health, including how modes of delivery impact pelvic
      floor function. Similarly, antenatal pelvic floor workshops have been found to improve
      patients' knowledge on pelvic floor health, their practice of pelvic floor muscle exercises
      and their confidence with these exercises.

      To our knowledge, there is no literature exploring the role of a postpartum pelvic floor
      workshop, on managing perineal and pelvic floor symptoms in women who are identified as being
      at higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. Our goal is to develop and assess such
      a workshop.
