      brief psychodynamic psychotherapy. The patients are recruited from occupational health
      services and suffer from mild to moderate major depressive disorder. The treatments last for
      16 weeks. The main outcome measures include HAM-D, BDI, SOFAS, Rand-36. In addition to more
      traditional outcome measures, we also measure the densities of 5HT-1A and D-2 receptors
      before and after the treatment using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) . The main hypothesis
      is that brief psychotherapy is as effective as fluoxetine, but differences between the
      treatments are seen in PET scanning.
