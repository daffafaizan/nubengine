      program) will be eligible for study participation. The objective is to test a social
      media-based intervention designed to promote annual repeat colo-rectal cancer screening using
      the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) among person who have taken the FIT test once before. 220
      men and women (50 to 75 years of age) will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the
      intervention condition (monthly social media contact) or a control condition (standard of
      care reminder for repeat testing one month before the annual test is due). The dependent
      variable will be whether volunteers requested and retuned a FIT kit with 60 days of the
      annual due date (one year from their initial screening).
