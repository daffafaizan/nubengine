    
      The current study is a cross sectional study that includes an interview lead questionnaire
      that will be carried out by second year dental students of the academic years (2018-2019,
      2019- 2020). The questionnaire consists of four sections; a demographic section, a modified
      Arabic Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy (ARELAD-30) Tool, Arabic Modified Dental Anxiety
      Scale (AMDAS), and Utilization of oral health services questionnaire. Before conducting the
      study, orientation sessions and thorough training of the students will be performed to ensure
      that the students can conduct the interview consistently and efficiently. Students will be
      asked to design educational materials (brochures, leaflets and posters) that aim at improving
      patients' knowledge and awareness regarding oral health and the utilization of oral health
      services. The aim of this study is to detect the impact of oral health literacy on the level
      of dental anxiety and utilization of dental services among dental patients.
