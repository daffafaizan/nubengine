    
      Capecitabine (Xeloda Â®) is currently the most biologically active oral fluoropyrimidine drug,
      and is widely used in adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. It is usually taken twice a day
      (in the morning and in the evening) for 2 weeks, followed by a 1 week break before repeating
      the next dosage cycle. In this study, capecitabine will be prescribed as dosage of 500mg/m2,
      and maintain for a whole year after the standard treatment in stage II/III pancreatic cancer
      patients. 1 year disease-free survival is set as the primary outcome, OS, RFS, AEs and
      exploratory biomarkers including effects of metronome chemotherapy on immune cells, such as
      NK cells, T cells, TAMs, B cells, etc are also observed as the secondary outcomes.
      Statistical analysis are made to see compared with observation group, whether this metronomic
      therapy of capecitabine ( 500mg/m2) will bring benefit to pancreatic cancer patients.
