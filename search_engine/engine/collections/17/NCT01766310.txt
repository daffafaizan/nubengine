      myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Many studies founded
      hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for those cardiovascular diseases which
      take responsible for about 10% of total cardiovascular disease risk. Reduction of elevated
      plasma homocysteine may prevent up to 25% of cardiovascular events. One of modifiable cause
      of hyperhomocysteinemia is prevention of vitamin deficiency, especially folate deficiency.

      Obese Thai children are probable risk for folate deficiency due to low dietary folate intake
      and low serum folate level from unbalanced diet (low vegetables intake & high fat diet) and
      high prevalence of thalassemia. Moreover obese children are also at risk of atherosclerosis.
      However, no data have been reported about effect of folic acid supplementation on
      homocysteine level in these patients.
