    
      Consecutive adult patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability for HIT
      (according to the clinical prediction rule called the "4T's Score) will receive rivaroxaban
      15 mg bid while awaiting confirmation or exclusion of HIT by the local laboratory assay.
      Patients who are confirmed to have HIT by the local laboratory assay will continue to receive
      rivaroxaban 15 mg bid until their platelet count â‰¥ 150 or until end of study (Day 30). At the
      time of platelet count recovery (typically 4-7 days), they will be transitioned to a
      maintenance dose of rivaroxaban (20 mg od) for a maximum of 30 days.
