        1. Substitution of Erwinase after E.coli asparaginase allergy has been standard practice
           despite the paucity of evidence regarding its efficacy and uncertainty about dose.
           Definition of an appropriate dose and schedule of Erwinase that provides reliable
           asparagine depletion may be useful for patients with clinical allergy to E. coli
           asparaginase, both in first remission or after relapse.

        2. Patients in relapse may have a different level of asparagine synthesis than patients
           maintaining remission and require different asparaginase dosing.5

        3. Intravenous administration provides more rapid and predictable asparagine depletion with
           less discomfort and danger of bleeding for often thrombocytopenic patients than
           intramuscular administration.

        4. Vincristine, doxorubicin, asparaginase, and dexamethasone with dexrazoxane is clinically
           relevant for a population with first marrow relapse.

        5. Vincristine, doxorubicin, asparaginase, and dexamethasone with dexrazoxane is clinically
           relevant for a population with second marrow relapse, if the duration of CR2 > 18 months
           year.
