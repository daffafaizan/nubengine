      caregivers will be asked to participate in the Roadmap (iPad) portion of the study.

      Each caregiver will be provided with an iPad to use the BMT Roadmap system. Patients and/or
      caregivers are free to use this tool as much as they would like on their own time while in
      the hospital. The hospital care team will collect the iPad when the patient is discharged and
      ready to go home. Patients and caregivers will also be asked to take three surveys that will
      ask about their feelings and thoughts about the Roadmap application. The surveys will be
      completed when patients are admitted for their CART or other CRS-eliciting therapy, when they
      get discharged from the hospital and around 100 days after they receive their therapy.

      In addition to the use of the BMT Roadmap, this study will include around 7-10 interviews
      about participants' opinions on the two tools and their experience in the therapy process.
