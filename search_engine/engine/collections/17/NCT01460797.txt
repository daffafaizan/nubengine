      anthropometric parameters, but only Low-GI and Low-GI + Metformin groups have an improvement
      in body composition parameters. In addition, the Low-GI group achieved better results in
      metabolism of carbohydrates (glucose, insulin, Cederholm Index, and HOMA-Î²) and lipids (Chol,
      TAG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and TC/HDL-c). These results show the benefits of Low-GI diet on
      metabolic parameters in overweight or obese type 1 subjects.
