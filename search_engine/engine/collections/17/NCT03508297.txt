    
      Study Design This is an observational, non-randomised, non-controlled, prospective cohort
      study to look at the efficacy of in vivo RCM as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of MM and
      LM.

      Study Endpoints The hypothesis of this study is that the use of RCM is would reduce the NNE
      prior to definitive treatment by at least 30% from the current value of approximately 10.

      The secondary hypothesis is that the intra- & inter-observer agreement for interpreting the
      RCM images will have kappa scores 0.6 or greater (indicating good agreement).

      Setting and recruitment Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Skin
      Care Network Barnet, and from the outpatient clinics of the Chase Farm and Barnet sites of
      Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

      Participants The number of true negative lesions examined in this study will be 654. It is
      anticipated that this will result in a total of 661 lesions being recruited. 10% of
      participants are expected to have more than one lesion sampled.

      The result of biopsy for each lesion will not be known until after the lesion has been
      included in the study. Therefore lesions will be added to the study until the required number
      of true negatives has been included.
