    
      The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of chronic disease risk factors, including abdominal
      obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose.

      A main treatment for metabolic syndrome is lifestyle modification (alterations in diet and/or
      physical activity patterns) resulting in weight loss.

      Beans are easily incorporated into the diet and may lead to the attainment and maintenance of
      healthy a body weight and improved metabolic control.

      Canned baked navy beans (with tomato sauce) have a low glycemic response following
      consumption, however, whether this effect has long-term benefits on glycemic control requires
      further investigation.

      OBJECTIVE

      To determine the effect of consuming 5 cups per week of commercially available canned navy
      beans over 4 weeks on risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome.
