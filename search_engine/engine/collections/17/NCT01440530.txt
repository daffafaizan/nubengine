      online lifestyle interventions. Compared to Primary Care (PC) Diabetes System of Care
      (control), the investigators hypothesized Technology Intervention for Diabetes Engagement &
      Self-Care (TIDES) would significantly improve diabetes knowledge and self-care.

      Methods: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, physician letters were sent to
      patients with type 2 diabetes, age >18 years with HgA1c >8% identified via Electronic Health
      Record (EHR) of an integrated US health system to invite participation in a 3-site, 24-week
      diabetes study. Of the 270 with >1 week email/web use invited to the shared medical visit
      (SMV) orientation, 166 subjects provided written informed consent. Diabetes knowledge and
      self-care assessments, vital signs, HgA1c, fasting glucose and lipids were collected at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. Following randomization to TIDES (N=117) or usual care (N=49),
      TIDES group was oriented to the multimedia online intervention including a dosed sequence of
      learning via email, video, slide shows, food solutions, expert questions and answers,and
      quizzes.
