      Osteoarticular infections related to orthopaedic implants are associated with substantial
      morbidity, prolongation of hospital stay, and additional costs. Due to the increasing number
      of patients with orthopaedic implants in Switzerland, similar to the rest of Europe and
      elsewhere, the number of infections is expected to increase. While the surgical treatment of
      these infections has been well studied, the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy after
      removal (explantation) of the infected implant remains unknown. For almost 40 years, the
      recommended total duration of post-explantation antibiotic therapy has been 6 weeks. This
      recommendation is based on expert's personal experience rather than on prospective randomized
      studies. Shorter treatment would decrease antibiotic-related adverse events and costs
      hospital stay for patients awaiting an eventual reinsertion of a new implant. If physicians
      and surgeon prescribe antibiotics for 6 weeks, this duration should be at least supported by
      evidence.
