      therapy, or a combination of treatments. However, several variables may exclude participants
      from these treatments such as multiple tumors, multiple previous surgeries, pulmonary
      dysfunction, or co-morbid medical conditions. For these participants, percutaneous
      cryoablation may be a suitable option.

      Ablation of metastatic lung tumors is a rapidly expanding area within interventional
      oncology. Cryotherapy, radiofrequency, laser, and microwave have all been shown to be
      effective. Cryotherapy offers a wide range of anatomic and tumor treatment options because of
      the ability to visualize the ice under imaging guidance and the preservation of collagenous
      tissue structure. Cryoablation has been extensively performed in the prostate and kidney with
      favorable outcomes reported in the literature. More recently, cryoablation has been shown to
      be safe in the treatment of lung tumors with CT guidance.
