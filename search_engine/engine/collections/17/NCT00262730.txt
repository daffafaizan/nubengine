    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiation plus low-dose temozolomide followed by
           adjuvant temozolomide and intramuscular poly ICLC for adult patients with newly
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the frequency of toxicity associated with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Induction chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week,
           for 6 weeks. During the same 6 weeks, patients also receive oral temozolomide once
           daily. Four weeks later, patients are evaluated for disease progression. Patients with
           progressive disease are removed from the study. Patients with no progressive disease
           proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 (week 1).
           Patients also receive poly ICLC intramuscularly three times a week in weeks 2-8. Courses
           repeat every 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.
