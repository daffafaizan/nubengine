      lesions with the taxus stent in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression of SVGs as
      evaluated by IVUS. Patients with previous coronary bypass surgery with SVG implantation
      undergoing coronary angiography by clinical indication will be screened. If the patient has a
      moderate lesion at any level of the SVGs it will be includable in the study. After inclusion,
      the patients will be randomized to either stenting the moderate SVG lesion with the taxus
      stent or standard medical treatment. The use of a filter wire during dilation will be
      strongly recommended. Following this procedure, all patients will have clinical controls at 1
      month and at 6 months and an angiographic and IVUS control study at 1 year follow-up.
