      cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (ACPO), literature still lacks of multi-centre randomised
      prospective studies that compares CPAP with NPPV.

      Aim of the study was to assess efficacy and safety of CPAP and NPPV in patients with ACPO.

      Methods 80 patients with ACPO were randomly assigned to receive CPAP or NPPV (40 for each
      group) through a face mask.

      Inclusion criteria were: severe dyspnoea, respiratory rate > 30, PaO2/FiO2 < 200, muscle
      fatigue.

      Main end-points were endotracheal intubation, length of ventilation, hospital length of stay
      and mortality.
