      I. The use of an accelerated pathway will result in a shorter postoperative hospital length
      of stay for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) without an increase in
      perioperative complications or readmission rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The investigators anticipate lower cost, lower readmission rate, similar rate of
      post-operative complications (delayed gastric emptying [DGE], anastomotic leaks,
      intra-abdominal abscesses, wound infection, urinary tract infection [UTI], respiratory
      compromise, renal failure, etc.) in our study group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients follow the standard 7-day pathway at the end of surgery.

      ARM II: Patients follow the Whipple accelerated 5-day pathway at the end of surgery. The
      accelerated pathway includes more rapidly leaving the ICU setting, early mobilization and
      enhanced physical therapy, multimodal pain control, dietary modifications, and increased and
      standardized phone contact by a nurse practitioner during the first week following hospital
      discharge.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
