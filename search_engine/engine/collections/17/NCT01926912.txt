      following patient enrollment), multicenter, observational study (a type of study in which
      participants are observed or certain outcomes are measured). This study will consist of
      6-week observational period during which data will be collected for participants who are
      hospitalized due to schizophrenia exacerbation and are receiving treatment with paliperidone
      palmitate (treatment initiated within 3 weeks after admission to hospital). The participant
      satisfaction will be evaluated at week 6 (or early discontinuation). Safety evaluations will
      include body weight, extrapyramidal symptom (eg, inability to initiate movement and inability
      to remain motionless) rating scale scores, concomitant therapy and assessment of adverse
      events.
