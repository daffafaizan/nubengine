      hormones in women who use copper or hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs). This study will
      provide more information on the potential effect of levonorgestrel intrauterine system
      (LNG-IUS) use on an individual's stress response. Ultimately, this study hopes to provide
      data to better counsel women on potential mood effects of the LNG-IUS. From a research and
      clinical management perspective, hair cortisol may provide a tool to evaluate women at risk
      for discontinuation of hormonal contraception due to concern of mood symptoms.
