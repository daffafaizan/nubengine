    
      This study was a passive surveillance of hospitalized dengue cases in participants who
      participated in study CYD23 (NCT00842530) where participants were initially randomized to
      receive 3 injections of either CYD dengue vaccine or control at 6 month intervals. Any SAE
      related to a study procedure or related to a previous injection from study CYD23, or any
      fatal SAEs (even if unrelated) were reported to the Sponsor.

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was also involved in the regular review of
      virologically-confirmed hospitalized dengue cases. Any fatal outcome or related SAE were be
      promptly reviewed by the IDMC.

      No study vaccinations were administered.
