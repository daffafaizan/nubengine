      This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution.

      One group is treated with daily intramuscular injections of glucantime. Patients with less
      than a complete response on Day 21 continue treatment until lesions heal completely or for a
      maximum of 60 days. Patients with progressive disease on Day 40 are removed from study.

      The second group is treated with daily oral allopurinol. Patients with a partial response on
      Day 21 continue treatment until lesions heal completely. Patients with stable or progressive
      disease on Day 21 or unhealed lesions on Day 56 cross to glucantime therapy. Accrual into
      this group was closed in 6/96.

      The third group receives allopurinol and glucantime.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 9 months, then annually for at least 5 years.
