      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), or the size of the covering around the nerve behind the eye.
      This covering expands when there is a higher than normal pressure inside the head. The group
      of interest on which this study focuses is the children with cerebrospinal shunts that drain
      extra fluid from their heads to other parts of the body (abdomen, heart, lungs) because the
      brain cannot drain all of the fluid like normal. When these shunts malfunction or fail, this
      can cause a backup of fluid in the brain, and raise the intracranial pressure (ICP) inside
      the skull. Depending on the degree of pressure buildup, this can be a surgical emergency due
      to pressure on the brain. Currently, computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans are used to diagnose the condition, but a quick screening tool, such as
      use of ultrasound to screen for elevated ICP in the emergency department, would be of great
      benefit to the patients to expedite care. Previous studies have explored the use of bedside
      ultrasound to evaluate the optic nerve sheath diameter in children with shunts. However, to
      date, there have been no reported prospective observational studies that compared before and
      after ultrasound measurements of the ONSD in patients in whom shunt failure is diagnosed and
      treated. Of note, this study is observational and the measurements taken with the ultrasound
      machine will not be used for clinical decision making. The measurements in this study will
      have no clinical impact on patient care. The use of ultrasound to measure the ONSD is an
      already accepted application of ultrasound.
