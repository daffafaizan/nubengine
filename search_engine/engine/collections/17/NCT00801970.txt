      define it as an anxiety disorder while it is often defined as a form of phobia; some regard
      only the pre-pregnancy period, some regard the anxiety during pregnancy and some focus on the
      labor process. Despite the high prevalence (between 13%-20% of fertile women), research in
      this area is scarce and the current findings are incohesive due to various conceptualizations
      of the phenomenon and to various measurement methods.
