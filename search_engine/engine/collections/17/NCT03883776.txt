    
      In the first part of the study, six healthy volunteers will undergo several sequential
      whole-body PET/CT scans starting from the moment of tracer injection up to six hours post
      injection for an initial safety assessment and dosimetry study of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide in
      humans.

      In the second part of the study, six neuroendocrine tumor patients, with at least five
      positive lesions on routine clinical 68Ga-DOTA-peptide PET, will undergo a dynamic PET scan
      for the first 45 minutes, followed by three single static whole-body PET/CTs up to three
      hours post injection for an initial efficacy assessment (evaluation of the lesion detection
      rate) and pharmacokinetics study of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide in humans. Furthermore a first
      comparison with 68Ga-DOTA peptide PET will be performed.
