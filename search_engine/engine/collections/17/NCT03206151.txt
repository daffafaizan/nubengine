      chemotherapy alone or with CMAB009 and will then be treated until progression of the disease
      or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Regular efficacy assessments（every 8 weeks）based on
      imaging will be performed throughout the study together with regular safety assessments.

      After participant discontinuation from the trial, regular updates on further treatments and
      survival status will be requested from the investigator.
