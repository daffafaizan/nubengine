    
      In the dose-escalation phase, escalating doses of etrumadenant in combination with
      carboplatin and pemetrexed at standard doses (Arm A), and etrumadenant in combination with
      carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab (Arm B), may be assessed in participants with
      advanced NSCLC. Eligible participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as
      well as IV infused carboplatin, pemetrexed, with or without pembrolizumab in this phase. The
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of etrumadenant will be determined upon completion of
      the dose-escalation phase.

      In the dose-expansion phase, zimberelimab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Arm
      1), and etrumadenant at RDE in combination with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and zimberelimab
      (Arm 2) may be assessed in eligible NSCLC participants who harbor an EGFR mutation and have
      progressed on EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) treatment(s).

      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated.

      Treatment may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons
      specified in the protocol.
