      mainly based on left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA class. This criteria are too
      robust, approximately 2/3 of ICD recipients do not profit from this treatment in the
      following 5 years, especially those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. We plan to
      sub-stratify this group of patients with both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy by:
      non-linear heart rate variability analysis, microvolt T-wave alternans, QRT-T angle and
      character and amount of left ventricular scarring assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.
      Pre-implantation values will be correlated with numbers and character of ICD therapy (both
      anti-tachycardial pacing and ICD discharge). The results may allow to decrease the number of
      patients, who do not profit from ICD treatment.
