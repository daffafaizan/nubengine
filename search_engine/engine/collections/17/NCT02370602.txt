      phosphodiesterase10A (PDE10A) occupancy in the brain following a single dose of TAK-063. This
      study used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to look at changes in the volume of
      tissue distribution before and after TAK-063 administration to calculate PDE10A occupancy in
      the brain.

      The study enrolled 13 participants. Participants were assigned to a treatment group based on
      an enrollment schedule. The first 4 participants were assigned to the Pilot Cohort and
      received one dose of TAK-063 30 mg or 1000 mg tablets. The remaining participants were
      enrolled into the Main Cohort and received one dose of TAK-063 at 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg.
      Participants in both cohorts also received 3 separate intravenous infusions of [^11C]T-773 <8
      μg; 400MBq ± 10% followed by a PET scan.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in Sweden. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 46 days. Participants made 3 visits to the clinic, including one 3-day period of
      confinement to the clinic. Participants were contacted by phone on Day 16 for follow-up
      safety assessments.
