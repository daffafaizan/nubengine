      primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This was a Phase IIA dose escalation study of
      sodium nitrite to determine its safety in patients with aneurysmal SAH and to establish its
      pharmacokinetics during a 14 day infusion.

      Sodium nitrite was delivered intravenously for 14 days in 18 patients with SAH from a
      ruptured cerebral aneurysm using a dose escalation scheme in three cohorts of 6 patients each
      (3 nitrite, 3 saline), with a maximum dose of 64 nmol/min/kg. Sodium nitrite blood levels
      were frequently sampled and measured using mass spectroscopy and blood methemoglobin levels
      were continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter.
