        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma
           (KS) treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12.

        -  Determine the time to response and the number of complete responses in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Provide pilot information on the ability of interleukin-12 to maintain major responses
           induced with paclitaxel salvage therapy in patients with aggressive or life-threatening
           KS after treatment failure with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on CD4 counts and viral load in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome (LipoDox) IV over 30 minutes once every 3
      weeks for a total of 6 doses. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of LipoDox, patients
      also receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) for
      up to 3 years.

      Patients with refractory disease are transferred to the paclitaxel salvage therapy regimen
      comprising paclitaxel IV continuously on days 1-4 once every 3 weeks until a major response
      is achieved. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of paclitaxel salvage therapy,
      patients also receive IL-12 as above for up to 3 years.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response may discontinue IL-12 administration. If necessary, IL-12
      treatment may resume at a later time.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4 years.
