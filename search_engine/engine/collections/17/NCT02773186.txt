      years undergoing a major surgery using general anesthesia. Cerebral oxygen saturation,
      non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and heart rate were recorded at the following
      stages of the surgical intervention: baseline, induction, intubation, surgical incision, end
      of surgery, and extubation. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated by using the modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale, and NPOBC was determined by using the Post-Hospital Behaviour
      Questionnaire on 7th and 28th postoperative days. A logistic regression was created to
      identify factors associated with the development of NPOBC
