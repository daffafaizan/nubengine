    
      In this study, the medication (an antibiotic which is used to treat or prevent infections)
      will be compared with a placebo. A placebo is something that looks like a "real" medication,
      but it doesn't contain any active medication. As a participant in this study, you may receive
      the active medication (Cefazolin Sodium Injection or Clindamycin) or you may receive a
      placebo.
