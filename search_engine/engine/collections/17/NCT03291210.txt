      hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction, increased perfusion heterogeneity, and resultant
      myocardial injury. Previous studies have been observed higher mortality in patient group
      maintained with supranormal oxygenation after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. However, the
      effect of hyperoxia vs. normoxia on myocardial injury during transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) has not been well investigated. We hypothesized that the normoxic group
      would have lower myocardial injury compared to hyperoxic group after TAVR.
