      randomised to a treatment arm of 4 units of platelets for every day they have a platelet
      count <20x10^3/uL, or a control arm with supportive care. Patients will be followed up daily
      till hospital discharge, and again at day 21.

      It is assumed that the incidence of bleeding from randomization to Day 7 or discharge,
      whichever earlier, is 10% for the control (no transfusion) group and 5% for the intervention
      (transfusion) group. With 1:1 allocation ratio, to attain 80% power and one-sided 5% type I
      error rate, the required number of subjects in each arm is 382 by a Chi-square test with
      Yates' continuity correction. If a drop-out rate of 5% is allowed, the required number
      increases to approximately 400 per arm.
