      third trimester of pregnancy (Rodney JR, Huntley BJ, Rodney WM, 2012). An increase in the FHR
      of 5-25 beats per min (bpm) in response to maternal exercise has been established as a normal
      reaction(Riemann,Kanstrup Hansen, 2000)however the normal FHR response to maternal exercise
      has remained unclear for several reasons

      Most of the studies are focused on obtain data in order to examine the fetal heart rate
      response to maternal exercise using cardiotocography measurements prior to and following
      maternal exercise
