      endoprosthesis (stent-grafting) or antihypertensive management (medical treatment). Only
      stable patients without spontaneous false lumen thrombosis 14 days after index dissection
      were considered eligible for study inclusion. Long-term outcome measures included all-cause
      mortality, aorta-specific mortality and a cluster endpoint (reflecting progression of
      disease, conversion and additional interventions); the analysis is based on 140 randomized
      cases followed for at least 5 years.
