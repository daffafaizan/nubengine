      the prevention of postoperative morbidity. If cysto-biliary connections are not obvious,
      diagnosis is not easy. Intraoperative bile leakage test has been shown to reduce
      postoperative biliary complications by revealing occult CBCs. However, bile leakage testing
      in emergency conditions such as hydatid cyst perforation has not been experienced so far.

      Here, a bile leakage test performed in a 23-year-old male patient undergoing emergency
      surgery due to the perforation of the hydatid liver cyst was presented. Following the
      treatment of perforated hydatid liver cyst and biliary peritonitis, a bile leakage test was
      performed. The common bile duct was cannulated with a 22 Gauge catheter, normal saline and
      parenteral lipid solution were given to demonstrate the CBCs, and leakage areas were suture
      ligated. The patient was discharged postoperatively without any problem.

      The investigators recommend detection and treatment of the CBCs even in emergency hydatid
      liver cyst surgery for prevention of postoperative biliary complications.
