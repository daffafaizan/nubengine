      aimed to examine a possible beneficial effect of relaxation guided imagery on pain. This will
      be a phase I, controlled, single blind and randomized efficacy study in 2 parallel groups.
      The study will include a baseline assessment of pain severity where after the intervention
      group will undergo relaxation guided imagery and the control group will listen to relaxing
      music. After these relaxation session patients will receive a CD with either relaxation
      guided imagery or relaxing music to listen to at home. Pain severity will be recorded for the
      following 6 weeks.
