      efficacy of adjuvant therapy with sodium bicarbonate for tumor related pain. Patients will
      receive sodium bicarbonate (0.15 g/kg/day for 1 weeks and if tolerated 0.3 g/kg/day for one
      week and if this dose is tolerated 0.6 g/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The sodium bicarbonate will be
      provided to the patient as a powder and consumed after it is mixed with about 250 cc (about 1
      cup) of water. In consultation with the PI, the patients will be permitted to mix the sodium
      bicarbonate with a commercially available drink instead of water provided the liquid has an
      acid/base balance (pH) of 7.4 or greater. Patients with a good tolerance to study therapy and
      with at least a 30% improvement in pain intensity (by VAS) compared to baseline after 3 weeks
      of therapy and who wish to continue study therapy will be allowed to continue sodium
      bicarbonate therapy under the direction of their treating physician. Patients without at
      least a 30% improvement in pain intensity at 3 weeks will discontinue study therapy.
