    
      This open study will have two parallel groups based on the vaccination received in the
      primary study: AC primed Group: primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine and AC unprimed
      Group (control): primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine. All subjects will receive a
      booster dose of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age with GSK
      Biological's OPV vaccine given concomitantly and a dose of Mencevax™ ACW vaccine at 24 to 30
      months of age. Blood sampling will be done prior to (pre) and one month after (post) the
      Mencevax™ ACW vaccine administration for immunogenicity analyses. The study will last minimum
      7 to maximum 16 months per subject.

      Mencevax™ ACWY was changed to Mencevax™ ACW throughout the posting to correct an
      inconsistency in the earlier version of the protocol posting and to reflect the actual
      situation.
