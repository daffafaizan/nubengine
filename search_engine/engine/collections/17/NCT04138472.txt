      discharge which results in intense cardiovascular reflex i.e. tachycardia and hypertension.
      In this study we will compare effects of intravenous dexmedetomidine, fentanyl and lidocaine
      for attenuation of these reflexes in patient undergoing laproscopic cholecystectomy. how
      these agents will effect hemodynamic response during pneumoperitoneum. Tertiary objective
      will be to observe sedation, perioperative complications and recovery in these patients.
