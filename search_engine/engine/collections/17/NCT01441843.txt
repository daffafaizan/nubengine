      surgery, many patients have negative feelings about the surgical procedure. These anxieties
      have various negative effects. To reduce this resistance preoperative administration of an
      anxiolytic drug is administered, typically a benzodiazepine. The investigators know that
      benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety, but up to now there is nog good scientific
      evidence about the effectiveness of lorazepam on the quality of recovery in day-case surgery
      patients.

      The ultimate goal of our research project is to identify patients who would benefit from
      preoperative benzodiazepine administration and who not. Identification would substantially
      contribute to optimal medical decision making.
