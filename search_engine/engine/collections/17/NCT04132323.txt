      which have a high frequency of adverse events. According to histological studies the safest
      concentration for the treatment of telangiectasias is less than that specified in the
      official instructions. The concentration of sodium tetradecyl sulfate 0.15% was effective and
      did not cause any adverse reactions in the treatment of telangiectasias from 0.8 to 1 mm in
      diameter. Small telangiectases (0.5 mm or less) require the treatment with the less
      aggressive sclerosing agent. Perhaps, the sodium tetradecyl sulfate 0.15%, 0.1% or even 0.05%
      and hypertonic glucose may be more effective and safe in this situation.
