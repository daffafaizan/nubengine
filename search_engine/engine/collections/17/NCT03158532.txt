      cardiovascular procedures in many centers worldwide. This is largely driven by the evidence
      supporting an unequivocal reduction in access site-related complications associated with TRA
      compared with transfemoral access, as well as reduction in cost and increased patient
      comfort. The radial artery occlusion (RAO) is the main inconvenient and impose a limitation
      of future use of the radial artery as an access site for catheterization in the future. RAO
      is the most commun complication of transradial access, and its incidence continues to reach
      up to 12%.

      Nitrates in intra-arterial have been widely studied in prevention of this spasm.
      Nitroglycerin binds to the surface of endothelial cells and undergoes two chemical reductions
      to form nitric oxide (NO). The nitric oxide then moves out of the endothelial cell and into
      an adjacent smooth muscle cell, where it promotes the formation of cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate (cGMP), which then promotes muscle relaxation. Current data show that
      nitroglycerin intra-arterial at the end of the procedure reduce the incidence of radial
      artery occlusion.

      A big sheath to artery size ratio could reduce the incidence of RAO, so the main objective of
      this study is to evaluate whether administration of nitroglycerin at the start of a
      transradial procedure may preserve the patency of the radial artery; as well, confirm if
      nitroglycerin administration just before sheet removal helps to keep the radial artery
      patency.
