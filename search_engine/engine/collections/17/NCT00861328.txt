    
      This is an open-label, 2-arm, dose-escalation combination-therapy study in which patients
      with advanced malignancies will be assigned by the Investigator to dosing with either
      irinotecan plus ON 01910.Na (Group A), or oxaliplatin plus ON 01910.Na (Group B). The
      Investigator will make this assignment using clinical judgment, taking into consideration the
      patient's tumor type, UGT1A1 genotype when applicable (i.e., patients considered for
      treatment in Group A will be tested for UGT1A1 genotype, if not already known, and patients
      homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele will be excluded from Group A), prior treatment, and
      current clinical condition. Patients will be enrolled in 1 of 8 Cohorts (4 sequential Cohorts
      in Group A and 4 in Group B) of 3 patients each. Up to 6 additional patients will be tested
      at the MTD. Groups A and B will enroll and proceed simultaneously.
