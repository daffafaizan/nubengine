      NIH precision medicine initiative. Stroke gait impairments adversely affect kinematics and
      kinetics in all paretic lower limb joints, disrupt stance and swing phases, and are marked by
      inter-limb asymmetry. One intervention cannot target all post-stroke gait deficits. Multiple
      factors, including biomechanics, energy cost, and functioning and integrity of corticomotor
      neural pathways can influence stroke gait function and training-induced gait improvements.

      The study seeks to develop an understanding of how, why, and for whom fast treadmill walking
      (Fast) and Fast with functional electrical stimulation (FastFES) induce clinical benefits,
      allowing future development of cutting-edge, individually-tailored gait treatments that
      enhance both gait quality and gait function.
