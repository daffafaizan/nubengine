      morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain associated with nicotine withdrawal may
      attenuate some of the beneficial health effects and is cited as a major obstacle to quit
      smoking. The mechanism for the weight gain is not elucidated but reduced resting metabolic
      rate, reduced total energy expenditure, increased caloric intake and changes in fat
      metabolism may be involved. Elucidating effective strategies to prevent or reduce
      post-cessation weight gain may improve health outcomes of smoking cessation.
