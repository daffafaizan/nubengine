      anticoagulation for preventing thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.
      Whereas most complications associated with LAAC have decreased over time, the occurrence of
      device thrombosis remains a concern, with an incidence of 1 to 17%. Antithrombotic therapy
      for preventing device thrombosis following LAAC has evolved empirically, with antiplatelet
      therapy being the most commonly prescribed treatment. However, the rates of device thrombosis
      post-LAAC remain relatively high and have not decreased over time despite of increasing
      operator/center experience and the arrival of newer generation devices. This is of particular
      concern if we consider that LAAC is a preventive treatment. Experimental and mechanistic
      studies have suggested enhanced thrombin generation (and not platelet activation) within the
      days-weeks following the procedure as the most important mechanism involved in device
      thrombosis and appropriate short-term anticoagulation therapy with DOAC should translate into
      a significant reduction in the rate of device thrombosis post-LAAC.

      Therefore, the objective of the study is to compare short-term (8 weeks) anticoagulation
      therapy (DOAC) vs. antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of device thrombosis following
      transcatheter LAAC.

      It is estimated tha 350 patients will take part in the study. Considering the lack of data on
      DOAC therapy post-LAAC, a blinded interim analysis will be performed after the inclusion of
      the first 150 patients. The final sample size will be adjusted following the results of the
      blinded interim analysis.
