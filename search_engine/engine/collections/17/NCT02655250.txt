      low income setting, this validation study will be conducted to verify the validity of our
      proposed field collection methods for stool and breast milk samples. We will compare the
      microbial diversity and abundance in the biologic samples using various proposed field
      collection methods to an immediately frozen sample. The proposed field collection methods are
      feasible for use in a community-based study in a low income setting with limited access to
      cold storage.
