      compared to patients without diarrhoea after right-sided colon cancer treatment.

      All patients will be asked to answer a short questionnaire regarding bowel function, and they
      will all have standard blood tests taken to exclude non-cancer related causes of diarrhoea.
      Besides these standard tests, the value of FGF19 will be measured in a blood sample from the
      fasting participants. All participants will undergo SeHCAT scan to determine the presence of
      bile acid malabsorption among right-sided colon cancer patients with and without diarrhoea.
      In addition, a glucose breath test will be performed to examine, if the patients have small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

      Patients with a positive glucose breath test, and thus bacterial overgrowth, will be treated
      with antibiotics, followed by another SeHCAT scan, glucose breath test, and measurement of
      gastrointestinal transit time. In addition, they will be asked to complete the questionnaire
      regarding bowel function again. All cases with an abnormal SeHCAT scan will be treated with a
      bile acid binder, and the patients will be asked to complete the questionnaire one more time,
      and the GITT measurement will be repeated.
