      side effects and medication adherence on a daily basis. Side effects (e.g., pain, fatigue,
      diarrhea, nausea) can be physically and emotionally debilitating, and when uncontrolled, can
      cause treatment complications, resulting in unscheduled care costs, patient out-of-pocket
      costs, and delays or discontinuation of treatment. The app allows personalization of daily
      entries such that patients can select the specific medications and dosage and side effects
      (using items from the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) that they and/or
      their providers want to track. A charting feature provides an easy-to-read display of
      patients' daily reports, summarizing the intensity and frequency of side effects and
      medication use either by week or by month. These reports can also be printed out and shared
      with providers.
