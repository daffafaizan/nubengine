      by affecting balance and gait pattern. However, little is known regarding the best footwear
      for hospital inpatients in whom approximately 40% of older persons fall during their hospital
      admission. Patients admitted to hospital without their own footwear (slippers or shoes) are
      routinely given foam slippers referred to as pillow paws (PPs). There are concerns that these
      PPs may contribute to falls as they are often ill fitting (come in a very limited size range)
      and or are flimsy offering little foot and ankle support. Hence Medicine for the Elderly
      consultant and registrars designed this study to gain information on differences in balance,
      mobility and confidence when patients are wearing different footwear types. As a secondary
      outcome, falls data will also be collected to see whether there is any association between
      footwear types and inpatient falls incidence.

      The aim is to compare pillow paws (PPs) with sturdy outdoor footwear or sturdy slippers. In
      this way we hope to gain information on which footwear type is most beneficial to hospital
      inpatients. A recent similar study infers that sturdy outdoor footwear benefits outpatients,
      but it is not clear whether the same applies to a hospital inpatient population whom are
      often frailer with greater co-morbidities (physical and mental) and a higher falls risk.
