      I. To determine the antitumor activity of PXD 101 as a single agent in the following patient
      population using objective response rates (complete and partial): a) Platinum resistant
      ovarian carcinoma (progression within 6 months of platinum based therapy); b) Micropapillary
      / borderline (Low Malignant potential) ovarian carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the antitumor activity of PXD 101 with regards to stable disease rates,
      duration of response, progression- free, median and overall survival rates as well as
      determine the safety and tolerability this drug.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between clinical and pharmacodynamic effects of PXD101 in
      patients with platinum resistant and micropapillary tumors undergoing treatment with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
