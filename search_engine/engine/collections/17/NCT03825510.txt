      approach to stimulating the immune response which is a critical option in the treatment of
      metastatic NSCLC. However, progression free survival (PFS) is increased by only 2-4 months
      and median overall survival (OS) by 3-9 months.

      There is compelling evidence that PFS is increased up to 3 fold and OS by 2 fold in patients
      receiving a course of radiation therapy while on immunotherapy. Radiotherapy is known to
      induce immunogenic tumor cell death and upregulation of dendritic cells and antigen
      presentation leading to activation of cytotoxic T-Cells. Dramatic T-cell activation has been
      demonstrated where tumor regression occurs outside the radiation treatment field in a
      phenomenon termed the abscopal effect and is associated with high dose radiation delivered
      via SBRT.

      As such, SBRT activation of T-cells could be complementary to immunotherapy and enhance
      T-cell mediated killing via PD-L1 blockade which could lead to lasting and durable tumor
      response with improved progression free survival and overall survival.
