      Due to a growing recognition of its role, recent studies have focused on inflammatory markers
      and their association with outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI). Recently, our single center study demonstrated that preprocedural
      neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio is an independent predictor of impaired coronary flow after
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and of in-hospital major advanced cardiac
      events (MACE) in patients with STEMI.Several previous studies also evaluated the role of N/L
      ratio in long-term outcomes among patients with STEMI; however, they evaluated the
      association between long-term mortality and in-hospital N/L ratio, they were single-center
      studies and they evaluated a relatively small study population.

      In the present multicenter experience, the investigators aimed to investigate the association
      of the preprocedural N/L ratio with the in-hospital and long-term outcomes in patients with
      STEMI undergoing primary PCI.
