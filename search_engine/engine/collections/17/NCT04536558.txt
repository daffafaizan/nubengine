    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase III study assessing the
      efficacy and safety of Olanzapine plus fosaprepitant plus ondansetron and dexamethasone
      versus fosaprepitant plus ondansetron and dexamethasone in the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving high emetic risk multi-day
      chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either olanzapine plus
      fosaprepitant standard antiemetic therapy or fosaprepitant standard antiemetic therapy in a
      1:1 ratio.
