      in anterior esthetic region were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned into
      three groups; de-epithelialized connective tissue graft harvesting technique or; conditioning
      the exposed root surfaces with Er,Cr:YSGG laser before connective tissue coverage using
      scalpel blade harvested de-epithelialized connective tissue graft harvesting technique, or;
      conditioning the exposed root surfaces with the Er,Cr:YSGG laser before Er,Cr:YSGG laser
      harvested connective tissue using de-epithelialized technique. Clinical and radiographic
      parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3, 6 and 9 months postoperatively.
