      is linked to lower stool weight. The objective of this study is to feed liquid diets, with
      and without added fiber, to healthy human subjects to determine if mixed fiber sources can
      normalize stool weight. Secondary objectives of the study include measurement of gut
      microbiota and stool chemistry with fiber addition.
