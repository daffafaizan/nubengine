      anesthesiologists. Although new upper airway devices, such as Trachway (R), a video-assisted
      intubating stylet, had been developed for facilitating airway management.

      The larger size and the complexity of DLT than single-lumen tube (SLT) makes the difficulties
      for DLT intubation. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the
      effects of Trachway(R)compared with direct laryngoscope in DLT intubation.
