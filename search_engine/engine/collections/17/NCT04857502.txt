      I. To define the biodistribution of 99mTc-based PSMA imaging and surgery agent
      (99mTc-PSMA-I&S) in normal and malignant tissues of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) with
      histopathology validation, when available.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the 99mTc-PSMA-I&S accumulation within tumor lesions observed by in-vivo
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ex-vivo gamma measurements and level of
      prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression quantified by histopathology, when
      available.

      II. To define the best time-point for radio-guided surgery (RGS) with the highest
      tumor-to-background ratio following 99mTc-PSMA-I&S administration.

      OUTLINE:

      The first 5 patients receive an initial dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S intravenously (IV) followed by
      5 SPECT/CT scans at 3-5, 5-20, 17-21, 25-29, and 40-46 hours later. These 5 patients then
      receive a second dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S IV and then undergo standard of care surgery. All
      subsequent patients receive one dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S IV before surgery.
