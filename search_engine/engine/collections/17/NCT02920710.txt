      sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis affecting the leptomeninges, spinal cord, or brain parenchyma
      portends a difficult course and frequently results in severe disability or death (1).
      Treatment of moderate and severe CNS sarcoidosis typically involves a combination of
      corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents such as methotrexate (2). Unfortunately, most response
      rates are reportedly only in the 29-38% range for corticosteroids alone, and the effects of
      cytotoxic agents in sarcoidosis require up to 6 months to occur. A typical scenario is that
      patients are treated for prolonged periods with high dose glucocorticoids with suboptimal
      effectiveness despite development of substantial toxicities. Some series report that
      cyclophosphamide or infliximab may be beneficial (3), but these approaches are limited by
      potentially severe toxicities, loss of effectiveness, or payor constraints.

      . ACTHAR is a 39-amino acid peptide natural form of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that
      was initially approved in 1952 by the FDA. It has since been approved for 19 indications
      including respiratory sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and infantile spasms.
