        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small
           cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin vs gemcitabine and paclitaxel
           vs paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Compare the overall response rate and time to progression in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to weight
      loss within the past 6 months (less than 5% vs at least 5%), disease stage (IIIB vs IV), and
      brain metastases (present vs absent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin
           IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and paclitaxel
           IV over 3 hours on day 1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15-30
           minutes on day 1.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks during study treatment, and then every
      3 months until progressive disease is documented.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,134 patients (378 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
