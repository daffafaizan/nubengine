      anthocyanidins) as an adjunct therapy with the conventional chemotherapy drug
      paclitaxel/docetaxel for treatment of NSCLC. The study is based on information from published
      studies in which blueberry anthocyanidins (bioflavonoids which give blueberries their color)
      have been shown to regulate a vast array of molecular targets, and on our own exciting and
      compelling preliminary data showing that blueberry anthocyanidins elicited potent synergistic
      chemo-sensitizing effects in two highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
      lines.
