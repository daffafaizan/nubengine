        -  Collect blood samples for DNA extraction for genetic studies from patients receiving
           chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Collect detailed clinical, pathological, and chemotherapy data from these patients.

        -  Identify genetic factors that relate to treatment response and outcome in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected and relevant genes and regions are amplified by PCR. PCR
      products are then sequenced or genotyped for known biological markers and single nucleotide
      polymorphisms. Tumor samples from surplus pathology specimens are analyzed for expression of
      candidate genes and mutation in the candidate genes.

      Clinical and family history data is also collected by questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.
