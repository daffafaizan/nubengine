      probe that exploits elastic-scattering spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Both of
      these technique have independently shown to provide signatures for the onset of cancer, with
      varied success. The purpose of this effort is to combine the two techniques and develop and
      understanding of the signatures obtained in both normal and abnormal oral tissue with
      simultaneous collection of these optical signatures.
