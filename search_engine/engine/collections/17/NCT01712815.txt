      2'-fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil-clevudine (FMAU) (fluorine F 18-clevudine
      ) in 10 patients with known breast cancer to obtain data on safety, circulating metabolite,
      tumor imaging feasibility, and radiation dosimetry. II. Assess the potential utility of
      FMAU-PET in the imaging evaluation of chemotherapeutic response in 15 patients with breast
      cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorine F18-clevudine intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and
      then undergo PET/CT scan at baseline. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      positive (HER2+) breast cancer also undergo fluorine F 18-clevudine PET/CT scan 2-3 weeks
      after the first course of treatment and after completion of treatment. After completion of
      study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours.
