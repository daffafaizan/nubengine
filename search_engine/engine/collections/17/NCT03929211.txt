    
      Primary Objective(s):

        -  To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of CPI-613 and
           Hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients with high risk MDS who have failed
           hypomethylating therapy.

        -  To determine the overall response rate (complete remission (CR), marrow CR, partial
           remission (PR), Hematologic improvement (HI)) of high risk MDS patients who have failed
           hypomethylating agents, treated with the combination of CPI-613 and the maximally
           tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To assess the safety of the combination

        -  To assess progression-free-survival (PFS)

        -  To assess the overall survival of MDS patients who have failed hypomethylating agents
           treated with the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine defined as the time from
           enrolment on study to death from any cause.

        -  To assess any changes in the frequency of blood transfusions

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine, followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatments repeat every 14 days for 2 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients
      receive hydroxychloroquine PO and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days
      1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
