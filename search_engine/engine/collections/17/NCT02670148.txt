      patient-reported outcomes in participants with low back pain (LBP) treated with chiropractic
      care, providing evidence that may enhance our understanding of the relationship between
      functional outcomes and chiropractic care. The findings from this study may support the use
      of chiropractic care for military personnel as an effective, conservative treatment for low
      back pain that may also help preserve or improve functional outcomes and thus, allow active
      duty personnel to better perform the physical demands required of them.
