      clinical questions about circulatory failure mechanisms. The objective of the study is to
      assess the agreement between these answers and those of the expert physician in patients
      admitted in the emergency department with a circulatory failure due to sepsis or not.
      Emergency physicians will volunteer to take part in a basic training on echocardiography. The
      training will include 4 hours of theory, 2 hours of interactive clinical cases and 6 hours of
      tutored practice at patients' bedside (10 to 15 examinations). The objective of the practice
      sessions will be to learn the technical grounds of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the
      different views and to identify the anatomical structures. The second part of the study will
      start after the training. Each eligible patient will be successively assessed by two
      investigators: one emergency physician recently trained and the expert physician. The
      echocardiography will be performed as soon as possible in the emergency department before or
      after the initiation of treatment without delaying it. The order of hemodynamic assessments
      will be random depending on the availability of the investigators; both assessments will
      however be performed within 30 minutes. Each investigator will independently read the
      echocardiography in real time at patients' bedside. They will then answer a limited list of
      standardized questions using two-choice answers or predefined choices. Finally investigators
      will choose a therapeutic proposition among a predefined list based on the answers. Only the
      results of the echocardiography performed by the expert physician will be used in patient
      management.
