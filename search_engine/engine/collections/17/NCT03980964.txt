    
      The study will be conducted at Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, located in New York,
      New York, and involve a total of 120 patients. All study patients will be evenly divided into
      two groups: (a) conductive garment and mobile app with NMES therapy; (b) conductive garment
      and mobile app without NMES therapy (sham).

      Eligible patients will be evaluated according to the time and events schedule. Clinical
      outcomes will be assessed from 1 to 10 days before day of intervention and followed up after
      intervention over a 24 weeks Â± 1 week study period.

      These two groups will be analyzed using several outcome measures including validated
      patient-reported outcome measures including Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain level, the Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) JR., KOOS ADL, and WOMAC survey. Functional
      measures include isometric quadriceps strength, Time Up and Go (TUG), 6 minute walk test,
      repeated chair rise test, stair climb test, and number of steps recorded by an Apple Watch
      Series 3 or a Samsung watch. Reduction of use of anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) and
      narcotics, use of ambulation assist devices, plan for TKA procedure survey, device compliance
      use, and patient satisfaction survey will be tracked The primary endpoint for the study is
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain The proprietary app for this product will be used to track
      device usage (intensity, duration of session, frequency of use), VAS, WOMAC, and KOOS JR.
