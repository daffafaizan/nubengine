      Both conditions are characterized by increased inflammation and oxidative stress and are
      associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Our previous work shows that insulin exerts a prompt and powerful anti-inflammatory effect,
      on circulating blood cells and in plasma in healthy subjects and in critically ill patients.

      Toll like receptors (TLRs) recognize bacterial and viral products like endotoxin and viruses
      and are major determinants of the inflammatory response against foreign pathogens. In view of
      the recent data showing that TLRs recognize a range of molecules and proteins that are not of
      pathogenic source like saturated lipids and that TLRs are involved in the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis which leads to cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance which leads to
      type 2 diabetes (DM) we hypothesized that insulin infusion suppresses TLRs expression.

      Our preliminary data show that insulin infusion for 4 hours reduces the levels of many TLRs
      and thus might protect from inflammation induced conditions We therefore propose to
      investigate, in more detail, the effect of infusing different doses of insulin on TLRs mRNA
      and protein levels and its activity in obese and DM subjects over a longer infusion period
      and a larger number of subjects in circulating white blood cells and in fat tissue. Also we
      will be comparing the baseline levels of TLRs and TLRs related proteins as well as their
      modulation by insulin between normal, obese and DM subjects.
