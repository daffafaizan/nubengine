      perform two identical experimental tests: one test without an exoskeleton and another one
      using the exoskeleton. To avoid sequence bias, the test order will be randomized (balanced).
      The labor operation will be simulated. This operation will consist of lifting the load, which
      is 20 kg off the floor, walking 1.5m to a surface with a height of 70 cm to put it on, the
      frequency of lifting is 1 time in 30 seconds. The work will be performed for 105 minutes,
      then a break of 15 minutes, then 105 minutes of work. Heart rate (Polar) will be monitored.
      An ergospirometric device (Metamax) will be used to collect muscle activity data (Trust-M,
      Myoton), inertial sensors (Trust-M) will be used to evaluate the biomechanics of movements.
      In addition, questionnaires will be filled out for a subjective assessment of the use of
      exoskeleton prototypes (local discomfort scale, exoskeleton properties assessment
      questionnaire).
