      radiation treatment in which a pre-planned quality improvement default option for radiation
      treatment prescriptions will be introduced throughout the network of Penn Radiation Oncology.
      This study is a prospectively designed, observational trial with two comparison groups: (1) a
      usual practice group (control group) and (2) a default radiation treatment prescription group
      (intervention group), in which the usual practice group will subsequently rollover from
      control to intervention so that all sites and physicians in the practice network of Penn
      Radiation Oncology are exposed to intervention. The purpose of this study is to reduce
      preference sensitive, unnecessary daily imaging during radiation treatment with the
      implementation of a quality improvement initiative within 5 sites of Penn Radiation Oncology.
      We aim to leverage the introduction of a default prescription option to reduce the use of
      daily imaging in palliative intent cases where it has limited clinical benefit and adds to
      cost burden. Our objective is to encourage more patient-centric clinical practice.
