      planned peri-anal procedure, which will subsequently be performed with standard instruments,
      will allow us to observe the ease of insertion, the expansion of the blades, and the creation
      of the operative field achieved. If necessary, we will modify our design based on these
      findings. When a successful, operating room prototype is established, the device will be
      suitable for clinical use and the stated benefits thereof.
