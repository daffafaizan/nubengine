      periodontal pocket.

      All patients who need root canal treatment would be screened to determine the periodontal
      condition for possible involvement in this study. They would be grouped into two groups,
      normal and periodontitis Group.

      Included teeth will be dried with 4x4 gauze then tested with a cold test using Endo-Ice and
      electric pulp tester (EPT). Similar or adjacent teeth with no caries, restorations, or a
      history of the previous injury will be used as controls for that patient.

      Upon accessing the tooth, no bleeding was counted as necrotic and any presence of blood was
      counted as a vital pulp
