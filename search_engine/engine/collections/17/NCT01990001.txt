        1. Measure the difference in reminder utilization over three months between patients who
           are assisted with initiating the reminder system during their office visit versus those
           who are encouraged to self-initiate after the visit.

        2. Assess whether provider-assisted enrollment in the online reminder system improves
           adherence to a short-term contraceptive regimen compared to self- initiated enrollment
           after the visit.
