      ischemia, supporting its use during invasive procedures for functional assessment of coronary
      lesions. Landmark randomized trials have demonstrated that deferral of nonsignificant lesions
      based on FFR is not only safe, but also that FFR-guided revascularization is associated with
      a better clinical outcome up to 2 years, when compared with standard angiography.

      In spite of the overwhelming evidence of its potential clinical and economic benefits and
      strong guideline recommendation, the adoption of FFR in the real-world is perceived to vary
      significantly. Reasons for this disparity are several, but most operators still do rely the
      most on angiographic eye-balling to decide on the functional significance of coronary lesions
      and the need for revascularization.

      Italy is the European country with the minor penetration of FFR as compared to the number of
      percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Accordingly, the Societ√† Italiana di Cardiologia Invasiva (SICI-GISE) conceived and promoted
      a prospective nationwide study to describe the patterns of the use of FFR in an unselected
      real-world population and to to assess the reasons, on clinical decision making, driving
      operators in the use or not of the FFR.
