      treatment of patients with leprosy reactions and nerve function impairment and that patients
      treated with ciclosporin would have fewer side effects than patients treated with
      prednisolone. A randomised controlled trial comparing ciclosporin and prednisolone in the
      treatment of acute leprosy T1R was conducted.
