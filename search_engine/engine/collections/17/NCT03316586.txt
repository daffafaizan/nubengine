      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of Nivolumab
      and Cabozantinib as a treatment for any disease.

      The FDA has not approved Cabozantinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for
      other uses. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for
      this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Cabozantinib has been used in some phase I studies and information from those other research
      studies suggests that cabozantinib may help to shrink or stabilize breast cancer.

      Cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system
      may control or even eliminate tumors. An antibody is a natural protein made by the immune
      system that binds other proteins and molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.
      Antibodies stimulating the immune system have been developed for treatment of human cancers.
      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active
      against cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participant's type of breast
      cancer responds to the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab.
