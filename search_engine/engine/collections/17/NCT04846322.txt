      delirium and dementia risk, referral of ED patients with undiagnosed cognitive impairment and
      dementia for primary care feedback and care recommendations. This pilot would gather
      observational data evaluating the feasibility of incorporating cognitive impairment screens
      into routine ED delirium assessments, and developing optimal work flow for identifying and
      referring ED patients with suspected (undiagnosed) dementia for confirmatory evaluation and
      care coordination.
