      Center is conducting a research study to test whether group singing therapy helps people with
      voice or speech disorders due to Parkinson's disease (PD). Communication problems, including
      loss of vocal loudness, affect many people with PD. While existing forms of speech therapy
      have been shown to be helpful, group singing may be a beneficial alternative to traditional
      speech therapy.

      The study will involve participating in weekly treatment sessions where subjects will receive
      training in vocal exercises from a speech-language pathologist with expertise in PD, as well
      as instructions for structured home practice. Participants will be assigned to a singing or
      non-singing group for the 12-week treatment phase of the study. Researchers will measure
      subjects' vocal function and communication-related quality of life before and several times
      after the 12-week program. All subjects and their care partners are welcome to participate in
      a singing group following the study.

      You may be eligible for this study if you have been diagnosed with PD for one year or more,
      and you have difficulty with your voice or speech such as quiet voice, or difficulty being
      understood.
