      KIR-ligand mismatched haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploBMT), for poor risk
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients. MM is a malignancy of plasma cells that usually resides in
      the bone marrow. Despite new treatment modalities that have been introduced in the last
      years, MM is still an incurable disease for most patients and median survival for the younger
      patients (<65) is about 5 years. MM can be treated by several disease modifiers - classical
      chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT),
      immunomodulators like thalidomide and lenalidomide, and drugs like bortezomib that interact
      with relevant intracellular pathways of malignant plasma cells. Though these treatment
      modalities have improved overall survival and quality of life, patients are not cured.
