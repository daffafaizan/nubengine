      parameters of patients undergoing major liver resection under xenon- compared to
      desflurane-anesthesia. Xenon is known to maintain hemodynamic stability and consecutive
      tissue perfusion. Together with its potential for ischemic pre-conditioning, we hypothesize a
      protective effect of xenon on post-operative liver failure and ischemia/reperfusion injury.
