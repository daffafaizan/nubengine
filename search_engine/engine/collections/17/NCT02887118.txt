      manifestations has been demonstrated in adults with sickle cell anemia.

      This factor has not been studied in children. The identification of predictive biomarkers of
      disease severity, especially of specific pediatric complications (cerebral vasculopathy,
      splenic sequestration, Dactylitis) would be useful for optimal care of the children and early
      intensification Red blood cell density might be one of these prognostic factors.
