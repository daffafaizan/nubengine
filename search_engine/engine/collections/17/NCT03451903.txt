      effective during the acute phase of cerebral infarction with proximal occlusion of the
      anterior circulation in reducing disability at three months. MT-only treatment has only been
      assessed retrospectively in subgroups of controlled studies, with a significant difference in
      favour of the treatment. These results have led to a discussion about the benefits of MT
      without IVT in cases of proximal occlusion or carotid terminus occlusion. Recent data are in
      favour of a better prognosis for patients benefiting from a combined procedure. The impact of
      IVT on the implementation of MT is widely disputed, in particular the speed of execution,
      which could be enhanced by IVT. The factors influencing the time span and success of
      reperfusion after an MT are still not well-known, IVT in particular. The investigators have
      made the assumption that IVT could have an effect on the success of MT by shortening the
      duration of the procedure and increasing the likelihood of satisfactory revascularisation.

      The investigators carried out a retrospective study based on data gathered prospectively by
      the Franche-Comt√© Stroke Registry. The investigators also considered other factors which
      could have affected the duration of the procedure or the rate of satisfactory
      revascularisation, including location of infarct, thrombus size and stroke aetiology.

      Hypothesis: the investigators have made the assumption that IVT could have an effect on the
      success of MT by shortening the duration of the procedure and increasing the likelihood of
      satisfactory revascularisation.
