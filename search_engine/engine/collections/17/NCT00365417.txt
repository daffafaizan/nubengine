      including those in breast cancer, demonstrated therapy could induce sufficient tumor
      regression to allow for the resection of otherwise unresectable tumors. Subsequent
      demonstration of the equivalence of lumpectomy to mastectomy in patients with operable breast
      cancer, stimulated interest in the concept of using preoperative chemotherapy to reduce
      large, but operable, primary tumors to allow for lumpectomy in women who would otherwise
      require a mastectomy. Given the data from previous studies, it is appropriate to continue
      development of sequential doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel regimens to improve on
      clinical and pathologic response rates. FB-4 is a Phase II, single arm study for women with
      locally advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer
      diagnosed by core needle biopsy. The primary aim of the study is to determine the pathologic
      complete response rate in the breast following neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with
      bevacizumab.
