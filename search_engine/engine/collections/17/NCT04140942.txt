      recidivate within 12 months of release. Employment significantly reduces the risk of
      recidivism for ex-offenders, and as such, is a critical target for intervention. However,
      evidence-based employment services are rarely delivered in prisons. Moreover, employment
      services that are available do not include evidence-based job interview training. Virtual
      Reality Job Interview Training (VR-JIT) is an evidence-based tool that was developed and
      evaluated with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. However, VR-JIT has a
      feature to practice discussing a prior conviction during a job interview that has not yet
      been evaluated. Given that an ex-offender's job interview outcome may depend on discussing
      their prior conviction, we are partnering with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC)
      to evaluate if delivering VR-JIT within their Vocational Village program can improve
      employment and reduce recidivism among offenders after their release from prison. Thus, there
      are two goals for this pilot study. We will evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of whether
      VR-JIT added to Vocational Village services-as-usual improves outcomes (interview skills,
      employment, recidivism) for offenders after their release from prison (at a 6-month follow-up
      visit). These preliminary data will support a proposal to a federal agency for a
      fully-powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-JIT with prison
      settings.
