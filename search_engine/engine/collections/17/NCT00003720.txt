      Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Evaluate the antitumor effects and biological activity of this regimen in these patients. IV.
      Determine the safety of this regimen on HIV replication and immune parameters in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 by intravenous
      injection twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients may continue treatment for a maximum of 1 year
      in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 6 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients
      each receive escalating doses of SU5416 on the same schedule. If DLT occurs in 2 of 6
      patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next lower dose is
      declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Six additional patients are treated at the MTD.
      Patients are followed at 30 days after the last treatment, and every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a maximum of 30 patients.
