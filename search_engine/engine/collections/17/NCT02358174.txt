      (MMPs) has been described previously. MMPs regulate extracellular structural proteins and
      tissue remodeling. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is involved in the
      regulation of MMP activity. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between the
      levels of MMPs and NGAL and different stages hemorrhoids.

      Methods. In a multicenter, open-label, prospective study, patients with hemorrhoids were
      recruited and represented the Group I (patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids - Grade I to IV
      sec. Goligher), a further group of healthy volunteer subjects were also recruited as the
      control group (Group II).

      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis will evaluate the levels of
      immunoreactive MMPs and NGAL in all patients with hemorrhoids.
