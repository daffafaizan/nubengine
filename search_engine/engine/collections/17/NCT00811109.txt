      ill patients despite advances in renal replacement therapy (RRT). Over the last few years,
      new devices in dialysis equipment, such as blood temperature and blood volume on-line
      monitors, have been developed to improve hemodynamic tolerance, and these new modalities have
      demonstrated their positive impact on decrease in intra-dialytic hypotension rate in chronic
      hemodialysis patients. In order to evaluate these new devices in critically ill patients with
      acute kidney injury we decided to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial.

      We based calculation of the sample size on a power analysis that assumed an expected decrease
      in intra-dialytic hypotension rate of 40% (from a crude intra-dialytic hypotension rate of
      30% to 18%) in groups B and C, compared with group A. Analysis is done by intention to treat,
      according to prescribed new dialysis on-line monitoring devices.
