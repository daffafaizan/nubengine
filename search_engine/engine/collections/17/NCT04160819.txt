      participated. Patients were randomly allocated to either a nutrition intervention (NI) group
      or a standard care (SC) group. Participants in the NI group received an iNIP according to
      energy and protein intake requirements in addition to dietary advice based on face-to-face
      interviews with their family members during hospitalization. After discharge, phone calls are
      adopted for prescribing iNIPs. Anthropometry (i.e., body mass index, limb circumference, and
      subcutaneous fat thickness), blood parameters (i.e., albumin and total lymphocyte count),
      hospital stay, Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) score, target daily calorie
      intake, total calorie intake adherence rate, and three-major-nutrient intake were assessed
      during hospitalization and 3 and 6 months after discharge. Both groups received regular
      follow-up through phone calls. Furthermore, the rate of readmission resulting from pneumonia
      was recorded after discharge.
