    
      the investigators aimed to observe the clinical outcome of combining cryoballoon ablation
      (CBA) with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in drug-refractory non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation patients, who have high risk of stroke or hemorrhage, or contraindication of
      long-term oral anticoagulants (OACs).

      The combined procedure was completed using CBA following LAAC. Generally, 3-month OACs,
      following 3-month double antiplatelet therapy, and lifelong single platelet therapy was
      recommended as antithrombotic regimen.

      At 3rd,6th,12th and every year after since the procedure, Holter and transoesophageal
      echocardiography monitoring, and outpatient follow-up was applied to every patient.

      The safety was evaluated by all-cause mortality, peri- and postprocedural complications.
      While the efficacy was evaluated through the freedom of atrial arrhythmia, stroke incidence,
      and withdrawal of OACs.
