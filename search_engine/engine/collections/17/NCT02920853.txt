      proposed study will use a novel biofeedback treatment to try and enhance the capacity of
      relaxation to engage pain inhibitory circuits. Specifically, a biofeedback system
      (Biofeedback Training for Conditioned Pain Regulation, BT-CPR) will be used to monitor the
      participant's level of sympathetic arousal and will use this to control the intensity of
      painful stimulations delivered to the participant during biofeedback training. Thus, when the
      participant successfully relaxes (and reduces their arousal), the intensity is lowered and
      produces pain relief. Efficacy of the treatment will be tested in a small, randomized
      controlled trial in which individuals with a verified diagnosis of chronic musculoskeletal
      pain will receive 10 treatment sessions, or 10 sessions of a control condition (traditional
      biofeedback, to control for the effects of relaxation on pain). The aim will be to assess
      whether the treatment results in improvements in clinical pain outcomes (e.g., pain
      intensity, quality of life, pain interference) and psychosocial variables (e.g., coping,
      self-efficacy, mood).
