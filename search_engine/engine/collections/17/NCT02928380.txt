      extruded through the new nozzle with directed application compared to the use of no adhesive
      and a marketed adhesive (extruded through a flat ribbon nozzle [FRN]) with standard
      application as per product label, utilizing a peanut occlusion methodology. This was a single
      center, controlled, single blind (to the examiner performing the safety assessments (oral
      soft tissue [OST] examination) and the laboratory staff weighing the peanut particles),
      randomized, three-treatment, three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper
      and lower dentures. Each treatment period consisted of one day of testing with at least two
      days between treatment visits. This study consisted four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit;
      Visit 2 - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.
