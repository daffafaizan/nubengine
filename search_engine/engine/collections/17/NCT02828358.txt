    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability of azacitidine in addition to Interfant-06 standard
      chemotherapy in infants with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with KMT2A
      gene rearrangement (KMT2A-R).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the biologic activity of azacitidine by pharmacodynamic assessment of global
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of
      infants treated with azacitidine.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 5 year event-free survival (EFS) of infants with KMT2A-R treated with
      azacitidine in addition to Interfant-06 standard chemotherapy.

      II. To correlate minimal residual disease (MRD) with outcome in the context of the protocol
      therapy.

      III. To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of azacitidine in infants. IV. To test the
      expansion of infant T lymphocytes by stimulation with artificial antigen presenting cells
      identical to those used in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART)-19 production.

      V. To collect pharmacodynamic (PD) data for asparaginase activity following pegaspargase
      administration in infants.

      OUTLINE:

      hours or intramuscularly (IM) on day 12, and hydrocortisone sodium succinate IT on days 15
      and 29 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only patients with
      KMT2A-R continue to post-induction chemotherapy.

      POST-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY:

      AZACITIDINE BLOCK I: Prior to CONSOLIDATION, patients receive azacitidine IV over 10-40
      minutes daily for 5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Following completion of AZACITIDINE BLOCK I, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 29, mercaptopurine PO or NG daily on days 1-28,
      cytarabine IV or subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 3-6, 10-13, 17-20, and 24-27 and IT on day
      10, methotrexate IT on day 24, and hydrocortisone sodium succinate IT on days 10 and 24 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      AZACITIDINE BLOCK II: Prior to INTERIM MAINTENANCE, patients receive azacitidine as in
      AZACITIDINE BLOCK I

      INTERIM MAINTENANCE: Following completion of AZACITIDINE BLOCK II, patients receive
      mercaptopurine PO or NG daily on days 1-14, methotrexate IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8 and
      IT on days 2 and 9, leucovorin calcium PO or IV on days 3-4 and 10-11, hydrocortisone sodium
      succinate IT on days 2 and 9, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 15-16 and
      22-23 for a total of 8 doses, and pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours or IM on day 23 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      AZACITIDINE BLOCK III: Prior to DELAYED INTENSIFICATION PART I, patients receive azacitidine
      as in AZACITIDINE BLOCK I.

      DELAYED INTENSIFICATION PART I: Following completion of AZACITIDINE BLOCK III, patients
      receive pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours or IM on day 1, dexamethasone PO, NG, or IV TID on
      days 1-14 and 15-21 with a taper on days 15-21, thioguanine PO or NG daily on days 1-28,
      vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV
      over 1-15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, cytarabine IV or SC on days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, and
      23-26 and IT on days 1 and 15, and hydrocortisone sodium succinate IT on days 1 and 15 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      AZACITIDINE BLOCK IV: Prior to DELAYED INTENSIFICATION PART II, patients receive azacitidine
      as in AZACITIDINE BLOCK I.

      DELAYED INTENSIFICATION PART II: Following completion of AZACITIDINE BLOCK IV, patients
      receive thioguanine PO or NG daily on days 1-14, cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30 minutes on
      days 1 and 15, cytarabine IV or SC on days 2-5 and 9-12 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Following DELAYED INTENSIFICATION PART II, patients receive mercaptopurine PO or
      NG on days 1-168, methotrexate IT on day 1 and 92 and PO once weekly on days 8-91 and 98-168,
      hydrocortisone sodium succinate IT on day 1, 57, and 99, and cytarabine IT on day 57.
      Starting on day 169, patients receive mercaptopurine PO or NG on days 1-84 and methotrexate
      PO once weekly. Cycles repeat every 84 days for 2 years from the start of INDUCTION
      CHEMOTHERAPY in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
