      controlled, continuous intravenous manner. As research subjects complete the week-long study
      without adverse effects, the dose of PThrP will be increased in later subjects. In the event
      of a significant adverse effect, immediate action will be taken to reverse it. The
      investigators want to estimate the effect of a sustainable level of mild hypercalcemia
      achieved by a week-long intravenous infusion of PTHrP has on vitamin D metabolism, markers of
      bone turnover and fractional excretion of calcium.
