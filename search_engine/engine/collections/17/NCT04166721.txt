    
      A multi-centre phase II open label non-randomised trial of DKN-01 plus atezolizumab in
      patients with advanced inoperable or metastatic mismatch repair proficient gastroesophageal
      cancer (GC) who have progressed following chemotherapy. This trial is designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of administering DKN-01, a DKK1 inhibitor plus atezolizumab, an
      anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in this patient cohort. This trial is in 2 stages: the first
      stage (Phase IIA, 3+3 safety run-in) will establish a safe and tolerated dose of DKN-01 in
      combination with atezolizumab and the second stage (Phase IIB, Single Stage A'hern design for
      efficacy/ anti-tumour activity) will assess the efficacy of this combination therapy in
      achieving tumour response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (additional iRECIST criteria will
      be used in a sensitivity analysis).
