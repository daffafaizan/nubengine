      effectiveness, decrease tumor metagenicity and decrease IL-1-induced fatigue, metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC) patients will be treated with chemotherapy plus anakinra. This is a pilot
      safety, single arm, open label trial. The objective is to determine the safety of anakinra
      plus the physician's chemotherapy choice (TPC) of nab paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, or
      vinorelbine in patients with MBC and to define an anakinra-induced anti-IL-1 whole blood
      transcriptional profile.
