      erythema, papule size, while flattening lesions and improving skin texture. Topical rapamycin
      has been reported to be well tolerated.

      The efficacy and safety of a topical rapamycin cream at two strengths (0.5% and 1.0%) will be
      assessed during a 26 week double-blind treatment phase with assessments made at clinical
      visits at baseline, 2, 8, 14, 20 and 26 weeks, and at follow-up (4 weeks after the last dose
      of study drug).
