      preoperative setting. Severe perioperative anxiety of a child poses a major challenge for the
      surgeon, since it is often accompanied by adverse behavioral and emotional reactions and
      associated with a complicated operative and postoperative course.

      The investigators have made the personal experience that informing the children ahead of time
      about what to expect in the hospital, decreases child anxiety and increases parent
      satisfaction.

      There is considerable debate on the best way how to inform children about what to expect
      during their hospital stay. The investigators had a virtual reality application developed
      that introduces the children to several aspects of the hospital environment. Therefore, these
      children now ahead of time what they will experience during their hospital stay.

      The aim is to evaluate the effect of this preparatory virtual reality application on the
      anxiety level of children immediately before surgery.
