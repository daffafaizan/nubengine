      accounts for 30% of preterm births (PTB) and is associated with serious maternal and neonatal
      morbidity. An important factor in the underlying pathophysiology of PPROM and subsequent PTB
      is subclinical infection, which promotes a cascade of events that contribute to synthesis of
      prostaglandins, release of proinflammatory cytokines, infiltration of neutrophils, and
      activation of metalloproteases. Over time, enhanced activity of these infectious and
      inflammatory pathways contributes to the development of spontaneous labor and/or overt
      intraamniotic infection (IAI). Unfortunately, the majority of patients with PPROM do not
      manifest signs and symptoms of infection that are detectable by clinical examination,
      laboratory evaluation, and traditional microdiagnostic tests, and attempting to predict
      length of latency period and/or timing of delivery remains a clinical challenge. We propose
      the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to identify microbial DNA in
      maternal plasma following PPROM. We hypothesize that the presence and abundance of microbial
      DNA is associated with a shorter latency period and that an increase in the abundance of
      microbial DNA precedes delivery.
