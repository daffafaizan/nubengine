    
      Patients will be randomized to Routine Care (RC) or Fluid Optimizations (FO) arms. Both arms
      will have interval Cheetah NICOM® (non-invasive cardiac output monitoring) Passive Leg Raise
      Testing (PLRT).

      In the FO arm, patients having a PLRT demonstrating a >/= 15% change in stroke volume index
      (SVI) or cardiac index (CI) patients will receive a 500ml normal saline bolus. If the NICOM®
      PLRT shows a SVI or CI <15% patients will receive a saline lock. If bolused, NICOM® PLRT will
      be performed within 10 minutes after the bolus with the decision to re-bolus or saline lock
      according to repeated NICOM® PLRT measurements. If saline locked, NICOM® PLRT will be
      performed every 30 minutes with the decision to re-bolus or saline lock according to repeated
      NICOM® PLRT measurements.

      In the RC arm, IV fluid administration will be per the treating clinicians discretion. The
      Cheetah NICOM®PLRT will be performed before and after each clinician fluid bolus.

      Lactate blood samples will be drawn at time zero, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, and/or ED
      departure and compared between arms.
