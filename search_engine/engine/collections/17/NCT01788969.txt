      crossover design to assess the effects of SSRIs (escitalopram oxalate, Lexapro®, Forest
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc) and 5HT-antagonists (cyproheptadine [CYPRO], Periactin ®, Merck, Inc)
      on volitional and spastic motor behaviors in subjects with motor incomplete SCI following
      both acute and chronic medication delivery. Voluntary and reflexive motor behaviors in 120
      subjects with SCI will be assessed. These interventions will be applied to individuals with
      acute (< 6 months post injury) chronic (> 1 year post injury) motor incomplete SCI to
      determine both the rate and extent of changes in volitional motor performance and involuntary
      spastic behaviors. For the training portion of the study (referred to as subproject 2 below),
      a portion of the acute and chronic subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks for up to16 weeks
      and participate in locomotor training, to investigate and better understand changes in motor
      function and recovery in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Following 2-4 weeks of this
      training, individuals will be given either the study drug, or placebo and continue evaluation
      and training. Following an additional 4 weeks, subjects will be given either the placebo or
      study drug (whichever they did not receive during the prior 4 weeks). The order will be
      randomized.
