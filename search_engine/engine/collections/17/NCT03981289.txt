      investigations often limited to single gene mutations. Much attention is paid to the
      variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining
      the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major
      dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping
      phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear,
      is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity
      and represent a large unmet clinical need.

      Recent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular
      approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of
      the LGMD mutations. Several of these gene replacement therapies are currently in
      pre-clinical/phase 1 testing, leading to an urgent need for natural history data. In
      addition, non-specific therapies which target muscle mass or function are being tested in
      other muscular dystrophies and may prove beneficial for LGMD.
