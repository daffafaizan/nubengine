      ulcers (DFUs) at an outpatient clinic will be recruited. At baseline, participants will be
      stratified into normal and high adiposity groups as measured by Bioelectrical Impedance
      Analysis (BIA). Both groups will receive DFU management according to locally appropriate
      standards of care and followed-up for 24 weeks or until complete wound healing, whichever
      occurs first. Local microbial characteristics, presence or absence of infection and other
      clinical parameters will also be assessed, and compared between the two groups. Enrolling 150
      participants per group will have a minimum power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in
      cumulative incidence of complete ulcer healing (at the 5% level of statistical significance)
      between the normal and high adiposity groups.
