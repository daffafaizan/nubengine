      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of F-genotype mumps live attenuated vaccine (human
      diploid cells) after vaccination in 720 healthy children aged 5-11 years, and explore the
      detoxification in 144 subjects, who randomly selected from these 720 subjects. The second
      stage will evaluate the clinical protective efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of F-genotype
      mumps live attenuated vaccine (human diploid cells) after vaccination in 11280 healthy
      children aged 5-11 years.
