      haemodialysis patients, however only 37% of haemodialysis patients have this form of access.
      A possible explanation for this could be the high fistula failure rate due to the lack of
      maturation. Therefore interventions aimed at enhancing fistula maturation are warranted. One
      such intervention could be forearm exercise, however this recommendation is not evidence
      based. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether a program of post
      operative progressive hand grip exercise can improve fistula maturation.
