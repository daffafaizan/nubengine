      treatments and large numbers still experience tooth decay. Primary care providers have had
      little option other than invasive and costly specialist treatment in the hospital under
      general anesthesia. In this context, there is interest in simple treatments to halt progress
      of carious lesions after tooth decay onset. Among these simple treatments is silver diamine
      fluoride (SDF) treatment. The major drawback to SDF treatment has been its black staining,
      which has limited its use. To counter the staining, researchers have tested SDF treatment
      immediately followed with application of saturated solution of potassium iodide (KI).
