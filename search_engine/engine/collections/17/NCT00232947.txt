      elderly population, and also cause lost work and productivity among the healthy, working
      elderly. Fluviral, a product now licensed in Canada, is being tested to determine whether it
      is as active in causing immune responses, and as safe as a currently licensed U.S. vaccine in
      persons 50 y.o. and over.
