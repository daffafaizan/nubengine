    
      Aim of this study is to develop and establish an indication-based algorithm for identifying
      particular stress patterns of patients with initial diagnosis of a sarcoma or a metastatic
      bone disease. A further aim was the establishment of an adequate psychosocial treatment
      within the clinical workday routine to support coping with illness and treatment.

      Methods:

      Patients with histologically assured sarcoma or metastatic bone disease are
      psycho-oncologically screened by a common cancer specific expert rating scale (PO-Bado: Basic
      Documentation for Psycho-Oncology, 6 items) at the time of admission before tumor resection.
      In the same line patients were asked to answer two standardized self-rating questionaires,
      namely the FBK-R10 (Questionaire for Psychosocial Burden of Cancer Patients, 10 items) and a
      modified form of the PHQ (Patient Health Questionaire, 2 items) to assess patients' burden of
      disease as well as the presence of depressive mood. Cancer patients exceeding a defined
      critical PO-Bado cut-off value (a minimum of 2 items scoring 3 or 1 item scoring 4) are
      expected to require psychosocial support and a psychosocial consultation/co-treatment iss
      initiated.

      To evaluate short-term effects of the psycho-social treatment the cancer-specific screening
      is repeated (PO-Bado, FBK-R10, PHQ) before discharge from the hospital. All diagnostic
      findings as well as a specific recommendation for the continuing treatment are integrated
      into the orthopedic discharge letter. Furthermore, all findings are shown and factored for
      decision making within the interdisciplinary musculoskeletal tumor board. For appraisal of
      treatment-based long-term effects the psycho-oncological screening is repeated within the
      orthopedic aftercare examinations 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
