    
      This study was a double-blind, randomised, balanced incomplete block design exploratory study
      of efficacy, with 11 active treatments compared to a control product in 42 healthy subjects
      to see if a mix of active ingredients (viscous fibres and flours) lowered the post-prandial
      glucose (PPG) response in capillary blood (finger prick) over a two and three hours period,
      relative to the control product. Every subject received the control and 4 out of the 11
      treatments on five separate test days.
