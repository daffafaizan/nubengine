      tests the efficacy of radiotoxic treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma using
      (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine [(131)I-MIBG], and in particular, tests whether pre-treatment
      with enhancer pharmaceuticals increases the efficacy of experimental (131)I-MIBG treatment in
      reducing the size and number of tumors and the tumor burden.
