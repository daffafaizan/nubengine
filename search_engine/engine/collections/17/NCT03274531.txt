    
      Patients with medically treated arterial hypertension, who attend a pharmacy in order to
      obtain their antihypertensive medication are invited to participate in the trial.

      The main inclusion criteria is uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by an automated
      office blood pressure measurement at a threshold of 135/85 mmHg.

      Main exclusion criteria include a first-ever prescription of an antihypertensive agent,
      resistant hypertension, systolic blood pressure â‰¥ 180 mmHg and dialysis.

      Randomization occurs on the level of pharmacies (cluster randomization).

      Patients in the interventional arm are immediately referred to their treating physician for
      up-titration of antihypertensive therapy. Re-examination of automated automated office
      blood-pressure occurs in the respective pharmacy, and patients are referred to their treating
      physician again if required. These measures are accompanied by a structured and educational
      blood pressure record card.

      Patients in the observational arm undergo periodic automated office blood pressure
      measurements and are referred to their treating physician at the end of the trial in case of
      persistently uncontrolled blood pressure.
