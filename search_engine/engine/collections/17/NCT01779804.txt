      This study's independent variable (or "intervention/predictor" variable) is the triage
      application of the OAR and OFR. Dependent variables (or "outcome" variables) include the
      number of X-rays ordered and LOS (co-primary outcomes), and measured patient and provider
      satisfaction (secondary outcomes). The Principal Investigator will create and validate his
      own study tool/survey to measure patient and provider satisfaction.

      Confounding Variables:

      Confounding variables include, but are not limited to: Patient age; patient gender; census
      volume on the days the study is conducted; assistance from ED staff from either site;
      difficulty in achieving enrollment goals in a timely fashion; season of the year (i.e.,
      skateboarding versus skiing injuries); patient expectations about their ED care; and/or
      patient insurance status.

      Study Design/Methods:

      This study is designed to be a pilot, prospective, 2-stage study to examine the application
      of OAR/OFR at the 17th and Chew, and Cedar Crest site EDs that aims to determine if triage
      nursing application of these clinical decision rules can decrease the amount of radiographs
      ordered, as well as decrease patient LOS.
