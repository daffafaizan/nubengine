      and light exposure are no longer restricted to daytime hours due to increased shift work.
      Recent scientific reports have shown that shift work leads to disruption of circadian rhythms
      and promotes diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Until now only few studies
      investigating circadian rhythm disturbances in the context of type 2 diabetes and obesity
      have been conducted in man. Thus, knowledge of the molecular pathways and the responsibles
      genes in man are missing and have been identified only in animal studies.

      The objective of the project is to achieve breakthroughs in the understanding of the
      causality between inner clock rhythm disturbances and the development of type 2 diabetes and
      obesity. The provided data on the interaction between genes, epigenetics, metabolism,
      cardiovascular function and the internal clock are intended to contribute to identify novel
      biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches focusing on circadian rhythms to reduce the
      occurence of diabetes and obesity in shift worker.
