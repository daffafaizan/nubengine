      12 years of age with mild to moderate AD. A sufficient number of subjects were screened to
      ensure that approximately 80 subjects were randomized, to yield 70 completed subjects.
      Subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment groups: the J&J Device or AtopiclairÂ®.
      All subjects were to return to the clinical site for clinical assessments at baseline (Day 1)
      and at Days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 43 after initial investigational product application. The
      investigational products were used topically during the duration of the study.
