      regimen to a basal-bolus plus metformin treatment regimen in patients with very uncontrolled
      (HbA1c>10%) type 2 diabetes. The investigators will compare the two regimens with respect to
      efficacy in improving glycemic control, rate of hypoglycemia, change in weight, effect on
      patient quality of life, treatment burden, physician time, as well as healthcare related
      cost. The investigators hypothesize that at 26 weeks from randomization the two treatment
      regimens will have similar percentage of patients reaching A1c levels <7.0%, while more
      patients on the GLP-1 plus basal insulin strategy will achieve the composite end point of A1c
      levels <7.0% without severe hypoglycemia or significant weight gain.
