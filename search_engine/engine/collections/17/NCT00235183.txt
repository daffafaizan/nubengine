        -  quarantined plasma,

        -  methylene blue treated plasma,

        -  solvent/detergent plasma. The main purpose is to show that the volume of methylene blue
           treated plasma consumed intraoperatively is equivalent to that of the 2 other types of
           plasma.

      In addition, the correction of coagulation abnormalities are studied.
