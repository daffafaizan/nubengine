      idiopathic overactive bladder. Multiple studies have shown that Botox at the dose of 50UI is
      effective but not for a long time. Maximum efficiency is about two weeks and until about
      twelve weeks compared to the dose between 100UI and 300UI that shown an efficiency until
      twenty-four at thirty-six weeks. But it's not without consequence since the side effects are
      more numerous increasing the dose. The most frequent are urinary retention with necessary to
      perform clean intermittent catheterization and urinary infection.

      This dose at 50UI is therefore more a test to assess the patient's tolerance to the product,
      as recommended by the product marketing authorization.

      So, through this evaluation of professional practices, investigators would like to evaluate
      the patient satisfaction treated in hospital, with a first dose at 50UI.
