      to study who apply to Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of knee pain, aged between 45-75 years.
      Patients also have diagnosed as knee osteoarthritis according to American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria and Kellgren-Lawrence grades are ≤3. These patients
      will be divided into two groups randomly (Treatment group n:48, control group n:48). The
      patients in the treatment group will receive treatment with 1 MHz probe with the intensity of
      1w/cm2, pulsed at a ratio of 1:4 for 10 minutes and at an interval of 3 sessions per week for
      8 weeks, a total of 24 sessions. On the other hand, sham US will be applied to control group
      for the same times and periods as the treatment group. A home exercise program will be given
      to both of two groups which contain knee range of motion and isometric strengthening
      exercises. The patients will be allowed to take paracetamol only when they complain of pain.
      All patients will be evaluated for 3 times, before and after treatment and 3 months after the
      treatment with ultrasonographic measurements and life quality tests. Primary aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of pulsed ultrasound on amount of synovial fluid and
      cartilage thickness.

      For this purpose, cartilage thickness and reduction in the amount of synovial fluid will be
      measured via ultrasound.

      Secondary aim is evaluating the effect of pulsed ultrasound on quality of life. Knee pain
      will be measured by VAS (Visual analogue scale) and functionality will be measured by WOMAC
      survey and Timed Up and Go Test.
