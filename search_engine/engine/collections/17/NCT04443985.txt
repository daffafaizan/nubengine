      were diagnosed with rectal cancer and received chemoradiation between January 2011 to
      December 2017 at Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok were analyzed. Patients who were not received
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, loss follow-up, incomplete data in the record, distant
      organ metastasis and who was not received colorectal surgery were excluded as study flow
      diagram. Age, sex, performance status, smoking, initial Hb level (g/mL), CEA level (ng/dL),
      distance of tumor from anal verge, diagnostic variables, clinical T staging, preoperative
      thickness and length from computer tomography scan (CT scan), organ metastasis before
      treatment, histology, treatment course, and outcomes after treatment were collected and
      analyzed.Total dose of radiation, interval time from CCRT to operation, and chemotherapy
      regimens were also collected between and after treatment. After preoperative CCRT, the
      radical rectal surgery was performed by eight experienced general surgeons and surgical
      oncologist using open and laparoscopic techniques. Perioperative data were collected and
      histology was evaluated by an experienced pathologists. For pathological classification,
      pathological responses were divided in 2 groups i.e., pathologic complete response (pCR
      group) and non-pCR group, (partial response, stable disease, and disease progression). Margin
      of lesions were classified as proximal, distal and circumferential margins. Lymph nodes
      status after surgery were specified as total lymph nodes harvested and positive lymph nodes.
