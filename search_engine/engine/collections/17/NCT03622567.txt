      world. Researchers have previously found a relationship between mobile phone use and changes
      in brain activity, reaction times and sleep patterns.

      Brain Power is a consumer-grade application using a proprietary combination of neurological
      (EEG) and behavioral (reaction time and accuracy) data to create a comprehensive score out of
      1000 which allows users to have an objective evaluation of their brain performance.

      This study will examine how Brain Power Score is affected by the presence of smartphone push
      notifications.
