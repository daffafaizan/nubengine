      ovarian reserve, who would be expected to have reasonable outcomes after in vitro
      fertilization, will serve as the subjects. Embryos from the same patient will be randomized
      to either static or dynamic culture. They will then be cultured to the blastocyst stage of
      embryo development and biopsied for preimplantation genetic screening. The best chromosomally
      normal embryo from each culture group will be selected and transferred to complete a double
      embryo transfer in a subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycle the following month.
