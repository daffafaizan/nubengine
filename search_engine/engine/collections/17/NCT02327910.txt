      transcutaneous CO2 partial pressure(TcPCO2) monitoring(U group)or acceleromyographic
      monitering(T group)or conventional(C group).Anesthethic management was standardized.U
      patients were extubated when TOF ratio greater than 0.9 and transcutaneous CO2 partial
      pressure recover to preoprative (Â±5mmHg).T patients were extubated when TOF ratio greater
      than 0.9.C patients were extubated when standard criteria were met.Anesthesia monitoring,
      including ECG, invasive arterial pressure, pulse oxygen saturation, the BIS, nasopharyngeal
      temperature.The anesthesia induction with propofol 1 ~ 2 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg,
      fentanyl 2 ug/kg, anesthesia maintained using propofol, fentanyl and the rocuronium 0.3
      mg/kg. continuous pumping, maintain circulation stabilization and BIS value in 40 ~ 60, about
      30 minutes before the end of surgery to stop rocuronium infusion, at the end of sewing
      leather to stop propofol and fentanyl infusion. Adjust Respiratory parameters, maintain
      breathe out co2 partial pressure at the scope of the 30 ~ 35 MMHG, using the variable
      temperature blanket insulation. All patients are monitored and give the muscle relaxant
      antagonists, pulling out endotracheal intubation, recording the TOF and TcPCO2 data when
      leaving the operating room . But during anesthesia management in group C, shielding TOF and
      TcPCO2 data to the anesthesiologists; T group during anesthesia management, shielding TcPCO2
      data to the anesthesiologist; U set during anesthesia management, can according to the TOF
      and TcPCO2 data to management. All postoperative patients are sent into PACU, giving oxygen
      mask 3L/min, they can leave PACU Aldrete score nine points or more. By blind method
      principle, physicians of PACU,who is responsible for the patients with postoperative index
      records and statistics are blind to the staff for grouping, intraoperative management and
      BiBa tube drawing situation , in order to avoid bias. Statistical analysis: all the data
      represented as mean + / - standard deviation, using SPSS statistical software, measuring data
      comparison using analysis of variance between groups, count data using chi-square test, P <
      0.05 that was statistically significant
