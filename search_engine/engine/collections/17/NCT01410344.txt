      fully-ablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with
      hematological malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have HIV infection. The
      goal of the study is to assess the 100 day Non-relapse Mortality as well as immunological
      reconstitution in this patient population. Where feasible, an attempt will be made to
      identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible hematopoietic stem cell donors who are
      homozygotes for the delta32 mutation of the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5delta32). Patients will
      undergo a treatment plan review prior to registration on the trial. All patients will undergo
      allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor.
