      safety of using ACRX-100 to treat heart failure in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
      Safety will be tracked at each dose by documenting all adverse events (AEs), with the primary
      safety endpoint being the number of major cardiac AEs at 30 days. In each cohort (n=4 in low
      dose, n=6 each in mid and high dose), subjects will receive a single dose of ACRX-100.
      Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the impact on cardiac function via
      standard echocardiography measurements, cardiac perfusion via SPECT imaging, and improvement
      in NYHA classification.
