      I. To assess the overall rate of response among study participants treated with the
      combination of encorafenib and binimetinib, with or without nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) among study participants treated with the
      combination of encorafenib and binimetinib with or without nivolumab.

      II. To assess the overall survival (OS) among study participants treated with the combination
      of encorafenib and binimetinib with or without nivolumab.

      III. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR). IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of study participants treated with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib with or
      without nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive encorafenib PO QD and binimetinib PO BID as in arm I. Patients also
      receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with nivolumab repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 12 months.
