      cancer patients. TKIs are the only class of anticancer drugs that are predominately used as
      single agents. TKIs were hoped to lack side effects but can cause severe enough diarrhea that
      patients frequently stop treatment, even if TKIs are controlling their cancer. TKIs inhibit
      nucleoside transporters (NTs), perturbing regulation of adenosine levels in the intestine. It
      is possible that the reason for the inability to use TKIs in combination therapies has been
      their additive effects on NTs causing unacceptable diarrhea. It has been shown that TKIs are
      potent NT inhibitors, therefore it will theoretically inhibit NTs of intestinal epithelial
      cells causing an accumulation of extracellular adenosine resulting in chloride secretory
      diarrhea. If this hypothesis is correct, it has profound implications for oncology, since
      diarrhea is one of the dose-limiting toxicities of TKIs. It has been shown that co-incubating
      cells with 8-phenyltheophylline (8PT), which is an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist, block
      chloride secretion caused by nitrobenzyl-mercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR). Theophylline
      is also a methylxanthine and is a commercially available and licensed example of a 8PT. As it
      is already known that erlotinib is effective, it is used as a control factor in the first arm
      of the study and will be increased in the second arm to see what the maximally tolerated dose
      is when in combination with a controlled dose of theophylline.
