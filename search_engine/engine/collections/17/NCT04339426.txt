      single-agents and combination therapies for patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection
      requiring therapy as determined by risk factors for complication (age, comorbid illness) or
      the presence of respiratory compromise. The first combination to be evaluated is
      atovaquone/azithromycin. Other combinations may be added to the study at future amendments as
      information of potential benefit arises. The first part of the study will enroll 25 evaluable
      male and female patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
