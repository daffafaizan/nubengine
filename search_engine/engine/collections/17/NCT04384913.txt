      arthritic knee patients; nevertheless, a substantial percentage of these patients are not
      fully satisfied. Thus, several authors reported significantly improved outcomes after
      slightly under correcting varus knees after TKA. The concept of kinematic alignment (KA) even
      more addresses the patientÂ´s individual anatomy with three-dimensional restoration of
      individual axes, joint lines and joint envelope of laxity. The aim of this prospective
      randomized study was to demonstrate equivalence between mechanical and kinematic alignment in
      restoring knee function in terms of subjective and objective outcomes.

      In this prospective randomized controlled double-blind study 120 patients with osteoarthritic
      knees will be treated with a Medial Pivot TKA (Medacta Sphere GMK). The patients are divided
      into two groups. Group A receive the TKA using mechanical alignment principles, group B
      receive the kinematic alignment. The surgical technique was equal in both groups. CT-based 3D
      printed PSI cutting blocks were used for the saw cuts. Pre and postoperative standard x-rays
      were performed. To determine the subjective and objective outcomes the OKS(Oxford Knee
      Score), the KSS(Knee Society Sore), the FJS-12(Forgotten Joint Score) and the WOMAC Score
      were collected.
