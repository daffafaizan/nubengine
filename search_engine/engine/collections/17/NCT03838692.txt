      harms cancer cells. It was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for leukemia
      treatment, but is not approved for medullary thyroid cancer treatment. Early studies,
      however, have shown that medullary thyroid tumors respond to ponatinib. These studies were
      done in the laboratory and not performed on humans. This is a study designed for patients
      with medullary thyroid cancer. Treatment will consist of a drug called ponatinib which is a
      pill that taken once each day and continue throughout the duration of the study. The purpose
      of the study is to:

        1. Determine if this treatment will be effective in decreasing the amount of cancer and, if
           it does, to determine how long the response will last.

        2. Determine the side effects that may occur with this treatment.

        3. To analyze genetic mutations in tumors to help us understand how tumors grow and how
           these drugs interact with the mechanisms within the tumor.

      Ponatinib has been given to many patients with leukemia and is now approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of certain types of leukemia. This study
      will seek to determine if ponatinib can bring benefit to patients with medullary thyroid
      cancer.
