      systemic inflammatory response syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality in 20% of
      patients. Part of endocrine function of pancreas would be affected in AP. Stress
      hyperglycemia would explode at acute phase. There are two reasons. One is because that
      sympathetic hyperactivity makes glucagon elevated. Secondary, microcirculation disorder makes
      pancreas edema, ischemia and necrosis, affecting secretion and excretion of insulin. In
      severe acute pancreatitis, there may be ketoacidosis. Many scoring systems for predicting
      prognosis of severe acute pancreatitis also contains glucose values, such as the Ranson
      scoring system and the Glascow scoring system. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetes has become
      a global pandemic disease. Most of patients of type 2 diabetes are obese, who easily
      complicated gallstone disease and hypertriglyceridemia. All of above could be the risk
      factors for acute pancreatitis. Our initial small sample research also suggests undiagnosed
      diabetes patients whose glucose value elevated is significantly worse than the known diabetic
      patients. Therefore, the investigators believe that glucose directly affects the prognosis of
      AP. So the investigators decide to follow up and observe 1000 cases of patients with acute
      pancreatitis, determining of blood sugar, blood amylase, hemoglobin and glycosylated
      hemoglobin level. At last, using ROC curve method to identify the die cutting between blood
      glucose level and acute pancreatitis, and makes analysis of the diagnostic value.
