      presenting with the diagnosis of advanced NSCLC are to be enrolled in this study. All
      eligible patients will receive continuous daily oral erlotinib 150 mg (Tarceva™) with daily
      bexarotene oral capsules 400 mg/m2 (Targretin®). The two agents will be taken at the same
      time. We anticipate the maximum accrual of 40 patients to this trial.

      Patients will be evaluated by history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment every
      4 weeks. Radiographic disease assessments by chest radiograph will be obtained every 4 weeks
      and computer tomography every 8 weeks or longer if clinically indicated. Whole body PET scan
      will be obtained at 10 days and 8 weeks. All radiographic studies will be sent to Medical
      Metrix Solutions (MMS) for an independent radiographic review of tumor response.
