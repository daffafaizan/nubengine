      placebo-controlled study with a split-lesion design.All study procedures will be performed at
      the Department of Dermatology, Erasmus MC Medical Center in patients referred for scar
      treatment to our outpatient clinic.

      Clinical photos will be obtained after signing the informed consent form by patient and
      investigator. Study visits and clinical assessments will be scheduled at baseline, 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, and 12 weeks. Measurements include clinical photography, scar volume measured by
      3D-camera, POSAS questionnaire, laser speckle contrast imaging to visualize keloid scar
      vascularization, measurement of residue formation on the skin, and a treatment related
      questionnaire. The keloid will be divided into two treatment areas, and randomly assigned to
      three consecutive treatments of: a) bleomycin and b) placebo (saline (NaCl 0,9%)),
      administered with an electronic pneumatic jet injector.
