      investigators aim to assess both the nature of germline and somatic VHL mutations along with
      the total residual VHL protein (pVHL) activity in tumor cells and evaluate association to
      disease outcome in patients and families.

      vHL tumor development follows Knudson's "two-hit-mode": patients are born with a germline
      mutation in one copy of their VHL gene in all the cells of the body - "the first hit".
      Somatic mutation in the other copy of the VHL gene - "the second hit" - initiates tumor
      development. Pheno-genotype correlations are well known in vHL, but have so far been
      explained exclusively by the nature of the germline mutation (the first hit). It is the
      investigators' hypothesis that it is the total residual activity of the protein (pVHL)
      present in the tumor after both first and second hit, which decides each tumor's destiny.

      The investigators will apply Sanger sequencing, MLPA (and multiplex ligation dependent probe
      amplification), LOH (Loss of heterogeneity) analysis, methylation assays, FISH (Fluorescence
      In Situ Hybridization), and immunohistochemistry to characterize the germline and somatic
      mutations, determine presence of mRNA and pVHL, and assess residual VHL activity in each
      tumor. All these methods are already established in our laboratory.

      The results will give deeper insight to vHL tumorigenesis and pave the road to future
      individual prediction of each patientÂ´s course of disease and need for surveillance.
