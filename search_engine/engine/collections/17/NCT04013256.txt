      smoking. Indoors, they can be found both on surfaces and in the air. Thirdhand smoke derives
      from secondhand smoke and contains the chemicals that stick to surfaces, are re-emitted into
      the air and that form by chemical reactions both on surfaces and in the air.

      Thirdhand smoke can contain higher concentrations of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine and
      known carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) than secondhand smoke,
      because nicotine reacts to form NNK in the indoor environment. Dermal exposure to thirdhand
      smoke includes nicotine, NNK and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. Inhalational exposure to thirdhand smoke
      includes nicotine, ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds. Previous studies have
      shown that inhalational exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke causes endothelial
      dysfunction, which is a risk factor for heart disease and heart attacks.
