      to optimized antiarrhythmic medical therapy in preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmia
      relapses among patients with prior myocardial infarction and implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD). The patients have not been using using chronic antiarrhythmic
      medication. Primary end point is number of ICD therapies (defibrillations, cardioversions and
      antitachycardia pacing) and otherwise documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (duration
      more than 30 s or hemodynamically unstable ) or ventricular fibrillation episodes during 12
      months follow-up period. Secondary end points include mortality, hospitalization for cardiac
      reason, health economics, quality of life and several ICD and arrhythmia related issues.
      Total length of the follow-up is at least two years.
