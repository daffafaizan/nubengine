      for 72 months regardless of initiation of other local or systemic prostate cancer treatments,
      which will allow assessments of recurrence rates and morbidity after conversion to radical
      therapy, long-term safety and tolerability, as well as oncologic outcomes.

      This is multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial that will
      compare two treatment methods (PGA with TOOKAD® VTP and Active Surveillance) for treating
      localized prostate cancer who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached for
      participation in the clinical study. Patients consenting to participate will be individually
      randomized to TOOKAD® VTP or Active Surveillance with a 1:1 ratio. Central randomization will
      be performed using an independent web-based allocation system. Randomization will be
      stratified by center using minimization. Ongoing assessment of patients in both arms will be
      balanced, including follow up examinations, PSA testing, MRI and biopsies at defined
      intervals.

      Subjects in the experimental arm will receive the experimental treatment consisting of
      unilateral TOOKAD® VTP treatment applied to the index lobe containing pattern 4 cancer. The
      treatment will be administered under general anesthesia. Routine ultrasound examination in
      the operating room will be performed for morphometric description of the prostate and to
      facilitate accurate treatment planning and probe placement. Ultrasound will not be used for
      diagnostic purposes.
