      medical research study), open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CNTO1959
      (Guselkumab) in the treatment of participants with GPP or EP. Participants will receive 50
      milligram (mg) guselkumab subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. At Week 16 up to Week 52
      participants who will be defined "Very much improved" or "Much improved" in Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) will continue to receive guselkumab 50 mg every 8 weeks from Week 20 to the
      study end (Week 52). At each visit timing from Week 20, participants who will be defined "No
      change" or "Worsened" will receive guselkumab 100 mg and continue 100 mg every 8 weeks dosing
      until Week 52. Participants who are "Minimally improved" will also receive guselkumab 100 mg
      only if investigator considers it necessary. Participants will primarily be assessed for the
      treatment success. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
