      retention detected two weeks later in a whole body scintillation counter. Each subject has
      iron absorption measured from each of 7 1-d menus formulated to meet the US dietary
      guidelines (MyPyramid menus), with the order of menus randomly assigned. Each subject
      participates for 14 wk to test all 7 menus.
