    
      This is a cross-sectional study in which mixed methods will be used in various phases of the
      study. Mixed methods involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative
      data in a single study. Data are collected concurrently or sequentially and integrated at one
      or more stages during the research process. This study will be divided into 3 phases with
      stages to answer the objectives.

      Phase one of this study will attempt to answer objectives 1-3 of the study. Stage 1 will
      include a systematic review of literature to identify the most effective vocational
      rehabilitation interventions amongst PLWSCI. Stage 2 will determine rehabilitation services
      rendered to individual who sustain SCI in South Africa with an intention of identifying gaps
      in vocational rehabilitation practices by retrospectively analysing medical files. This phase
      will be concluded by a focus group to further explore current vocational rehabilitation
      practices rendered to PLWSCI (Stage3).

      Phase two will answer objectives 4-5. Stage 1 of this phase will determine the employment
      status as well as factors that influence employment amongst PLWSCI. Stage 2 will determine
      the barriers and facilitators of employment amongst PLWSCI. Results obtained from phase 1 to
      2, will be utilised to by the researcher to develop the proposed model.

      The final phase will aim to develop, validate and refine the model. Stage 1 of this phase
      will include the researcher using the information gained in previous phases to develop the
      proposed model. The second stage will include a focus group to validate the content of the
      proposed model. The last stage will included obtaining consensus amongst the stakeholders
      regarding the structure and the content of the proposed model and subsequently refine it.
