      preparedness to make decisions pertaining to antidepressant therapy. The research team has
      systematically developed an Antidepressant Decision Aid for Major depressive disorder
      patients (ADAM) according to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) and

      pharmacotherapeutic decisions compared usual care.
