      Given that a biological equivalent dose (BED)more than 100 Gy yields approximately a local
      control rate of 90% in early-stage non-small lung cancer, this BED or ever higher is
      logically required to control local disease for locally advanced non-small lung cancer.
      However, dose escalation is limited by radiation-related toxicity. Use of hyperfractionated
      radiation Therapy boost to residual metabolic disease as defined by positron emission
      tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) immediately after standard chemoradiotherapy
      (SCRT) using image-guided (IG) IMRT could potentially improve local control and perhaps
      survival
