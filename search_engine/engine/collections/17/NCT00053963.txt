      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FR901228 (depsipeptide) in pediatric
      patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess tolerability of this drug at
      the solid tumor MTD in patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia.

      V. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients with solid tumors receive escalating doses of FR901228 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 patients (6 patients total) with leukemia receive FR901228 as above at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for survival.
