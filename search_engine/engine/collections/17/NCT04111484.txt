      the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) superfamily and has several structural,
      physiological and pharmacological similarities to CGRP, intermdine and amylin. In a
      randomized double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over design 20 migraine patients without
      aura recruited to receive infusion of adrenomedullin or placebo (saline).

      A pilot study on healthy volunteers were conducted to determine tolerable dose of
      adrenomedullin to the main study.
