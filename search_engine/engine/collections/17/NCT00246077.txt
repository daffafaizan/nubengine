      patients with sickle cell. This study aims to explore the QoL of children who are receiving
      chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) using a Lifeport device, which allows them to undergo
      erythrocytapheresis, rather than standard transfusion therapy. Erythrocytapheresis is less
      time consuming and is associated with less iron overload than conventional transfusion
      therapy; however, little is known about the implications for the child's QoL. This study will
      explore QoL from the child's perspective.
