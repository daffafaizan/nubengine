    
      This was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, postmarketing safety study to evaluate the
      risk of seizure among patients with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide who were at potential
      increased risk of seizure.

      Participants who met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled into the
      study and participated in a 4-month treatment period, during which once daily dosing of
      enzalutamide (160 mg/day) occurred. At the end of the 4-month treatment period, participants
      who were assessed as deriving benefit from enzalutamide treatment were allowed to continue in
      the extension period where participants continued to receive enzalutamide until 1 of the
      following criteria was met:

        1. The participant experienced bone disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
           (PCWG2) guidelines or soft tissue disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

        2. The participant initiated treatment with another anticancer therapy or, in the opinion
           of the investigator, continued dosing would have led to undue risk to the patient

        3. The participant met a discontinuation criterion

        4. The sponsor terminated the study

      Participants who continued to receive clinical benefit from treatment with enzalutamide and
      did not meet any discontinuation criteria may have transitioned to an open label roll-over
      extension study upon approval of the study protocol at the institution where they were
      receiving treatment.

      Participants who did not continue in the extension period or who met a discontinuation
      criterion were discontinued from enzalutamide therapy and completed a follow-up visit 30 days
      from the last dose of enzalutamide or prior to the initiation of another anticancer therapy,
      whichever occurred first.

      For participants who continued on treatment after the 12-month extension period, data
      collection was limited to dosing information, concomitant medications, and all adverse events
      (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs).
