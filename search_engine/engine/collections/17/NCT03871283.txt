      are poorly undertaken. In some cases, the anesthesiologist does not understand correctly the
      indication of the treatment due to lack of information and therefore does not know how to
      adapt it to the medical situation.

      the investigators want to investigate these transitions: how were they understood by
      patients, how were they performed, and how does this affect surgery, postoperative morbidity
      and mortality?

      Anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic events will not be studied in this study.

      The anesthesia team will not be particularly trained in anticoagulants and antiplatelets
      management to be close to actual care. In the Hospital the investigators have a guide written
      in 2013 in order to describe all the cases possible. The "control/ goal group" will be the
      patients who have undertaken strictly the protocol described for their cases in the guide.
