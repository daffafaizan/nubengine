      into account, this research project aims to develop and validate a new digital measure of
      affective patient-reported experience/outcome in maternal care.

      In this validating study extensive collection of affective ratings of 195 emotion words will
      be collected. Pregnant women (N=1000) at different gestational stages are asked to provide
      affective ratings of 195 emotion words in relation to the dimensions: pleasure, arousal,
      dominance. This is done by using a visual Likert scale (Self-Assessment Manikin). The
      pregnant women participating in the research are also asked to answer to various
      questionnaires to identify patterns of personality, behavior and the state of health and
      well-being. Based on the affective ratings population averages and properties of emotion
      words will be calculated. The measure will be developed in respect to the analysis of
      affective ratings and supplementing data.

      The research provides insights on how affective ratings could be connected to clinical
      indicators and patient experience.
