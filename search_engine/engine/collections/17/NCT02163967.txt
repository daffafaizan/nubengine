      different intensities of stimulation (sham, 1 milli Amp, 2 milli Amp), with each session
      occurring on a separate day. The Fisher Wallace Stimulator (FW100) which delivers a low dose
      alternating current a varying pulsed frequencies (5 Hertz, 500 Hertz, and 25000 Hertzz) will
      be used for the stimulation. ECG will be recorded continuously for 15 minutes before
      stimulation, during 20 minute stimulation and for 15 minutes following stimulation. Effect on
      parasympathetic tone will determined by measuring high frequency heart rate variability
      before, during and after the stimulation. Effect of CES of heart rate and low frequency heart
      rate variability will also be examined. Subject side effects will also be assessed.
