      receive, 6 months after the graft, 3 injections of hexavalent vaccine (diphteria-tetanus-
      poliomyelitis-pertussis-Hib-HBV) within 2 months, followed by a booster dose one yrar after.
      However, this strategy do not constantly lead to efficient antibody levels.

      the investigators aim to determine whether a 4th dose in the initial vaccine schedule (month
      0, 1, 2, and 3) allows to obtain a better response.

      After informed consent, the investigators will recruit 6 months after the graft 200 patients
      who had received an hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The participants will have a
      measure of their antibody level against 5 pathogens (diphteria toxin, tetanus toxin,
      Haemophilus influenza b, hepatitis B virus, poliomyelitis virus) at month 0 (before the 1st
      hexavalent vaccine injection), and one month after the 3rd injection of this vaccine. If the
      antibody response is not sufficient, they will be randomized for a 4th dose in the following
      month.

      The one year booster dose will be then injected to all participants, and the antibody
      response will be again measured one month after this dose. The primary endpoint is to compare
      the antibody levels at this date in patients who had an unsufficient immune response after
      the 3rd dose and who received or not a 4rth dose in the initial vaccine schedule.
