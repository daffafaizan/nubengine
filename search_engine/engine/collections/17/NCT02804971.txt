    
      Phenotype of the lung disease will include: spirometry, plethysmography, DLCO measurement
      according to the ATS/ERS guideline. 6M walking test and echocardiography will be also
      performed.

      Frequency of comorbidities will be calculated with data from questionnaire as well as
      standardized explorations.

      Aging related manifestations will be measured: arterial stiffness using aortic pulse wave
      velocity, bone mineral density using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Appendicular skeletal
      muscle mass and grip test were also performed.

      Blood test were also performed to measure inflammatory markers, cytokines and length of
      telomere in circulating leucocytes.
