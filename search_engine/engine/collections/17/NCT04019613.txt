      chronic dyspnea. Ultimately, high LV filling pressure leads to the development of
      extravascular lung water (EVLW) which can cause symptoms of dyspnea. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is
      a highly feasible, non-invasive procedure that is extremely sensitive for detecting EVLW. The
      sonographic signature of EVLW is a reverberation artifact called a "B-Line". The study will
      evaluate the etiology of sonographic B-Lines using invasive hemodynamic catheterization while
      simultaneously measuring the amount of EVLW present during exercise stress testing using
      transpulmonary thermodilution. The study aim is to demonstrate that the severity of EVLW,
      assessed by number of B-Lines, will correlate with LV filling pressures. In addition, the
      study will test the hypothesis that patients demonstrating dynamic increases in sonographic
      B-Lines with exercise will also display more severe symptoms of dyspnea, altered ventilatory
      mechanics (higher ratio of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2)), and
      reduced aerobic capacity (lower peak oxygen consumption (VO2)).
