      reported incidences varied from 10% to 20%. The development of postpartum depression produces
      harmful effects not only on mothers, but also on infants and young children. Prenatal
      depression or high depression score is an independent risk factor for the development of
      postpartum depression.

      Ketamine is a commonly used general anesthetic. In addition, low-dose ketamine is recommended
      for antidepressant therapy. S-ketamine is more potent as an anaesthetic and might also have a
      better antidepressive effect. We hypothesize that low-dose s-ketamine has a therapeutic
      effect on parturients with prenatal depression. However, evidences in this aspect are
      insufficient. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose s-ketamine
      administered after childbirth can reduce the incidence of postpartum depression in
      parturients with prenatal depression.
