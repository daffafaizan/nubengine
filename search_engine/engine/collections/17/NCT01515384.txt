      of the VMAT2-binding compound 18F-AV-133 as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical in the field of
      diabetes. Specifically, this study will evaluate 18F-AV-133 imaging in patients with type 1
      diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy controls in order to:

        1. Obtain information regarding the safety of 18F-AV-133 in these populations;

        2. Determine whether uptake, distribution, or clearance of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas
           differs between subjects with predicted reduced beta cell mass (patients with type 1 or
           type 2 diabetes of long duration) and normal beta cell mass (healthy volunteers);

        3. Evaluate the PET imaging pharmacokinetics of 18F-AV-133 in abdominal organs of healthy
           control subjects and patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes;

        4. Obtain preliminary information regarding the appropriate time window for optimal PET
           imaging of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas post-administration for type 1, type 2, and normal
           healthy individuals;

        5. Obtain preliminary information regarding an appropriate reference tissue for evaluating
           the PET imaging results of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas; and

        6. Evaluate the imaging properties of 18F-AV-133 in the pancreas relative to the brain in a
           subset of subjects.
