      high-normal blood pressure is increasing rapidly among the young and middle-aged people aged
      less than 65 years.

      Young and middle-aged patients with hypertension have a lower absolute short-term
      cardiovascular risk, but their lifetime risk is higher.

      Studies have shown that the awareness rate, treatment rate and control rate ("three rates")
      of young and middle-aged hypertensive patients in my country need to be improved urgently.

      Improving the knowledge and behavior of young and middle-aged hypertensive patients with
      disease, treatment compliance and self-health management has become the focus of research.

      "Internet + medical" through information network technology, innovative service models have
      become a trend.
