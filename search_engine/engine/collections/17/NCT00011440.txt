      model of allergic inflammation and nasal lavage as a non-invasive method for obtaining
      samples. The nasal cavity is both an excellent model of allergic inflammation and provides an
      easily accessible site for study. We measured inflammatory cells and cytokines in the nasal
      lavage fluid. Our specific hypothesis was that particulate exposure prior to allergen
      challenge would enhance inflammatory cell recruitment and expression of inflammatory
      cytokines.
