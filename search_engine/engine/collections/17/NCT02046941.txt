      predictive of speech treatment response and measure neural plasticity in response to speech
      treatment, using state-of-the-art neuroimaging and statistical processing techniques in a
      group of well-characterized left hemisphere patients meeting strict inclusionary criteria.
      Specifically, the investigators will use voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to identify
      lesion sites most predictive of a positive response to speech treatment and advanced
      diffusion imaging techniques to map changes in the integrity of white matter tracts from pre-
      to post-treatment.
