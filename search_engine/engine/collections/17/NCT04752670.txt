      submucosal space to perform advanced endoscopic procedures. The submucosa is the third layer
      of the gastrointestinal wall and it is a potential space which is expandable upon injecting
      the submucosa with fluid. The expanded submucosa causes a significant lift which enable
      dissection of the submucosal space with the removal of the overlying polyp or early cancer.
      The submucosal space can be also utilized to create a longitudinal submucosal tunnel in the
      esophagus or the stomach wall which allows for performing lower esophageal sphincter or
      pyloric myotomy for the treatment of achalasia or Gastroparesis.

      Currently, the most commonly performed submucosal endoscopy procedures are endoscopic
      submucosal dissection (ESD) for removal of early cancers or polyps throughout the
      gastrointestinal tract, Per-oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) for treatment of achalasia, or
      Gastric Per-Oral Endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of Gastroparesis. All of the above
      procedures require a specialized electrosurgical unit (ESU) which generate high frequency
      current to help incision (cutting) of the mucosa and dissection (coagulation) of the
      submucosa. The ConMed Beamer is a novel ESU with tissue sensing property which expedites the
      process of submucosal dissection. The device is currently approved for clinical use in the
      US. The purpose of this study is to create registry for all submucosal endoscopy procedures
      performed using ConMed Beamer device at BSLMC with focus on clinical outcomes of the
      procedure including adverse events.
