      concurrent urinary symptoms. Broadly, UCPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder
      SyndromeBladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic
      Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. IC is a debilitating bladder disorder characterized by
      urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. The presentation of symptoms can be quite variable
      among patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial syndrome with several proposed
      etiologies, some of which may be interrelated.1 BPS as defined by the International
      Continence Society, is "the complaint of suprapubic pain related to bladder filling,
      accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and night-time frequency, in the
      absence of proven urinary infection or other obvious pathology."2 BPS is a clinical
      description of disease based on the patient's symptoms, and does not depend on urodynamic or
      cystoscopic findings. These symptoms may be related to IC, although diagnostic criteria are
      still lacking for this entity, and the relationship between BPS and IC is not clear. After
      the initiation phase for the MAPP SPS Study, it became clear that many of the hypotheses
      being proposed required well-characterized healthy "normal" controls that lack urologic pain
      as well as other study related symptoms/conditions. This second phase is enriched with
      pre-defined subgroups and a longer follow-up period which will allow further investigation of
      clinical and biologic factors associated with worsening and/or improvement of reported
      urinary and non-urinary symptoms.
