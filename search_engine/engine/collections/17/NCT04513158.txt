      one hour, the study proposes to determine the therapeutic efficacy (response rate) of
      convalescent plasma infusion in patients at high risk for mortality when infected by
      SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by prevention of progression to severe or life threatening COVID-19
      during the current hospitalization as determined by evaluating if the patient experienced the
      following the following: respiratory rate >30/min, Blood oxygen saturation <93%, partial
      pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ration <300, or received a medical
      diagnosis of respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure. This
      will be captured from the daily physical exam/clinical assessment done as part of routine
      care and at discharge.

      The study also proposes to determine the immunologic effects of convalescent plasma infusion
      as measured by serial SARS-CoV-2 Ag levels through RT-PCR measured by CoV PCR collected at
      enrollment, day 7 and discharge.

      Finally, the study intends to measure normalization of laboratory parameters for risk which
      will be documented every 3 days while the patient is hospitalized until the time that lab
      value returns to within the institution's normal range.
