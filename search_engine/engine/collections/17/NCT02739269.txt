    
      Patients undergoing the first-time IVF treatment cycle using either conventional insemination
      technique or intracytoplasmic sperm injection at Queen Mary Hospital will be invited to
      participate in this study. Participating subjects will be randomized into either (i) AFC or
      (ii) AMH group, where the gonadotrophin dosing will be determined based on the baseline AFC
      and serum AMH respectively as assessed one month before the IVF treatment. Randomisation will
      be performed according to a computer-generated list which will be read by an independent
      research nurse. That research nurse will assign the initial gonadotrophin dose according to
      the study protocol.

      In the AFC group, starting dose of gonadotrophin will be determined based on serum AMH
      concentration as follows:

      AFC <= 5: 300 IU daily AFC >5 and <=15: 225 IU daily AFC >15: 150 IU daily

      In the AMH group, starting dose of gonadotrophin will be determined based on serum AMH
      concentration as follows:

      AMH <= 1.0 ng/ml: 300 IU daily AMH >1.0 and <=3.3 ng/ml: 225 IU daily AMH >3.3 ng/ml: 150 IU
      daily

      The clinician and patient will both be blinded to the randomization throughout the course of
      treatment. The proportion of subjects having appropriate ovarian response, defined as the
      number of oocytes retrieved being 6 to 14 inclusive, will be compared between the two arms.
