      radiation exposure to half of that of the routine Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy.

      We will refer 50 patients over the age of 18 who had knee trauma, intent to or had MRI
      assessment and are scheduled for arthroscopy. The compartments of the injured knee will be
      evaluated on each of the modalities.

      Exclusion criterion is pregnancy
