    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether therapy with nivolumab following combined modality therapy (CMT)
      improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared with observation in patients with high risk
      anal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare nivolumab following combined modality therapy (CMT) with observation in
      patients with high risk anal carcinoma with regard to:

      Ia. Objective response rate (complete [CR] and partial [PR]), stable disease and progression.

      Ib. Severe toxicity interval. Ic. Colostomy-free survival. Id. Overall survival. Ie.
      Toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients who received standard CMT are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo observation for up to 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
