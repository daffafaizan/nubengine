      of preterm birth, giving birth to a child with low birth weight and a higher risk of
      complications during pregnancy both for mother and child. An early and coordinated
      intervention to reduce inequality in health may be important for this group of vulnerable
      women.

      The FACAM intervention is developed in Odense with the aim of reducing inequality in health
      by giving vulnerable pregnant women and their children the best possible start in life by
      offering an interdisciplinary coordinated support. The support will be offered by Odense
      municipality, the family clinic (Familieambulatoriet), and local voluntary organizations.

      The aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of FACAM to improve mother-child
      relationship, maternal health, maternal mental health, and the development and well-being of
      the child.

      The study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). A total of 320 pregnant women will be
      randomized to FACAM or Care as Usual.

      Participants are pregnant women categorized as antenatal care group 3 or 4, living in Odense
      and with a referral to Familieambulatoriet, OUH. Participants must be able to fill out
      questionnaires in Danish or English.

      Data will be collected at baseline (pregnancy), and when the child is 3 and 12 months old.
