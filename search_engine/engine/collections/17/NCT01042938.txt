      size for a larger study to be conducted through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community
      Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) mechanism. Specifically, this pilot project will
      investigate: 1) if curcumin can prevent or alleviate radiation-induced skin reactions in
      cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and 2) if skin pigmentation, as well as pain and
      psychophysiological factors, can predict the severity of radiation-induced dermatitis.
      Potential future research studies may be conducted to identify the biological mechanisms
      involved in radiation-induced dermatitis and the radioprotective function of curcumin.
