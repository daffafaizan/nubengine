      510(k) K171677), which fuses CT images to real-time US images to minimize the drawbacks of
      each modality while enhancing their benefits. Such benefits include, the reduction of
      radiation dose to the patient with the fusion of initial CT imaging overlaying the live US
      images. The fused imaging software allows the operator to watch the needle tip advance
      towards the lesion on both live US and overlaid CT imaging. In such a setting, the operator
      would only need to perform an initial CT scan, advance the needle into position using fused
      US/CT images, and a final CT scan to ensure needle tip location. This eliminates interval CT
      scans that are usually required after each incremental needle position adjustment, and thus,
      reduces radiation dose to the patient and wasted procedural time during the incremental CT
      scans.
