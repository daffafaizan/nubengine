      I. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in primary outcomes of psychological trauma
      and cancer distress over a six week time period while receiving weekly accelerated resolution
      therapy (ART).

      II. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in secondary outcomes of anxiety and
      depression over a six week period while receiving weekly ART.

      III. We will use a qualitative, descriptive design to explore contextual elements of the
      cancer experience that are consistently distressing and/or psychologically traumatic to more
      fully inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing in ART in cancer distress and
      psychological trauma.

      IV. Calculate changes, and estimate mean changes, in secondary outcomes of resilience and
      symptom distress over a six week period while receiving weekly ART.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ART over 60-90 minutes once a week for up to 5 sessions.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week and again at 1
      month.
