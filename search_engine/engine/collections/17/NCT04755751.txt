      activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Enzyme replacement therapy
      (ERT) with Myozyme has significantly improved the prospect of patients with infantile Pompe
      disease (IPD). Most IPD patients show clinical improvement on therapy, but deteriorate at
      different time points, raising the possibility that increasing drug delivery might halt the
      progression of the disease. Data on the effects of ERT therapy on physiological variables
      related to exercise tolerance is scarce.

      Our aims are to investigate the acute and long term effect of ERT on exercise capacity;
      comparing the effect of different ERT dosages (as prescribed by the clinician according to
      clinical judgment) and assessing the relationship between enzyme blood level and exercise
      capacity. Such evaluation may allow a more objective quantification of the response to ERT.

      Methods: A retrospective - prospective study evaluating pediatric patients with Pompe before
      and 2 days after ERT on multiple occasions and different dosing. Evaluation included
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 6 minute-walking test (6MWT), motor function test
      (GMFM-88) and self-collected blood samples (on a Guthrie card) for enzyme blood levels.
