      during a 28-day window in which chemotherapy was initiated. Disease is also assessed after
      cycles 3 and 6 of trial treatment (and after cycle 8, if administered), every 3 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months thereafter. Physical examinations will be performed, and serum
      CA-125 levels measured at the beginning of each cycle of chemotherapy. Treatment-free
      interval (6 to 12 months or >12 months after the last chemotherapy infusion) will be
      reported.
