      I. To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in refractory tumors and plaques
      of mycosis fungoides (MF).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of sequential PDT and radiation therapy (RT). II. To determine
      the side effect profile of PDT in MF.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the quality of life during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically and undergo photodynamic therapy
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at week 24, patients undergo radiation
      therapy daily for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 weeks.
