      autonomic neuropathy, hormonal imbalance, and psychogenic factors. However, as the
      endothelial dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the development of ED in
      diabetic patients, such patients can be resistant to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5I)
      like sildenafil therapy. There are reports of lower efficacy of sildenafil in DM patients
      compared to general population.In the field of sexual medicine numerous studies have shown
      that ESWT is safe, noninvasive, and, most importantly, an effective method for treating
      vascular ED

      Before starting the study, clearance will be obtained from the institutional ethical
      committee and prior informed consent of all the participants will be obtained before
      conducting the study. Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinic of andrology (Cairo
      University Hospitals). The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups:

      Group (1): (Study group): Men in this group (n= 20) men receive extracorporeal shock wave
      (ESWT) twice weekly for 3 consecutive weeks and repeated after a 3-week rest period, for a
      total of 12 treatment sessions+sildenafil 5mg) Group (2): (Control group):) will receive sham
      treatment underwent identical therapy with ESWT application with a similar appearance and
      sound as the active low intensity ESWT+sildenafil 5mg
