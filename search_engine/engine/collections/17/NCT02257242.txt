    
      Bendamustine-rituximab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for treatment of many indolent
      B-cell lymphomas, but most patients experience a recurrence of the lymphoma. Vincristine
      sulfate has been a traditional component of chemotherapy regimens in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
      it is possible that adding it to the bendamustine-rituximab regimen might provide a better
      quality of remissions or longer duration of remissions with acceptable toxicity.

      This is a phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-arm trial in patients with indolent
      B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma otherwise appropriate for bendamustine-rituximab as initial or
      subsequent line of therapy. Patients will receive the of rituximab and bendamustine in
      combination with escalating doses of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®). The
      objective of this study is to assess safety of this combination by establishing the maximum
      tolerated dose of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®) in the combination.
