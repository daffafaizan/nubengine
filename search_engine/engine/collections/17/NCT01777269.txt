    
      This is an European double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group comparison of DUODART
      (fixed dose combination of dutasteride 0.5mg and tamsulosin 0.4mg, one capsule daily) and
      placebo. Men eligible at screening will be randomised, after a 4 week placebo run-in, to the
      2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. All men will receive standardised lifestyle advice
      (primarily concerning weight management and exercise) relevant to maintaining sexual
      function. Men will also receive a standardised lifestyle advice leaflet for BPH. The double
      blind phase will continue for 12 months, with assessment visits at 2 weeks and at months 1,
      3, 6, 9 and a final visit at month 12. Subjects with sexual adverse events during the double
      blind phase will continue to be followed at scheduled study visits until resolution of the
      adverse event or at a visit 6 months after the last dose of study medication, whichever is
      sooner.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the change in sexual function from baseline to 1 year in sexually active men with
      at least moderate BPH (international prostate symptom score - IPSS = or > 12) who are treated
      with DUODART, compared to men treated with placebo . Change in sexual function will be
      assessed by change in total score from the full men's sexual health questionnaire (MSHQ)
      which has domains for erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory function and libido.
