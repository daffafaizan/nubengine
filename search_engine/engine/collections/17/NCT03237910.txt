      the cardiac arrest scene and application of the defibrillatory pads to the patient's chest
      and power on of the defibrillator with the real time AMSA analysis:

        -  If AMSA is ≥ 15.5 mV-Hz, an immediate defibrillation is attempted, followed by CPR

        -  If AMSA is < 15.5 mV-Hz, defibrillation is not attempted and CPR is delivered

        -  During the 2-min cycle of CPR, AMSA is measured during pauses for ventilations (every 30
           CC, approximately every 20/25 sec). If an AMSA value ≥ 15.5 mV-Hz is achieved prior to
           cycle completion, an immediate defibrillation is delivered (thus the defibrillation
           attempt is anticipated)

      After completion of the first 2-min CPR cycle:

        -  If AMSA is ≤ 6.5 mV-Hz, the defibrillation is not attempted but CPR is continued

        -  If AMSA is > 6.5 mV-Hz, an immediate defibrillation attempt is delivered, followed by
           CPR

        -  During the 2-min cycle of CPR, AMSA is measured during pauses for ventilations (every 30
           CC, approximately every 20/25 sec). If an AMSA value ≥ 15.5 mV-Hz is achieved prior to
           cycle completion, an immediate defibrillation is delivered

      After completion of the second 2-min CPR cycle and till the end of the resuscitative
      intervention:

      • CPR is continued based on standard 2015 ERC guidelines (a defibrillation attempt every
      2-min CPR cycles), except for the possibility to anticipate the defibrillation attempt if
      AMSA becomes ≥ 15.5 mV-Hz during the CPR cycle.

      In the standard CPR intervention, upon arrival of the ALS team at the cardiac arrest scene,
      and application of the defibrillatory pads to the patient's chest and power on of the
      defibrillator:

      • a defibrillation is immediately attempted and CPR is then started and continued for 2- min.
      Analysis of rhythm and subsequent defibrillation attempts are performed every 2-min CPR
      cycles.

      In both study groups, the quality of CC and ventilation is monitored in real time thought the
      feedback integrated into the defibrillator.
