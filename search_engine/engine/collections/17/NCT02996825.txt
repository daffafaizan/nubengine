    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) when given in combination with mirvetuximab
      soravtansine (IMGN853) to patients with FRalpha-positive recurrent ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, fallopian tube, endometrial cancer, or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the toxicity, response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) in three
      expanded cohorts of heavily pre-treated FRalpha-positive a) TNBC patients; b) endometrial
      cancer patients; and c) ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer patients, all
      treated at the initial recommended phase II dose.

      II. To provide additional safety data from the expanded cohorts to help inform on the RP2D
      for each cohort.

      III. To evaluate the relationship between intratumoral levels of DM4, tumoral expression of
      FRalpha, and plasma concentration of DM4 at 48 and 72 hours following the first dose.

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DM4 and gemcitabine when given in combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the role of archival FRalpha expression as a substitute for the 48-72 hour (H)
      expression in determining intratumoral concentration of DM4.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously (IV) on day 1 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
