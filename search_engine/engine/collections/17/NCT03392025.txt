      Center in Tehran, Iran. After review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and explanation
      of the design of the study, written consent form will be completed. The participants are 81
      eligible coronary artery disease patients, aged 20-75 years. Intervention groups will be
      received 30 g/d flaxseed, alone, or with weekly Mediterranean-like diet menu and control
      group will be received capsules of wheat fiber as placebo for 3 months. Vascular endothelial
      function will be evaluated through measurement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in brachial
      artery and carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) via ultrasound sonography and plasma level
      of asymmetric di-methyl arginine (ADMA). Fasting blood sample will be taken to measure
      malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid profile, high sensitive C-reactive protein and inflammatory
      cytokines (Interleukine-6 [IL-6] and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a [TNF-a]).
