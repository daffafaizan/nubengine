      unknown. Although not a life-threatening illness, IBS is considered to be a serious condition
      that has a substantial impact on a subject's day-to-day function. IBS is characterized by
      abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, including diarrhea, constipation, or alternating
      diarrhea and constipation. Symptoms are typically intermittent but may be continuous.
