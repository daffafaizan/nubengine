      endoscopic transilluminating point to the abdominal wall. Percutaneous anterior colopexy will
      be performed, using a gastropexy device that is included in the percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy (PEG) kit . This technique involves the placement of a threaded nylon fastener
      into the colon through a needle.

      The endoscope will be manipulated until the light approaches the premarked site. A small skin
      disc will then be removed at this location and a loop colostomy will be made. The colonoscope
      will also be used as a guide to identify the proximal and distal limbs of the loop colostomy.
