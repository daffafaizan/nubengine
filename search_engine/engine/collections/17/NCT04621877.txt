      trial of lay-delivered Behavioral Activation ("Do More, Feel Better"; DMFB), in comparison to
      MSW-delivered Behavioral Activation (MSW BA), for depressed (PHQ-9>10 and Ham-D>14) older
      (60+) senior center clients. The primary aim tests the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison
      to MSW BA, on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression symptoms.
      The investigators will test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in
      depression severity and whether increased activity's impact on depression is non-inferior
      across conditions. Secondarily, the investigators will test hypotheses associated with
      overall functioning, satisfaction with treatment, and client-level moderators. Lastly the
      investigators will explore longer-term client outcomes, delivery cost, and preparing for
      sustainability by exploring client, provider, and center factors related to intervention
      fidelity.
