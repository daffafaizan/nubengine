    
      Phase I study design:

      This is a single-centre, Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of bevacizumab-rucaparib combination and determine the MTD in patients with
      advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      The dose of bevacizumab is fixed in cohort 1, 2 and 3 of the study at 15mg/kg, q 3 weekly.

      The dose of rucaparib is evaluated in three cohorts (400 mg BID; 500 mg BID; 600 mg BID).

      This trial will enroll at least 3 patients in cohort 1 with dose escalation to rucaparib 500
      mg from cohort 1 to 2. Cohort 2 will enroll at least 3 patients with dose escalation to
      rucaparib 600 mg from cohort 2 to 3.

      The standard 3+3 design will be used. Patients will be enrolled in cohort of 3 patients, if
      no DLT event will be reported among the first 3 patients, a second cohort will be enrolled at
      the upper dose level. If 1 DLT event is registered in the first cohort, other 3 patients will
      be enrolled at the same dose.

      Phase II study design:

      Eligible patients with histological documented high grade Stage IIIB-IIIC-IV ovarian cancer
      (regardless of residual tumor) will be randomized 1:1:1 according to a molecular driven
      treatment.

      HRD positive patients:

        -  ARM B: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 for 6 cycles followed by Rucaparib
           600 mg BID q 28 for 24 cycles as maintenance

        -  ARM C: Carboplatin AUC 5+ Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg for 6 cycles
           followed by Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 21 days for 16 cycles + Rucaparib 500 mg part BID q
           28 for 24 cycles as maintenance

      HRD negative patients:

        -  ARM A: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg for 6 cycles
           followed by Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 21 for 16 cycles

        -  ARM B: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 for 6 cycles followed by Rucaparib
           600 mg BID q 28 for 24 cycles as maintenance

        -  ARM C: Carboplatin AUC 5+ Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg for 6 cycles
           followed by Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 21 days for 16 cycles + Rucaparib 500 mg BID q 28 for
           24 cycles as maintenance.

      Stratification factors are:

        -  Residual tumor at primary surgery (RT=0 vs RT> 0)

        -  Neoadiuvant chemotherapy (Yes or not)
