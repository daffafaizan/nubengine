      I. To use 3-dimensional (3D) quantitative mapping to determine whether differences in T2 spin
      parameters exist between the peritumoral area and normal brain in the contralateral
      hemisphere at baseline.

      II. To use 3D quantitative mapping to examine how differences between peritumoral and normal
      brain in the contralateral hemisphere change before and after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether T2 values might be useful in distinguishing non-enhancing components of
      the tumor as well as predicting response to treatment.

      II. Quantify T1 and proton density (PD) spin parameters of the peritumoral area and their
      differences before and after treatment.

      III. Examine post-contrast T1 spin parameters with perfusion characteristics as measured by
      an established dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) technique.

      IV. Examine differences in measured perfusion parameters (blood volume and mean transit time
      of each tumor) before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 21 days before standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, patients
      undergo an MRI scan for the first set of images. Patients then receive either gadobutrol or
      gadobenate dimeglumine intravenously (IV) and undergo an MRI for the second set of images.
      All MRI scans take a total of 60 minutes to complete. Patients then repeat the MRI scans 120
      days after standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
