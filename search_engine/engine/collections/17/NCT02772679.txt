      polyclonal regulatory T cells (Polyclonal Tregs) plus Interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered to
      patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) will be safe and biologically active. A Phase I
      trial with this cellular therapy plus IL-2 will lead the way for Phase II trials that test
      for efficacy based on preservation of C-peptide, reduced exogenous insulin requirements and
      improved glycemic control.

      This is a Phase I safety/dosing study of Polyclonal Tregs + IL-2 in patients with T1DM.

      The Tregs will be expanded using an established protocol utilizing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads
      plus IL-2. The study will involve 2 dosing cohorts of 6-8 T1DM patients each. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the safety of Tregs + IL-2 and survival of Tregs in
      patients with recent onset T1DM who receive infusions of autologous Tregs + IL-2. The study
      will also assess potential effects of Tregs on beta cell function and the autoimmune
      response.

      Subjects will receive Polyclonal Tregs at doses of 3 or 20x10^6 cells/kg. The dose of Tregs
      is selected based on a combination of considerations of manufacturing capacity, a predicted
      efficacious dose, and the available safety data of the Treg product currently in clinical
      trials. The IL-2 dose will be 1 x10^6 IU subcutaneously, given daily for 5 consecutive days
      at the completion of the cell infusion and again after 1 month. This dose is based on recent
      studies from Klatzmann et al. in T1DM, where the dose was found to be effective in a
      selective Treg expansion, well tolerated, and without an acute decline in beta cell function
      (Rosenzwajg et al., 2015).
