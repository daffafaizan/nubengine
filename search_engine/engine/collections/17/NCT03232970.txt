      sufficient to change diet behavior of the participants. Forty participants will be recruited
      and then randomly assigned to one of two groups (20 in each group): The Experimental group
      will attend one weekly session with instructions on how to increase fiber intake; Control
      group will not have the intervention. The goal of the study is to see if the Full Plate Diet
