    
      Main objective

      To estimate, in sub-Saharan African HIV-1 infected adults who failed a NNRTI-base first-line
      ART and then a PI-based second-line ART:

        1. The efficacy (and associated factors) at 12 weeks of an intensive 3-months adherence
           reinfrocement phase;

        2. In patients who successfully resuppress at 12 weeks: The percentage of patients still
           with continuing succesfull virologic supression on 2nd-line ART at 64 weeks (and factors
           associated to success) ;

        3. In patients with persistent failure at 12 weeks : The efficacy (and associated factors)
           at 64 weeks of a darunavir/r + raltegravir-based 3rd-line regimen.

      Number of participants : 200

      Main outcome :

        -  At 12 weeks : Proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml and/or with
           a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA >2 log10 copies/ml between inclusion and 12 weeks;

        -  At 64 weeks : proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Age >18 years

        -  Documented HIV-1 infection.

        -  History of failing a NNRTI-based 1st-line ART

        -  Current PI-based 2nd-line ART >6 months

        -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml

        -  Signed informed consent
