      immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of CpG 1018/Alum-adjuvated SCB-2019 vaccine. The
      COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high morbidity and mortality, caused major disruption to
      healthcare systems, and has had significant socioeconomic impacts. Currently, only limited
      treatment options are available against COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is
      urgently needed. A safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 prevention would have significant
      public health impact.
