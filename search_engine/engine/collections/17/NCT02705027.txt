      patients because of the beneficial effect in patients e.g. with necrotizing pancreatitis,
      according trauma or major surgical procedures.

      A direct application of jejunal tube feeding is necessary especially in patients with
      gastroparesis due of existing diabetes mellitus, postoperative or severe underlying disease.
      Since the jejunal tube feedings, the secretion of gastric juice can be increased, the use of
      probes that allow both: jejunal nutrition, as well as a gastric outflow of secretions are
      beneficial.

      While in a randomized trial of Schwab et al. it could be shown that the use of
      Freka-Trilumina® compared to Dobbhoff probe by so-called drag technique is significantly
      faster there are currently no comparative data to use the Easy-In® probe subsequently
      developed , which is directly introduced through the working channel of the endoscope, and
      thus shortening the procedure time.

      In the presented study should be investigated to what extent the use of imported directly via
      the working channel Easy-Inn® probe, application time and thus the investigation period may
      be shortened compared to the usual nasojenunal probes.
