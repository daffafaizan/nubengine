    
      This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients are given 100mg of minocycline
      2 hours prior to their procedure and then 100mg two times a day for 5 days. The subjects are
      then contacted daily to check their level of pain. The investigators' outcome of interest is
      time to pain resolution.

      The investigators will perform a futility analysis to assess if a larger trial would be a
      reasonable next step after this pilot study.
