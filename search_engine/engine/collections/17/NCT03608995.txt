      hospitalizations). To date, the assessment of severity relies mainly on ultrasound
      measurement of the cervix. The length of the cervix is significantly correlated with the risk
      of spontaneous premature delivery. A threshold of 25mm is relevant to rule out a delivery
      within 7 days but the identification of new markers including biological would be interesting
      to guide the clinician in assessing the risk of preterm birth. Among the biomarkers measured
      in vaginal secretions, the detection of fetal fibronectin seems to be the most relevant
      because of a high negative predictive value (NPV) up to 100% to rule out a delivery within 7
      days. However, the use of this test is discussed because of its low positive predictive value
      (PPV) to predict delivery within 7 days (from 11% to 48%). The use of Premaquick © test
      (Biosynex, Strasbourg, France), which allow the simultaneous quantification of IL-6, total
      IGFBP-1 and native IGFBP-1 could be more efficient compared to the detection of fibronectin
      by improving the VPP. The results already obtained on a cohort of 97 patients (Eleje et al.,
      2016) show a similar NPV and a higher PPV of the Premaquick© test compared to the Quikcheck
      fFN ™ test (PPV up to 95% when the 3 markers are positive). Investigator wish to conduct a
      comparative study between these two tests on a larger cohort of patients (n = 220). Results
      of the tests will be masked for the clinician and the patient in order to assess and compare
      their ability to predict delivery within 7 days without modify the current medical
      management.
