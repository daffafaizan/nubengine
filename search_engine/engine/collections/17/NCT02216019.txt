      CD3 on T lymphocytes.

      Flow cytometers will all be calibrated the same way using common reagents (known fluorescent
      calibration beads). Moreover, CD45 and CD3 level of expression on lymphocytes will help to
      check that the collection of data is standardized between the different centers.
