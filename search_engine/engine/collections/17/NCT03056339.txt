      Primary objective:

      To determine the safety and relative efficacy of Chimeric antigen receptors
      (CAR).CD19-CD28-zeta-2A-iCasp9-IL15-transduced cord blood natural killer (CB-NK) cells in
      patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B lymphoid malignancies.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the overall response rate (complete and partial response rates).

        2. To quantify persistence of infused allogeneic donor CAR-transduced CB-derived NK cells
           in the recipient.

        3. To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.
