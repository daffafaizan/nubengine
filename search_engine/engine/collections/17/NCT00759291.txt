      endothelium-dependent vasodilation in conduit vessels and insulin-mediated vasodilation in
      forearm resistance arterioles in vivo, whole-body insulin sensitivity, and AKT (also known as
      Protein Kinase B) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in skin biopsy
      specimens ex vivo, when compared with placebo.
