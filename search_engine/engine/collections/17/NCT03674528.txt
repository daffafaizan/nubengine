      Americans with or at risk for NAFLD, the most common chronic liver disease and most rapidly
      growing indication for liver transplantation in the United States. To achieve this objective,
      an advanced MR-based imaging method will be used to measure liver "stiffness" which is an
      early sign of disease. This technique has been previously developed and validated and ready
      to be used for further research. This current protocol will extend previous work by
      optimizing and validating advanced 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional-magnetic resonance
      elastography (MRE) methods as non-invasive biomarkers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in
      obese patients at risk for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the histologically more
      aggressive subset of NAFLD.
