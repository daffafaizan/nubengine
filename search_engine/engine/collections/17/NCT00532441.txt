    
      Outline: This is a multi-center study.

      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive treatment as follows until disease
      progression or excessive toxicities:

        -  Erlotinib 150 mg p.o. daily on days 2-7, 9-14, 16-28

        -  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 IV over 30 min weekly x 3 weeks on days 1, 8, 15

      Treatment cycle = 28 days

      Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

      Life expectancy: At least 12 weeks

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000 mm3

        -  Platelet count > 75,000 mm3

        -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin < 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Transaminases (AST, ALT) < 5.0 x ULN if alkaline phosphatase is < 2.5 x ULN, or alkaline
           phosphatase < 5 x ULN if transaminases are < 1.5 x ULN.

        -  If not on anticoagulation: PT < 4 seconds above ULN; INR < 1.5; PTT < 1.3 x ULN.

        -  If on therapeutic anticoagulation, patients may have an INR > 1.5 and PTT within
           therapeutic range; INR will be monitored weekly until stable.

        -  Serum Albumin > 3.0

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine clearance of > 60 ml/ min (by Cockcroft-Gault)

      Pulmonary:

        -  Not specified
