      of HIV infection, there are still unexplained differences in both the progression of
      untreated HIV infection and response to antiretroviral therapy. These differences are likely
      related to the unique genetic makeup of individuals with HIV infection. Particular genes may
      offer protection against HIV infection, while other genes may make disease progression more
      likely. Knowing more about the genetic makeup of HIV infected individuals may lead to the
      development of a targeted treatment strategy based on an individual's specific risk of
      disease progression and sensitivity to medication toxicity. The purpose of this substudy is
      to collect blood samples from SMART study participants. The samples will be used in future
      Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) studies investigating the link
      between human genetic factors and clinical outcome data.

      This study will enroll individuals currently participating in the SMART study. Participants
      will provide one blood sample. Individual test results from future blood analyses will not be
      provided to a patient unless they may have profound health implications for that patient.
