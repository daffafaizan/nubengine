    
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, parallel, sequential ascending multiple-dose,
      multicenter study to assess the dose related safety, tolerability, PK and PD of SOBI003 in
      pediatric MPS IIIA patients. Patients between 1 and 6 years of age who have not received
      previous treatment for MPS IIIA with an ERT, gene- or stem cell therapy will be eligible to
      participate in the study. The study is planned to consist of 3 dose cohorts, each comprising
      3 patients. Treatment initiations will be staggered within each cohort in order to be able to
      observe, interpret and treat possible adverse reactions. SOBI003 is administered as weekly
      i.v. infusions over a period of 24 weeks. Upon completion of the 24-week treatment period
      with satisfactory tolerability, the patient is offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment
      by participation in an extension study.
