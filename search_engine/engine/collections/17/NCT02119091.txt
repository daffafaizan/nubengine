      years old. Half of them will be healthy Chinese volunteers, both male and female; will be
      recruited to obtain at least 36 evaluable volunteers in Chinese site of CTC, PUTH. The other
      half will be healthy Caucasian volunteers, both male and female; will be recruited to obtain
      at least 36 evaluable volunteers in the U.S. site of Spaulding Clinical Research LLC. An
      evaluable subject is defined as a volunteer completing all study procedures from the
      screening period to the final ECG nominal time-point for QTc interval measurement and final
      blood sampling for plasma levels of Moxifloxacin on the last study day (Day 2 of the second
      period).

      Study Objective:Primary Objective:To compare the difference of ΔΔQTcF (Baseline-adjusted,
      placebo-corrected effect on QTcF) between Chinese group and Caucasian group under the same
      exposure (Cmax) of Moxifloxacin.Secondary Objectives:1)To compare the difference of ΔΔQTcF,
      heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and Moxifloxacin plasma concentration between Chinese group and
      Caucasian group.2)To compare slopes of Moxifloxacin plasma Concentration/QTcF value between
      healthy Chinese volunteers and Caucasian Volunteers.
