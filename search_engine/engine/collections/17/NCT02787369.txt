    
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. The investigators are studying the
      combination of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors with ricolinostat, in order to
      try to enhance both the initial remission and to help improve the response in those who
      relapse after a first inhibitor and are receiving a second.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ACY-1215 as a treatment for
      any disease. ACY-1215 or ricolinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, specifically HDAC6.
      The FDA has approved idelalisib as well as ibrutinib as treatment options for Relapsed or
      Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia (CLL).
