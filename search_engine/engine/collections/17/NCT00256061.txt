      between electrolyte levels measured using blood gas analysers and by laboratory techniques,
      and between levels measured on arterial and venous blood samples.

      The study aim is determine the agreement between electrolyte levels measure by formal
      laboratory serum analysis and point-of-care blood gas analysis.

      Also, to determine the agreement between electrolyte levels measured on simultaneous arterial
      and venous blood samples, using both serum and whole blood samples.
