      exercise is generally considered secondary to energy restriction for the treatment of
      obesity. Indeed, an argument can be made that suggests exercise is not effective for weight
      loss. Meta-analytic studies consistently find small amounts of weight loss due to exercise
      without energy restriction. It is critical to note that there are actually very few
      randomized controlled trials using exercise alone for weight loss. We believe that there are
      3 critical flaws in the vast majority of the literature. 1)Participants are not supervised
      and is generally recorded by self report and is likely poorly estimated and in general,
      overestimated. 2)The amount of exercise used is usually prescribed from the guidelines for
      recommended levels for physical fitness and to diminish cardiovascular disease, not the
      amount that may be necessary for weight loss. 3)The energy expenditure of the exercise is
      rarely reported.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to expend either 400 or 600kcal per exercise session
      (or a control group) and will exercise 5 days per week for 9 months. All exercise sessions
      will be supervised and the length of the exercise session will be based upon energy
      expenditure (kcal/min) at a give heart rate range. To account for improvements in fitness,
      energy expenditure will be measured monthly and adjustments to the daily exercise
      prescription will be altered accordingly.
