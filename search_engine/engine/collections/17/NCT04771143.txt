    
      This is a randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group study to assess safety and tolerability and to compare the effects of AFQ056 on IV
      cocaine's physiological and subjective effects in non-treatment seeking, cocaine-experienced
      participants who meet American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      (DSM-V) criteria for cocaine use disorder.

      Approximately twenty participants will be randomized to 2 groups (10 in each group),
      receiving either AFQ056 or placebo treatment for 8 days.

      Participants will be screened for eligibility as outpatients and inpatients. Outpatient
      screening will occur between Day -28 and Day -4. On Study Day -3, participants will undergo
      clinic intake to screen for continued eligibility. On Study Day -2, participants will be
      screened for eligibility with a participant-blinded screening infusion (Infusion Session 1)
      of 20 mg cocaine, followed by a saline infusion, followed by a 40 mg cocaine infusion. Each 2
      ml infusion of cocaine and saline will be administered by IV over a 60 second time period and
      approximately 60 minutes apart. Physiological and subjective data (VAS) from these sessions
      will be part of the eligibility criteria to continue in the study.

      Once a participant has been determined to be eligible, the participant will be randomized on
      Day -1 to receive either AFQ056 or placebo in a 1:1: ratio and at the same time, will also be
      randomized to a specific couple of sequences saline/cocaine or cocaine/saline for Infusion
      Session 2 and Infusion Session 3 within each treatment group. The order of the saline and
      cocaine infusions for each participant for Infusion Sessions 4 and 5 will be the same as the
      randomized order for Infusion Sessions 2 and 3, respectively.

      Participants will receive baseline infusions determined by the randomized sequences of saline
      and 20 mg of cocaine on Day 1 (Infusion Session 2) and saline and 40 mg of cocaine on Day 2
      (Infusion Session 3). The participants will receive either AFQ056 or matching placebo twice a
      day from Days 3 to 9. The AFQ056 treatment group will be up titrated to 200 mg according to
      the following dosing schedule: Day 3: 50 mg twice daily; Day 4: 100 mg twice daily and Days
      5-9: 200 mg twice daily. On Day 10, participants will be administered only the morning dose
      of AFQ056 200 mg or placebo. AFQ056 doses must be taken within 30 minutes of meals. On Day 9
      and Day 10, approximately 4 hours after the morning dose of AFQ056 200 mg or placebo,
      participants will receive treatment infusions determined by the randomized sequence of saline
      and 20 mg of cocaine on Day 9 (Infusion Session 4) and saline and 40 mg of cocaine on Day 10
      (Infusion Session 5). The participants will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 12,
      two days after the last infusion of cocaine (Infusion Session 5) and will have a Follow-up
      visit between 7 and 14 days after clinic discharge. A safety follow-up call will be conducted
      30 days following the last administration of study treatment on Day 40.
