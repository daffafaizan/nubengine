      the MH closure in the swept source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images was compared
      with the surgery by the surgeon's decision. All eyes were treated by pars plana vitrectomy,
      internal limiting membrane peeling, and gas tamponade. MH closure was defined as a connection
      of the edges of the sensory retina in the SS-OCT images.The macular hole closure and visual
      outcome were compared.
