      sarcopenia and osteopenia. It is, therefore, postulated that many physiologic changes of
      aging are secondary to the decline in DHEA. Thus, the objective of the proposed research is
      to evaluate the effect of DHEA replacement on age-related changes in body composition, muscle
      function and metabolism, and bone mass in healthy older adults. The specific aims are to
      evaluate the effects of DHEA replacement (50 mg/d) alone, or in combination with resistance
      exercise training on: a) lean body mass, intraabdominal fat and thigh muscle volume, and
      muscle protein synthesis rate b) bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body, lumbar spine,
      and hip and biochemical markers of bone turnover and c) insulin sensitivity. It is
      hypothesized that DHEA administration will have additive or synergistic effects with
      exercise. Healthy but sedentary subjects , aged 65-78 years old, will be randomized to
      receive either DHEA, 50 mg/d, or placebo and to participate in either supervised or home
      exercise training programs. The supervised exercise program will consist of resistance
      training designed to increase muscle mass, strength, and bone mass, and decrease fat mass.
      The goal of this research is to provide information on the potential role of DHEA replacement
      therapy in maintaining the physical health and functional capacity of older people
