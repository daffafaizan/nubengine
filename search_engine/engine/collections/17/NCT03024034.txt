    
      This study is designed to assess oral TP-271, and the objectives of the study are to examine
      the safety, tolerability, and PK of oral TP-271 in healthy adult subjects after
      administration of a single dose. A single-dose, dose-escalating study design is common for
      early clinical studies. A cohort size of 8 subjects (6 receiving oral TP-271 and 2 receiving
      placebo) for the single ascending dose cohorts (Cohorts A through F) will allow sufficient
      data assessments of plasma and urine concentrations, plasma PK parameters, and safety without
      exposing large numbers of subjects to oral TP-271 in this clinical study. One additional
      cohort of 8 subjects will first receive treatment with TP-271 or TP-271 co-administered with
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then cross-over to treatment with the other study
      agent, which will allow a comparison of the bioavailability of TP-271 alone compared to
      TP-271 co-administered with EDTA, as well as allow additional assessment of plasma and urine
      concentrations, plasma PK parameters, and safety.
