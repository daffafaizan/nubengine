      vaporization rather than combustion, the generation and inhalation of HPHCs, smoke, and
      carbon monoxide (CO) may be reduced or avoided. This study will provide an understanding of
      the in vitro levels of nicotine obtained with use of the company's ENDS products compared to
      competitor products marketed in the United States of America (USA), and to a popular brand of
      combustible cigarette smoked in the USA.
