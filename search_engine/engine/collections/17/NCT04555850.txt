    
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability pharmacokinetics and potential immune responses of multiple NL005
      intravenous administration.

      Three groups of 30 subjects will receive an NL005 or placebo dose of 0.5μg/kg 2.0 μg/kg and
      5.0 μg/kg for 10 consecutive days at a ratio of 4:1.

      While observing the safety of the subjects in each dose group, about 5mL of venous blood was
      collected for the ADA study in healthy subjects 14 days and 28 days after the first
      administration of the drug.
