      the endometrium has a specific period of uterine receptivity, which occurs 5-7 days after
      ovulation and remains receptive for ~4 days (cycle days 20-24), when embryo implantation
      starts. Implantation failure refers to the failure of the embryo to reach a stage when
      intrauterine gestational sac is recognized by ultrasonography. It occurs when the embryo is
      abnormal or when endometrial function is impaired.

      Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells have been implicated to play a role in female reproductive
      performance. They comprise 70-80% of the total leukocyte population in the endometrium during
      implantation and early pregnancy. Several studies showed an increased uNK cell density in the
      endometrium of women with reproductive failure. To better understand the contribution of
      various immune factors to endometrial function and future pregnancy, it is proposed to
      examine the major immune cells in the same specimen to measure the relative magnitude of the
      cell density changes and the degree of clustering between two immune cell types.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the endometrial leucocytes profile around the time of
      embryo implantation.
