      will be 90 stable COPD patients with poor nutritional status selected by the community or
      primary hospitals. On the principle of having no statistical difference in indicators such as
      baseline age, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease（GOLD） staging, and
      medication oxygen consumption among the groups , the trial will randomly be divided into
      three groups: health education group, health education + upper and lower extremity exercise
      group, health education + upper and lower extremity exercise + oral nutritional supplements
      group.

      A 12-week pulmonary rehabilitation clinical study will be conducted to observe the difference
      of outcome indicators among the three groups like nutritional status (24hr diet, body weight,
      body composition, albumin), pulmonary function (classification and staging), muscle strength
      and muscular endurance (grip strength, 6-minute walking distance(6MWD)), inflammation factors
      and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score. Moreover outcome indicators after 24
      weeks like patient weight, SGRQ score and GOLD staging also will be recorded for comparison.

      The project will evidence-based provide effective means like nutrition and exercise for
      Chinese malnourished COPD patients who are at stable stage. And popular science books on
      pulmonary rehabilitation based on this trial will be compiled to record the best pulmonary
      rehabilitation guidance strategies.
