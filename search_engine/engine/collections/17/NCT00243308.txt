      randomized in a 3:1 ratio of Serp-1 injection to placebo control.Subjects will receive Serp-1
      by intravenous (IV) bolus injection daily for 3 days, at dose levels of 5.0, 15, and 50
      ug/kg/dose or placebo (0.9% normal saline) added to any prescribed therapy for ACS. Serp-1
      will be administered as a single IV bolus injection. The initial IV bolus dose is
      administered immediately preceding the PCI procedure with subsequent doses administered 24
      and 48 hours later.Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events, serum inflammatory markers
      and restenosis rates at 6 months post-dose.
