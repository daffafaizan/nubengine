      treated with any recombinant human proteins and suggested to be more common especially when
      the native protein is deficient or absent as many male patients with Fabry disease.

      The immune response that results in the development of antibodies against the infused
      proteins may affect the clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy by the development of
      hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid, or febrile reactions, or may lead to the development of
      cytokine release and a generalized inflammatory response or immune complex formation.
      Furthermore, the mounted immune response may lead to inactivation or degradation of the
      recombinant enzyme or may change the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the
      therapeutic protein.

      The different rates of antibody formation with agalsidase alfa and agalsidases beta are often
      attributed to differences in techniques used to measure antibody formation. However, other
      factors such as host, structural similarity of the infused protein and tertiary structural
      difference such as glycosylation may lead to differences in the immune response. Among the
      factors that may affect host response are also the dose and the infusion frequency. Although
      agalsidase alfa and beta are derived from the same complementary DNA sequence there are minor
      differences in glycosylation patterns, and different dosing is used, 0.2 mg per kg every
      other week for agalsidase alfa, 1.0 mg per kg for agalsidase beta.

      The investigator hypothesize that although the observation that the antibodies exhibit in
      vitro neutralizing capacity may suggest the presence of a single immunogenic epitope for both
      human recombinant alpha-galactosidases, the immunogenicity may not be similar for both
      agalsidase alfa and beta, and thus the differences in immune response will be determined by
      the host factors and the escalating dose of infused protein.
