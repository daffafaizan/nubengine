      reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with healthy counterparts.
      The mechanisms underlying the exercise deficit in T2DM remain largely unknown, but previous
      work has suggested that reduced exercise blood flow and impaired submaximal VO2 may be
      contributing factors. Both of these findings are consistent with a peripheral impairment of
      skeletal muscle oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, or both. Indeed, dysfunction of skeletal
      muscle metabolism plays a key role in the pathophysiology of T2DM, and considerable work has
      described abnormalities of oxidative function in the skeletal muscle of people with T2DM.
      Given this, it is likely that the causes of exercise intolerance in T2DM may relate to
      specific defects at the level of the skeletal muscle, particularly given that skeletal muscle
      blood flow and oxidative capacity are impaired in diabetes. However, to the knowledge of the
      investigators, no one has related these peripheral muscle abnormalities to the diminished
      exercise function in this patient group.

      The overarching hypothesis for the proposed research is that impaired CVEC in T2DM is the
      result of preclinical cardiac, vascular dysfunction and skeletal muscle perfusion
      abnormalities. Exercise training will improve CVEC and will reveal specific reversible
      therapeutic aspects of this pathology. The investigators will first determine the impairments
      and then evaluate responses to an established cardiac rehabilitation exercise training
      program, established to improve fitness in people with and without diabetes. Given the
      greater CVEC abnormalities observed in women, sex differences will be evaluated for each aim.
