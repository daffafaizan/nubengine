    
      This is a pilot phase 2, single arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy combined with recombinant human endostatin (Endostar) in early stage
      cervical cancer patients with high risk factor(s).

      Postoperative pelvic radiotherapy starts 2-3 weeks after surgery. Intensity modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) is given five fractions per week at 1.8-2 Gy/fraction/day with total
      prescription dose of 45-50Gy to PTV region. The external beam radiotherapy should be
      completed within 6 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy consists of cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1-3)
      and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1000mg/m2/day, civ, day 1-4) for 2 cycles every 3 weeks.
      Recombinant human endostatin (Endostar,15mg/m2/d, civ, d1-7) is applied 3 days before the
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy for 2 cycles every 3 weeks.

      Aimed to recruit total of 120 cases in this single arm study. The primary endpoint is 3-year
      disease-free survival and acute toxicity. Secondary endpoints include time to distant
      metastasis survival, local-regional recurrence free survival, 3 and 5-year overall survival,
      and safety and tolerability. Quality of life will be evaluated with EORTC-Q30.
