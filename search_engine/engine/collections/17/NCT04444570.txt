      potentially devastating for patients health. One of the most known risk factors of such state
      is glucose metabolism disorders. Such pathologies, containing diabetes mellitus, are
      considered one of the most epidemic health-related problems in XXI century.

      Diabetes is a civilization disease, caused mainly by obesity, unhealthy eating habits and
      lack of physical activity. It was concerning about 108 million people in 1980, while in next
      40 years this number grew 4-times and is expecting to reach almost 600 million people in
      2035.

      Total joint arthroplasty is considered the most effective way of treating the end-stage
      osteoarthritis of hip and knee joints. It is estimated that every year more that one million
      total joint replacements are performed in Europe. It is believed that our community is
      getting older and that is the reason why the number of total joint replacements will be
      growing, as well as patients expectations towards it. Even though total knee and hip
      replacement have wonderful outcome and are improving significantly patients life and its
      quality, there are several potential side effect that might lower patients limb function.

      There were several studies confirming increased risk of surgical site or implants infections
      in patients undergoing total joint replacements such as knee or hip, who had perioperative
      poor glycemic control or had treated diabetes mellitus. However, there is lack of literature
      concerning analysis of continuous glycemia measurements before and after hospital stay. There
      are some promises that glycemic disturbances during postoperative period might also increase
      risk of cardiovascular events in this time and more frequent periods of hypoglycemia, which
      might result in higher risk of unconsciousness and falls. What is more higher cardiovascular
      risk is corelated with higher risk of disability and death.

      Results of this research will allow to investigate influence of orthopedic surgery on
      glycemia and possible modifications of hyperglycemia treatment in perioperative period in
      patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance. What is more it will allow to investigate
      changes of glycemia in patients with normal glycemia metabolism, potentially protecting them
      from hypoglycemia during hospital stay and increasing their awareness of potentially
      suffering diabetes mellitus in the future. Additionally, this study will allow to corelate
      perioperative glycemia levels with risk of cardiovascular events in one year follow-up, and
      its influence on surgical site and implants complications. Thanks to these findings surgeons
      will be able to lower the risk of such complications in the future, hence lowering mortality
      and quality of life, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus and from the group with
      high risk of developing this disorder.

      Nowadays, with technological development concerning our every day life, also devices used in
      medicine are getting more and more sophisticated and are making patients lifes easier. One of
      the most prominent examples of such device are the "discs" implanted into the subcutaneous
      tissue which might measure patients glycemia level. Thanks to it patients no longer need to
      measure it with traditional glucometers, which action relayed on blood samples collected from
      the tip of the finger. It was associated with every day unpleasant needling. Nowadays modern
      solution allow patients to get the result from their devices on their smartphones by only
      sliding it above the place of the implanted device.

      Taking into considerations, such a wide spread of diabetes mellitus in our population it is
      obvious, that among patients qualified for total hip or knee arthroplasty many of them will
      have this disease. Adding to it common risk factors of diabetes and osteoarthritis, such as
      obesity, it seems that number of patients with such diseases is much bigger than it seems.
      According to the literature mentioned above it is obvious that microangiopathic changes, as
      well as hyperglycemia, have negative influence on wound healing, surgery itself and might
      increase the risk of periprosthetic infections. It is worthy to look for ways to optimize
      patients care in perioperative period.

      Additional good side of this study is a fact, that it contains patients without recognized
      diabetes mellitus to assess their glycemia fluctuations, without carbohydrate metabolism
      disorders. Such knowledge might improve and allow to develop the algorithm of perioperative
      care for the high number of patients, who in such demanding for their body period are exposed
      to significant glycemia fluctuations.

      What is more, it must be admitted that this study has unique model (described below), in
      which glycemia monitoring will contain both pre- and postoperative period of every included
      patient. Such way of analyzing patients allows to produce "perfect control group", because
      every measurements after the surgery has its counterpart before the surgery.

      The aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate the level of glycemia and its
      variability in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgeries during one month (two weeks
      before the surgery and two weeks postoperatively) and its influence on the number of
      cardiovascular and orthopedic complications. What is more the investigators want to evaluate
      its influence on objective functional outcome of the surgery in one year follow-up. It seems
      that long bone surgery as a stress factor might increase the risk of developing diabetes or
      glucose intolerance, what might increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and number of
      complications.

      To this prospective observational study, patients qualified for elective total knee or hip
      replacement in the Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation in Miedzyleski Specialist
      Hospital in Warsaw will be recruited. 100 patients will be included.

      There were several studies confirming increased risk of surgical site or implants infections
      in patients undergoing total joint replacements such as knee or hip, who had perioperative
      poor glycemic control or had treated diabetes mellitus. However, there is lack of literature
      concerning analysis of continuous glycemia measurements before and after hospital stay. There
      are some premises that glycemic disturbances during postoperative period might also increase
      risk of cardiovascular events in this time and more frequent periods of hypoglycemia, which
      might result in higher risk of unconsciousness and falls. What is more higher cardiovascular
      risk is corelated with higher risk of disability and death.

      Results of this research will allow to investigate influence of orthopedic surgery on
      glycemia and possible modifications of hyperglycemia treatment in perioperative period in
      patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance. What is more it will allow to investigate
