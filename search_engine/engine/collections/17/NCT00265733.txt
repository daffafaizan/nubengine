        -  Assess the tumor response rate and adverse event profile in patients with metastatic,
           HER2 negative breast cancer treated with paclitaxel poliglumex (CT-2103; Xyotax™) and
           capecitabine.

        -  Examine the distributions of disease-free progression times and survival times in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel poliglumex IV (CT-2103; Xyotax™) over 10-20 minutes on day 1 and
      oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
