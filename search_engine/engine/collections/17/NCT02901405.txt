      rates of wound breakdown in patients with resection of soft tissue sarcomas which are
      primarily closed.

      Patients will be randomised into either NPWT or standard absorbent dressings with primary
      outcome measure of surgical site infection according to the Health Protection Agency
      guidance. Secondary outcomes are; time to wound dryness, delayed discharge from hospital,
      adverse events, cost estimation
