      membrane oxygenation (ECMO), inhaled nitric oxide therapy, and ventilator strategies that
      minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, morbidity and mortality rates for babies with severe
      CDH remain high. Data from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between January 2006
      and December 2010 for prenatal and postnatal care for 64 patients with isolated left CDH
      showed overall survival was 63%. Survival was 33% in patients requiring the use ECMO.
      Immediate morbidity/mortality is related to the severity of the pulmonary hypoplasia caused
      by the mass effect of the herniated abdominal contents on the developing lungs. Quantifying
      the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia has been performed using the observed/expected lung to
      head circumference ratio (O/E LHR). It is a tool validated in 354 fetuses with unilateral
      isolated CDH evaluated between 18 and 38 weeks gestation. For O/E LHR < 25%, survival was
      dismal at 1/9 or 11% (CHOP experience, not published). Published data from an
      interdisciplinary follow-up program at CHOP shows striking morbidities in neuromuscular tone
      and neurodevelopmental status.

      The rationale for fetal therapy in severe CDH is to improve fetal lung growth and therefore
      neonatal survival. Prenatal tracheal occlusion obstructs the normal egress of lung fluid
      during pulmonary development leading to increased lung tissue stretch, increased cell
      proliferation, and accelerated lung growth. European colleagues have developed foregut
      endoscopy and techniques to position and remove endoluminal tracheal balloons in utero.
      Recently, the Belgium group published summary results of FETO showing an improved survival in
      175 patients with isolated left CDH from 24% to 49%.

      The investigators goal with this pilot study is to study the feasibility of implementing FETO
      therapy in the most severe group of fetuses with left CDH (O/E< 25%; O/E < 30%) and right CDH
      (O/E < 45%).
