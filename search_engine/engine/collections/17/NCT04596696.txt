           dose of vaccine to obtain information on adverse events. ("Reactogenicity")

        -  Childhood vaccines including pentavalent (Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hib, Hepatitis
           B) and oral polio vaccine as well as injectable polio vaccine will be administered along

        -  Safety assessments will include observation in the study clinic for 30 minutes after
           each vaccine administration to record immediate adverse events. A subject diary card and
           personal contact with the subjects will be made to record adverse events during the
