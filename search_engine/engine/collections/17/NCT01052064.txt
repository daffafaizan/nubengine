      ADHD have good clinical response to amphetamines alone or in association with antiepileptic
      drugs. It is described that some patients(10-30%) with ADHD do not respond to conventional
      pharmacological and psycho- pedagogical treatment; in those patients non invasive brain
      stimulation methods could be a supplementary option for symptomatic control. There are not
      many published papers describing the effects of rTMS in persons younger than 18 years; so the
      first step to extent its use in pediatric population should be to obtain evidences about its
      tolerance and safety.
