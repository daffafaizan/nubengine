    
      Stage 1 will consist of an initial cohort (Cohort 1) up to 6 evaluable participants who will
      receive a dosing regimen of Oraxol consisting of a 15-mg oral HM30181AK-US tablet plus an
      oral paclitaxel dose of 205 mg/m2, both administered once daily for 3 consecutive days. The
      stages and cohorts are further described in the "Study Design - Stages and Cohorts" table
      below. An interim analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Cohort 1 will be conducted to
      determine if the administered regimen would appear likely to achieve BE (AUC0-∞), if tested
      in a greater number of participants in Stage 2. If it appears unlikely that the selected
      regimen will meet the criteria for BE based on AUC0-∞ data, a second cohort (Cohort 2) of up
      to 6 evaluable participants may be enrolled in Stage 1, and the dose of paclitaxel in Oraxol
      may be adjusted by a maximum of +/- 25%. If Cohort 2 is enrolled, a second interim analysis
      will be conducted.

      After the interim analysis/analyses (depending on the outcomes), a decision will be made by
      consensus of the DSMB, Kinex, Zenith Technology, and the Principal Investigator as to what
      dose should be administered in Stage 2. The DSMB will consist of a clinical oncologist, an
      ethicist, an independent statistician, and additional members, as deemed necessary. A DSMB
      charter will describe the planned evaluations and decision points used to determine the dose
      for Stage 2. An additional 18 to 42 evaluable participants will be enrolled into Stage 2
      based on the Stage 1 results (AUC0-∞). Thus a total of up to 54 evaluable participants could
      potentially be enrolled in this study (6 each from Stage 1, Cohorts 1 and 2, and up to 42
      participants in Stage 2).
