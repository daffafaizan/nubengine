      Atherosclerosis is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease. Statins are known to
      exert a powerful anti-atherogenic action which is reflected in a marked beneficial effect on
      the prevention of cardiovascular effects and cardiovascular mortality. They induce a
      reduction in the progression and an increase in the regression of atherosclerotic lesions.
      Statins exert powerful effect on lowering LDLc and are also anti-inflammatory due to their
      ability to lower CRP concentrations. But little is known about their anti-inflammatory
      effects at a cellular and molecular levels in humans, in vivo.

      Vytorin, a preparation containing simvastatin and ezetimibe, has a powerful effect on
      lowering LDLc concentration through a combination of effects on the absorption of cholesterol
      from the gut and hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. In our previous study we have shown that
      Vytorin exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect in the obese in the fasting state and
      following acute inflammatory changes induced by the intake of cream. The IMPROVE-IT trial,
      which examined the benefits of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin, showed a small additional
      benefit of ezetimibe (a 6% reduction in cardiovascular events) compared to simvastatin alone.
      This is marginal when compared to the established cardiovascular benefits of statins.

      We, therefore, explore further into the anti-inflammatory actions of the two components of
      Vytorin by comparing the effects of simvastatin versus ezetimibe on intracellular lipid and
      inflammation in obese patients to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin is
      responsible for the specific combination of these effects.
