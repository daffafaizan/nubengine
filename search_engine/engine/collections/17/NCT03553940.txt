    
      This is a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 50 healthy
      adolescents and children, 9-17 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity
      of a prime-boost regimen of H3N2 M2SR intranasal influenza vaccine (manufactured by FluGen)
      followed by licensed inactivated Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) boost administered
      intramuscularly. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Arm 1 will
      receive one dose of M2SR intranasally on Day 1 and one dose of QIV on Day 92. Arm 2 will
      receive one dose of placebo (saline) intranasally on Day 1, and one dose of QIV on Day 92.
      Study duration will be approximately 28 months with patient participation duration
      approximately 13 months. The primary study objective is to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of a monovalent live attenuated influenza H3N2 M2SR vaccine. The secondary
      study objectives are to identify circulating and mucosal antibody responses induced by H3N2
      M2SR vaccination and to identify cellular immune responses induced by H3N2 M2SR vaccination.
