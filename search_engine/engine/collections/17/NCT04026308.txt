    
      This project has 3 aims: (1) Will ED patients with suicidal ideation/attempt accept coaching
      on safety planning from non-clinical personnel (i.e., medical students or peer supporters);
      (2) Are these safety plans of high-enough quality for clinical personnel; and finally, (3)
      Will ED patients with suicidal ideation/attempt complete safety plans electronically?
