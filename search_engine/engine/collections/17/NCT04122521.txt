      molecular and expression patterns. Advanced imaging provides additional clues but no studies
      have examined its added value particularly in a prospective setting. The investigator's aim
      to evaluate preoperative MRI for patients suspected of glioma to predict IDH mutation, 1p19q
      codeletion, MGMT methylation and EGFR mutation status using imaging characteristics such as
      margin, patterns of contrast enhancement and edema as well as diffusion and perfusion
      characteristics. This will be confirmed pathologically and further correlated with patients'
      long term outcome.
