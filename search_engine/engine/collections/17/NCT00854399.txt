      All of the patients received four to six courses of adjuvant platinum-containing
      chemotherapy. Histologic grading was according to International Union against Cancer criteria
      (28). The stage of disease was classified according to the International Federation of
      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO, 1987). Pelvic and paraaortic lymph node samplings will be
      performed, if the disease will be confined to within the ovary or will be without a ruptured
      capsule. The histopathologic data, including histologic type and histologic grade, will be
      evaluated by a certified pathologist. The maximal diameter of the residual tumor after
      surgery will be also recorded. All patients will be followed up at 3-month intervals.
