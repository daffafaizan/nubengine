      (POCD) is not different in patients received intravenous anesthetics propofol or sevoflurane
      for their cardiac valvular surgery. Two groups of general anesthetics (propofol or
      sevoflurane) are used to explore the possible difference of the postoperative outcome and the
      incidence of POCD. After cardiac valvular surgery with CPB, patients' POCD tests at 7 days
      after the surgery, and postoperative delirium, etc., are evaluated by different
      questionnaires. Also the blood sample of these patients are collected for detection of some
      stress hormones.
