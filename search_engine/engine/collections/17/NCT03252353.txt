    
      This is a double blind, randomized study that assesses the efficacy and safety of octreotide
      capsules vs. placebo. Eligible acromegaly patients, treated with injectable somatostatin
      analogs, who are biochemically controlled and have prior evidence of active disease, will be
      randomized to receive either octreotide capsules or placebo for up to 36 weeks. At the end of
      this double blind, placebo controlled period, eligible patients will receive octreotide
      capsules in an open-labeled extension for at least one year. Patients failing to respond (per
      protocol), to oral treatment, (either placebo or octreotide capsules), will be rescued with
      the standard of care and upon meeting the eligibility criteria could also enroll into the
      long term extension with octreotide capsules.

      This study received agreement from the FDA, under a special protocol assessment.
