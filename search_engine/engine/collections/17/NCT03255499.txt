      training) against either one of the components (exercise alone, or cognitive training alone)
      and against an active control group. The study will include measures of scholastic aptitude,
      as well as of working memory and cognitive control (primary outcome measures), two cognitive
      abilities that are critical to daily life activities, and that respond well to training. In
      addition, the investigators will measure physiological responses to training, to monitor
      changes associated with exercise (secondary outcome measures). Finally, the investigators
      will relate training-specific improvements with transfer gains, to better model the
      interaction between training and transfer. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of
      the dynamics associated with the intervention.
