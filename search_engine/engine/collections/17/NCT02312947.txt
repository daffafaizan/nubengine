      and behavioral impacts. The hypertrophied adenoid tissue obstructs the air way in the
      nasopharynx that initiates the common symptoms. The treatment from that concerning problems
      is in the operation rooms by diversity surgical methods, the very older one is the cold
      dissection adenoidectomy.

      Recently many surgeons use the coblation system as a preferred method for adenoidectomy. This
      method was proof as a safe and efficient especially referring to the bleeding and the
      dehydration risk .

      Many children that operated by the cold dissection forced to perform another one or two
      operations presumably due to the adenoid tissue that did not removed completely from the
      first operation .

      our hypothesis is that the coblation systemis a safe and eficient method for adenoidectomy.

      The aims of this project is to verify if our theory is corect by blinded comparision between
      two methods.
