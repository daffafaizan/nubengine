      following cataract surgery. Several drugs, both topical and systemic, have been tested for
      their ability to blunt the acute IOP spike, nevertheless none has proven to be superior and
      consistently effective. Oral acetazolamide has demonstrated to help controlling IOP spikes
      following cataract surgery in glaucomatous eyes. However there are still constraints in its
      widespread use, as it may be contraindicated in patients with poor renal function, sickle
      cell disease and sulpha drug allergy.

      As a result, many units including Moorfields Eye Hospital have used a technique called known
      as 'burping of the corneal wound' to release fluid from inside the anterior chamber of the
      eye. This makes logical sense as it reduces the pressure immediately and may remove some of
      the causes for raised IOP such as retained viscoelastic and inflammatory molecules from
      inside the eye. This technique has also been used to reduce IOP in patients already receiving
      pharmaceutical treatment.

      The technique has been used for decades, however, there is no published evidence of a
      proposed technique, range of IOP decrease or frequency of complications. Thus, most surgeons
      in most units are cautious of 'burping the wound' as it may induce infection or other
      complications compromising the surgical outcome due to the sudden reduced IOP reduction.
      Nevertheless a similar approach, needle penetrating the eye to release aqueous and reduce
      IOP, is becoming more popular as the first approach to treat an acute angle closure crisis,
      where the presenting IOP is often very high, i.e. a much more difficult and dangerous
      situation than post cataract surgery.
