      the 2 periods; once under fasting conditions and once after a high fat meal. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive apremilast either fasted first, then fed, or fed first
      then fasted. Participants will check into the study center on Day -1 of each period, will be
      dosed on Day 1, and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled
      pharmacokinetic blood draws and safety evaluations. After a washout of 5 to 10 days,
      participants will return for period 2 during which they will receive apremilast according to
      their assigned sequence.
