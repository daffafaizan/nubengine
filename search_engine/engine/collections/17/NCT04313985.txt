      be lead to healing. Perfusion studies and bacterial measurements will be assessed before and
      after treatment on this cross-over study.

      Avazzia microcurrent stimulation was applied to patients with chronic, non-healing wounds in
      Malaysia and was presented at the international wound conference. In 2015 a poster
      presentation was presented with a 10-patient case series, and in August 2016, a presentation
      was made by Dr. Nair, keynote speaker about his 100- patient case series showing that the
      treatment was safe and effective. Dr. Nair followed this study with a 5-patient study looking
      at perfusion images using SPY- LUNA imaging equipment. The 5-patient study looked at
      different methods of applying the therapy.
