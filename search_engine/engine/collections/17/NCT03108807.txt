      necessary. If there was a fast and reliable system that could be used to determine the risk
      of all medical patients, many low-risk patients could be safely returned to primary care or
      outpatient follow-up clinics.

      The investigators wish to determine, if the combination of the National Early Warning Score
      and plasma D-dimer levels can be used to identify patients at low risk of mortality within 30
      days in an unselected group of medical patients presenting to a Danish Emergency Department.

      This is a prospective observational study that will be performed on adult medical patients
      referred to the Emergency Department of a Danish hospital to be assessed for possible
      admission. The study will be performed in the Emergency Department of Hospital of South West
      Jutland in the region of Southern Denmark.
