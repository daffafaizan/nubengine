      system that interacts with one another harmoniously. With the well-established
      academic-community partnership between HKU and Caritas-Hong Kong, our pilot trial aims to
      build upon the previous experiences by Caritas-Hong Kong and investigate the feasibility and
      effectiveness of a BMS approach in enhancing positive emotions and well-being among community
      participants. This trial is an innovative attempt at conducting an ICT-supported online
      intervention with community participants. It would also help meet the urgent need for brief,
      community-based preventive mental health promotion, especially in the context of the COVID-19
      pandemic.
