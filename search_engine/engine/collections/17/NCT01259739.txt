    
      13 participants (highly-trained cyclist, accustomed to exercise testing on ergometers will be
      enrolled (VO2max>50 ml/kg, FMD >5%, non-smokers, no medication, no diseases, age 20-36,
      male).

      Baseline Testing:

      Participants will perform a baseline testing consisting of an ergometric test with a
      step-wise increase of workload until exhaustion to determine lactate anaerobic threshold and
      cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity. Vascular function is monitored by Doppler Ultrasound.

      In a second test, participants will perform a time trial (goal: as fast as possible)

      Flavanol intervention Participants will twice daily receive either a flavanol-poor cocoa
      drink (13mg/dl)or a flavanol-rich cocoa drink (596mg/dl) over a period of 7 days. Order is
      randomized and balanced. Subjects will crossover to the second arm after a washout period of
      7 days.

      Testing performed on baseline day is repeated after the intake of both drinks

      In a subgroup of n=6 participants, we will test whether the blood pressure cuff maneuver used
      for FMD will itself modify nitrite levels. For this the manuever will be completed 4 times
      and compared to n=6 untreated controls. in another subgroup 6 participants will receive
      4times the maneuver but reperfusion will be limited by means of an ultrasound probe.
