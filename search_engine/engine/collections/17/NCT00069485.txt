      exposures. These individuals, referred to as exposed seronegatives (ES), represent a unique
      population in which to evaluate mechanisms by which HIV-1 replication is either controlled or
      aborted. The purpose of the study is to analyze HIV-specific immune responses, both cellular
      and humoral, that exist in seronegative individuals who have experienced multiple exposures
      to HIV by sexual contact.

      This study will follow participants for 2 years. Participants will have 25 study visits
      during the study. Assessments will include HIV tests, viral load measurements, CD4 counts,
      pregnancy tests, and physical exams.
