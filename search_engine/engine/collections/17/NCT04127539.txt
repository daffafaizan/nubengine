      shown to be effective in preventing falls. Strong and steady has been adapted to more
      functionally fit older people.

      The study period will be one year. Due to the corona pandemic all S&S groups in Norway have
      been closed. Due to this all participants have had a break from their exercise program for
      more than 6 months and can be seen av new participants to the exercise groups. Participants
      that are about to start in a S&S group in municipalities in Tr√∏ndelag will be asked to
      participate in this study. They will go through tests of muscle strength and balance in
      addition to questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of exercise. Where possible
      the participants will go through the same tests 1 month before they start to exercise in
      addition to the three other test timepoints.
