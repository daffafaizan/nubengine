      that single-agent ifosfamide administrated by various schedules produces response rates of
      15-29%, with media survival times of 5-7 months. Ifosfamide has also been used in various
      combination regimens to treat NSCLC, including platinum based and non-platinum regimens. But
      in refractory NSCLC patients platinum and some third generation cytotoxic drugs have been
      used before. So in this study, ifosfamide is combined with vinorelbine. In previous study,
      Masters reported the objective response rate was 40% and the median survival duration was 50
      weeks, with a 1-year survival rate of 48% with vinorelbine-ifosfamide regimen [Vinorelbine 15
      mg/m2 on days 1-3, and ifosfamide 2.0g/m2 on days 1-3 with granulocyte-colony stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) support]. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of this regimen is
      myelosuppression. In our experience, the regimen of vinorelbine 25mg/m2 d1, d8 and ifosfamide
      1.25g/m2 d1-d3 with Mesna uroprotection is safe in Chinese population and the objective
      response rate is about 7% (data not published).

      Gefitinib is the first small molecule inhibitor that has directed activity towards EGFR and
      has shown appreciable response rates in phase Ⅱ trials of patients with previously treated
      advanced NSCLC. In the posterior analysis of Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer
      (IDEAL) and IRESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer (ISEL) trials, the response rate with
      gefitinib ranges from 2.6% to 10% in wild-type EGFR gene NSCLC patients.
