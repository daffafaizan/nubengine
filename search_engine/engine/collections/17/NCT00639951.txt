      countries. The WHO estimates 40 000 annual deaths in the world for this cause. In MÃ©xico the
      Ministry of Health estimated 3 882 cases on 2005, being the age of 15-44 the most affected.
      There are not official numbers of mortality, although the thought is that there are few cases
      of death, most of them related with a delay on treatment.

      There are a broad variety of clinical presentations depending on many factors such as
      species, snake bite variability or patient conditions. Proteolytic action of venom produces
      amines and vasoactive peptides such as bradykinin, histamine and serotonin which cause
      capillary lesions with anticoagulant effects. Coagulopathy is one of the most important
      systemic consequences. The Dry Tube Test has been proposed as an indirect test to evaluate
      coagulopathy related to this pathology.
