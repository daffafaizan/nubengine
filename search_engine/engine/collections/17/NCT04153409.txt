      product (LAT8881 60 mg or placebo), to be taken at the onset (within one hour from the onset
      of pain) of a migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity [Numeric rating scale greater

      the clinic for re-evaluation and crossover to the second treatment. After treatment of one
      migraine headache in the second treatment period or a maximum of 28 days from commencement of
      the second treatment period, the subject will return to the clinic for re-evaluation. An End
