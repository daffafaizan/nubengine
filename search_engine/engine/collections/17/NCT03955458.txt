      fracture is a FICB with continuous infusion of ropivacaine given via catheter.

      In this study, some people will receive a single injection FICB with EXPAREL + bupivacaine
      HCl. The groups will be evaluated to determine the amount of pain medication they took from
      the FICB to 72 hours after.
