      children who will be turning 6 in the next two years. First, the investigators will follow up
      with the children's development by conducting a battery of non-invasive neurodevelopmental
      tests. Also, the parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire called the Child Behavior
      Checklist, which assesses behavioral problems. Then, each child's parent will be asked to
      send the research team 2-3 teeth that their child has shed, or to send teeth as they are shed
      over the next three years. Dr. Stroustrup's collaborator, Dr. Manish Arora, will perform a
      temporal analysis of chemical distribution for each tooth to determine each child's
      environmental exposures during the perinatal and neonatal periods.
