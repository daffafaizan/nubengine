      cancers, but is also employed in the management of symptomatic goitres. Occasionally, it is
      mandated in patients with thyrotoxicosis refractory to medical therapy. While thyroid surgery
      can be performed with low risks such that patients rarely have to stay beyond three days in
      hospital, the track record of thyroid surgery is somewhat blemished by the unfortunate side
      effects associated with the neck scarring after thyroid surgery. Not uncommonly, patients
      experience discomfort in the neck region after thyroid surgery; in the extreme of cases,
      patients may even complain of a lifelong pulling sensation in the neck area during eating.

      The anti-adhesive properties of Seprafilm are well established in animal studies and affirmed
      by clinical observations in abdominal surgeries that utilize this material. Thus, Seprafilm
      is routinely used in instances when a surgeon foresees a need to perform abdominal surgery on
      the same patient in future, or during the fashioning of a temporary stoma. The safety profile
      of Seprafilm in thyroidectomy has also been shown by a recent study conducted by a group of
      clinicians in Seoul.

      We postulate that the application of Seprafilm to the surgical wound towards the end of a
      thyroidectomy significantly reduces internal adhesion formation in the neck region. By
      achieving this objective, we hope to improve patients' satisfaction with thyroid surgery in
      terms of ease of swallowing after surgery.
