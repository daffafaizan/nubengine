      mortality cause for them. Breast cancer incidence increases for elderly women and will become
      a major public health problem in the next years.

      The principal therapeutic solution is the partial mastectomy associated to radiotherapy.
      However, the radiotherapy scheme and its role are debated for elderly patients. Hypo
      fractionated radiotherapy could be considered as an advantageous option.

      The treatment duration (6,5 weeks) and direct and indirect fatigue (around 33 travels) are
      major cons. Thereby, for elderly patients, the selection of patients who will benefit from a
      shorter treatment could be really difficult. It would be interesting to define an objective
      scoring, predicting a bad or good tolerance and observance to the radiotherapy. Nowadays,
      onco geriatric evaluations are used to decide some treatment's decision, but no study
      compared different orientated radiotherapy schemes.

      The present study proposes an onco geriatric evaluation leading to a score according to seven
      tests (Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities Of Daily Living, Mini Mental State
      Examination, mini Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Cumulative Illness
      Rating Scale-Geriatric, and " timed get up and go " tests). The score will then determine an
      adapted radiotherapy scheme.
