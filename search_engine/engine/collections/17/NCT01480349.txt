      mortality and long-term morbidity in premature infants. The two most common temporary
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedures are the ventriculosubgaleal shunt (SGS) and an
      implanted ventricular reservoir (RES) for intermittent CSF removal. These methods are
      physiologically very different and their comparative effectiveness in treating hydrocephalus
      and possibly reducing the need for an eventual permanent CSF shunt is currently not known.
      The goal of this pilot study is to obtain information critical for planning and executing a
      future randomized trial comparing SGS and RES. Specifically, this pilot study will establish
      inclusion criteria, define the primary outcome, and standardize the interventions in
      preparation for initiating a comparative trial between the SGS and RES procedures. In
      addition, the importance of examining the neurodevelopmental outcomes for these patients has
      been recognized within the neurosurgical and neuropsychological settings. Therefore, the
      scope of this study has been extended to include an examination of the neurodevelopmental
      outcomes at 18 to 22 months and at 36 to 42 months in patients who undergo BSID-III testing
      at their clinical centers.
