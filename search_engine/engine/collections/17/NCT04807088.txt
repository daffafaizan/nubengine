    
      Preterm neonates were recruited via random sampling and divided into two groups (intervention
      group and control group). A written informed consent was obtained from the parents or
      guardians.

      Before the intervention, physical examination was performed to ensure the neonates had normal
      vital signs, were healthy and did not present with congenital abnormalities.

      In the intervention group, TKS was performed with specific baby oil for 15 minutes, three
      times a day, for 10 days. After 10 days, TKS was applied once daily by the mother or
      caregiver. TKS implementation at home was supervised by the investigator or nurse through
      phone call. The TKS were documented by the mother or caregiver in the diary card, which
      should be brought during the next visit when the neonate was 11-14 days old. In addition to
      TKS, history of illness and nutrition which was confirmed through history taking during
      hospital or home visit, was also recorded. The participants who did not go the hospital were
      home visited by the investigator or nurse.

      Anthropometric measurement by investigator and trained nurses and Dubowitz examination was
      performed by investigator in a warm and quiet place in the neonatal unit, mother-baby unit,
      outpatient clinic or participants' home while the neonate was fully alert.

      At 3 months of age, infant development was assessed by the investigator using the Capute
      scales (Developmental Quotient of Clinical Adaptive Test [DQ CAT], Clinical Linguistic
      Adaptive Milestone Scale [DQ CLAMS]) and the Full Scale Developmental Quotient (FS DQ) score.
      The Clinical Linguistic Adaptive Milestone Scale (CLAMS) score was based on the parent's
      report of language skill attainment. The Clinical Adaptive Test (CAT) score was based on the
      child's performance according to the listed items.
