    
      Adults at low to intermediate risk of acute coronary syndrome who present to the Emergency
      Department with symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia will undergo a blinded cardiac CT
      followed by a standard of care (SOC) strategy. Significant coronary artery disease on CT
      (coronary stenosis >50%) will be compared to an adjudicated diagnosis derived from clinical
      data and other diagnostic tests based on the SOC strategy. Costs for the SOC evaluation will
      be collected and compared to a CT-based evaluation. Patients will be followed for 3 years
      after enrollment to evaluate prognosis.
