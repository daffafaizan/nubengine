      the uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries, and occasionally lymph nodes. This is usually done
      through a minimally invasive (not a large incision) surgery. To accomplish this, the uterus
      needs to be manipulated (moved around) to help the surgeon complete your surgery. This is
      usually done with a device called a uterine manipulator and the majority of surgeons use this
      device in any patient undergoing a minimally invasive hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and
      cervix).

      Even though the majority of surgeons use a manipulator, there are some surgeons who believe
      there is a possibility that cancer cells inside the uterus can be spilled into the abdomen
      through the fallopian tubes. This may cause a higher risk of spreading the cancer and or of
      the cancer coming back.

      Currently, there are very limited research studies directly looking at whether the uterine
      manipulator may cause these cells to appear in the abdomen.

      The purpose of this study is to see if patients undergoing a minimally invasive surgery for
      early stage uterine cancer have cancer cells in the fluid that is obtained at the time of
      their surgery when a uterine manipulator is placed versus patients who do not have a uterine
      manipulator placed.

      A computer program will randomly assign the subjects to one of two groups. One group will
      have minimally invasive surgery with the use of a uterine manipulator and the other group
      will have minimally invasive surgery without the use of a uterine manipulator.

      Researchers will use the information from this study to decide how best to take care of
      patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery for uterine cancer.
