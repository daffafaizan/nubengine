      of a custom-made mouthguard on the degree of satisfaction with a mouthguard among water polo
      players. Twenty-four water polo players will participate in this randomized crossover trial.
      Two different custom-made mouth guards will be made for each participant, a conventional one
      and an occlusal-adjusted mouthguard. Both types of mouthguard will be fabricated using a
      pressure molding device and 4-mm ethyl vinyl acetate foils. The conventional mouth guards
      will be made at 2 mm from the full depth of the labial sulcus, covering the second maxillary
      molar, and with the palatal margin extending 2 mm from the cervical line. To fabricate the
      occlusal adjusted mouthguard a second 2-mm foil of ethyl vinyl acetate will be formed over
      the initial 4-mm layer. The maxillary and mandibular casts mounted to an articulator using an
      inter occlusal record will facilitate the accommodation of the occlusal surface to the
      antagonistic teeth. The participants will be instructed to wear the mouth guards during
      training sessions and competitions. The sequence of use will be randomized to obtain one half
      of the participants beginning the first and the fourth week wearing the conventional
      mouthguard and the second and the third wearing the occlusal-adjusted mouthguard. The other
      half will start wearing the first and the fourth week the mouthguard with occlusal-adjusted
      mouthguard and the second and third week wearing the conventional mouthguard. The
      participants will evaluate on a 10-point scale for discomfort (gag reflex, fits too tight,
      fits too loose), interference with functions (speech, breathing, swallowing, aesthetics, and
      athletic performance), protection, and general satisfaction after each training session or
      match.
