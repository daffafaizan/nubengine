      pre-transplant conditioning regimen. This non-myeloablative therapy uses doses of
      chemotherapy and radiation to weaken (but not destroy) the patients bone marrow and immune
      system, while still allowing their body to accept the donor's stem cells. Alemtuzumab will be
      given 7 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.03 mg/kg IV, 6 days prior to stem cell infusion
      at 0.1 mg/kg IV, and 5 thru 3 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.3 mg/kg IV.
