      I. To determine the objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      of erlotinib in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) patients who have epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of patients with MPeM who have EGFR mutations. II. To
      characterize asbestos exposure history and other clinical parameters of patients with MPeM
      who do or do not have EGFR mutations.

      III. To determine the disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) of MPeM patients
      who have EGFR mutations and are treated with erlotinib.

      IV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations
      and are treated with erlotinib.

      V. To determine the median overall survival (OS) of MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations and
      are treated with erlotinib.

      VI. To evaluate toxicity in MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations and are treated with
      erlotinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the specific EGFR mutations observed in MPeM patients. II. To correlate
      tumor markers (cancer antigen [CA] 125 and soluble mesothelin-related peptide [SMRP]) with
      response rate, PFS, and OS in MPeM patients treated with erlotinib.

      III. To correlate immunohistochemical staining of EGFR, phosphorylated (p)-EGFR, MET
      (Metastasis), E-cadherin, vimentin, and CBL (Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma)with EGFR mutational
      status and, if present, particular EGFR mutation noted.

      IV. To correlate immunohistochemical staining of EGFR, p-EGFR, MET, E-cadherin, vimentin, and
      CBL with response rate, PFS, and OS in MPeM patients treated with erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
