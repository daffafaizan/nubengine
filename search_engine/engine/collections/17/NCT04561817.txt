    
      This is a phase II open label, non-randomized, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with paclitaxel in platinum-resistant recurrent
      epithelial ovarian cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine - the safety and objective response rate
      of treatment with ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with paclitaxel in platinum-resistant
      recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer at week 12 for two cohorts of patients: with PI3K/AKT
      mutations (altered) and without PI3K/AKT mutations (non-altered)

      About 39 patients will participate in the study and the accrual will take place over a course
      of 30 months Patients will be treated until disease progression and followed for 1 year
      thereafter.

      The two drugs are ipatasertib and paclitaxel.

        -  Ipatasertib will be given 400mg PO daily: day 1-21 of 28 day cycle

        -  Paclitaxel will be given 80mg/m2 IV weekly: day 1, 8, 15 of 28 day cycle

      The study hypothesis is that the combination of Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) plus paclitaxel will
      safely induce a tumor response and increase the objective response rate in patients with
      platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, with or without PI3K/AKT mutations.

      This trial will enroll patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
      Given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this
      population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. The
      benefit-risk ratio for ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel is expected to be
      acceptable in this setting.
