      of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10
      and its metabolite(s) administered as single ascending oral doses to healthy volunteers (Part
      A). The effects of food on the PK of CXA-10 will also be investigated (Part B). Part A of the
      study will be a single-center, randomized, double-blind, third party open (sponsor)
      placebo-controlled study. Sequential single ascending doses will be administered in up to 5
      cohorts of subjects. Each cohort of subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of
      CXA-10 or placebo in, a fasted state, as illustrated in the table below. Part B of the study
      will be a single-center, open-label, two-period study conducted in two cohorts of subjects as
      follows. The selected dose and the interval between Period 1 and Period 2 will be determined
      based on emerging PK data from Part A. The selected dose will be an intermediate dose level
      to avoid a food effect interaction that markedly enhances exposure. Subjects who participate
      in Part B of the study will receive two doses of CXA-10.
