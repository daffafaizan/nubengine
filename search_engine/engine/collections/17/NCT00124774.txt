      in whom leg pain is the predominant complaint. Standard treatment for these patients is
      conservative, as an operation is not without risks and is not always effective. Furthermore,
      complaints will usually resolve in due time. However, the pain limits the patients in their
      daily activities, often for a prolonged period.

      In this study, nucleoplasty will be compared with a sham treatment and not with conservative
      treatment, as the discography is thought to have some therapeutic effect.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with at least a 2.5 points decrease on
      a ten-point Jensen VAS score 3 months after treatment.
