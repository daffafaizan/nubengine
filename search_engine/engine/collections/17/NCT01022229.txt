    
      The study is a randomized control, double blinded trial. A population of 30 children
      diagnosed with ADHD (n=30) will be randomly assigned to the NHP group (n=15) or a placebo
      group (n=15). The NHP group will be provided with a weight-based dose of a chewable natural
      health product containing zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C for 10 weeks, with an
      additional follow-up post intervention at 20 weeks. The placebo group will be administered a
      chewable placebo tablet and will follow the same regimen. Severity of ADHD symptoms will be
      measured at baseline, week 5 and week 10 using the Connor-3 Parent and SNAP-IV validated
      questionnaires. Nutritional status will be monitored at baseline and week 10 for changes in
      serum zinc and erythrocyte magnesium. Children will be monitored for any adverse reactions
      that may occur using the investigational product.Following the informed consent process,
      participants will undergo a structured psychiatric interview prior to enrollment and will
      have 4 30 minute study visits and 2 10 minute telephone calls throughout the study. Blood
      samples will be taken 2 times with the use of a topical anesthetic to decrease sensation
      during the blood draw. Once enrolled, children can withdraw from the study at any time if
      assent to participate is withdrawn.
