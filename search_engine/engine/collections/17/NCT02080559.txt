      England and Wales, during the period 2005-2010, there were 900-1300 cases annually. Disease
      is commonest in infants, young children and adolescents and case fatality is high at 8-10%.

      Until recently there were no licensed vaccines against serogroup B meningococcal disease,
      although vaccines against epidemic strains of MenB have been used in several countries.

      Unfortunately, 4CMenB is associated with significant reactogenicity. This is presumably
      related to the presence of various bacterial surface components present in the outer membrane
      vessicles (OMVs), including lipopolysacchride (LPS), which are capable of activating the
      innate immune response. The host pathways responsible for reactogenicity to OMV vaccines, and
      indeed to other vaccines, are not yet established, and the relationship between
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity is not clear.

      This study will provide information about pathways and mechanisms of immunity and may
      identify gene expression signals which can be used in future vaccine design and evaluation.
