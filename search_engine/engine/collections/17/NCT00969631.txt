      Industries Development,Cairo, Egypt), 500 mg thrice daily for 6-8 weeks. Then after the end
      of this period, they received 100 mg CC (Clomid®; Global Napi Pharmaceuticals,Cairo, Egypt)
      for 5 days starting from day 3 of menstruation (increased by 50 mg in the next cycle in case
      of anovulation ). Patients continued treatment for up to six cycles. Metformin was stopped
      only when pregnancy was documented. All patients in the control group underwent laparoscopic
      ovarian diathermy, then followed up for 6 months.
