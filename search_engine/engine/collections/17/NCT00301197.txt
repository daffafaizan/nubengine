      long-term maintenance of weight loss in children compared to a no maintenance treatment
      control group. In this study, overweight children between the ages of 7-12 years old
      participated along with their overweight parents in a 20-week behavioral, family-based weight
      loss treatment. Following weight loss treatment, participants were randomly assigned to one
      of two 4-month maintenance interventions or to a no-continued treatment control. The
      Behavioral Skills Maintenance intervention (BSM) will confront the declining motivation to
      engage in weight-maintenance behaviors, incorporate specific skills for weight maintenance,
      and teach coping skills and relapse prevention techniques. The Social Facilitation
      Maintenance treatment will use an innovative, socially-based approach to enhance peer
      support, increase parental instrumental support, improve body image, and teach effective
      responses to teasing as methods for sustaining weight maintenance behaviors (i.e., healthy
      diet and physical activity). It is expected that children participating in BSM and SFM
      interventions will demonstrate better outcomes at the point of the weight maintenance
      intervention cessation than children not provided any maintenance treatment. It is further
      hypothesized that the developmentally appropriate focus and more pervasive and sustaining
      nature of the SFM treatment targets relative to BSM targets will result in better weight
      maintenance outcomes for SFM than BSM children. Follow-up assessments will occur at the end
      of the maintenance phase of treatment, as well as at 12 and 24 months following the initial
      weight loss treatment. Effective maintenance treatments in children will have a substantial
      impact on children's immediate and future physical, psychological, and social well being.
