      translational neuroscience, and health care in general. Reliable and cost- effective
      screening procedures that can identify individuals who are more likely to benefit from an
      intervention could have substantial real-world benefits. Here, the investigators sought to
      examine the potential for high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to
      modulate sustained attention in a manner that was informed by individual differences in a
      well-studied electrocortical marker, spontaneous theta/beta ratio. The investigators
      hypothesized that individuals with relatively high theta/beta ratios, putatively reflecting
      suboptimal cortical arousal, would be more likely to benefit from the gains in cortical
      excitability afforded by tRNS. Seventy-two young healthy adults were administered 1mA, 2mA
      and sham tRNS in a double-blind, randomised, cross-over manner, while they performed a
      continuous monitoring paradigm. Electroencephalography was acquired before and after each
      stimulation condition.

      This approach may constitute a feasible means of using individual differences in
      neurophysiology to inform predictions about outcomes from targeted cognitive interventions.
