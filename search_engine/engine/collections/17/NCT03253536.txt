    
      Prospective single arm, single center observational study to evaluate Quality of Life (Qol)
      after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC).
      Patients will receive work-up, treatment and follow-up exclusively as routinely done except
      additional quality of life measurements. This will include contrast-enhanced liver MRI or CT
      and placement of fiducials if necessary. Radiation treatment planning will be based on
      contrast-enhanced fourdimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) with abdominal compression.
      Target volume definition will use an internal target volume (ITV) concept. Dose prescription
      and fractionation will be prescribed individually based on lesion size, localisation,
      movement and liver function according to institutional standards. Qol will be measured by
      standardized and validated EORTC questionaires (QLQ C-30 and HCC 18) at baseline, at the end
      of SBRT, during follow up at 6 weeks, 3,6,12,24,36,48 and 60 months.
