      of procedures, used in clinical practice since 1970. One potential side effect of Ketamine is
      hypersalivation, potentially leading to laryngospasms. To prevent hypersalivation (and reduce
      the potential for laryngospasms), an anti-salivary agent, such as Atropine, is commonly given
      in combination with Ketamine. Recently, however, the necessity of this practice has been
      brought into question. The consideration of using a different drug, glycopyrrolate, has been
      debated. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each medication in
      addition to the placebo control.

      Patients enrolled into this study must present to the emergency department or abscess clinic
      with the need to receive Ketamine as part of a sedation procedure (as determined by the
      treating physician). This study will randomize enrolled patients to receive double-blinded
      Atropine, Glycopyrrolate or placebo given 30 minutes prior to Ketamine. After Ketamine is
      administered, a trained medical person will suction the patient's mouth every 5 minutes for a
      total of 30 minutes, collecting all oral secretions. Total saliva production will be measured
      and salivary flow rates will be calculated and compared between each assigned group. Adverse
      events and complications will be monitored throughout the patient's stay in the emergency
      department or abscess clinic.
