      web-study.

      All students at the participating universities will be informed about the PsSt-study. They
      have to agree to the informed consent to take part in the study. A missing agreement leads to
      exclusion. All subjects get an individual random login-code for study participation. After
      random assignment (intervention (eCHUG-D) vs. control group) all subjects have to answer the
      same web-questionnaires about their alcohol consumption (see outcome variables). Subjects of
      the intervention group are then requested to conduct eCHUG-D and to fill in their login-code
      at the end of the program.

      The 3-month and 6-month follow-ups contain similar questions about alcohol consumption and
      alcohol related consequences. On 6-month follow-up additional questions ask about the
      acceptance of eCHUG-D (intervention group) and the acceptance of the study in general
      (control condition).

      Earlier studies showed the effectiveness of eCHUG in US college samples. The primary endpoint
      of the study ist the amount of alcohol consumed. We hypothesize that the eCHUG group will
      show significantly lower levels of alcohol intake than the control group
