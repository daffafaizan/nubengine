      records and the social security death index. Primary outcome measures were OS (time from
      salvage laryngectomy to death from any cause), disease-specific survival (DSS; time from
      salvage laryngectomy to death from recurrent/persistent laryngeal SCC), and DFS (time from
      salvage laryngectomy to laryngeal SCC recurrence)
