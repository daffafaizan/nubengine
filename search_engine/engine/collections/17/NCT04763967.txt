      Anonymized retrospective data from two clinical sites, NewYork-Presbyterian Queens and Weill
      Cornell Medical College, from 2016 and 2018 will be used to define the control subject
      population, who were assessed for urinary tract infection (UTI) based on a urine sample taken
      according to Standard of Care (SoC).

      Subjects entering the emergency department (ED) generally require that a urine specimen is
      obtained and tested to determine whether there is an active infection in the bladder.
      Emergency department personnel will confirm the possibility of UTI based on symptoms and
      inform the parents/guardians of the potential for study participation using the PedSCath. The
      physician will assess the subject based on Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, including
      non-toilet training and an upper age limit of 3 years. If determined that the subject meets
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, the physician will inform the parents/guardians of the subject
      about the study and request informed consent if the parents/guardians wish their child to
      participate.

      Following the granting of Informed Consent, subjects will be enrolled in the study within the
      treatment arm and a urine sample of 2-3 ml will be taken via the PedSCath. All study
      assessments, from enrollment through urine sample collection, will occur over a single visit
      to the ED. Per standard of care, any treatment following the diagnosis will be performed by
      hospital staff based on physician assessment. Up to 3 run-in subjects per PedSCath user will
      be treated with PedSCath to allow PedSCath users to become familiar with PedSCath mechanism.
