      thousand new injuries each year. Most recovery, following SCI, occurs in the six months
      following surgery. Further recovery after 12 months is unusual.

      In this study 10 subjects, more than 1 year post injury, will be enrolled to test the safety
      and efficacy of a new type of robotic therapy device known as the AMES device. The aim of
      this Phase I/II study is to investigate the use of assisted movement and enhanced sensation
      (AMES) technology in the rehabilitation of the legs of participants with incomplete SCI.
