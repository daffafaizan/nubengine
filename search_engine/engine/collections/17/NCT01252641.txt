      SB-728, HIV is prevented from killing the CD4+ T-cells. On the basis of these laboratory
      results, there is the potential that this may work in humans infected with HIV and improve
      their immune system by allowing their CD4+ T-cells to survive longer.

      The new treatment to be studied will involve removing white blood cells from the blood that
      contain CD4+ T-cells. The extracted CD4+ T-cells are then genetically modified by the Zinc
      finger Nucleases to be resistant to infection by removing the CCR5 gene from the surface of
      the CD4+ T-cell where HIV enters the cell. Additional genetically modified cells are
      manufactured and then re-infused back into the individual. Researchers hope that these
      genetically modified cells will be resistant to infection by HIV and will be able to
      reproduce additional resistant CD4+ T-cells in your body.
