      invasive infections, such as bloodstream infections (BSIs), that are due to ESBL-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae. Previous studies of ertapenem were done in small group of patients, in
      less invasive infection, as a definite 'step-down' therapy, or as compared to other
      non-carbapenem antibiotics.
