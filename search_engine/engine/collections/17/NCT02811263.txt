      blood and oxygen flow to a baby's brain near the time of birth. HIE affects up to 12,000
      newborns each year in the U.S. Half of affected infants have a bad outcome including death,
      cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment despite receiving hypothermia, the only available
      treatment. Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine with remarkable neuroprotective and
      neuroregenerative effects demonstrated in animal models of neonatal brain injury. In a phase
      I trial of Epo + hypothermia, the investigators found that Epo 1000 U/Kg/dose best reproduced
      the pharmacokinetics of neuroprotective dosing in animal models. Long term outcomes were
      better than expected based on entry criteria and MRI findings. A phase II trial compared 50
      cooled infants randomized to receive Epo or placebo. Infants treated with hypothermia + Epo
      had less brain injury on early MRI, and better 12-month motor development. The investigators
      hypothesize that Epo given to cooled infants with moderate/severe HIE will reduce the
      combined primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment from 49 to 33%. This is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Epo therapy in 500 infants with HIE
      undergoing hypothermia. Specific aims are 1) To determine if 5 doses of Epo 1000 U/kg IV
      reduces the rate of death, motor or cognitive deficits at 2 years; 2) To assess safety of Epo
      by evaluating clinical toxicity; and 3) To determine whether Epo decreases the severity of
      neonatal brain injury as evidenced by early MRI and circulating biomarkers of brain injury.
      The investigators anticipate that Epo will confer improved 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome,
      will be safe, and will decrease brain injury severity as determined by early biomarkers.
