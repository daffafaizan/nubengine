      measuring vascular inflammation, which has been previously examined in atherosclerosis using
      68Ga-DOTATATE. To test the hypothesis that 68Ga-DOTATATE can quantify drug-induced changes in
      arterial inflammation, patients with stable cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol despite
      high-intensity statin treatment will undergo serial carotid 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in a double-blind, two-arm, parallel-design, placebo-controlled
      study.
