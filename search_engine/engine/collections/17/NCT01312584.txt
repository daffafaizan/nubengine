      10 healthy human volunteers to test the impact of alkalisation on the absorption, metabolism
      and vascular reactivity of cocoa flavanols. Participants will be requested to consume a
      standardised high flavanol-rich cocoa, non-alkalised (1745 mg of flavanols), a low-flavanol
      cocoa, heavily alkalised (1.3 mg of flavanols) and a flavanol-rich cocoa, medium alkalisation
      (410 mg of flavanols). The three intervention diets are otherwise matched for macro- and
      micronutrient content. Vascular measurements will be performed by using Flow Mediated
      Dilation (FMD), Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and Digital Volume Pulse (DVP). Blood and urine
      samples will be taken to measure the concentration of flavonoids from the cocoa drinks and
      markers of blood vessel function. A number of other biochemical and physiological measures
      will be recorded including blood glucose, lipoproteins, cytokine levels and blood pressure.
