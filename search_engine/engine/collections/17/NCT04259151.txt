      driving a semi-autonomous electric wheelchair. This module is designed to accessorize the
      electric wheelchair to improve the safety conditions when driving an electric wheelchair,
      thus reducing the wheelchair accident rate on the one hand and facilitating access to the
      wheelchair to persons who can not claim it without the use of a safety device of this type.

      This study "SWADAPT2" follows "SWADAPT1" with patients with Neurological Disorders, Regular
      Drivers of Electric Wheelchairs, in the same conditions :

      Each patient included will test a wheelchair equipped with a collision avoidance assistance
      module in 2 conditions, assistance activated or not. This evaluation will be carried out in 3
      standardized test circuits of increasing difficulty, one week apart. At each session, the
      patient will perform the circuit 6 times, including 3 with activated assistance, in a random
      order established upstream.
