      people who have stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study will look at
      changes in arterial inflammation in people who take MLN1202 in addition to standard-of-care
      (SOC) therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 108 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  MLN1202 Dose A intravenously (IV)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient

      All participants will receive IV administration of MLN1202 or placebo on Day 1, Day 29, and
      Day 57 of this study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 19 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone approximately 35 days after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
