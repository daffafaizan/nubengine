      food ingredient from two different sources at two different doses on food intake and appetite
      markers over a 10 hour period. All participants reported to the laboratory first thing in the
      morning and remained in the laboratory until after their evening meal. A fixed breakfast was
      served but the participants were free to eat as much as they liked at lunch and dinner. Blood
      was taken at regular intervals during the day and assayed for glucose and several hormones
      related to appetite. Subjective measures of appetite were also collected over the 10 hour
      test session.
