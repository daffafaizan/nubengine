    
      Induction Phase: 28-day treatment cycle for 12 cycles:

        -  Lenalidomide 15 mg PO QD on Days 1-21

        -  Ixazomib 4 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15

        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV Q1W week for 8 weeks, then Q2W weeks for 16 weeks, thereafter
           Q4W weeks

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg PO will be administered day of and day after all doses of
           daratumumab and ixazomib (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). The dexamethasone 20 mg PO oral
           or IV dose administered as a pre-infusion medication on daratumumab infusion days (Days
           1, 8, 15, 22) replaces the oral dexamethasone dose for that day.

      Maintenance Phase: 28-day treatment cycle until progression or excessive toxicity or a
      maximum of 2 years of maintenance treatment:

      Arm A

        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21 Arm B

        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21

        -  Ixazomib 3 mg (or last tolerated dose from the induction phase) PO on Days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV on Day 1

      In the maintenance phase, dexamethasone, 20 mg PO orally or IV will be administered to
      patients as a pre-infusion medication prior to daratumumab dosing. When dexamethasone is
      reduced to 20 mg/week and is given as pre-infusion medication, patients may receive low-dose
      methylprednisolone (â‰¤20 mg) orally (or equivalent in accordance with local standards) for the
      prevention of delayed IRRs as clinically indicated.

      If the investigator wishes to continue the maintenance regimen at the end of the 2 years
      maintenance treatment, patients may continue current maintenance as per standard of care.
