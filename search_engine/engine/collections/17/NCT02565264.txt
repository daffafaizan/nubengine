      extracellular space via intracellular endocytosis. They are found abundantly in body fluids
      such as blood. They consist of lipid bilayer so that their structure is stable. They can be
      preserved for 2 weeks at 4℃. They contain proteins, lipids and nucleic acids including coding
      or non-coding RNA. Resent studies have revealed that exosomes have an important role in
      cell-to-cell communication.

      The investigators found that serum exosome levels were significantly decreased in scleroderma
      patients with vascular involvements such as cutaneous ulcers and/or pitting scars compared to
      in normal subjects. The investigators also elucidated that serum-derived exosomes accelerated
      cutaneous wound healing in BALB/c mice. Exosome supplementation to cutaneous ulcers seems to
      have significant therapeutic value.

      The objective of present study is to evaluate the effect of exosomes derived from plasma on
      intractable cutaneous ulcers (e.g. rheumatic disease, peripheral arterial disease, chronic
      venous insufficiency, decubitus or burns).

      Autologous exosomes are obtained from the participants' own plasma. The duration of study is
      28days. The cutaneous wound healing will be evaluated at day1, day2, day7, day14, day 21 day
      28.
