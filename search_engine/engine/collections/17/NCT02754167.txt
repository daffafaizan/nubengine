    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      phase Ib study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring hemodialysis.
      Eligible subjects will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be administered
      by intravenous infusion. The study will consist of 3 dose cohorts of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 8
      mg/kg body weight with 8 subjects in each cohort. Using a standard 6+2 design, 6 subjects in
      each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 subjects in each cohort will be
      randomized to placebo. The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis
      of clinical safety and safety laboratory data. Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will be investigated.
