      discrimination (2PD) test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test. Active motion of the
      joints is measured using a standard hand goniometer. For the direct DDIF, total active motion
      is calculated as the sum of degrees of active flexion of the interphalangeal and the
      metacarpophalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of extension deficit. For the reversed
      DDIF, total active motion of the donor finger is calculated as the sum of degrees of active
      flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of
      extension deficit.
