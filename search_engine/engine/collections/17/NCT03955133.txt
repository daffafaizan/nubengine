      care homes, each with up to 26 residents prescribed >4 medicines (estimated ~90% residents).

      Each home will identify a nurse lead and a deputy. Nurses will be asked to administer the
      PADRe Profile with all patients prescribed >4 medicines.

      Barriers, facilitators, and feasibility of the Profile will be explored. This will identify
      how, in which contexts medicines' monitoring can be integrated into routine care, relate the
      Profile to improved processes and outcomes of care, and inform implementation strategies (see
      logic model in cited papers).

      Data collection:

        -  Record review before and after each of 3 administrations of the intervention to identify
           clinical and prescription changes. Narrative accounts of problems causing moderate or
           severe harm will be prepared.

        -  Serial interviews and debriefs with nurses: three per nurse.

        -  Stakeholder interviews with patients, participating pharmacists and prescribers for an
           overview of implementation.
