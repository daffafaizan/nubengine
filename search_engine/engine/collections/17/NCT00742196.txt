      coherence tomography (OCT) becomes very useful to detect such a glaucomatous damage. However,
      there are some difficult cases including parapapillary atrophy to perform this measurement.
      Because the RNFL thickness is so sensitive to the position of measurement and the measurement
      of RNFL thickness on parapapillary atrophy is incorrect, it is difficult to determine exact
      RNFL thickness in patients with a large parapapillary atrophy. In the present study, we want
      to find the proper method to analyze the RNFL thickness on parapapillary atrophy. The
      previous OCT used a fixed circle to measure the RNFL thickness, but the new spectral domain
      OCT, the Cirrus HD OCT, uses a movable one. Therefore, we may suggest a new analysis strategy
      for the parapapillary atrophy.
