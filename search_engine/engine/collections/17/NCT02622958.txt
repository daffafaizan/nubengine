    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trial of the
      efficacy and safety of PH94B in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with Social Anxiety
      Disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV and confirmed by the MINI
      (5.0.0). The study is intended to serve as a feasibility trial of a multi-center phase 3
      study protocol of similar design.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate design features for a larger Phase 3 study
      that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PH94B for the acute management of symptoms in
      subjects with Social Anxiety Disorder. Careful review of diary entries and measurement of
      study medication compliance each week will be used to determine the feasibility of using the
      study medication on an "as needed" basis for anxiety-provoking social events. Specifically,
      the frequency of use, variability of SUDS ratings, effect size of differences in average peak
      SUDS ratings during treatment with PH94B and placebo, and general reliability of the diary
      recording method will be evaluated and used to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria as
      well as provide guidance for designing a larger multi-site study.

      The study will last a total of 6-8 weeks. The randomized double-blind treatment period will
      last a total of four weeks for all subjects.
