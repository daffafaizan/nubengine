      impairment in elderly subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects will
      undergo screen that includes neuropsychological testing and brain MRI. This study uses a
      special type of scan called a PET scan to take pictures of the brain. During the PET scan, a
      special radioactive dye called 18F-MK-6240 is injected into the body. 18F-MK-6240 sticks to
      abnormal tangles made of the protein tau. Subjects will have the option to have lumbar
      puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers.
