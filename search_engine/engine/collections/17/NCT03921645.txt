      patients pneumonia after 48h of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation is one of the
      most common and most serious complications, hospital acquired is An important cause of
      pneumonia. According to the onset time of VAP, VAP can be divided into early-onset VAP and
      late-onset VAP. The time limit is mechanical ventilation for 4 days, in which early-onset VAP
      (mechanical ventilation ≤ 4d) is mainly caused by pathogens sensitive to most antibacterial
      drugs (such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, etc.);
      late-onset VAP ≥ 5D occur during mechanical ventilation, mainly caused by multi-drug
      resistant (multi-drug resistance, MDR) (such as P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Some early-onset VAPs can also be caused by
      MDR. Therefore, MDR has become the main pathogen of VAP, especially Gram-negative bacilli.
      Studies have shown that VDR caused by MDR has a mortality rate of 76% and an attributable
      mortality rate of 20-30%. Such bacteria are not sensitive to commonly used antibacterial
      drugs in the clinic, and sensitive antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, have a large
      systemic side effect, thereby limiting clinical use. Therefore, in theory, nebulized inhaled
      sensitive antibiotics can achieve high drug concentrations in lung tissue, and lower blood
      concentrations can avoid or reduce systemic side effects.
