      I. To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) between patients who develop a pathologic complete
      response (pCR) or do not achieve a pCR following dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant
      combination therapy in patients with locally advanced BRAF V600 mutated melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) and
      patients without pCR who are receiving dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant therapy followed
      by adjuvant combination therapy.

      II. To identify biomarkers predictive of response through collection of serial blood draws
      and biopsies in patients receiving neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy.

      III. To evaluate the safety of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination in this patient
      population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate and perform further advanced imaging analysis on magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanned (if
      available) images collected on patients enrolled onto this study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD)
      for 8 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib, patients undergo
      surgery. Approximately 1 week after surgery, patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and
      trametinib PO QD for 44 additional weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
