      in that it: (1) has a novel resistance/rebound profile demonstrating virus suppression even
      in the presence of ddI-resistant mutants; (2) can produce a pronounced fall in viral load;
      and (3) is well tolerated (over 200 patients have been treated for up to 3 years with minimal
      side effects).

      Patients are stratified by antiretroviral experience: naive (no more than 2 weeks of therapy)
      versus experienced (more than 2 weeks). Patients must discontinue all antiretroviral therapy
      for at least 28 days prior to randomization to 1 of 9 HU treatment arms. Treatment arms are
      divided into 3 HU dose categories: very low, low, and medium. Within each category HU is
      administered daily on 3 different dosing schedules. Depending on viral load, patients on the
      very low and low dose arms may have the opportunity to intensify their HU dose at any time
      beyond Week 12, provided no Grade 3 or 4 HU-related toxicity is present (these patients are
      monitored for an additional 8 weeks following intensification). All patients receive ddI and
      d4T at the same doses every day. When 50% of patients have completed 24 weeks of treatment,
      an analysis is made to determine whether or not to continue the 52-week study without
      modifications. Patients are monitored periodically for changes in plasma HIV RNA, CD4 cell
      counts, weight, and symptoms.
