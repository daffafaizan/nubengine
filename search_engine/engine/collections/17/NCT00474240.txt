      risk of a heart attack, specifically for patients who have heart disease plus major risk
      factors. Available medications used alone at even the highest approved doses are not expected
      to reach these new target recommendations for cholesterol in a large number of subjects.
      Thus, the development of new medications that can provide additional cholesterol lowering may
      be beneficial.

      This study tests the effectiveness of different doses of the study drug, AEGR-733 alone and
      in combination with the approved cholesterol lowering drug, atorvastatin (Lipitor), on
      cholesterol. Volunteers will be randomized to one of 6 different study treatments and will
      take the assigned medication (3 capsules daily) for 8 weeks.
