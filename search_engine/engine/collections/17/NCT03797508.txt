      and serum CA 125 level in predicting of fetal demise in cases of threatened miscarriage three
      vaginal ultrasounds will be done ) the first one will be done at six to eight weeks of
      pregnancy to the patients who fulfill the criteria in this us we will make sure that the
      cardiac pulsations are present and measure the following:

        1. the fetal heart rate,

        2. the crown rump length

        3. gestational sac diameter

        4. yolk sac diameter. b) The second ultra sound will be after two weeks from the first one
           to follow up the patient for pregnancy survival, take the same measures again and
           correlate them with the results of laboratory investigations to select the investigation
           which is most accurate in anticipating outcome in cases of threatened abortion.

      C) the third one will be at the end of first trimester (13 weeks) to ensure fetal viability.

      . embryonic bradycardia and absence of yolk sac or smaller yolk sac than expected for any
      given gestational age are prognostic factors of poor pregnancy outcome in the first 12 weeks
      of pregnancy women with small for age gestational sac are more prone to have miscarriage we
      will do laboratory investigation in the form of A) Serum progesterone: low maternal P levels
      have been useful in predicting spontaneous abortion in threatened pregnancies with a
      sensitivity of 80% (<10 ng /mL) so, this will be our cutoff value. B) Serum CA 125 :we will
      take a level of 51.5 as cut off value.this is the upper level of normal we will do them once
      when the patient presents to us.
