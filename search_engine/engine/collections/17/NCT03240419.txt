      to induce fetal adaptations and greater risk of obesity in the offspring. Probiotic
      supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in normal
      weight women. However, little is known on the effects of probiotic supplementation throughout
      pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and inflammation as well as offspring gene
      expression and body composition. Long term nutritional supplementation, however, is
      associated with increased participant burden as well as lower compliance and retention rates.
      Thus, this study will assess the feasibility of a long term probiotic supplementation study
      in obese pregnant women. Acceptance and compliance with daily capsules throughout pregnancy
      and study procedures will be assessed.
