      not been beneficial in the juvenile population. A new approach for treating patients with
      presumed autoimmune disorders is oral tolerance therapy. Chicken type II collagen (Colloral)
      is being developed as an oral tolerance therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
      This open label pilot study will describe the safety of chicken type II collagen added to
      current anti-inflammatory medications as treatment for patients with uveitis associated with
      juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The primary ophthalmic outcomes of this study will be a change
      from baseline in the number of anterior chamber cells and the number and dosage of
      anti-inflammatory medications. Secondary outcomes for JRA will include change in physician's
      global assessment, parent/patient assessment of overall well-being, functional assessment,
      number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limited range of motion, and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Secondary outcomes for uveitis will include change in
      visual acuity, vitreous haze, and anterior chamber flare.
