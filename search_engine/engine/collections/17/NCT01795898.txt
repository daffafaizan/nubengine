    
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded") single-arm and prospective
      study (study following participants forward in time) of fentanyl in participants with
      osteoarthritis and Chronic low back pain with moderate (medium level of seriousness) and
      severe (very serious, life threatening) pain levels. Participants will be treated with
      fentanyl transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will
      enter the body through the skin) starting with 12.5 microgram (mcg) dose of fentanyl. The
      dose will be increased on Day 3, if needed, by 12.5 mcg. Dose adjustments will be done every
      3 days. Maximum of 50 mcg dose of fentanyl will be allowed. Participants will be evaluated
      for pain levels and quality of life using Brief pain inventory (BPI) score and Clinical
      global impression-severity (CGI-S) score. Tramadol 50 milligram tablet at a maximum of 6
      tablets per day will be used as supplemental doses of analgesic (drug used to control pain).
      Participants' safety will be monitored through out the study.
