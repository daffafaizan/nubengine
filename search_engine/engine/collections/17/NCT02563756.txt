    
      Objective: The investigators aim with the present study was to compare patient related
      outcome measurements, knee function and muscle mass in patients operated with an UKR or a TKR
      for medial gonarthritis.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that a greater number of patients might benefit
      from a less invasive surgery in terms of increased quality of life, function and muscle mass.

      Primary Outcome: Thigh muscle cross sectional area and radiological attenuation measured by
      CT.

      Secondary outcomes: Functional tests (timed up and go, 30s sit and stand, forward reach,
      forward step down, 6 min walk and 40 m walk test), knee strength (Biodex isokinetic
      dynamometer) and patient reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). A number of PROMs:
      Health related quality of life (EQ-5D), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),
      Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) as well as 3D movement and gait
      analysis.

      Inclusion criteria: Unilateral medial osteoarthritis of the knee (Kellgren 3b-4), aged 50 or
      above.

      Exclusion criteria: Insufficient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Fixed varus deformity
      >10°, fixed flexion deformity >10°, flexion <100°. Previous high tibial osteotomy on the same
      side. Any neurological disease affecting strength or locomotion in any leg. Body mass index
      (BMI) >35. Rheumatoid disease. Symptomatic osteoarthritis of the contra lateral knee or any
      hip. Insufficient written or spoken Swedish.
