      of disability in the world. Cognitive disorders are known to exist during the phases of
      bipolar disease, and alterations increase significantly after the age of 65. Recent studies
      have shown that attention, memory and executive function impairments are the main causes of
      cognitive disorders. Residual symptoms have a significant impact on the risk of relapse into
      bipolar disorder and on quality of life. Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a pedagogical approach
      based on the idea that cognitive skills contribute to personal development in the same way as
      psychological and social factors. This study aims at assessing a cognitive stimulation
      program initially developed for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and adapted to
      bipolar disease. This program will be compared to the usual practice consisting in
      consultation with psychiatrist and sometimes in intervention of home nurses.
