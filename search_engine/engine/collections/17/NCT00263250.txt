      is safe and a good option for some patients has not been assessed.

      OBJECTIVE To compare pain and the Physical Component Score (PCS) of the SF-36 at two years in
      men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias randomized to watchful waiting (WW) or a
      standard tension-free hernia repair (TFR).

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS. Between January, 1999 and December, 2004 we conducted a
      multicenter trial of 720 men (364 WW, 356 TFR) who were followed for 2-4.5 years. Men were
      excluded with hernia pain interfering with activities; undetectable hernias; infection;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status >3; recent difficulty in reducing the
      hernia.

      INTERVENTIONS Men assigned to WW were followed at 6 months and annually and watched for
      hernia symptoms. Men assigned to operation received TFR, and were followed at 3 and 6 months,
      and annually.
