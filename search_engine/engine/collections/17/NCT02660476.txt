      period of 24 months.

      A range of patients with diabetes will be sampled (including those with Type 1 diabetes as
      this group is under-studied in Qatar). This will be important in designing appropriate
      intervention plans that will improve diabetic patients' health conditions to prevent or delay
      the onset of complications and will provide a strong foundation for longitudinal study.

      The broad objectives of the study are:

      QUDOS 1: Aims to recruit 1,700 diabetic patients (including 200 with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (independent of healthcare setting)) attending the hospitals and primary care and to collect
      the following data:

        -  Demographics: age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic background, smoking status;

        -  Anthropometrics: vital signs, height, weight, body fat percentage, fat mass, neck and
           waist circumference;

        -  Medical History: medications, complications, comorbidities, latest HbA1c and lipid
           profiles and family medical history;

        -  Routine laboratory data;

        -  Lifestyle: diet, physical activity,;

        -  Sleep: quality and daytime sleepiness;

        -  Cognition and Mental Health: depression, anxiety, stress and memory;

        -  Diabetes microvascular complications: diabetic neuropathy, urine albumin/creatinine
           ratio; routine retinal screening data.

        -  Gut microbiome from a stool sample

      QUDOS 2: To further characterise 500 patients, from the total 1500 patients with T2DM
      recruited in QUDOS 1, who accept to continue with QUDOS 2 (a more detailed study and
      assessment).

      This phase aims to concentrate on the following aspects:

        -  Obstructive sleep apnoea;

        -  Sleep duration and quality;

        -  Diet;

        -  Objective physical activity;

        -  Stress;

        -  Quality of Life;

        -  Depression and anxiety;

        -  Perceived control of health;

        -  Detailed neuropathy screening;

        -  Cardiovascular function;

        -  Cognitive function;

        -  Biological samples.
