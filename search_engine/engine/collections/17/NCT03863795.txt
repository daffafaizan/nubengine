      I. To examine if self-affirmation attenuates the effects of cigarette smoking stigmatization
      on smoking risk perceptions, pro-smoking beliefs, and intentions to change smoking behavior.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants are recruited and pre-screened via an online crowdsourcing program called Amazon
      Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants then respond to a one-time research survey over 20
      minutes on SurveyGizmo, an on-line survey software platform.
