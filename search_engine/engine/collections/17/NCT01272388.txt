      be eligible for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study. Prior to
      randomization, subjects will have testing including: 6 minute walk, quality of life
      questionnaire, blood draw, and an echocardiogram. If an initial monitored dose of tadalafil
      is tolerated, participants will be randomized 2:1 to tadalafil vs. placebo. After 4 weeks on
      drug or placebo, subjects will have the same baseline testing repeated. At the time of aortic
      valve replacement surgery, the aortic valve and a small piece of LV myocardium will be taken
      for several analyses.
