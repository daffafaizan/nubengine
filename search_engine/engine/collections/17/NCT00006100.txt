        -  Determine the toxicity of allogeneic Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic
           T-lymphocytes (EBV CTL) in patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory
           EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Detect alterations in the anti-EBV cellular immunity of patients treated with EBV CTL.

      OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis. Epstein Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
      (EBV CTL) are cultured in vitro.

      Patients receive an infusion of EBV CTL over 10 minutes on day 0. The EBV CTL infusion is
      preceded by 3 doses of fludarabine. Patients then receive interleukin-2 injections for 12
      days after the EBV CTL infusion.

      Patients are followed weekly for 1.5 months, twice a month for 1.5 months, and then monthly
      for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
