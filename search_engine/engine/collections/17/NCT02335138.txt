      (RCT) to take place over a four-year period. The investigators plan to enroll and maintain a
      cohort of 350 men who have sex with men (MSM) couples: 175 self-reported concordant
      HIV-negative and 175 self-reported HIV-discordant couples. Within this sample, the proposed
      study will examine the impact of home-testing with video-based Couples HIV Testing and
      Counseling (CHTC) (intervention) versus home-testing alone (control) on changes in: sexual
      risk-taking (e.g., UAI), formation and adherence to explicit agreements about sex,
      relationship functioning for the management of HIV risk, and linkage to care for newly
      diagnosed HIV positives among MSM couples who live throughout the US. To assess these
      specific changes, couples will complete online surveys at 3 time points (baseline, 3 months
      and 6 months).
