    
      Vinorelbine (NVB) + CDDP is considered a standard trt in induction or concomitantly with RT
      (Vokes, Fournel, Krzakowski). NVBo simplifies the administration of trt and provides the same
      efficacy as intravenous NVB (NVBiv). In order to assess this and to improve the tolerance, a
      trial was started with NVBiv and NVBo + CDDP as induction followed by a fractionated
      administration of NVBo + CDDP during RT.
