      type 1 diabetics. In gestational diabetes the correlation is less clear. In the view of
      current knowledge, it seems that moderately elevated intrapartum blood glucose may not cause
      neonatal hypoglycemia. There is no consensus of how to treat intrapartum blood glucose level
      in gestational diabetics. Some studies have implied that most of mothers with gestational
      diabetes would have normal blood glucose level during labour and hence would not need any
      intervention if their daily insulin dosage is less than 0,5-1 IU/kg.

      Study participants are recruited into the study at Tampere University Hospital Maternity Ward
      when their daily insulin dose exceeds 30 IU. Randomization is done at 37th gestational week,
      if vaginal delivery is planned, and HbA1c is measured. Randomization envelope is opened at
      the delivery ward when active labour begins and treatment of blood glucose level is carried
      out accordingly. If insulin dose is 1 IU/kg or more, the participant is treated as in active
      treatment group despite of result of randomization. All neonates will receive milk substitute
      after birth in labour ward. Plasma glucose is measured immediately if neonate has symptoms of
      low blood sugar. If not, plasma glucose is measured approximately two hours after birth and
      after that every 4 hours until plasma glucose is 3,0 mmol/l or more in three consecutive
      measurements.
