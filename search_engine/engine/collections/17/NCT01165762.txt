      haplotype to be withdrawn of immunosuppressive medication and become "tolerant "to their
      kidney graft. The recipient will receive a conditioning regimen composed of low dose
      radiation to the lymphoid tissue (total lymphoid irradiation, TLI) and anti-thymocyte
      globulin (ATG) at the time of transplant. They will then be infused with purified "stem cell"
      and T-cell from their kidney donors 2 weeks after the transplant to try to achieve mixed
      chimerism of their white blood cells with the donor (the recipient would have a mixture some
      of the with blood cells of the donor and theirs in their blood). The kidney donor has to
      provide peripheral stem cell 6-8 weeks before kidney donation. It is an outpatient procedure
      done using peripheral veins after treatment with G-CSF (filgrastim).Immunosuppressive
      medication will be decreased gradually and possibly stopped by 1 1/2 year after the
      transplantation if the recipient meets withdrawing criteria (persistence of mixed chimerism
      more than 18 months, no episode of rejection and no rejection on surveillance kidney biopsy).
      Potential candidates need to be approved for kidney transplant and available for close
      follow-up at Stanford University Medical Center.
