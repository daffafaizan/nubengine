      double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and
      efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily and 15 mg once daily versus placebo for the
      treatment of signs and symptoms of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) who were on a stable dose of csDMARDs and had an inadequate response to
      csDMARDs.

      Period 2 is a blinded long-term (up to 5 years) extension period to evaluate the long-term
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily and 15 mg daily in
      participants who had completed Period 1 that is currently ongoing.

      Participants were to be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology
      (IRT) to receive double-blind study drug in one of the following treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: Upadacitinib 30 mg QD in Period 1 → Upadacitinib 30 mg QD in Period 2

        -  Group 2: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD in Period 1 → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD in Period 2

        -  Group 3: Placebo in Period 1 → Upadacitinib 30 mg QD in Period 2

        -  Group 4: Placebo in Period 1 → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD in Period 2

      Randomization was stratified by prior exposure to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
      drug (bDMARD) (yes/no) and geographic region.
