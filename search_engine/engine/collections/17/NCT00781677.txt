      between the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and amygdala will decline as symptoms of
      co-morbid anxiety (Anxiety Factor Score) increase in patients with MDD. This decrease in
      connectivity will also account for decrease in treatment response. The structural
      connectivity will be assessed using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and the functional
      connectivity will be assessed using resting state BOLD fMRI.We propose to use the fMRI and
      DTI to identify biological markers that are associated with treatment response in a cohort of
      patients with a spectrum of Anxiety Factor Scores.
