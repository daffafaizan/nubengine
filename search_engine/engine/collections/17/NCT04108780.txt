    
      Common Bile Duct Exploration is a surgery that involves opening the main bile duct that
      drains from liver and gallbladder into the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum).
      This is needed when a gallstone drops out of the gallbladder into the duct and partially or
      completely blocks up the duct. This can cause jaundice , fever and chills, severe abdominal
      pain due to infection / inflammation of the bile duct, gallbladder or pancreas. This most
      often involves admission to the hospital and urgent intervention. Most commonly, a procedure
      called an ERCP is used to clear out the stones from the bile duct. If gallbladder will have
      to be removed soon to prevent this potentially serious condition from occurring again.

      During the operation the investigators remove gallbladder then a duct exploration is
      performed. This involves opening the duct directly and removing the stones.

      Prior to Common Bile Duct Exploration surgery, patient will be asked not to eat anything
      after midnight prior to the surgery. patient will be given specific instructions from the
      surgeon or anesthesiologist about which medications he should or should not take prior to the
      surgery. patient should not take any blood thinning medications at least 5 days prior to your
      operation. This should be discussed with the surgeon at the preop visit.
