    
      In a 24 week randomized controlled trial based in a large urban area with high rates of
      opioid use disorder (OUD) and HIV, 250 out-of-treatment opioid users who utilize syringe
      exchanges will be recruited and randomize to receive an onsite treatment intervention (O-BMT)
      or enhanced referral to buprenorphine treatment. Over 2 weeks, participants in the O-BMT arm
      will see a buprenorphine provider twice, receive weekly blister packs of medication, and then
      their care will be transferred to a community health center for maintenance buprenorphine
      treatment. In the control arm, participants will receive enhanced referral to the community
      health center for maintenance buprenorphine treatment. Data collection will include urine
      drug tests, questionnaires, and medical and pharmacy record review. Key outcomes will include
      engagement in buprenorphine treatment, treatment outcomes, and programmatic costs.
      Buprenorphine diversion will be assessed by using electronic monitors that estimate
      medication adherence, testing urine samples for buprenorphine, and through sequential surveys
      regarding buying or selling illicit buprenorphine.
