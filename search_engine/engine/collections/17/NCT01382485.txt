      nonunion of a long bone will be invited to speak to the research coordinator regarding the
      study. An internet based randomization system will be used to allocate subjects to treatment
      groups. Participating sites will be given a unique ID and password to log into the secure
      website and register their subject.

      Treating physicians will use 1 of 2 bone graft harvesting methods in patients with a nonunion
      of a long bone requiring grafting. The first method involves harvesting bone graft from the
      iliac crest area. The second method involves using the RIA to harvest bone graft from the
      femoral canal. Clinical assessments will occur at the time of hospital admission (baseline),
      at post-op day 1, and then at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 month, 12 months and 24 months
      post-surgery.

      Surgical procedure at the nonunion site will not be standardized as this will vary greatly.
      Surgeons may use bone graft substitutes at the recipient site at their discretion. We will
      however, standardize surgical techniques for harvesting of the graft from the donor site.
