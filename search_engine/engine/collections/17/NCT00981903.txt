      heparin (tinzaparin) for primary treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous
      thromboembolism in patients with cancer. We will determine the efficacy (recurrent VTE) and
      safety (major hemorrhage) of this approach. Secondarily, we will analyze the outcome of
      patients in terms of survival and response to therapy versus matched controls. We will also
      determine baseline levels of markers of hemostasis, fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis and will
      follow changes with treatment as well as correlate levels of these plasma markers with
      outcomes, including recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage,and survival.
