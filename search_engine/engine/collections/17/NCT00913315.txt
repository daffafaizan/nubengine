      clinics. Most of the clinically CP/CPPS are to some extent associated with storage
      (irritative) symptoms, such as increased frequency, urgency, and nocturia, namely many
      patients with CP/CPPS have overactive bladder symptoms. Alpha-blocker therapy has been
      advocated as a treatment modality for CP/CPPS. Some trials showed a statistically and likely
      clinically significant treatment effect, while other trials showed no benefit. Therefore,
      tamsulosin combination with tolterodine treatment for CP/CPPS may be more effective than
      tamsulosin single.
