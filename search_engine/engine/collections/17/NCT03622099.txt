      work in adult critical care unit at Menoufia University hospital for patients with
      circulatory failure, a 100 ml bolus of normal saline solution was given to the patient over 1
      minute through a central venous catheter or jugular cannula. For prediction of responders,
      echocardiographic parameters were recorded1 minute after bolus administration. The remaining
      400 ml of normal saline solution was infused at a constant rate over 10 minutes, and
      echocardiographic parameters were recorded again. The mean echocardiographic measurements
      over three consecutive respiratory cycles were recorded along with heart rate HR, systolic,
      diastolic and mean arterial pressures, central venous pressure, and Temperature also
      mechanical ventilation parameter (tidal volume, respiratory rate and PEEP) for each patient.
      Patients with an increase in CO after a 100 ml or total 500-ml infusion over 10 minutes
      (Î”CO500) of 15% or more were classified as responders (Rs) and those without an increase in
      CO was classified as non-responders
