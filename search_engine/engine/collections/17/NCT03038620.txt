      including the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as coronary artery
      disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Obesity has recently
      been formally defined as a chronic disease characterized by pathophysiological processes that
      result in increased adipose tissue mass and can result in increased morbidity and mortality.
      Although the health risks associated with obesity are clear, there is an emerging
      appreciation that obesity per se, as defined by simple anthropometric measures such as waist
      circumference or body mass index (BMI), is neither necessary nor sufficient to promote
      cardiometabolic disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. As a result,
      BMI alone is an insufficient marker of risk and may not accurately identify individuals at
      elevated risk for ASCVD. There is a pressing need to more accurately phenotype obesity to
      identify individuals at elevated risk for ASCVD that may benefit from more intensive
      preventive and therapeutic strategies
