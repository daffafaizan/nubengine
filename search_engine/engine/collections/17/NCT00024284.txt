        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of carboplatin and
           irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety profile and dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboplatin and irinotecan.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 50 minutes on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on
      days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and irinotecan until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
