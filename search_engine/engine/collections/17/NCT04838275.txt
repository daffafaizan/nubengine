      with antifibrotic therapy, which may be more effectively captured with long-term activity
      monitoring. Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation centers create a barrier to patient exercise
      accessibility and compliance, which is eliminated in a mobile health (mHealth) exercise
      training approach. In this study, 30 patients with IPF will be randomized into one of two
      arms. The exercise arm will receive a 12-week home exercise intervention using an mHealth
      platform plus pre- and post-intervention monitoring (4 weeks each). The non-exercise arm will
      be monitored for the same study duration. The primary end point is change from baseline in
      daily physical activity as a number of weekly exercise minutes qualifying as moderate to
      vigorous physical activity (MVPA), METS*minutes of exercise per week, and sedentary time
      minutes. Assessments will be performed primarily via in-person study visits at week 4 and
      week 16, as well as via daily recordings from mHealth monitoring devices.
