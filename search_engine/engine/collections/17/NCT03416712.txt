      Medicine service at Texas Children's Hospital. Each eligible participant will give informed
      consent prior to enrollment.

      Study participants will be randomized into an intervention (400 participants) or control
      group (400 participants). The intervention group will receive a survey (WE CARE HOUSTON) that
      has been designed to assess family need for community resources that address the SDH (such as
      food insecurity, housing insecurity, etc.). The intervention group will receive referrals to
      community resources based on their responses to the WE CARE HOUSTON survey. The intervention
      group will receive a phone call within 3 months of discharge to ask if they have had trouble
      following up with resources.

      Both the intervention and the control groups will be followed for 6 months. Study
      investigators will obtain outcome data through structured telephone interviews at 6 months
      and also through medical record review.

      This research has been designed to test our hypotheses:

        1. The use of the WE CARE HOUSTON screening tool and subsequent referral to community
           resources will result in increased family participation in community resources that
           address the SDH; i.e. we believe that the intervention group will enroll in more
           community resources than the control group over the 6 month study period.

        2. The use of the WE CARE HOUSTON screening tool and subsequent referral to community
           resources will result in improved health outcomes, i.e. children in the intervention
           group will have fewer ED visits, fewer readmissions, improved BMI and improved parent
           perception of child's health during the study period.
