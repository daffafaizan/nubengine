      delivery under general/spinal analgesia using a transverse lower abdominal incision.

      Prior to each operation, the surgeon will be provided with a syringe containing a 20 mL
      solution of 1% lidocaine or 0.9% sodium chloride, which will be injected subcutaneously to
      the incisional site region after anesthesia and before the beginning of the surgery.

      After the operation the conventional post cesarean analgesic regime will be used and recorded
      for all women.

      The self-report of pain will be assessed by the patient using a validated visual analog
      scale, as instructed by the nursing staff.

      The patient's mark will be used as a numerical index of pain intensity. The reports will be
      taken by the patients in intervals of 4 hours for 48 hours after the operation. In addition,
      analgesic requirements of the patient will be monitored and recorded by the nursing staff and
      used for comparison between the two study group
