    
      This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of surgical patients with severe
      renal impairment that seeks to address the following:

      Specific Aim:

      To determine whether rocuronium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade and reversal with
      sugammadex achieves recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF ≥ 0.9) faster than reversal of
      cisatracurium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade and reversal with neostigmine in
      patients with severe renal impairment.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Patients with severe renal impairment who are reversed with sugammadex after rocuronium will
      achieve a TOF ≥0.9 within a time frame that is one-third of the time it takes for reversal
      with neostigmine after cisatracurium.
