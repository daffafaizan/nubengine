      low-dose dobutamine visit and Visit 2: a low-dose cocaine visit. At the dobutamine visit, the
      subject will only receive low-dose dobutamine, which will be used as an internal
      inotropic/vasodilator control for cocaine. At the cocaine visit, the subject will receive
      low-dose intranasal cocaine followed by either the active study drug (dexmedetomidine) or an
      inactive placebo (saline). Both cocaine and dobutamine will increase myocardial contractility
      and oxygen demand, thereby stimulating metabolic vasodilation. If, as predicted, cocaine also
      causes Î±-adrenergic agonist in the coronary microcirculation, then myocardial blood flow
      should increase less with cocaine then with dobutamine for a given level of myocardial oxygen
      demand. We will study if dexmedetomidine, a central sympatholytic, can normalize this cocaine
      effect. We previously have used dobutamine as a comparator for cocaine in our research. At
      both visits, myocardial contrast echocardiography will be used to measure regional myocardial
      perfusion.
