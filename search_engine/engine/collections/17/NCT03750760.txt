    
      Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), which includes myocardial infarction, are at
      high risk of recurrent ischaemic events (e.g. heart attacks), and death. The current standard
      treatment includes high dose statins to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      also known as bad cholesterol, soon after admission. In some cases, following assessment
      after 1-3 months, administration of a second line cholesterol lowering therapy (ezetimibe)
      may be added if LDL-C levels remain high ≥ 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L). Many guidelines advocate that
      following ACS high dose statins should be used as first line therapy. If LDL-C levels remain
      greater than 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) then additional add on therapy on statins could be
      considered for ACS patients.

      Consented patients meeting the eligibility criteria for the EARLY trial will be randomised to
      enhanced care or standard care within 24hrs of symptom onset for MI. Patients randomised to
      enhanced care will receive alirocumab 150 mg on randomisation and then every 2 weeks during a
      7-week treatment period. All patients will receive atorvastatin 80 mg. Patients randomised to
      standard care with an LDL-C level ≥ 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) at week 4 will receive ezetimibe 10
      mg, in addition to atorvastatin 80 mg for the remaining duration of the treatment period.

      All patients will be followed up for a two-week period after completing the 7-week treatment
      period (i.e. a total of 9 weeks to assess safety).
