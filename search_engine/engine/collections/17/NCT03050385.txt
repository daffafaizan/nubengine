      stimulation during cognitive rehabilitation tasks in mild cognitive impairment or mild
      dementia patients. Potential participants are recruited by physicians' referral or
      self-entry. Informed consent by a clinical research coordinator and research physician is
      performed followed by screening. Participants who passed screening go through 10 sessions of
      active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation and are evaluated their cognitive
      function at screening, at the end, and two weeks after the intervention. For quality
      assurance, independent researcher regularly monitor and audit as participants are enrolled in
      the trial.
