      activity tracker in a credit-based Physical Activity Instructional Program on promoting
      habitual levels of physical activity (PA) in college students.

      The project was conducted in a large public university located in the mid-south region of the
      US. The university offers more than one hundred 1-credit hour PAIPs per academic semester.
      Considering the pilot nature of the study, the target PAIPs was limited to those meeting the
      following inclusion criteria: 1) PAIP with a size of 30 students that generally show an
      approximately equal gender distribution; and 2) PAIP that delivers the principles and
      practice of individually tailored habitual activity plans. The investigators randomly
      selected 14 eligible PAIPs and assigned them into intervention (k=7) and control (k=7)
      groups. The outcome measures of interests were the changes in objectively and subjectively
      measured physical activity over an academic semester.
