      samples and alveolar lavage fluid of patients with sepsis complicated with ARDS were studied
      by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem electrospray four-stage rod
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS). Aim to screen out the different
      metabolites between patients with mild and moderate/severe sepsis complicated with ARDS. HO-1
      protein, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in serum and alveolar lavage fluid were
      measured simultaneously to explore the relationship between HO-1, oxidative inflammatory
      markers and metabolic markers. In addition, a biomarker model was established to provide an
      important reference for assisting ARDS disease management and predicting the adverse outcome
      of patients with sepsis complicated with ARDS.
