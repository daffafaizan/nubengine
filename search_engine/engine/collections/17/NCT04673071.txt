    
      The objectives of this clinical trial are twofold: the effectiveness of TEA is assessed by
      comparing the changes in the seizure control and quality of life at 5 months between 2
      groups: the TEA + baseline AEDs group and the sham-TEA (STEA) + baseline AEDs group. Adverse
      events (AEs) that occur during the study will be investigated to evaluate the safety of TEA.

      This study is investigated by the following hypotheses:

        -  TEA can increase the probability of becoming seizure free.

        -  TEA can reduce the frequency and duration of seizures.

        -  TEA can improve quality of life.

        -  TEA is associated with adverse effects.

      This clinical trial will be performed as a 2-arm parallel design, randomized, controlled,
      assessor-blinded, clinical trial.
