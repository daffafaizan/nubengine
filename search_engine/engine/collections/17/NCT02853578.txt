      corticosteroid hormone with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The slow and continuous
      release of budesonide in the airways due to their esterification and their short plasma half
      life increases the selectivity of the corticosteroid to the airways, in patients with asthma,
      inhaled corticosteroids have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects, such as reducing
      the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs and inhibiting the synthesis and release of
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.
