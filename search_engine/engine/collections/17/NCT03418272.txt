      of dental decay. Another possible problem arising from this flora is the migration of the
      bacteria into the trachea causing pulmonary infections such as trachietis or pneumonia. The
      risk of developing a pulmonary infection appears to be increased in patients who have been
      intubated for a period of time (days) such as those patients ventilated in the intensive care
      unit (ICU). It has also been shown that in patients in the ICU the nature of the oral flora
      changes over time to include bacteria that are more commonly associated with the nosocomial
      pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia. We have previous demonstrated in a small pilot
      study (CYIRB2779) that the changes in the oral flora in children intubated in the ICU was
      similar to those bacteria grown from tracheal cultures ordered by the intensivist. Patients
      intubated in the ICU maybe at risk of decreased salivary flow, sedated and unable to clear
      secretions and are reliant on the bedside nurse to maintain adequate oral hygiene. Most ICU's
      have guidelines and policies to ensure that oral hygiene is appropriately cared for. They are
      also at risk for changes in the oral flora due to concomitant broad-spectrum antibiotic use
      that is common in the initial 48 hours after admission with respiratory failure.

      The second are of interest is to determine whether children who are very sick and require
      intubation and ventilation support have different bugs growing in their mouth that may
      predispose them to future infection whilst in the ICU.
