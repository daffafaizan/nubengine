      of each other as part of their treatment. Usually the drug Melphalan is used for both
      transplants.

      Bortezomib is a drug that is used for treating multiple myeloma and has been used in
      combination with melphalan for stem cell transplantation for patients with multiple myeloma.

      The purpose of this trial is to study the effects of doing 2 transplants, first using
      melphalan and second using melphalan and bortezomib. The trial is aiming to find out if
      adding the Bortezomib to the second transplant will increase the chances of staying in
      remission longer.
