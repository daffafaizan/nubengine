      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are found to have unforeseen positive lymph nodes during
      resection.

      Central tumors, even if they are smaller than 3cm (cT1), have a higher incidence of both
      intrapulmonary or hilar (N1) or ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) lymph node involvement in
      comparison to peripheral lesions.

      In a cohort of patients that underwent identical preoperative mediastinal evaluation and
      postoperative pathologic tissue examination of equal quality, nodal upstaging can be used as
      a quality indicator of oncologic thoracic surgery. Or, it can be used as an instrument to
      compare different techniques, such as thoracoscopic (VATS) versus open lung resections for
      lung cancer.

      Five papers showed a lower N1 nodal upstaging with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)
      compared to open surgery. These retrospective studies did not include tumor location.

      The investigators hypothesize that this creates a bias as surgeons might have chosen an open
      approach when the tumor was centrally located. This is in line with initial feasibility
      reports and guidelines that excluded patients with central lesions. This results in a higher
      prevalence of positive N1 nodes in patients operated with the open approach.

      Our single centre analysis showed a one in three chance of nodal upstaging in central located
      cStage-I tumors , multivariate analysis showed central location to be the only significant
      predictor for upstaging, and not the surgical technique.

      The aim of this multicentric study is to investigate risk factors for nodal upstaging,
      including tumor location, in patients with cStage-I NSCLC and validate previous findings.
