      Department, 20 unifocal and 20 multifocal breast cancer patients will be included. Tissues
      will be taken from both tumoral and normal breast tissues and they will be saved in microRNA
      later solution under -80Â°C. Then, 84 microRNA's will be studied in these tissues to see if
      they express any of these microRNA's.
