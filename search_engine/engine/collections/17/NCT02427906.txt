      can potentiate disease progression and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and
      infections. Dysbiosis or altered gut microbiota, due to decreased autochthonous or commensal
      taxa, has been found in stool and colonic mucosa in cirrhotic patients, which is in turn
      linked with disease severity and systemic inflammation.

      TIPS can decompress the hypertensive portal vein,so that the intestinal congestion can be
      decrease too. Hence we summarize that TIPS may have effect on gut microbiota and associated
      inflammatory factors in cirrhotic patients.
