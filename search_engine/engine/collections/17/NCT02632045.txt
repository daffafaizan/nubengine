      breast cancer remains incurable and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality.
      Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. This study will be evaluating estrogen
      receptor (ER) expression positivity and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positivity of breast
      cancer with the absence of over-expression or amplification of HER2.

      Inhibitors of the cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) have been developed and
      demonstrated impressive activity in patients with ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer
      with marked improvements in progression free survival. This question is asking whether CDK
      4/6 inhibition should be continued with hormone therapy in patients who will be switching
      their hormone therapy in the metastatic breast cancer setting.
