      effects of methamphetamine without producing major cardiovascular changes or toxic effects
      under controlled laboratory conditions. This goal will be accomplished using a
      methamphetamine challenge procedure in which quetiapine will be given orally prior to
      intravenous (iv) methamphetamine administration. This will allow rapid and systematic
      evaluation of the therapeutic potential of this medication.

      Results of this drug-interaction study will help determine further investigations of the
      clinical efficacy of this and other dopamine-active agents. We hypothesize that quetiapine
      will reduce the self-reported, performance and cardiovascular effects of methamphetamine.
