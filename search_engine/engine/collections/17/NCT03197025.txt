    
      Background:

        -  Vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is a premalignant epithelial
           lesion that is frequently multifocal and/or recurrent.

        -  The primary treatment is surgery, which may result in disfigurement and compromise of
           the urethra, anus, or clitoris. Recurrence after surgery is common and primarily treated
           with additional surgery.

        -  Vulvar HSIL is caused by chronic infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16
           infection. In this clinical trial the HPV-16 infection is targeted with a single
           infusion of autologous T cells that have been genetically engineered to express an
           HPV-16 E6-specific

      T cell receptor (E6 TCR T cells).

      Objective:

      -Determine the safety of E6 TCR T cells for the treatment of vulvar HSIL.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV-16+ vulvar HSIL.

        -  Expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2*02:01 allele.

        -  Measurable lesion(s) that are recurrent or cannot be resected with acceptable cosmetic
           or functional results.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old and less than or equal to 65 years old.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I clinical trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design.

        -  Subjects will receive E6 TCR T cells followed by up to two doses of aldesleukin 720,000
           IU/kg intravenous (IV).

        -  No conditioning regimen will be given, aldesleukin will be capped at a maximum of two
           doses, and E6 TCR T cell dosing will begin at dose level -1 from the previously
           determined safe dose.
