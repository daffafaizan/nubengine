      for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after major orthopedic surgery of the lower
      limbs such as hip and knee replacement surgery. Additionally, RXA is approved by Swissmedic
      to be used at a therapeutic dose for primary therapy of VTE and for prophylaxis of
      cerebrovascular events in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

      Monitoring of RXA concentration (conc.) is generally not required because of its stable
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, even in patients with renal insufficiency.
      However, there are several clinical situations, in which it may be desirable to measure the
      RXA plasma conc. The range of RXA conc. is wide among individuals with typical peak levels of
      median 244 µg/L (IQR 175-360) and trough levels of median 32 µg/L (IQR 19-60) with once daily
      doses of 20 mg RXA.

      This is an explorative laboratory study to evaluate the intra-individual variability of RXA
      conc. in time and to standardize assays among 9 Swiss laboratories to determine RXA conc.
