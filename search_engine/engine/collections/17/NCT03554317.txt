      ablative therapy with a GnRH analogue (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard, or Lupron) if they
      have not undergone orchiectomy. Following enrollment, participants will receive an
      intramuscular injection of testosterone cypionate 400mg every 4 weeks for a lead-in period of
      12 weeks. After the lead-in period, all participants will be treated with nivolumab 480mg IV
      every 4 weeks and maintained on testosterone cypionate 400mg IM every 4 weeks. Assessments
      for response to testosterone + nivolumab will be performed approximately every 3 months.
      Treatment [with a minimum drug exposure of 12 weeks] will be continued until PSA progression
      (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3] criteria) or clinical/radiographic progression
      (whichever comes first), or until unmanageable toxicity requiring drug cessation.
