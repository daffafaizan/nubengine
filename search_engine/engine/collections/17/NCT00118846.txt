      Atherosclerosis, a primary cause of heart disease, accounts for more than 485,000 heart
      attacks and 370,000 strokes each year in American women. Data indicate that a woman's risk of
      suffering from an atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular event significantly increases after
      menopause; this risk may be due to reduced estrogen production associated with menopause. Soy
      isoflavones are plant compounds that are structurally similar to human estrogen. Evidence
      suggests that soy supplements may provide the same protection against heart disease as
      estrogen in postmenopausal women. This study will determine the effects of soy supplements on
      atherosclerosis progression, cognition, bone mineral density, and breast tissue density
      changes in postmenopausal women.

      This study will last 2.5 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either soy
      supplements or placebo daily for the duration of the study.

      The active product, which will be given as two divided doses, is 25 g soy protein containing
      85 mg aglycone weight naturally-occurring isoflavones (150 mg total isoflavone), genistein 45
      mg aglycone weight (80 mg total weight), daidzein 35 mg aglycone weight (60 mg total weight)
      and glycitein 5 mg aglycone weight (10 mg total weight). Blood collection, cognitive tests,
      and mammograms will be used to assess participants at study entry, at each monthly visit, and
      at study completion.
