      corticosteroid injection (LCI) in managing mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
      About 50-60 patients with mild to moderate CTS are supposed to be randomly allocated into
      either ESWT group or LCI group. The outcomes include the visual analog scale (VAS), the
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), and nerve conduction study at baseline and at 3
      weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the treatments.
