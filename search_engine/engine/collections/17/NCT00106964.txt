      documented in the literature. Given the importance of preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      co-infection in HIV+ youth and the poor response rates in this population, this study will
      attempt to improve the immediate and long-term sero-response rates by undertaking a
      randomized, open-label trial of three hepatitis B vaccination schemas, as follows:

        1. standard adult dosing of HBV-only vaccine: Engerix-B 20 mcg at Entry, Week 4 and Week 24

        2. increased adult dosing of HBV-only vaccine: Engerix-B 40 mcg at Entry, Week 4 and Week
           24

        3. standard adult dosing of combined HBV/hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine: Twinrix 720
           enzyme immunoassay (EIA) HAV Ag plus 20 mcg HBsAg at Entry, Week 4 and Week 24.

      This study will also describe the safety of administration of an increased dose of the
      hepatitis B vaccine in this population. In general, patients undergoing dialysis who have
      received the dosing regimen recommended for immunocompromised individuals have tolerated the
      vaccine series well.

      Design: This is a stratified, block-randomized, open-label trial of three hepatitis B
      vaccination schemas in HIV-infected and HBV-uninfected youth. Once randomized, there will be
      a total of 6 study visits in a 72 week period. Vaccination will occur at Entry, Week 4 and
      Week 24. Primary sero-response will be evaluated at Week 28 and sustainability of response
      will be evaluated at Weeks 48 and 72 for those who achieve a primary antibody response of >=
      10 IU/ml. Primary non-responders (antibody response of < 10 IU/ml) will be provided with a
      booster vaccine using the increased-dose Engerix-B vaccine at Week 48 and evaluated for
      responsiveness at Week 72.
