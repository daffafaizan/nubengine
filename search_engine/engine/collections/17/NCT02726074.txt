      to monotherapy for partial onset seizures consists of 2 periods: Titration Period (12 weeks)
      and Maintenance Period (24 weeks). During the Titration Period, participants will begin
      receiving perampanel 2 milligrams per day (mg/day) and be up-titrated in no less than 2-week
      intervals in increments of 2 mg up to 12 mg according to the investigator's judgment. Upon
      entering the Maintenance Period, participants will receive the last dose they achieved at the
      end of the Titration Period and will continue receiving this dose once daily for the
      remainder of the study.
