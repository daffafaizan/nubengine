    
      DRA is a separation of the abdominal wall muscles that commonly occurs during pregnancy and
      is caused by the stretching of the linea alba to accommodate a growing fetus. Separation of
      core muscles is thought to be factor in postpartum low back pain, stress urinary
      incontinence, and core strength, as well as being cosmetically undesirable. This study will
      evaluate the effect of a core strengthening program on shortening the IRD and improving the
      connectivity and strength of abdominal wall muscles in postpartum women with a DRA. It will
      also investigate the relationship between IRD and low back pain.
