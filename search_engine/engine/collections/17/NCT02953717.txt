    
      CAR-Study B is a prospective randomized trial comparing cognitive outcome after GKRS or WBRT
      in eligible patients with 11-20 BM on a triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI-scan.
      Neuropsychological assessment will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months
      after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be combined with 3-monthly MRI-scans.

      Patients will be randomized to either GKRS or WBRT. Groups will be balanced at baseline
      (prior to radiotherapy), taking into account several (stratification) factors that may
      influence cognitive functioning over time, such as: total tumor volume in the brain, systemic
      treatment, KPS, age, histology, and baseline HVLT-R total recall score.
