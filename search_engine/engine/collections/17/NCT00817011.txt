      antidepressant is about 40% of which, and 2) The time lag is existed until the patients
      respond to antidepressant and show the treatment effects.

      If it is predicted the response of antidepressant in advance, it would be overcome such
      problems. Drug response generally is known to be related to the individual genetic
      information and the environmental factors. We are going to investigation about antidepressant
      response using these approaches.
