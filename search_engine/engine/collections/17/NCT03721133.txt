             1. Duration of Treatment: 2018/8/1~2021/7/31

             2. Recruitment: Volunteer after explaination

             3. Number of Planned Patients: 200 According to the data base of lung cancer registry
                of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou. The patients' composition of lung cancer
                was 280 in stage 1, 45 in stage 2 and 45 in stage 3, respectively. Estimated
                patient number in disease severity

             1. Stage 1: 100

             2. Stage 2: 50

             3. Stage 3: 50 4. Measurement, Estimate recruitment, and risk

                Study subject:

             1. Non small lung cancer patients

             2. Received curative intended tumor resection (ie. anatomic resection and mediastinal
                lymph node dissection)

             3. age ≧ 20 yeas old

             4. agreed to join the study after thoroughly explanations Data collection: medical
                record review and blood sampling for circulating tumor cell purification Risk: no
                increased for patients who join into the study 5. Inclusion criteria

             1. Non small cell lung cancer patients ( ≧20 years old) clinical stage I to IIIa

             2. Volunteer to join the study after thoroughly explanations 6. Exclusion criteria

             1. Small cell lung cancer component which identified in pathology

             2. Patients who presented as stage IIIb or IV

             3. Not received curative intended surgery due to multi-comorbidities

             4. Patients who presented in tumor seeding or positive resection in pathology
                confirmation

             5. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy 7. Timing of blood sampling:
                Pre-operation, discharge date, and the regular OPD surveillance date (3
                month-interval) 8. Blood sampling: 20 ml blood that withdrawal from peripheral vein
                9. Blood sampling time: less than 3 minutes 10. Sample examination: Purification
                circulating tumor cell by high sensitive tumor cell marker. Combine the medical
                record to analyze the relationship between circulating tumor cell and disease
                relapse 11. Preservation of sample: All sample would be used to purify circulating
                tumor cell as soon as possible after collected. No sample left after circulating
                tumor cell purification.
