      their disease. Each teaspoon of transfused blood contains about 5 mg of iron and the levels
      of iron in sickle cell patients increase rapidly with each transfusion. While iron is
      necessary for many bodily functions, too much iron damages blood vessels, liver, hormone
      producing glands (pancreas, pituitary and thyroid) and the heart. It is important to know how
      iron damages blood vessels because most of the problems experienced by sickle cell anemia
      patients (stroke, kidney failure, pulmonary hypertension, heart disease) result from blood
      vessel damage. In this trial, iron in the liver, pancreas, and kidney will be measured
      noninvasively by MRI while vascular function will be measured by ultrasound and tissue
      Doppler. Patients will be recruited primarily from the greater Los Angeles area, although
      patients from greater distances will be allowed to participate.
