    
      There are 4 treatment groups in the study: ABT-143 capsules 20/135 mg, ABT-143 capsules
      10/135 mg, ABT-143 5/135 mg, and simvastatin capsules 40 mg. The primary outcome measure only
      compares 2 of these groups: ABT-143 capsules 20/135 mg and the simvastatin capsules 40 mg
      groups, therefore there are only results for these 2 groups and not all 4 groups for this
      outcome measure . Secondary outcome measure (mean percent change in LDL-C comparing ABT-143
      capsules 10/135 mg to simvastatin capsules 40 mg) only compares these 2 groups: ABT-143
      capsules 10/135 mg and simvastatin capsules 40 mg, therefore there are only results for these
      2 groups and not all 4 groups for this outcome measure. Secondary outcome measure (mean
      percent change in LDL-C comparing ABT-143 capsules 5/135 mg to simvastatin capsules 40 mg)
      only compares these 2 groups: ABT-143 capsules 5/135 mg and simvastatin capsules 40 mg,
      therefore there are only results for these 2 groups and not all 4 groups for this outcome
      measure. For the other pre-specified outcome measures, median percent change in triglycerides
      from baseline to the final visit and mean percent change in HDL-C from baseline to the final
      visit for the full analysis sets, all 3 ABT-143 capsules 20/135 mg, 10/135 mg, and 5/135 mg
      groups were compared to the simvastatin capsules 40 mg group, therefore there are results for
      all 4 treatment groups for these outcome measures.
