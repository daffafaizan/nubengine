      lymphocytopenia, and a case definition was established by the CDC as a CD4 count less than
      300 cells/mL on 2 consecutive samples in a patient uninfected by HIV and with no other
      disease or treatment that might provide a reasonable alternative explanation for CD4
      lymphocytopenia. Early investigations centered on a search for a novel retrovirus, but we and
      others have not found evidence of such a retrovirus. The patients that we have seen are
      heterogeneous, and it appears likely that there will be multiple etiologies for this
      syndrome. We are currently continuing to follow subjects long term and to see new subjects in
      order to continue to characterize the clinical aspects of patients who meet the case
      definition; to determine the natural history of ICL, and to provide samples to researchers
      who are interested in investigations into the pathogenesis of ICL.
