      shown BTDs to be non-inferior to an oral codeine-paracetamol combination and
      prolonged-release tramadol, in terms of pain control as well as sleep quality. BTDs is
      registered for use in Malaysia but the scientific data on efficacy and tolerability among
      Malaysians was not available. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of BTDs among Malaysian patients.

      Patients eligible for entry into the study were adults aged ≥ 40 years who met the inclusion
      criteria and qualified from baseline screening and liver function test (LFT) assessment. The
      study excluded patients who met the exclusion criteria and failed prior the LFT assessment.
      Patients received an initial dose of 5 mg BTDs after qualifying on the baseline screening and
      LFT test. The dose could be up-titrated to a maximum of BTDs 20mg (2 X 10 mg) to achieve
      stable pain control.

      There were six visits during the three-month study period. At visit 1, patients received 5mg
      of Sovenor® as initial treatment dose. Visit 2 occurred 7 days after the first visit; visit 2
      and visit 3 were dose titration visits. Visit 4 and visit 5, were for assessment purposes.
      Primary treatment efficacy was measured during each visit with additional assessments of
      patients' sleep quality and quality of life, while physicians' and patients' treatment
      satisfaction assessed during the final visit. Safety was measured by monitoring the
      occurrence of adverse events (AEs).
