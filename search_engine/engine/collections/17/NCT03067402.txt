      after revascularization. The issue to be resolved by the trial is whether routine stress
      imaging testing (stress test with nuclear perfusion imaging) benefits patients late after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

      What are the principal research questions to be addressed?

        1. Is a strategy of routine stress imaging testing late after PCI or CABG associated with
           lower clinical event rates than a strategy of selective stress imaging testing?

        2. Is a strategy of routine stress imaging testing late after PCI or CABG associated with
           better quality of life than a strategy of selective stress imaging testing?

        3. What are the resources utilization associated with routine vs. selective stress imaging
           testing?

      What is the primary hypothesis? The primary hypothesis is that routine stress imaging testing
      late after PCI or CABG is associated with lower clinical event rates than a strategy of
      selective stress imaging testing.
