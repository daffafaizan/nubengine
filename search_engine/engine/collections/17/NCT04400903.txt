      I. To determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in patients with pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared with individuals at increased risk of developing PDAC.
      (Stage I) II. To assess the feasibility of long-term compliance using a wearable device.
      (Stage II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess compliance with using a wearable device. (Stage I and II) II. To validate
      effectiveness of virtual device training. (Stage I and II) III. To determine whether HRV is
      reduced in participants at high-risk of developing PDAC. (Stage II) IV. To characterize
      timing and occurrence of PDAC among high-risk without disease. (Stage II) V. To characterize
      timing and occurrence of PDAC among participants at high-risk of developing PDAC. (Stage II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship between changes in HRV relative to sarcopenia-related body
      composition characteristics in PDAC patients. (Stage I) II. To investigate the relationship
      between the pNN50 HRV measure and PDAC diagnosis. (Stage I and II) III. To compare changes in
      sleep biometrics among all participants. (Stage I and II) IV. To evaluate changes in
      health-related quality of life assessments among all participants. (Stage I and II) V. To
      evaluate participant satisfaction with virtual device instruction.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo HRV monitoring using an activity monitor (WHOOP) for a minimum of 5 days
      weekly for up to 1 year in patients with newly-diagnosed PDAC and up to 5 years for patients
      in high risk group.
