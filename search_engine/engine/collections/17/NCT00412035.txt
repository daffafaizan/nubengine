    
      The specific aims are to determine if BTX-A will:

        -  1a. Reduce pain post operatively and during the distraction and consolidation process,

        -  1b. Reduce the amount, frequency and duration of narcotics taken in the postoperative
           period.

        -  2. Improve the quality of life during the distraction and consolidation process.

        -  3 Decrease muscular spasm and subsequent muscle contracture during the distraction and
           consolidation process and accelerate earlier return to pre-operative mobility function
           including earlier weight bearing.

        -  4. To develop clinical practice guidelines for the interdisciplinary care of children
           undergoing limb lengthening or deformity correction.

      Methodology: A randomization process for this one time injection will be used to determine
      who will receive the BTX-A or the placebo. 150 subjects will be recruited; 75 to the BTX-A
      group and 75 to the placebo group. There will be an equal number of subjects in each group at
      each site. The medication will be injected intraoperatively into specific major muscles in
      the lower limb adjacent to the bone or soft tissue being lengthened or corrected at a dose of
      10 U/kg with a maximum of 50 U per site, not to exceed a total maximum dose of 400 units.
      Pain scores, medication dosages, range of motion and an ambulation scale will be measured
      post-operatively and during the distraction and consolidation phases.

      In addition families will be asked to complete six different questionnaires related to pain,
      quality of life and psycho-social issues at various times during the process. The children
      will receive standard nursing care and physical therapy and will be followed for three months
      after the external fixator is removed, for a total time of approximately one year.
