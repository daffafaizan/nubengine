      I. To determine the response rate to sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival of
      sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      II. To determine the safety of sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed every 3 months until 2 years from study
      entry or until disease progression.
