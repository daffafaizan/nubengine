      transplantation resulting in profound hypophosphatemia. This can lead to hemolysis,
      congestive heart failure, rhabdomyolysis. Phosphate repletion is difficult in view of the
      persistent SHPT: oral phosphate supplementation can lead to hypocalcemia, reduced 1,25-OH
      Vitamin D production, hypercalcemia and further hyperparathyroidism. In addition,
      phospho-soda has been associated with phosphate nephropathy and renal failure.

      Cinacalcet HCl is a calcimimetic agent that has recently become a standard therapy in the
      treatment of SHPT in ESRD. It suppresses PTH secretion by acting as a modulator of the
      Calcium-sensing receptor on the PTH cell, causing the PTH cell to decrease production of
      parathyroid hormone. It is a very effective agent, producing significant reduction of PTH as
      well as improvement in calcium and phosphate metabolism in the dialysis patient. The drug is
      well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Cinacalcet has also been used to control
      hypercalcemia in renal transplant patients with persistent hyperparathyroidism. Short-term
      cinacalcet given for 2 to 4 weeks has normalized serum phosphorus and decreased urinary
      phosphate wasting in renal transplant recipients with stable graft function.

      We hypothesize that Cinacalcet HCl will normalize the hypophosphatemia of early renal
      transplant by reducing the effects of PTH on the proximal renal tubular transport of
      phosphorus, thereby allowing phosphate reabsorption and decreasing urinary phosphate wasting.
