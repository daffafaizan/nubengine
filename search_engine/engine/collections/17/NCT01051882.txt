    
      This study is a single center trial to be conducted at the Department of Neurology &
      Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem in
      Israel. All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study
      enrolment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 6 months
      and patients diagnosed with progressive stage ALS disease with duration of 6-12 months.
      Overall, 24 patients will be recruited and allocated based on their ALS disease severity to 2
      treatment groups: Group A - 12 patients of early ALS disease stage and Group B - 12 patients
      of progressive ALS disease.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every 2 weeks
      during a "run in period" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the
      disease. During the "run in period" after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of
      both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow Aspiration procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be
      produced from the bone marrow aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary
      method. On the last "run in period" visit, patients of both study groups will undergo the
      treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM or IT injection to the early and progressive
      ALS patients respectively.

      After the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post
      treatment follow up period of 6 months.
