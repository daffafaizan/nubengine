      tobacco product choices based on their exposure to an educational messaging condition related
      to nicotine content in cigarettes.

      Subjects (N=40 in each group) will be given a pack of low nicotine content cigarettes (LNC;
      0.4 mg/g) and will be randomly assigned to read one of two messaging conditions on low
      nicotine cigarettes.

      Smokers will undergo a telephone screening to assess eligibility, then move on to the next
      steps of the study depending on eligibility:

        1. Virtual Zoom Screening - Completed after telephone screen: Informed consent is obtained
           and then an interview where data is collected and eligibility is further assessed.

        2. Curbside Visit - Completed after the screening and if eligible: Breath test, and if
           necessary a urine test, is performed to assess smoking levels and urine pregnancy test
           is attained (if applicable). If eligible, randomization to messaging condition occurs
           and participants provided a pack of low nicotine content cigarettes.

        3. Virtual Zoom Home Session - Completed after curbside and if eligible based on curbside:
           Surveys assessing main outcome variables assessed.

        4. Follow-up - Completed 1 week after the virtual Zoom session: Interview where assessment
           of health and product usage is assessed.

      Except for the initial telephone screening, participants will receive compensation for each
      part of the study.
