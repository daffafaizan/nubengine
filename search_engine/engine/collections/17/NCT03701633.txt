      risk factor for developing future cardiovascular disorders. Thus far, no study considered the
      postpartum physiology itself as a possible confounder. If one wishes to draw conclusions
      about future cardiovascular risk, the role of oxytocin as a confounder must be determined. In
      the current study, we aim to determine whether oxytocin, physiologically produced during
      breastfeeding, has an effect on the UtA Doppler measurements in the postpartum period.
