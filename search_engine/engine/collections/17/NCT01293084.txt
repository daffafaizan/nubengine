      Because MCC is an important airway defense mechanism, drugs that slow impairment of MCC in
      children could prove beneficial in the long-term prognosis of the disease. A few studies have
      shown that inhalation of hypertonic saline (HS) significantly improves MCC in adults with CF
      and improvement is associated with increases in pulmonary function and decreases in pulmonary
      exacerbations. Nevertheless, no studies have examined if HS improves MCC in CF children. This
      is problematic for physicians who care for CF children with normal pulmonary function, since
      it is unclear if they should treat with HS or not. This study was designed to begin to answer
      this question. Twelve children with CF (7-12 yrs; 5 males) and normal pulmonary function
      (FEV1 and FVC > 90% of predicted values) participated in a screening visit and two study
      visits. On the screening visit, children underwent an induced sputum test. On the two study
      visits, they inhaled 0.12% saline (placebo), or HS, in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over
      study. Following inhalation of placebo or HS, patients inhaled the radioisotope 99mtechnetium
      and underwent sequential imaging of their lungs with a gamma camera for 90 min and
      approximately 24 hrs later. Mucociliary clearance was quantified at 60 min (MCC60), 90 min
      (MCC90) and 24 hrs (MCC24hrs) after inhalation of the radioisotope. Between the 60 min and 90
      min measurements, children coughed 30 times.
