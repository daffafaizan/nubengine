      hypertension treatment in cluster clinics. At each stage, the main randomization will occur
      at the PHC center level. During the first 3 months (baseline period), the physicians at all
      sites will use an electronic data collection system to collect information about the
      individuals who attend the clinic. After site randomization, physicians at control sites will
      continue to deliver usual care, and physicians at intervention sites will receive training
      and support on the use of the DSS. And the DSS will recommend antihypertensive medications
      according to the assigned protocol. All individuals will be asked to attend the clinic at
      least once every 3 months.
