      three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper and full lower dentures. Each
      treatment period will consist of one day of testing with at least two days between adjacent
      treatment visits. This study will consist of four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2
      - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.
      (Participants will use Test product (denture adhesive) applied to the dentures either in a
      pattern consistent with standard application or applied to the dentures in a pattern of
      continuous strips. Participants will also use no adhesive as a control. Participants will
      cross-over between treatments so that all participants will participate in all 3 treatment
      arms. An hour after the participant has worn their denture, they will chew a portion of
      peanuts in a controlled manner. The peanuts that migrate under the denture during this
      chewing procedure will be collected, washed, dried and weighed. Participant will also answer
      a short questionnaire on the procedure and record the number of times their denture dislodged
      during the chewing procedure. The study hypothesis is that this methodology will enable
      comparisons between denture adhesives and no adhesive to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      denture adhesives at restricting food ingress under dentures during eating.
