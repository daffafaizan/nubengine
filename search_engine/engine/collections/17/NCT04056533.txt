      related to delayed immune reconstitution after transplant increasing post-transplant
      infectious complications. Approximately 60% of patients reactivated CMV infection after HAPLO
      and 15%, developed CMV disease afecting organs and causing the death of the patient in 8% of
      CMV disease cases.

      If patient and donor are eligible, it will take 1x10^9 cells from donor leukapheresis. Donor
      cells will be selected and procesed by CliniMACs PRODIGY and after 12h it will obtain 7mL of
      CMV-CTLs. It will use 6mL of CMV-CTLs to infused a dose of 1x10^5 cells/kg in our patient.
      The donor derived CMV-CTL cells will be transfused into the patients' intravenous line. The
      patients will receive the dose of CMV-CTL cells when they are sero-positive for CMV-DNA 21
      (+- 7 days) days after transplant.

      The CMV-DNA levels will be monitored weekly for at least 100 days after the transplant. If
      after the initial dose of CMV-CTL cells the patient develops a viral infection, then the
      patient will receive treatment with anti-CMV comercial drugs.
