      Specialists) network. OTIS is a non-profit organization specialised to assess exposures
      during pregnancy and dedicated to providing accurate evidence-based, clinical information to
      patients and health care professionals about exposures during pregnancy and lactation. OTIS
      is based on voluntary phone calls. Women call when they have questions and concerns about
      risks potentially associated with any kind of exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding,
      including medications, chemicals, pesticides, diseases, infections, and vaccinations.
