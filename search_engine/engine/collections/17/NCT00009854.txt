        -  Determine the extent and pattern of distribution of DNA adducts in patients with
           recurrent supratentorial malignant glioma or metastatic neoplasm to the brain treated
           with neoadjuvant intratumoral carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) followed by tumor
           resection.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this treatment regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) intratumorally under
      stereotactic guidance 45-90 minutes prior to craniotomy and tumor resection.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTI-015 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 3 or 3 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
