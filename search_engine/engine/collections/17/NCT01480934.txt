      PCO with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation in diabetic versus
      non-diabetic eyes on a long-term basis. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the
      degree of PCO after cataract surgery between diabetic and age-matched non-diabetic patients.
      This prospective, observational case control study comprised patients who underwent
      phacoemulsification .The patients were asked to return for postoperative follow-up visits at
      1 month, 1 year and 4 years.

      the digital images were analyzed for PCO .
