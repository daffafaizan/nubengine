      mis-diagnosis, late diagnosis, and failure to treat. The condition has a measurable,
      substantial impact on patient function and perceived quality of life (QOL). Recent pilot
      studies suggest that interventions that are designed to facilitate early diagnosis and
      preventive strategies have a major impact on the incidence and severity of disease burden.
      This registry is designed to prospectively capture the relevant data to document the impact
      of preemptive diagnostic and treatment strategies.
