      movement, using either negative motor imagery or Go/NoGo reaction task, on cortical
      inhibitory mechanisms. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) and silent period (SP) are two major
      cortical inhibitory mechanisms demonstrated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
      Alterations in these inhibitory mechanisms have been extensively studied in various
      situations, but the influence of voluntary inhibition has not been elucidated yet. In normal
      volunteers, therefore, we plan to determine if voluntary inhibition of movement influences
      these cortical inhibitory mechanisms. The primary outcome measures would be any changes in
      motor evoked potential (MEP) size and intracortical inhibition (ICI) parameters.
