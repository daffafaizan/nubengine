      manage pediatric obesity using both Motivational Interviewing (MI) tools and advice from
      overweight children. A novel aspect of this study is that the skills taught during the
      trainings are made so that physician can easily incorporate them into their busy practice.
      The generated findings from focus groups with obese children, merged guidelines for the
      medical management of childhood obesity, and training in specific MI tools, also make this
      study unique. Primary Objective:

      To determine which of two interventions (behavioural/education) is most effective in
      increasing discussion initiation around weight with overweight children by calculating,
      plotting, and tracking BMI, and increasing self-reported efficacy in counseling overweight
      pediatric patients. HYPOTHESIS: The behaviour change intervention will be most effective
      because it will achieve greater changes in the above mentioned behaviours that are maintained
      for 6 to 12 months. These outcomes will be influenced by counselling efficacy, frequency, and
      type of reported barriers and not physician demographics.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate current physician practices of BMI calculating, plotting and/or tracking, and
      discussion initiation with overweight pediatric patients, and the factors that influence
      these behaviours. HYPOTHESIS: Physicians do not consistently calculate, plot, and/or track
      BMI and/or discuss weight with their pediatric patients. These practices will be primarily
      influenced by physicians' characteristics, counselling efficacy, frequency and type of
      reported barriers
