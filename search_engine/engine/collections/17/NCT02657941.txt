      promote early awareness of the lifestyle (physical activity and dietary balance) of
      hospitalized adult patients who receive a psychotropic medication that may cause increased
      morbidity cardiovascular mortality through excessive weight gain and development of metabolic
      syndrome.

      Both programs have the same number of sessions of the same duration (three weekly sessions of
      one hour); the same themes are addressed (risk of weight gain and cardiovascular risks
      induced by treatments, benefits of physical activity and of a balanced diet); only the
      psycho-educational methods differ.

      These programs are for patients with serious mental illness (mainly psychotic disorders and
      mood disorders), hospitalized in one of the four adult psychiatric units of the Eastern
      Sector of the Vinatier Hospital in Bron, France. Patients are treatment-naive or already
      under psychotropic drug(s) but a new antipsychotic or mood-stabilizer must have been started
      during this hospitalization.

      Patients are included on indication of their referring physician in hospital, as soon as
      their clinical status is compatible. They are randomized to one of two therapeutic
      educational groups. The two parallel modules of psycho-education are co-managed by two nurses
      specialized in psycho-education. The study is based on a module per month for 18 months.
      Patients included will receive three individual interviews with a nurse or psychiatrist: the
      first interview before module, the second after module and the third three months after
      module.
