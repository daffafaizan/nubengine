    
      BioFIND is a two-year observational clinical study designed to discover and verify biomarkers
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). BioFIND is collecting clinical data and biospecimens, including
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in a population of 120 well-defined, moderately advanced
      PD subjects and 120 healthy controls.

      BioFIND will follow standardized data acquisition protocols to ensure that tests and
      assessments conducted at multiple sites can be pooled. Data and samples acquired from study
      participants will enable the development of a comprehensive Parkinson's database and
      biorepository, which will be available to the scientific community to conduct research on
      novel PD biomarkers.
