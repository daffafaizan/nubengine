      started in January 2017 with funding from the European Commission Horizon 2020 scheme. Turkey
      is one of the eight sites in STRENGTHS project that this study will be conducted. The main
      aim of STRENGTHS in Turkey is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of the culturally adapted psychological intervention Group Problem
      Management Plus (PM+) intervention for adult Syrian refugees in Turkey.

      Study participants (n=380) will consist of adult Syrian refugees (18 years and older) in
      Turkey with self-reported functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0 >16) and elevated psychological
      distress (K10 >15.9). Participants will be randomly allocated either to the treatment group
      who will receive five sessions of PM+ or to the enhanced care-as-usual (E-CAU) group.
      Participants in the comparison group will receive E-CAU only. The primary outcome will be the
      decrease in psychological distress from baseline to three-month post-intervention assessment,
      measured through the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25).
