    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Following a patient safety lead-in, evaluate the anti-tumor activity
      of the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) preparative regimen - TMLI,
      cyclophosphamide (Cy) and etoposide (VP-16), as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival
      (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of
      relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      II. Evaluate early and late toxicities/complications by organ and severity, and characterize
      by organ dose/dose volume, including acute/chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),
      infection, and longer-term complications (via protocol #s 07173 and 00029).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo image guided TMLI on days -9 to -5, receive etoposide intravenously
      (IV) on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2, and undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell or bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
