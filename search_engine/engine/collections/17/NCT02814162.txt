      suggested to exert anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and vascular protective. Subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH) comprises about 5% of all strokes with high mortality and permanent
      disability rates. Although many patients survive from the initial hemorrhage or rebleeding,
      they suffered from long-term delayed neurological deficits (DNDs), including stroke, delayed
      cerebral ischemia, cognitive and neuropsychological abnormalities that seriously impact
      overall function and quality of life. Ruptured cerebral aneurysms are the most common cause
      of SAH. There is growing evidence supporting APN act as a predictive factor for SAH. The
      observational study will focus on the predictive value of serum adiponectin levels in
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
