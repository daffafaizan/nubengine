      commonly used method by researchers and clinicians are spot radiography and surface
      electromyography (sEMG). Radiographs can be used for the kyphotic angle or cervical lordotic
      angle measurements. Parameters that can be studied by EMG are amplitude, timing, conduction
      velocity, fatigability and characteristic frequencies/patterns.

      The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle. This nerve arises from the
      anterior rami of three spinal nerve roots: the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves
      (C5-C7) The nerve descends through the cervicoaxillary canal behind (posterior to) the
      brachial plexus and the axillary artery and vein, resting on the outer surface of the
      serratus anterior. The Serratus anterior electromyography, the needle can be inserted into
      the muscle superficially to the fourth to sixth rib in the medial or posterior axillary line.
      The usual nerve latency time is between 2.6-4 ms.

      In this study, the results of serratus anterior muscle EMG activity and postural cervical
      angle alterations (lateral radiography) in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain will be
      compared with healthy volunteers without neck pain.
