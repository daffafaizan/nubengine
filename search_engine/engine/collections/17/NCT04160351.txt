    
      This is an open label, cross-over group, single-centre randomised controlled trial comparing
      Medium Cut Off(MCO) Dialyser with High Flux Dialyser in patients with end-stage renal disease
      on chronic haemodialysis.

      Patients who are initially on High Flux Dialyser will be randomised into either MCO Dialyser
      (modality A) or High Flux Dialyser (modality B) dialysate. The dialysate flow (QD) and blood
      flow (QB) remains unchanged throughout study period. After 12 treatments (4 weeks) a 4-weeks
      wash-out phase using High-flux dialyzers was performed to minimize carry-over-effects. After
      the 4-weeks washout phase, the modality is switched to the alternative one for 8 weeks.
