      aging demographics in the U.S., the incidence of prolapse is projected to increase to 30% or
      more for women aged 60 years and older and become of greater concern to both patients and
      physicians. The demand for gynecologic services is predicted to increase by more than 45% in
      the next ten years. Prolapse is related to childbirth, aging, defects in collagen, and smooth
      muscle structure and strength. Etiology includes intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, with
      obesity becoming an ever increasing factor in the US.

      Treatment Choice of Patients:

      Patients choose between pessary, surgery, and expectant management based on: age, prior
      prolapse surgery, preoperative pelvic pain scores, and pelvic organ prolapse severity. These
      are difficult decisions for patients.

      When it comes to choosing between destinctive interventions with subtle advantages and
      disadvantages, patients typically want to hear their physician's views of the scientific
      merits of each procedure. Informed consent becomes extremely difficult when issues of
      cost-effectiveness are at hand. Thus, the proposed project.
