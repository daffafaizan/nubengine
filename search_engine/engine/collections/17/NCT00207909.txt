      replacement therapies such as peritoneal dialysis (PD), intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), and
      continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) have been used in the management of acute renal
      failure. CVVH is becoming increasingly utilized in pediatric acute renal failure. However, in
      patients who have acute renal failure, the institution of CVVH is often followed by a
      progression to oliguria or anuria. The underlying pathophysiology of this change is unknown.
      We believe that this progression is influenced by changes in the renin-angiotensin axis,
      cytokine response, and other modifiers of renal hemodynamics. By serially measuring
      components of those systems, this study will attempt to elucidate the pathophysiology of the
      decreased urine output seen with institution of CVVH. Once this process is understood, future
      studies should focus on prevention and treatment of this complication.

      General Hypothesis

      The decrease in urine output seen after the initiation of CVVH is associated with increased
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels, increased renin activity, increased angiotensin
      II levels, increased atrial naturetic peptide (ANP) levels, increased endothelin-1 levels,
      increased arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels, and alterations of cytokine levels and
      modulators of apoptosis.
