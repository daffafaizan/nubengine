      Group 1 (n=25) were provided periodontal treatment in the form of scaling and root planing
      (SRP) plus placebo soft gelatin capsules while group 2 (n=25): patients were received SRP
      along with systemic administration of Omega 3 fatty acids. Clinical parameters and superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) activity in the gingival crevicular fluid were recorded at baseline, 3 and 6
      months after therapy. The research has been conducted between July 2014 and June 2015. By the
      end of the study period, the Omega 3 treated group was able to achieve a greater mean probing
      pocket depth reduction, mean gain in clinical attachment level, as well as greater increase
      in SOD activity (P<0.01) compared to SRP alone.
