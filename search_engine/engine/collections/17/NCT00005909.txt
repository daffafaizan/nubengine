      and destroys connective tissue and bone, creating a condition called ochronosis. Symptoms
      generally begin in the third or fourth decade and progress to incapacitating spondylosis,
      arthropathy, and fractures by the sixth to eighth decades. Cardiac valve deterioration and
      renal and prostrate calculi also occur. Diagnosis is made by measurement of gram quantities
      of urinary homogentisic acid, which turns black on alkali treatment or exposure to oxygen. In
      the body, homogentisic acid forms a characteristic blue color in the cartilage of the ear and
      brown color in the sclera of the eye. The gene for homogentisic acid oxidase was isolated in
      1996, and scores of different mutations have been defined. Only symptomatic treatment is
      available. We propose to investigate up to 200 alkaptonuric patients, particularly adults,
      during 5-day admissions, to define the disorder using current medical techniques. We will use
      our expertise in this disease to advise the population in terms of prognosis and therapy.
      Mutation analysis with correlation of genotype and phenotype, will be performed as a
      secondary goal. Finally, we will use this protocol to recruit patients into protocol
      05-HG-0076. "Long-term Clinical Trial of Nitisinone in Alkaptonuria." Nitisinone is a very
      promising drug which inhibits the formation of homogentisic acid. The present protocol does
      not include treatment with nitisinone. Instead, we will examine patients, measure baseline
      excretion of homogentisic acid on repeated 24-hour urines, and characterize the signs and
      symptoms of alkaptonuria at different ages.
