    
      This is a phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg,
      orally, once daily) in second-line (or later) patients with EGFR mutation-positive, locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have progressed following treatment with an approved
      epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent.

      If feasible, subjects will have to provide a biopsy sample for molecular testing following
      confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. A second biopsy will be
      sampled at progression on AZD9291, if feasible. Liquid biopsies will be sampled throughout
      the treatment period.

      Subjects should continue on study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or until a
      treatment discontinuation criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as
      subjects may continue to receive investigational product beyond RECIST 1.1 defined
      progression as long as they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the
      investigator.
