      patch test (APT) test at study screening. Positive responders to the APT test will enter into
      a treatment period of ten days during which all subjects will have three test compounds (CT
      327, Placebo or an active comparator) administered twice daily to three test fields marked on
      patient's back. A fourth test field will act as untreated control. A challenge with the
      relevant aeroallergen to which the subject is responding most strongly, as assessed at
      screening, will take place on Day 10. Readings of APT scores will be performed at 48 and 72
      hrs after the challenge and the subjects will have a end-of-study visit 2 weeks later. Local
      and systemic tolerance of CT327 will be assessed during the study, in addition to its
      potential absorption into the systemic circulation. The effects of CT327 on modulating the
      immune response to aeroallergens and on the expression of immunological and inflammatory
      markers on biopsies of the treated areas will also be evaluated.
