      investigators will apply low amplitude (5%) TPMS to improve blood flow, then high amplitude
      (30-50%) to strengthen pelvic muscles. The treatment regimen will involve two 20-minute
      sessions/visit and 2 -visits per week for 12-weeks (final monitoring at 24 weeks). TPMS will
      be administered by a trained clinical coordinator under the supervision of a urologist.
      Symptom scores and hemodynamic changes will be evaluated monthly. MRI for assessing muscle
      thickness will be performed in the beginning (before TPMS) and at the end (after TPMS) of the
      study. The investigators will assess functional improvements using symptom scores.
      Morphological changes will be determined by MRI.
