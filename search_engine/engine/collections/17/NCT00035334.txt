      ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease), chronic infection (tuberculosis,
      osteomyelitis), and Familial Mediterranean Fever. Rheumatoid arthritis is the major cause of
      AA amyloidosis in Western Europe and North America. The most common clinical feature of AA
      amyloidosis is renal dysfunction manifested as nephrotic-range proteinuria or renal
      insufficiency at the time of diagnosis. End-stage renal failure is the cause of death in
      40-60% of cases. Gastrointestinal involvement is also frequent and is usually manifested as
      chronic diarrhea, body weight loss and malabsorption. Enlargement of the liver and spleen may
      also occur in some patients. The median survival time from diagnosis varies from 2 to 8 years
      depending on the stage of the disease at time of diagnosis. The goal of the current therapy
      in AA amyloidosis is the control of the associated disease. However, the current approaches
      for the treatment of AA amyloidosis are unspecific, toxic, invasive, and not sufficiently
      effective in many cases. NC-503 was specifically designed to compete with the naturally
      occurring sulfated GAGs for the binding to amyloidogenic precursor proteins, and to inhibit
      amyloid deposition into tissues. The proposed therapy with NC-503 is based on the prevention
      of the amyloid fibril formation. The objective of this clinical phase II/III study is to
      determine the efficacy and safety of NC-503 compared to a placebo in patients suffering from
      secondary (AA) amyloidosis by the assessment of clinical improvement/ worsening of both renal
      and gastrointestinal functions.
