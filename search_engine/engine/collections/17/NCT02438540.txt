      according to above mentioned method of randomization by independent research assistant. In
      the case group enrolled participants were treated with Metformin monotherapy and received
      electro acupuncture (EA) and Auricular acupuncture at the selected acupoints, and
      participants in a control group were treated with Metformin monotherapy and received sham EA.
      All patients were blinded to treatment assignment during the period of study and assessor was
      blinded to name of the patients and results as well. IR was calculated by the homeostasis
      model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) proposed by Matthews et al. HOMA-IR =
      (fasting insulin (mmol/L) × fasting glucose (µIU/ml))/22.5; body height was measured to an
      accuracy of +/-0.1cm; body weight was measured while the subjects were dressed in light
      clothing after an overnight fasting by standard scale to an accuracy of +/-0.1 kg; The body
      mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) into height (squared m²). Blood
      markers including fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin (FINS), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      tumor necrosis α (TNFα), C reactive protein (CRP), leptin, adiponectin, resistin,
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), HOMA index , free fatty acid (FFAs), low density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDLc), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) , and ceramides; were
      calculated by measuring them after drawing 10 ml of blood from cubital vein in each patient
      after 8 hours overnight fasting, before treatment, and for FBS, FINS and HOMA index 30 min
      after treatment additionally, 3 times during the study (in the beginning, in the 5th time and
      at the end) from both groups, with the chosen for this research standard range. All data with
      standard range were managed by Epi-data software, then analyzed by Statistical Package for
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) software 15.0.0 (6 Sep 2006). The investigators statistics method
      included T-test and repeated measures ANOVA. P-Value<0.05 was statistically significant in
      this trial
