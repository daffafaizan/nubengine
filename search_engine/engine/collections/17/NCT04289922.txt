      already been developed and used as a measurement tool in research on English speaking Greater
      trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) populations.

      The aim of this study is to translate, cross-cultural adapt and validate the Norwegian VISA-G
      (VISA-N-G) questionnaire.

      The translation of the original VISA-G into Norwegian has been done following the official
      guidelines.

      The patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation, Oslo University Hospital and will follow the ordinary patient
      care.

      After given written consent, patients will be asked to fill out the following Norwegian
      questionnaires: VISA-N-G, Harris Hip Score (HHS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and a
      numeric rating scale (NRS) for assessment of pain intensity. The aforementioned
      questionnaires will be used to test the construct validity with various hypothesis at
      baseline. Within one week the investigators will ask the patients to fill out the VISA-N-G
      once more to test the test-retest reliability.

      To investigate responsiveness the patient will be asked to fill out the VISA-N-G together
      With HHS, ODI, NRS and a 11-Point Global Rating of Change scale (GROC) after seven weeks.
      Responsiveness will be tested with various hypothesis and measured by the area under the
      receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC).
