      undergo percutaneous aspiration or percutaneous biopsy or RF ablation utilizing the
      ActiSightâ„¢ Needle Guidance system using CT to guide the needle. Subjects will be followed-up
      for at least one hour at the clinic for safety and preliminary accuracy evaluations. An erect
      chest radiograph will be performed within 90 minutes of observation after chest aspiration if
      performed to detect the majority of post procedure pneumothoraces for biopsies in the chest.
      Post procedural CT will be performed according to the physician's consideration. ** Note **
      If any complications are observed while using the ActiSight System, the investigator will
      revert to using standard procedure.
