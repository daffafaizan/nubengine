      supplementation on oxidative status, on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and on the
      microbiota of premature infants with or without sepsis. Clarification of these additional
      questions is essential for a better understanding of the benefits and implications of enteral
      administration of Lf in preterm infants. The enteral administration of lactoferrin reduces
      the incidence of late sepsis in preterm infants of very low birth weight (BMPN). Enteral
      supplementation with lactoferrin in NBWNS can have a beneficial effect on the systemic
      oxidative and inflammatory state, and may contribute to the creation of a healthy faecal
      microbiota.
