    
      This is a Phase II/III randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in i) hospitalized adult patients with high-risk of
      progression SARS-CoV-2 infection and ii) patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

      Compatible ABO plasma from convalescent patients will be administered at a dose of 400 ml
      divided into two doses intravenously. Outcomes will be measured as follows:

      * Group of patients with critical illness:

      Primary outcomes (Effectiveness and safety):

        -  Mortality

        -  Safety: Presence of adverse events

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Intensive care unit length of stay

        -  Evolution of clinical and paraclinical aspects.

             -  Group of patients at high risk of progression:

      Primary outcomes (Effectiveness and safety):

        -  Mortality

        -  Safety: Presence of adverse events

        -  Admission to ICU in 30 days

        -  Mechanical ventilation requirement

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Hospital/Intensive care unit length of stay

        -  Evolution of clinical and paraclinical aspects.
