      intramuscular injection of autologous bone marrow cell concentrate (aBMC) into the afflicted
      lower index limb.

      Bone marrow will be collected bilaterally from the patient's iliac crests using the
      SurgWerks-CLI Kit aspiration trocar under local anesthesia with mild to moderate sedation or
      general anesthesia, processed through the VXP System device to yield a rich cell and plasma
      concentrate ("aBMC"). Additionally, 10 mL of autologous peripheral blood will be aspirated
      for the placebo preparation.

      The Treatment Arm will receive the aBMC, which will be intramuscularly injected at multiple
      mapped sites/angiosomes into the ischemic index limb using the SurgWerks-CLI Kit supplied
      Therapeutic Infusion Needles and standard hypodermic needles. The procedure will be performed
      in a surgical suite and will take approximately 1.5-2.0 hours to complete. The subjects will
      be observed for 24 hours following the procedure for observation and control as necessary of
      post-operative pain, bleeding, and infection.

      Placebo Arm subjects will undergo an intra-operative point of care aspiration and preparation
      of bone marrow via the investigational device exactly as the Treatment Arm. However, instead
      of receiving the dosing with the aBMC device output, they will receive an intramuscular
      injection of diluted autologous peripheral blood into the afflicted lower index limb.

      At pre-specified follow-up intervals, all subjects in each arm will be evaluated for:

        -  Major limb amputation free survival

        -  Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)

        -  Wound healing: Quantitative evaluation of wound(s)

        -  Quality of life assessment (VascuQoL and SF-36)

        -  Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) - Quantitative evaluation of blood flow

        -  Rest pain assessment

        -  Brachial Index (ABI)
