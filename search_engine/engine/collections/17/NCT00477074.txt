      recently and is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate potential abnormalities
      of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in patients with COPD.

      Methods: To this end, we compared the levels of HGF and KGF, measured by ELISA, in
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and in serum in 18 patients with COPD (62 ± 2 yrs, FEV1 57
      ± 4% ref, X ± SEM), 18 smokers with normal lung function (58 ± 2 yrs., FEV1 90 ± 4% ref) and
      8 never smokers (67 ± 7 yrs, 94 ± 4% ref).

      Results: We found that, in BAL, HGF levels were higher in patients with COPD than in the
      other two groups whereas, in serum, HGF concentration was highest in smokers with normal lung
      function (p<0.01). KGF levels were not significantly different between groups, neither in
      blood nor in BAL, (most values were below the detection limit).

      Conclusions: These results highlight a different response of HGF in BAL and serum in smokers
      with and without COPD that may be relevant for tissue repair in COPD.
