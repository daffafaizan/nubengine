      multiple dose escalation trial.

      The trial consists of 6 drug dose groups, which are 50mg/m2, 75mg/m2, 100mg/m2, 125mg/m2,
      150mg/m2 and 180mg/m2 respectively. At each testing dose group, one patient will be treated
      with HCl-Irinotecan (CPT-11), at dose level of 175mg/m2.

      The initial dose of 50mg /m2 will be administered once. Starting from the 75mg/m2 dose group,
      each patient will be given testing drug at least twice. During first and second drug
      administration, blood samples will be collected for PK characteristics analysis. Patients
      will be evaluated after every two rounds of drug delivery and preliminary efficacy of testing
      compound will be determined as PD, SD, CR etc.
