      and noninvasive testing. The initial clinical manifestations of dilated heart failure are
      generally those of respiratory distress secondary to congestion of the pulmonary and systemic
      venous circulations.

      Pallor, irritability, diaphoresis, tachypnea, easy fatigability are characteristics.

      Failure to grow may also occur. In older patients, a history of orthopnea, nocturnal cough,
      and dyspnea provoked by minimal activity can be elicited and generally precede evidence of
      systemic venous congestion. In rapidly progressive disease, dominant symptoms are often
      abdominal distention, right upper quadrant pain, and nausea. Less often, initial symptoms in
      childhood include arrhythmias, syncope, neurologic problems (seizures or delayed
      development), vomiting, abdominal distention, or fever.

      Although as many as fifty percent of children with cardiomyopathy and heart failure give a
      history of a nonspecific febrile illness within three months of presentation, no evidence of
      myocarditis can usually be found on biopsy.'Physical signs vary with the stage of the
      disease.

      Signs of congestive heart failure are frequent, and include tachypnea,tachycardia,
      diaphoresis, hepatomegaly, pallor, and, in advanced cases, hypotension and shock.

      Failure to thrive may be present if, heart failure has been long standing. Patients are
      generally not cyanotic. Wheezing may be heard; however, rales are infrequent, especially in
      infants.

      Neck vein distension is common, the external jugular crest reflecting mean right atrial
      pressure, the internal jugular exhibiting a prominent V wave indicative of tricuspid
      regurgitation.
