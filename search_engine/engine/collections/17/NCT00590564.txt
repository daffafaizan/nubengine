      cirrhosis and approximately 5% will progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment for
      chronic hepatitis C is limited to interferon-based therapy. Many patients decline or cannot
      tolerate interferon because of its serious side effects. Sho-saiko-to, an Asian herbal
      medicine consisting of seven botanicals, has demonstrated anti-fibrotic affect by inhibition
      of lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes and stellate cells in an animal study. It has also been
      demonstrated to prevent progression of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma in human trials.
      This study is a single arm, single center trial of Sho-saiko-to in patients with chronic
      active hepatitis from hepatitis C infection who cannot tolerate or who have specific
      contraindications to interferon therapy. Patients will receive 52 weeks therapy with
      Sho-saiko-to. Outcome will be assessed by comparing pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies.
      Patients will be said to respond if they have an improvement of two points or greater on a
      standard measure of liver histology. If five or more of 25 evaluable patients respond,
      Sho-saiko-to will be deemed worthy of further testing.
