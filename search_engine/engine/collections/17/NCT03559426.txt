    
      The RADAR trial is a randomised controlled trial that will compare a flexible and gradual
      strategy of antipsychotic reduction and possible discontinuation with maintenance
      antipsychotic treatment in people with schizophrenia or who have recurrent psychotic
      episodes. In the reduction group, a guideline reduction schedule will be devised by the
      research team for each participant taking into account starting dose and number of
      antipsychotics prescribed. This may be adjusted by treating clinicians in discussion with
      participants. Antipsychotics will be discontinued in cases where reduction progresses well.
      The reduction schedule will be flexible, and will include guidance on monitoring and treating
      symptoms and signs of early relapse.

      Participants will be individually randomised to the two treatment strategies, which will be
      administered by treating clinicians. They will be followed up for two years. The primary
      outcome is social functioning, and secondary outcomes include relapse, symptoms, side
      effects, employment and medication adherence.
