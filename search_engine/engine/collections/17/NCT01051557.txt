    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus in combination with perifosine in
      patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma who are not taking enzyme-inducing
      anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). (Phase I) II. Determine the efficacy of temsirolimus in
      combination with perifosine in patients with recurrent/progressive glioblastomas (GBMs) not
      taking EIAEDs as measured by 6 month progression-free survival (6mPFS) and radiographic
      response rates. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the safety profile of perifosine and temsirolimus. II. Estimate median
      overall and progression-free survival. III. Explore the association of pre-treatment
      molecular phenotype with response to treatment.

      IV. Explore molecular effects during treatment including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
      (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6
      kinase (S6K) and rat sarcoma (RAS)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
      (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of temsirolimus, followed by a phase II
      study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 and perifosine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive temsirolimus and perifosine as in phase I. Some patients may also
      undergo cytoreductive surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.
