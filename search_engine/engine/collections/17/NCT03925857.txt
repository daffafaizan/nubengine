      The product contains allogeneic mononuclear enriched cells in the form of a liquid suspension
      with at least 40% early apoptotic cells. The study drug, Allocetra-OTS, is based on the known
      activity of apoptotic cells to contribute to maintenance of peripheral immune homeostasis. As
      altered immune response is associated with organ dysfunction in sepsis, the possibility is
      being tested that the study drug can improve the condition of sepsis.
