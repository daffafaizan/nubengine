      clinic on health related quality of life, for persons with AF. Secondary outcomes are effects
      on anxiety, depression, illness perception, symtom burden, life style and health economics.

      We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing person centred nurse led care vs. standard
      care. A sample size of 100 persons per group will be recruited.

      Data will be collected through questionnaires, medical records, interviews.
