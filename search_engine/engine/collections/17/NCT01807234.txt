    
      Participants are randomized to Ketorolac NS 31.5 mg, Sumatriptan NS 20 mg or placebo to treat
      three moderate to severe migraine attacks and switched treatments with each attack so that
      they received each treatment only once.

      For each treated attack (moderate to severe migraine attack), participants utilized two study
      treatments (A and B). Study treatment A administered as one spray in each nostril, and study
      treatment B administered as one spray in one nostril.
