      errors during anesthesia. These measures were learned to the entire anesthesia team (nurse,
      resident and anesthesiologist) during conventional meetings. An initial evaluation of the
      application of these measures will be carried out before the introduction of e-learning. This
      assessment will be conducted by nurses without the knowledge of the anesthetic team
      evaluated. After this initial evaluation, e-learning will be broadcast on the hospital
      intranet. Then a second evaluation of the application of the preventive measures will be
      carried out 6 month and 1 year after the introduction of e-learning.
