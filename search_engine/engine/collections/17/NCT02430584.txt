    
      This sample collection protocol allows for the identification, recruitment, and participation
      in women who are pregnant and are known to:

        1. be at an increased risk for fetal genetic abnormalities

        2. be at increased risk for congenital fetal infection by virtue of being positive by
           initial screening tests, or are known to have an active infection during this pregnancy.

        3. possess irregular blood group antigens (the subject or the father of the baby) and are
           therefore at increased risk for fetal sensitization during this pregnancy.
