    
      The LC-FAOD DMP is a global observational long-term prospective outcomes study aiming to
      collect information for up to 10 years from adult and pediatric patients with LC-FAOD,
      regardless of disease management, including treatment with triheptanoin, and those who have
      previously participated in triheptanoin clinical trials or Expanded Access Program (EAP).

      Patients enrolling in the LC-FAOD DMP will be managed at the discretion of their physicians
      and may or may not be treated with triheptanoin during the course of the study. Patients will
      only have access to triheptanoin through authorized commercial use (if approved in their
      country) or available EAP but not from the LC-FAOD DMP itself.
