      submental or "off the face" (abdomen, or arms, or thighs, or Décolleté) treatments (per PI
      discretion, 2-12 weeks apart) using the Sofwave System. In arm 1, each investigational site
      would treat the full face and/or neck and/or submental zones including 1. -The forehead and
      temples (left and right including the peri orbital zone) to lift the eyebrows 2. The cheeks
      (left and right including perioral zone and nasolabial folds) 3. Submental and sides of the
      neck (left and right) to lift lax skin. In arm 2, each site would treat "off the face" areas:
      abdomen, or arms or thighs or Décolleté. Each patient could be assigned to both arms.
      Treatment may be administered after the enrollment and screening at the first visit or it may
      occur at a later date following the enrollment and screening activities based on site
      scheduling availabilities. All patients will return to the clinic for one follow up visitat3
      months ± 2 weeks post last treatment (FU1) and a second optional visit at 2. 6 months ± 2
      weeks post last treatment (FU2; optional). Each treatment visit will also serve as a follow
