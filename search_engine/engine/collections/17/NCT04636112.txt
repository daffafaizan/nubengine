      considered as a healthy lifestyle in Chinese population. The current study aimed to examine
      the effects of sleep habits on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk and severity of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in Chinese population from two centers. A total of 873 patients
      including 314 with AMI were recruited from the inpatient cardiology department of the
      Affiliated Jiangning Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical
      University. 559 controls included 395 CAD cases and 164 non-CAD cases. Investigators used a
      17-item sleep factors questionnaire (SFQ) to evaluate sleep habits comprehensively by
      face-to-face interview. The severity of CAD was assessed by Gensini score in AMI and CAD
      groups. The effects of sleep factors on AMI risk and Gensini score were examined by
      unconditional logistic regression. The timing of sleep (24:00 and after), sleep duration
      (<6h) and frequency of night-time waking (3 times) increased the risk of AMI. In subjects
      with age â‰¤60 years, daytime napping reduced the risk of AMI. The correlation between sleep
      quality and AMI became insignificant after subgroup analysis by age. Short sleep duration
      also increased the risk of high Gensini score.
