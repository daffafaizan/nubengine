      protein and other glycoproteins in biological substrates, which shown to in increase
      macrophages phagocytic and antigen processing activity without promoting proinflammatory
      profile on macrophages. Bovine colostrum is substrate MAF capsules and bovine whey for M
      capsules. Enteric capsules formulation of investigational dietary supplements targeting gut
      mucosa and its associated natural anti-inflammatory macrophages profile. The SaiseiCovUKR
      clinical study is multicentric, randomize, open-label in hospitalized with moderate and
      severe COVID-19 participants to provide data on the activity and safety of MAF capsules and M
      capsules in the target population after 14 days of dosing. The trial will use an adaptive
      design based on pre-specified criteria, using an independent external Data Monitoring
      Committee (DMC) to monitor safety, efficacy, and review data at appropriate intervals. The
      general objectives of the study are to obtain preliminary indication of activity of MAF
      capsules and M capsules on shortening time to the recovery and decreasing mortality in the
      target population (600 patients, age â‰¥ 18 years). The study results can provide a background
      for further investigation of studied dietary supplements as new drugs in COVID-19.
