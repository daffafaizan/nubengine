      children is the commonest reason for admission to hospital. At present, there are no
      objective measurements of the degree of breathing difficulty.

      This is because current objective tests of breathing difficulty requires the patient to
      cooperate and actively perform the tests. This is not possible in babies and very challenging
      in young children. SLP is a noncontact, effort independent technique for measuring the rate
      of breathing, the amount of chest expansion and the relative contribution of chest and
      abdomen to the work of breathing. Measuring these parameters which are known to vary with
      increasing breathing difficulty will allow us to make objective assessments of breathing
      difficulty. This study proposes to validate this technique in babies aged 02 years who are
      healthy and in babies with clinical viral bronchiolitis. The Investigators intend to
      demonstrate that the technique is feasible in this young age group and that the investigators
      will be able to demonstrate clinically valid differences between normal and ill babies and
      also demonstrate measurable differences with the evolution of the clinical illness.
