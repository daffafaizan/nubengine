      promote positive health behaviors among young adult women. It will be one of the first to
      intentionally execute a prevention program targeting well-established risk factors for both
      obesity and eating disorders in this high-risk population. Intervention content focuses on
      promoting body size diversity and emphasizing positive health and behavior change in order to
      reduce stigmatization and remain sensitive to weight-related issues. The manual was developed
      by integrating two successful existing prevention programs and expanding on previous
      prevention efforts. Specifically, the diversity of beauty ideals were highlighted to enhance
      relevance among ethnic minority women, and distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills
      training were included to target the maladaptive coping mechanisms young adults use to manage
      the stress associated with transitioning to college.
