      hypoxia in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome impair quality of life, cognitive
      and cardiovascular functions. Similar consequences occur in healthy subjects exposed to
      hypoxia at altitude due to periodic breathing with recurrent central apnea. This project will
      investigate effects of altitude on sleep, breathing, psychomotor performance and on the
      cardiovascular system in healthy subjects and patients with sleep apnea. The results will
      help to better understand mechanisms of sleep disturbances and psychomotor impairment induced
      by hypoxia and to prevent adverse effects of altitude exposure.
