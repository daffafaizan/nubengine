      same unit increase in MAP adjusted for baseline and 2) RV function assessed by GLS, between
      VP and NE in patients with normal and increased pulmonary artery pressure, who require
      vasopressor support during cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that the use of vasopressin
      compared with norepinephrine induces a lower mPAP-to-MAP ratio, in cardiac surgical patients
      with and without pulmonary hypertension who require intraoperative vasopressor support.
      Second, we will test the hypothesis that vasopressin is associated with improved right
      ventricular global longitudinal strain compared to norepinephrine in patients requiring
      vasopressor support during cardiac surgery.
