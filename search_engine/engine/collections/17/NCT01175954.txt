      arising from one particular part of the brain) whose seizures have not been controlled. If
      they consent to the study, they will be followed for 4 weeks to get a baseline seizure
      frequency. The patients will take a battery of tests assessing attention, memory, cognitive
      speed, and language, and fill out some inventories to assess their mood and quality of life.
      They will then receive a new anti-epileptic drug, lacosamide, to add to whatever epilepsy
      medications they are currently taking. They will be closely followed for 24 weeks with
      regular doctor's visits to monitor their physical health and seizure control, and will
      complete an inventory assessing the frequency and severity of their seizures. During that
      period of time, the other medication will remain unchanged. At the end of the 24-week period
      they will re-take the battery of cognitive tests and mood and quality of life inventories.
      The cognitive, mood, and quality of life variables will be analyzed to determine if they
      change for the better or worse after the course of lacosamide treatment. Any changes will
      also be analyzed with respect to seizure frequency and severity and to adverse events or side
      effects from the addition of the lacosamide, as well as to lacosamide dosage. The
      investigators chose this design since it closely represents what the investigators do in
      clinical practice.
