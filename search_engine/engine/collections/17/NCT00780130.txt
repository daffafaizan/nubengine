      performance with the McGill Side Bridge test and core joint position error, this study is
      designed as a pilot. The subject's core stability will be measured with the SPARQtm method of
      athletic performance and the McGill Side Bridge test for core stability. Core proprioception
      will be determined using the standard test for proprioception, Joint Position Error (JPE)
      testing, with the Skill Technologies motion capture device. All participants will receive the
      SPARQtm method of athletic performance testing, the McGill Side Bridge test for core
      stability and the core joint position error tests twice, one week apart.
