      to be caused by an energy defect because of a genetic defect in the mitochondrial DNA.

      The investigators have analyzed a few MRI scans of muscles from patients with CPEO and have
      seen an extended amount of fat in their muscles, which seems to progress with age. The
      patient's symptoms might be caused by the extended amount of fat and thereby a less amount of
      active muscle instead of the "energy defect".

      This will be investigated in a group of patients with CPEO and the results will be compared
      with results from a group of healthy controls.
