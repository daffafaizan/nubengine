      by KIDNEY therapy system in patients with cast nephropathy, dialysis dependent renal failure
      and de novo multiple myeloma. Recruitment commenced in July 2014, in total 20 patients will
      be recruited. Participants will be treated with, KIDNEY therapy system (Bellco Mirandola,
      Modena, Italy) . The KIDNEY system is a kind of haemodiafiltration that utilizes separated
      convection, diffusion and adsorption. The sorbent cartridge has a high affinity for FLC (both
      κ and λ) but is able to re-infuse albumin, avoiding the need for albumin perfusions. The
      KIDNEY therapy will be undertaken over an intensive treatment schedule. The primary outcome
      for the study is independence of dialysis in 3 month. Secondary outcomes are: duration
      dialysis, reduction of serum FLC levels, myeloma response and survival.
