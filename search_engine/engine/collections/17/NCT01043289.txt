      higher risk for prenatal complications, preterm delivery, a higher rate of surgical birth and
      vaginal operative delivery. Depressed pregnant women are at risk for inadequate nutrition,
      poor weight gain, increased use of nicotine, drugs and alcohol, and failure to obtain
      adequate prenatal care, as well as poor mother-child attachment. Their infants have a higher
      risk for low birth weight, a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive care, and
      cognitive, emotional and behavioural disturbances.Treatment of antepartum depression requires
      careful judgement to minimise risk to the foetus. Pharmacological treatment is an option, but
      all antidepressants cross the placenta, and both practitioners and patients are concerned
      about possible teratogenicity, pre- and perinatal adverse effects for the infant, as well as
      negative effects on long-term development. Thus, psychiatric medication use for depression in
      pregnancy may also pose an excess risk of preterm delivery and withdrawal symptoms in the
      newborn. Treatment of depression during pregnancy that is efficacious, reliable, safe, and
      with minor side effects is an urgent unmet clinical need. Light therapy may provide this
      somatic, non-pharmaceutical alternative. It is well established as the treatment of choice
      for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and there is a growing data base for response in
      nonseasonal major depression. Two promising pilot studies led to the present randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5 weeks daily morning bright light therapy (1h,
      7000 lux white) compared with low-intensity placebo light therapy (1h, 70 lux red).
