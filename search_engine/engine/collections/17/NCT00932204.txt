      by repetitive, intrusive thoughts and time-consuming behavioral or mental acts. Many OCD
      patients who do not respond to conventional treatments experience severe distress and
      disruptions in their daily activities. Novel approaches including psychopharmacological
      therapy and surgical techniques for treatment-resistant OCD have been proposed. With recent
      advances in non-invasive technique for stimulating the cerebral cortex, repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic
      approach for various psychiatric illnesses including OCD.

      Because of contradictory findings and a lack of controlled trials in OCD, rTMS cannot be yet
      recommended as routine therapy for OCD. However, it may have a potential clinical effect as a
      putative add-on treatment for OCD and an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant OCD.

      For useful clinical applications, it is very important to develop methods to enhance the
      efficacy of rTMS. There are a number of putative ways to do this, and one of them is
      sequentially combining two forms of stimulation which are considered to have potential
      therapeutic effects. More recently, the sequential application of two stimulation regimens
      (high-frequency left-side rTMS and low-frequency right-side rTMS to the prefrontal cortex)
      has been found to have a substantial therapeutic effect in patients with treatment-resistant
      major depression. Therefore, the investigation for a sequentially combining effect of both
      the right prefrontal and the SMA stimulation would be worthwhile in OCD patients.
