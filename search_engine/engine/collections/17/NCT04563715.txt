      tested regularly. The study will evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to promote regular
      HIV testing and prevention (risk reduction and PrEP awareness and referrals) among friendship
      networks of Latino men who have sex with men and transwomen (LMSMT) in three midsized
      Midwestern cities. The intervention uses the relationships that permeate networks of LMSMT by
      training well-positioned members to encourage a collective response to the epidemic and to
      disseminate HIV testing and prevention messages and resources within the network. Thus, we
      will (a) recruit 36 friendship networks of LMSMT in Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Indianapolis (N
      â‰ˆ 432); (b) test them for HIV and recommend that they test regularly; (c) invite key members
      of 18 randomly selected networks to a 4-session training to promote regular HIV testing and
      prevention in their networks; (d) conduct chart reviews to verify regular testing and PrEP
      visits and assess regular testing, PrEP visits, and risk behavior and mediators at 6, 12 and
      18-month follow up.
