      who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will
      receive an investigational Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (EV ICD)
      system, in which a lead is placed outside of the heart and veins to deliver defibrillation
      therapy. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months following system implantation.
