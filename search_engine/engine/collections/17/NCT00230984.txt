      and nutritional depletion

      State of the art :

      The IRAD2 trial is evaluating a 3-month home intervention which includes education, oral
      supplements, exercise and androgenic steroids in undernourished patients with chronic
      respiratory failure. The main objective is to increase the six-minute walking distance by
      more than 50 m with an improvement in health-related quality-of-life. Secondary end-points
      include a reduction in exacerbation rates by 25%, a reduction in health-related costs and an
      increase in survival during the year following intervention.

      Material and methods :

      This interventional, multi-centre, prospective, two-armed parallel, controlled trial is being
      conducted in 200 patients. In both groups, "Control" and "Rehabilitation", 7 home visits are
      scheduled during the 3-month intervention for education purpose. In the "Rehabilitation"
      group, patients will receive 160 mg/d of oral testosterone undecanoate in men, 80 mg/d in
      women, oral dietary supplements (563 kcal/d) and exercises on an ergometric bicycle 3 to 5
      times a week.

      Expected results :

      In the event of significant responses to intervention, this trial would validate a
      comprehensive and global home-care for undernourished patients with chronic respiratory
      failure combining therapeutic education, oral supplements, androgenic substitution and
      physical activity.
