      gel or placebo the day prior to participating in the study. The day of the study,
      participants will provide saliva samples throughout the study to track testosterone and
      cortisol levels. Participants will be asked to complete the Trier Social Stressor Task, which
      includes having to give a 5 minute speech to a panel of judges. Participants will be given
      the opportunity to postpone giving their speech to an unspecified date. The study will focus
      on two types of responses to the threat of public speaking: behavioral and physiological. The
      behavior of interest will be participants desire to postpone dealing with the threat (it is
      hypothesized that those in the testosterone administration group will have an increased
      desire to postpone). The physiological responses include increased levels of cortisol and
      increased cardiovascular tone (it is hypothesized that the testosterone administration group
      will show an increased physiological response compared to the placebo group).
