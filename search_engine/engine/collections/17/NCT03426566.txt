    
      The abnormal plantar pressure distribution (APD) plays a key role in the formation of plantar
      calluses which are responsible for diabetic foot ulcer.

      The knowledge of APD is necessary to plan proper prevention in the group of patients with
      diabetes mellitus (DM).

      Medical records from previous patients' visits of non-ulcer patients with diabetes were
      retrospectively analysed. The relationship between APD, obtained during a pedobarographic
      test as a semi-quantitative assessment with colourful print analysis, and neuropathy, gender,
      age and BMI was searched.
