      hypertrophic scar characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to ascertain the effects ESWT on
      burn scars. The investigators retrospectively reviewed burn patients who had undergone
      autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) with same artificial dermis between January
      2012 and September 2019. The ESWT group (n=17) received shock waves with low-energy flux
      density (0.05-0.30 mJ/mm2). The interval between treatments is a 1-week. The ESWT group also
      received standard treatment. The control group (n=18) only received standard treatment. We
      reviewed skin characteristics before and after 6 treatment sessions for both groups. The
      investigators checked skin charateristics(erythema, transepidermal water loss, sebum level,
      and elasticity). The investigators expect that ESWT is effective for significantly improving
      burn-associated scar characteristics and may be used for managing burn patients.
