    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a chemokine-modulatory regimen on the immune microenvironment
      of colorectal liver metastases, specifically the changes in the ratio between cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) marker (CD8a gene expression) to regulatory T cell (Treg) markers (FoxP3
      gene expression).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the objective response rate of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in metastatic
      colorectal cancer (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).

      II. Examine the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b (interferon alpha-2b), rintatolimod, and celecoxib when given as chemokine modulation
      to colorectal cancer patients prior to surgical resection using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
      Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE version 4.0).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the median progression free survival of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in
           metastatic colorectal cancer

        -  Estimate overall survival in participants with recurrent and/or metastatic unresectable
           colorectal cancer who received the chemokine-modulatory regimen

        -  Comparison (using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence [IF] and immunohistochemistry [IHC] on
           serial sections) of the metastatic tissue specimen with regard to total numbers of
           infiltrating T cells, their CD4/CD8 ratios, frequencies of FoxP3 cells, and the
           expression of chemokine receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CXCR3, CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, and
           CXCR4)

        -  Evaluate the local expression of effector T cells (Teff)-attracting chemokines (CCR5,
           CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and Treg-favoring chemokines (CCL22 and CXCL12) using IF and
           RT-PCR.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), recombinant interferon alfa-2b
      intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV QD on days 1, 2,3,8,9,10,15,16 and 17
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
