    
      Study 165-303, is a Phase 3 substudy enrolling approximately 100 subjects, aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 70
      years old, with PKU who are participating in the Phase 3 study, 165-302.

      Per the 165-303 protocol, the investigator does not assign a specific intervention to the
      study participants. In accordance with the protocol for Study 165-303, subjects were asked to
      perform selected set of three tasks from the CANTAB tool (Rapid Visual Processing [RVP],
      Spatial Working Memory [SWM], and Stop Signal Task [SST]) to assess executive function and
      each subject's self perception of their current state was measured using a subject global
      assessment questionnaire that contains seven questions about current state perception of
      attention, energy level, tiredness, confusion, sadness, anger and tension.

      The time points for administering the above tools are as follows, which coincide with time
      points in part 2 and part 4 of Study 165-302: screening (entry into Part 2 165-302 Day 1 of
      Week 1), baseline visit (Part 2 Week 8), and 3 additional study visits at different time
      points in the Part 4 of 165-302 study.
