      for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is
      being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing
      a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the
      Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately
      every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions.

      Placebo-embedded IEM tablets are being tested to measure the accuracy of IEM detection by the
      MIND1 system. Approximately 30 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy.
      The duration of this substudy from Visit 1 (Day 1) to safety follow-up will be approximately
      1 week, of which approximately 1 day will be allotted for active subject participation, plus
      a 1-week safety follow-up period.
