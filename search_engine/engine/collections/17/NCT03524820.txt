      colorectal cancer patients with wild type RAS as third line treatment, following first line
      cetuximab treatment and other second line treatments. The hypothesis is that most cetuximab
      sensitive cells will be eliminated in the first line of treatment, but may reemerge following
      other second line treatments which are targeted to other clones in the tumor. The advantage
      to the patients is unclear, however some preliminary studies show advantage to patients. This
      study will look if mutations in patients' blood are a predictive marker for progression free
      time (FPT) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with third line cetuximab. A
      predictive marker for FPT metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with third line
      cetuximab will enable a reduction in the number of treated patients. Treatment only of
      patients with a positive marker is expected to prevent inefficient treatment which will
      reduce suffering for the patients and reduce unnecessary medical treatment.
