    
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase I, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced and/or refractory malignancies (solid tumours
      or lymphoma), to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of Debio 0932 administered
      orally every-other-day (schedule A) or every day (schedule B) and to assess its safety
      profile, pharmakokinetic, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

      Increments used in dose escalation will be determined according to the maximum grade of
      treatment-related adverse events observed during the first 30-day treatment period of each
      schedule in the previous in the preceding dose level Once reaching the recommended dose (RD)
      for each schedule, up to 40 additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the RD of the
      retained schedule, as part of an expansion phase.
