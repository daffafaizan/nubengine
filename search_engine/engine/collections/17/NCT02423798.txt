      for CGM, the (new generation) Enlite glucose sensor, CE-marked in 2013, in conjunction with
      the new Medtronic 640G system components. Accuracy and life-time of the sensor are important
      parameters contributing to the safety of patients and patient acceptance of this still fairly
      new technology.

      The current trial investigates the accuracy of the new sensor in conjunction with the new
      640G system components both in the clinic and at home. This enables us to assess the sensor
      accuracy in a well-controlled environment using a highly accurate laboratory glucose analyzer
      as reference as well as sensor accuracy during real-life conditions using a blood glucose
      meter as reference analyzer.

      The data gathered in this trial will help to understand the effect of technological
      advancements made and can guide future development of glucose sensor for continuous glucose
      monitoring.
