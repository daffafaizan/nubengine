    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (KRT-232 [AMG 232]), cytarabine and
      idarubicin hydrochloride (idarubicin), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profiles of KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin when used in combination.

      III. To evaluate p53 signaling induced by KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin.

      IV. To correlate KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin exposure with pharmacodynamics
      endpoints (efficacy, toxicity, changes in p53 signaling).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of KRT-232 (AMG
      232), cytarabine and idarubicin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers, including MTF2 and H3K27me3, of response to
      KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin in AML.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of KRT-232 and induction chemotherapy in
      AML blasts.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of AMG 232.

      Patients receive AMG 232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, cytarabine intravenously
      (IV) twice daily (BID) over 3 hours on days 1-7, and idarubicin IV over 10-15 minutes on days
      1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with residual disease may receive cytarabine IV BID over 3
      hours for 5 days and idarubicin IV over 10-15 minutes for 2 days starting between days 14-21
      of cycle 1 or the second cycle of AMG 232, cytarabine, and idarubicin. Patients who achieve a
      complete response (CR) or a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) in either cycle 1
      or 2 may receive cytarabine IV BID over 3 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for 3-4 additional 28 to
      35-day cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.
