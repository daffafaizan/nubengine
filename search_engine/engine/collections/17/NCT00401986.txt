      the PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214539).

      Enrollment will be limited to only those subjects who were treated with the Alair System in
      the PREDECESSOR STUDY.

      Written, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to performing any study
      procedures.

      The present study will extend the follow-up evaluation of Alair-Treated Subjects from the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY to 5 years post-treatment with the Alair System. These evaluations will
      consist of four study visits corresponding to the two-year, three-year, four-year and
      five-year time points following completion of Alair treatments in the PREDECESSOR STUDY. For
      consistency with the PREDECESSOR STUDY, ideally the subject's drug therapy should continue to
      be consistent with GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) Guidelines for the severity of the
      subject's asthma. Any changes in maintenance levels of asthma medications will be documented.

      The goal of this follow-on study is to enroll all Alair-Treated Subjects who completed the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY. Inclusion of subjects from the treatment arm will allow for better
      assessment of the long-term safety of the Alair procedure.
