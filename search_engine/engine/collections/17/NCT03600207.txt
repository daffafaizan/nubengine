      groups. One of the groups take part in a complex training which contains stretching,
      strengthening, mobilizing exercises and proprioceptive training and this training is
      completed by diaphragm strengthening exercises. This group is defined as diaphragm training
      group. The members of the diaphragm training group use the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device.
      Opposed to the diaphragm training group the members of the control group take part only in
      the complex training without strengthening the diaphragm muscle. The pain intensity is
      assessed by Visual Analogue Scale and the diameter of the stabilizer muscles' belly is
      measured by B-mode ultrasound examination, using Zonare Z.One Ultrasound System (Mountain
      View, CA, USA). The thickness of the transversus abdominis muscle, the lumbar multifidus
      muscle and the diaphragm muscle is assessed in two different positions: during lying and
      during sitting position with weightlifting. The muscles are measured in two different states:
      a relaxed and a contracted state. Functional tests and a balance platform (NeuroCom) are used
      to measure the stability, and the function of the diaphragm is assessed by using a
      POWERbreathe KH2 device.
