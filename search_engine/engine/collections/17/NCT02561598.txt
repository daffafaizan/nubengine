      information in samples of persons who have exhibited signs of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) or
      have family history or high risk of MH to see if risk factors can be identified. These will
      be compared with control samples of children who have been exposed to the same agents which
      could induce MH, yet showed no signs of the disorder.
