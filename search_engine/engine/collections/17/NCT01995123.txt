    
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral activation as an adjuvant to
      standard smoking cessation treatment improves smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with
      PTSD relative to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment +
      health and smoking education. It is expected that behavioral activation will produce more
      successful results than health and smoking education when paired with standard smoking
      cessation treatment.

      After an initial phone screen, in-person screening, and baseline assessment, enrolled
      participants will be randomized to either behavioral activation therapy and standard smoking
      cessation treatment (BA+ST) or health and smoking education and standard smoking cessation
      treatment (HSE+ST). Both groups will meet with a therapist once a week for 8 weeks to receive
      either BA+ST or HSE+ST. Participants' mood and smoking outcomes will be monitored throughout
      the 8 weeks of treatment and at 2 follow-up visits and 2 follow-up phone calls.
