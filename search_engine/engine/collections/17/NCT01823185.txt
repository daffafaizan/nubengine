      intervention (PCI) with stent implantation and during one year after PCI, to prevent
      atherothrombotic complications. Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite by
      Cytochrome P2C19 (CYP2C19). However 30 % of the Saudi population is carrier of the non
      functional CYP2C19*2 or *3 alleles having an impaired CYP2C19 capacity, resulting in
      decreased effectiveness of Clopidogrel. These patients have a 42% higher risk for major
      cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to non carriers. Further 50 % of the MACE occurs in the
      first 48 hours. Therefore Ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or prasugrel ( 10mg once daily or
      5mg once daily if the patient older than 75 years or a body weight < 60kg) whose actions are
      not dependent on conversion by CYP2C19 may be an alternative only in carriers of the non
      functional CYP2C19*2 or *3 alleles. This might be cost effective and prevent patients form
      MACE. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, complication free
      survival, safety and cost-effectiveness of the CYP2C19 genotype guided antiplatelet treatment
      strategy, using clopidogrel or prasugrel (or Ticlid). All participants will be followed for
      one year using follow up questionnaires.
