      breastfeeding found during preceding focus groups and a baseline survey. Messages were
      written in English and translated into Spanish, with back-translation to ensure accuracy.
      Mothers who plan to or are already breastfeeding will be recruited and invited to participate
      in the study in the post-partum ward after delivery at Public Hospital Roat√°n. Written
      informed consent will be obtained. Three animated videos will be shown to mothers at
      enrollment providing information regarding breastfeeding technique, breastfeeding
      encouragement and general breastfeeding information. SMS messages will start at time of
      enrollment and continue through six months after enrollment. Messages will be delivered
      through Telerivet, an SMS interactive platform designed to send the educational and
      motivational messages to mothers' cell phones.

      The intervention group will be polled when infants turn two months, four months, and six
      months regarding their infant feeding practices through Telerivet via SMS messaging. The
      primary outcome of this study is exclusive breastfeeding at 2 months of age, as compared to
      the exclusive breastfeeding rate obtained in our baseline cross sectional survey. Exclusive
      breastfeeding will be defined as giving only mother's breastmilk in the 24 hours preceding
      the interview. Mothers will also be asked if they are breastfeeding at all, age of infant
      when they last gave breast milk, the incidence of diarrheal illness in the past two weeks,
      and any other foods / liquids given to infant.
