      medication compliance and user friendliness. The patient group selected here is patients with
      Crohn's disease that are treated with Azathioprine. The patient selection was made since the
      metabolite can be easily measured and the compliance can be therefore be followed. The
      treatment will follow the standard care given to these patients.
