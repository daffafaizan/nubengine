      central venous catheter related infections with the application of topical antibiotics to the
      insertion point. One such study found a mortality benefit with Polysporin Triple Therapy
      ointment. We intend to determine if this preparation can reduce overall line infection rates
      in the ICU environment through its application at the time of line insertion and twice more
      the following week.
