      implementation, as well as the outcomes of the programme in a randomised controlled trial.
      Programme facilitators and intervention group participants will provide data for the former.
      For the outcome evaluation, two types of participants will be recruited who will provide
      self-report data: primary caregivers (n = 80) and where possible another adult living in the
      home with this primary caregiver and their selected child (n = 60). This "other adult" data
      will serve to verify the primary caregivers' self-report data. Both participants will provide
      demographic information, and report on parenting behaviour and child behaviour. Their data
      will be analysed separately in intention to treat analyses and secondary analyses which
      consider moderators of programme effectiveness.
