      include cardiac arrhythmias. For acute alcohol intake in particular it is insufficiently
      understood to what extent cardiac arrhythmias and other ECG changes occur, if the occurence
      depends on alcohol levels, and if there is a cut off value for occurence. Munich BREW aims to
      help clarifying these questions.

      Participants of Munich BREW are identified and invited as visitors of the Munich Octoberfest
      and similar events. Participants need to be 18 years of age and over and need to declare
      theri will to participate. Following enrollment, participants will answer astudy
      questionnaire and will subsequently undergo recording of a 30 sec smart phone based ECG.
      Ultimately, the alcohol level is determined using a breath alcohol analyzer.
