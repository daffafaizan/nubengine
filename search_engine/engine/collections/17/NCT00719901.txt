      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of obatoclax
      mesylate when given in combination with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the response rate (complete response, partial
      response, and very good partial response) in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III. To
      explore the utility of genetic markers based on initial evidence that they are predictive of
      drug responsiveness and/or successful target inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of obatoclax mesylate followed
      by a phase II study.

      Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV over 3 hours and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and
      11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
