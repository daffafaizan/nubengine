    
      Patients with medically inoperable primary soft tissue lesion of the lung (lesions less than
      or equal to 2cm and located in the outer two-thirds of the lung and not closer than 1cm to
      the pleura) will have transbronchial microwave ablation performed using CT imaging. All
      ablations will be performed under general anesthesia via transbronchial approach by an
      interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon.

      Prior to the ablation procedure, the treating physician will use endobronchial ultrasound to
      confirm staging.

      Patients will be followed for one year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and
      safety with specific follow-up visits at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-ablation. A
      user experience questionnaire is completed by the treating physician to better understand the
      ease of the procedure.
