      in patients with grades 2 and 3 knee osteoarthritis (OA) having significant joint pain and
      stiffness, in a large, multi-center clinical trial. Improvement in joint pain and stiffness,
      if any, will be evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis
      index ((WOMAC; v LK3.1: Turkish language translation). Improvement in knee range of motion
      (ROM), if any, will be measured by goniometer.
