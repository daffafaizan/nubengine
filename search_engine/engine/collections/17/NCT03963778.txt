      if it incorporates authentic staff engagement. The key choice made in formulating the
      research design is to adopt an approach that is collaborative and participatory in a process
      of action and learning.

      Here, eligible health practitioners involved in any aspect of the patients' food and
      nutritional care or helping to feed patients during mealtimes would be represented in one
      central team, engaging as co-researchers in the study.

      Patients and/or relatives will participate in a focus group or interview session. The AR team
      participants will be involved in the iterative action research cycle, reflecting on current
      nutritional care practices, collectively evaluate patients' stories and consider ways to
      improve eating and drinking on the wards. The AR team will meet throughout the course of 12
      months.

      The study will provide insight into the impact of organisational culture ('the way the
      investigators do things') in the delivery of good nutritional care and elucidate the roles
      and responsibilities of nurses and other staff groups involved in the provision of
      nutritional care.

      This research will provide data on the organisational culture of interdisciplinary teams
      working at both micro and macro levels while providing insight into the potential for AR to
      be used in a wider arena within the hospital to improve practice.
