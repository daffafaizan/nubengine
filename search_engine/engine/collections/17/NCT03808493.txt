      tested in Japanese healthy adult men. This study will evaluate bioequivalence of single oral
      dose of TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet without water and TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water (Study 1),
      and TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet with water and TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water (Study 2).

      The study will enroll up to 144 participants in total (Study 1 + 2). In Study 1 and 2,
      participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groups;

      Study 1:

        -  TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet without water (Period 1) + TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water
           (Period 2)

        -  TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water (Period 1) + TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet without water
           (Period 2)

      Study 2:

        -  TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet with water (Period 1) + TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water (Period
           2)

        -  TAK-438 20 mg tablet with water (Period 1) + TAK-438 OD 20 mg tablet with water (Period
           2)

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 11 days. Participants will make two visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for four days each in Periods 1 and 2.
