      large-cell lymphoma and other solid tumors. Our Previous study showed that two-weekly regimen
      of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen acheived comparable response rate to R-miniCHOP.The
      investigators therefore design this open-label,phase III and random trial to compared the
      safety and efficacy of R-Gemox versus R-miniCHOP as first-line treatment of elderly patients
      with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
