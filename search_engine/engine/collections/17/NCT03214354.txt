    
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating chronic blood disorder with multi-system
      end-organ damage that leads to morbidity and early mortality. The only cure for SCD is
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which given the risks with unrelated HSCT, is
      only an option for a minority of patients who have a matched sibling donor.

      In the field of HSCT, blood group ABO incompatibility between donor and recipient is not a
      contraindication and several studies do not show compromised outcomes. However, in the
      context of nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning and major ABO-incompatibility, when the
      recipient has existing antibodies to donor red blood cells, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) may
      occur.

      This phase II pilot study will enroll SCD patients with a matched related major
      ABO-incompatible donor to determine the safety and efficacy of NMA-HSCT. Biological studies
      will include a plan to study and monitor red cell engraftment in this population to
      facilitate early detection and interventional measures to prevent and treat PRCA.
