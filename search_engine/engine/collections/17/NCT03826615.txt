      discomfort during the second consecutive eye surgery compared to the first eye surgery.

      Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug, which has been extended the use to perioperative
      analgesia, and anxiolysis.

      Therefore, the investigators conducted this randomized, controlled study to evaluate the
      effects of gabapentin premedication on patients' subjective sensations, including
      intraoperative anxiety, perceptions of pain, and light sensitivity, in the second cataract
      operations.
