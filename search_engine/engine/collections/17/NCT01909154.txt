      follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) who were treated with
      autologous stromal cells of the bone marrow administrated locally (subarachnoid and
      intramedullar) by intrathecal microinjection and three months later, by lumbar subarachnoid
      administration. The minimum follow-up duration for each patient is 12 months after the first
      administration, or until death, if it occurs it before.
