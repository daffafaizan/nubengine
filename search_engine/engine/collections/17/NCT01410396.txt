      detection of atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of stroke of known case. Their
      are not study treatments or interventions, this is an observational trial. Eligible patients
      must be >50 years old, have a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack with a
      documented brain infarction within the prior 12 months. If patients are on anticoagulation
      therapies, they are eligible for enrollment if the long-term strategy for stroke prevention
      is anti-platelet therapy and not the oral anti-coagulant itself. Patients must not have an
      detection of AF and then must successfully activate the lifeStar device for enrollment. At
      the end of three weeks, the LifeStar device will be over-read and scored for the presence of
      AF and other clinically significant arrhythmias by the study electrophysiologist, who will
      determine the occurrence and burden of AF.
