      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma treated with
      trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) who are event free (%EF) at 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of DS-8201a in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma. II. To describe
      the pharmacokinetics of DS-8201a in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma.

      III. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), event free survival (EFS), overall
      survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR) of patients with recurrent, measurable
      osteosarcoma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the relationship between potential biomarkers and response to DS-8201a.

      II. To evaluate quantitative circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a surrogate markers of response in recurrent osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months.
