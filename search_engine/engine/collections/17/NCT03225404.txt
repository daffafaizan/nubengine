      Participants were asked to perform the exercise program on an individual basis twice every
      day for 4 weeks. The eccentric program consisted of 3 exercises, focusing on the epicondyle
      muscles. Participants were asked to do a normal flexion extension (concentric phase) and a
      slow return to the initial position (eccentric phase) included first the concentric phase,
      and the eccentric phase was slowly conducted. The exercise program was taught by a
      physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in the subsequent sessions.
