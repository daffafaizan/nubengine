      PIs. Statins and other lipid-lowering agents are often prescribed to control elevated
      cholesterol levels in both HIV infected and uninfected people. However, both antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) and lipid-lowering drugs may be associated with cardiovascular disease, so
      there is a clear need to find a lipid-lowering drug with low toxicity. This study will
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe, a lipid-controlling agent, in
      combination with ongoing statin therapy in HIV infected people currently on ART.

      This study will last 28 weeks. All participants will be required to continue their current
      stable statin therapy and ART for the duration of the study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Arm 1 participants will receive
      ezetimibe daily for 12 weeks, no treatment for 4 weeks, then placebo daily for 12 weeks. Arm
      2 participants will receive placebo daily for 12 weeks, no treatment for 4 weeks, and then
      ezetimibe daily for 12 weeks. There will be 9 study visits; they will occur at study
      screening, at study entry, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Clinical assessment and blood
      collection will occur at all visits. Participants will be asked to complete an adherence
      questionnaire at Weeks 4, 12, 20, and 28, and will also be encouraged to coenroll in ACTG
      A5128 (Consent for Use of Stored Patient Specimens for Future Testing).
