      Chest X-ray is commonly used as first line imaging method to diagnose the reason of
      respiratory distress in NICUs. Lung ultrasound is a new diagnostic tool for lung imaging, and
      this method has been used more common recently in NICUs.

      Objectives:

      We aimed to determine the decrease in the number of chest X-rays in newborns with respiratory
      distress, with the use of lung ultrasonography.

      Methods:

      From January 2019 to June 2020, 104 newborn infants with respiratory distress enrolled in
      this study. We used bed side ultrasound as the first line tecnique for lung imaging. X-ray
      were taken in cases with increasing respiratory distress in spite of treatment according to
      diagnosis depending on USG findings. We calculated decreased number of chest X-ray for every
      patient and evaluated the estimated decrease in radiation exposure.
