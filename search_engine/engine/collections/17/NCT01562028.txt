        1. To determine long-term outcome of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring
           EGFR mutations with or without T790M mutation at diagnosis and treated with the
           combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival

        2. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination

        3. To evaluate the correlation of BRCA1 mRNA and AEG-1 mRNA expression and T790M with
           progression-free survival

        4. To monitor EGFR mutations (including T790M) in serum and plasma longitudinally

        5. To evaluate molecular biomarkers related to EGFR TKI and bevacizumab

      Design:

      This is a multinational, multi-center phase II trial of erlotinib plus bevacizumab in
      patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations confirmed by central
      re-assessment. Patients will be stratified into two subgroups, with and without EGFR T790M
      mutation. The stratification will be done after the inclusion of patients.

      Sample size: 102 patients
