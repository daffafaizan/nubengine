      Primary Objective

        -  To investigate the late asthmatic response in mild to moderate asthmatics.. Secondary
           Objectives

        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on cutaneous antigen response, antigen induced airway
           hyperactivity and sputum eosinophilia.

      Methodology: Study Design:

        -  Single centre, phase IIa, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, repeated dose study
           in male and female asthmatic subjects.

        -  A sufficient number of subjects (at least 24 subjects) will be recruited to ensure that
           at least 20 completed sets of data will be obtained.

        -  Subjects will be randomised to receive either AER 001 25 mg / Placebo in a ratio of 1
           active : 1 placebo.

        -  Treatments will be administered as a sub-cutaneous injection.

        -  Subjects are to receive a daily administration of AER 001 / placebo over a 4 week
           period.

        -  Subjects will be admitted to the unit at least 2 hours prior to the first dose
           administration. On the first dosing occasion the subjects will remain in the unit under
           clinical supervision for at least 30 minutes post dose or until the Investigator is
           satisfied for them to be discharged. On subsequent dosing days the subjects will be
           admitted to the unit at least 45 minutes prior to dosing and remain in the unit for at
           least 15 minutes post dose or until the Investigator is satisfied for them to be
           discharged.
