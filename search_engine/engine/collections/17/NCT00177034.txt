      pathogenesis of vitiligo is multifactorial. Theories include autoimmunity, neural, apoptosis
      and cytotoxicity. The medical treatments for vitiligo are marginal with a 40-60% response
      rate which does not guarantee full repigmentation. Understanding the pathogenesis of vitiligo
      will allow better targets for treatment.

      Previous analysis of skin biopsies have found several of the changes in gene expression
      occurred in immune regulation, DNA replication and repair, oncogenes, signal transducers and
      transcription factors. These results give us insight as to what happens in lesional vs
      nonlesional skin which contains the epidermis, dermis, fat, blood vessels and immune cells.

      We have the technology today to study specific cell populations from tissue by the use of
      laser capture microdissection. We propose to use this technique to study the keratinocyte
      population in vitiligo skin because past evidence suggests that they may play a role. In
      addition, the role keratinocytes in vitiligo may be important for treatment as this would be
      the ideal target for therapy. Keratinocytes have been studied in vitiligo.

      The aim of the study is to isolate keratinocytes from normal skin, perilesional and lesional
      skin in vitiligo patients by laser capture microdissection and characterize their gene
      expression profile by gene microarray analysis and to compare keratinocyte gene expression in
      normal, perilesional and lesional vitiligo skin before and after narrow band UVB treatment.
