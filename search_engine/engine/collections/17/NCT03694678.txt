      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and their family caregivers (cgs) by conducting a pilot
      feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=80 dyads; 60 completers) of the dyadic
      resiliency program ("Recovering Together") to prevent chronic emotional distress in both pts
      and their cgs. Eligible dyads include adult, English speaking pts with acute neurological
      injury (ANI) admitted to the NICU, cleared medically and cognitively for participation by the
      nursing team, and their primary cgs. Dyads who are randomly assigned to "Recovering Together"
      will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person at hospitalization and 4 through live video
      after discharge, to reduce burden and facilitate access to care) led by a clinical
      psychologist. Dyads who are randomly assigned to the attention placebo educational control
      condition will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person and 4 through live video with a
      clinical psychologist), modeled after the Recovering Together program that will control for
      the dose of the intervention and support from therapist. Dyads will complete assessment
      surveys before, after the intervention and 3 months later. Clinical data on demographics,
      diagnosis, ANI severity, and any medical complications will be extracted from electronic
      health records.
