      vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness. Meniere's disease may result from an
      imbalance of fluid in the inner ear. Several studies have shown that corticosteroids may help
      manage this imbalance yet the effect does not last very long. OTO-104 is a longer lasting
      corticosteroid which could provide significant benefit to patients with Meniere's disease.
