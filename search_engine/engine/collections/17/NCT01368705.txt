      characterized by a breakdown of body stores. Without appropriate nutritional consideration
      this process can lead to increased physiological instability. It has been extensively
      documented that critically ill patients are typically catabolic. This results in body
      nitrogen losses from the breakdown of somatic protein to fuel metabolic processes such as,
      gluconeogenesis. The evaluation of this catabolic response is particularly crucial in infants
      due to their limited fat and lean body mass reserves. Quantifying the amount of protein
      needed to maintain body composition and to meet the demands of surgical stress is of clinical
      importance when considering factors associated with postoperative morbidity, such as delayed
      wound healing, impaired growth and prolonged hospital stay.

      The results obtained from this study will assist with determining an appropriate level of
      protein for the development of optimal nutrition prescriptions that are aimed at reducing
      catabolism of body stores.
