      ZOSTAVAX vs. no vaccine in 60 adults with solid organ tumors before, during and after
      chemotherapy. The personnel performing the laboratory studies will be blinded to vaccine vs.
      no vaccine. In a pilot study of an FDA approved vaccine that is being used within the
      parameters of the package insert and ACIP recommendations, placebo vaccine is not required to
      access our key primary immunologic endpoint.
