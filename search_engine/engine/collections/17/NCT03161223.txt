      neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). The current prevalence of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately
      9,500 patient. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have been
      limited. This study focuses on exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents
      in an effort to develop novel treatment platforms.
