      earlier in adult patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders in comparison to controls,
      as it was demonstrated in Becker muscular dystrophy patients and fascioscapulo humeral
      muscular dystrophy. Moreover, the deoxygenation kinetics was positively correlated to the
      functional status and the muscular deficiency severity. However, no pediatric study has been
      conducted on this topic up to date.

      The aim of the study is to determine if a correlation exists in children suffering from
      neuromuscular diseases:

        -  between muscular oxygenation and the percentage of the 6 minutes walking test performed
           in the routine medical care

        -  between muscular oxygenation and the total and D1 motor function measure value
