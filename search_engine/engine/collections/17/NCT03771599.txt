      in the management of children with CP. Massage is also used as a complimentary alternative
      medicine (CAM). It has many types being practiced across the globe. Traditional massage is a
      type of massage being practiced in a specific society and has its own way of execution. It
      does not need professional education, training and certification so do not have any financial
      burden on the caregivers. As Pakistan is a poor country with low socio-economic status, so
      such measures of management which involve less financial burden on caregivers need to be
      investigated.

      In this RCT, traditional massage was performed on the participants in the supine lying
      position. Each upper and lower limb was massaged for five minutes with gentle rubbing in
      proximal to distal direction. Five minutes massage was also provided at front and back of
      trunk area each in center to periphery direction. This type of traditional massage is
      practiced in Pakistan population which is somewhat different to Swedish massage. In few
      previous studies effect of Swedish massage on spastic CP has been investigated with
      conflicting level of evidence. However no study has been conducted in Pakistan to see the
      effects of traditional massage on children with cerebral palsy.
