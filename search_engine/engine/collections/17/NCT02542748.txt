      hypotension, resulted from sympathectomy is a common problem, especially in pregnant women.
      Prevention of this complication by sympathomimetic agents is of potential clinical
      significance. Ephedrine could be used to treat hypotension but lead to lower fetal pH, which
      may be related to worse fetal outcome.Norepinephrine could improve the hypotension to the
      same extent as phenylephrine. In this study, we tend to compare the effects of norepinephrine
      and ephedrine on hypotension in parturients and on fetal acid status.
