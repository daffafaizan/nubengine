      Approximately 16 subjects will participate in the BPX-501 main study. The treatment consists
      of three courses of BPX-501 T cell infusions at 30 day intervals with 2 escalating dose
      levels (DL). DL1 on Day 0; DL2 on Days 30 and 60.

      Two doses of rimiducid (AP1903) will be investigated for the treatment of aGvHD after BPX-501
      T cell infusion. A 0.1mg/kg initial dose of rimiducid which has demonstrated the ability to
      induce >50% BPX-501 T cell eradication in preclinical animal models will first be
      administered in the event of uncontrollable aGvHD. If there is no response to this dose
      within 24hrs + 12hrs a second dose of 0.4 mg/kg (which has been reported to induce T cell
      eradication of > 90%) will be administered. If there is no measurable GvHD response to the
      initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg rimiducid in 2 subjects, the starting dose of rimiducid will be 0.4
      mg/kg for all subsequent subjects.

      Rimiducid (AP1903) Optional PK Sub-Study:

      Approximately 12 subjects will be recruited to participate in the optional Rimiducid (AP1903)
      PK sub-study. Subjects will be assigned to one of two arms and receive either 0.04mg/kg or
      0.4mg/kg of Rimiducid (AP1903). Each arm will have a target enrollment of 6 subjects.

        -  Arm 1: 0.04mg/kg Rimiducid (AP1903), 6 subjects;

        -  Arm 2: 0.4mg/kg Rimiducid (AP1903), 6 subjects. Rimiducid PK samples and ECG data will
           be collected at Pre-dose (0 hour), 30 minutes, 2 hours and 8 hours following the
           initiation of rimiducid (AP1903) infusion.

      Efforts shall be made to enroll at least one subject from each age subset into the PK
      sub-study: infants and toddlers (12 months to 23 months); children (2-11 years); and
      adolescents (12-18 years).
