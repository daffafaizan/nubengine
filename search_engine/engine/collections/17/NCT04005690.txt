    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the feasibility of collecting tumor tissue for biomarker evaluation prior to and
      after window therapy with assigned study agent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess preliminary safety and tolerability of cobimetinib. II. Assess preliminary safety
      and tolerability of olaparib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to assigned study agent. II. Identify
      emerging mechanism(s) of resistance to assigned study agent. III. Determine cellular and
      molecular changes in pancreatic tumor cells exposed to assigned study agent.

      IV. Identify tumor markers suggestive of combinatorial therapy that could overcome resistance
      to therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 12-24 hours, patients undergo biopsy
      or surgery as clinically appropriate per institutional standards for management of patient's
      disease.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 12-24 hours, patients undergo biopsy or surgery
      as clinically appropriate per institutional standards for management of patient's disease.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
