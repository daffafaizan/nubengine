      steatohepatitis (NASH) patients was dependent on body composition. The proposed work is based
      on the hypothesis that gains in cardiorespiratory fitness and improved endothelial function
      achieved through exercise can arrest or reverse progression of hepatic fibrosis, lessen
      cardiovascular disease risk (CVD), and improve all-cause mortality in patients with NASH. The
      aims of this research proposal are designed to characterize and better understand the effects
      of physical activity (PA) on CRF and endothelial function in patients with NASH. The goal is
      to arrest progression of fibrosis and reduce CVD risk. This proposal includes a
      cross-sectional study and a small pilot clinical trial in a high-risk subgroup of NASH most
      likely to benefit from PA.
