    
      This is a non-randomized clinical trial in a type 2 diabetic population aiming to investigate
      the effect of Stevia rebaudiana bertoni on the glycaemic and insulin secretory response to a
      mixed meal tolerance test, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. The study has two arms
      including an intervention arm (test group) and a non-intervention arm (controls) matched for
      age, sex and body mass index in 2:1 ratio.

      The intervention is made of two phases including

        1. A mixed meal tolerance test with and without 240 mg of Stevia in a randomized order to
           evaluate the acute effects;

        2. An oral intake of 240 mg of Stevia within 30 days as food supplement in order to assess
           medium-term effects
