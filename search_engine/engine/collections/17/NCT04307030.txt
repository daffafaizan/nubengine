      by auscultation using an electronic stethoscope in children (0 ~ 18 years old) confirmed with
      or without CHDs by echocardiography during outpatient or hospitalization in 10 pediatric
      medical centers. Heart sounds will be visualized as phonocardiogram, and feature extraction
      will be done after classification of normal and abnormal heart sounds and labeling the
      characteristics of heart murmurs by pediatric cardiovascular specialists. Artificial
      intelligence algorithm (machine learning, deep learning, etc.) will be trained to build a
      heart sounds recognition system with the data mentioned above.We will use the receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve to compare the ability of recognition and classification
      of abnormal heart sounds between different artificial intelligence algorithm. Taken the
      results of echocardiography as the gold standard, we will use the evaluation indexes,such as
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      etc, to compare the diagnostic capacity of CHD screening between the AI recognition system
      and human cardiovascular pediatricians. Our target is to use artificial intelligence
      technology to assist heart auscultation for CHD screening.
