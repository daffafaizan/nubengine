      eosinophilic inflammation in the airways (as measured by FENO) or they may have Cysteinyl
      leukotrienes based inflammation in the airways that will be shown by high levels of Cys LT
      and low levels of lipoxin in the exhaled breath condensate. Our suggestion is that a special
      pattern of inflammation may be seen in asthmatics with food allergy because of their strong
      atopic march history and then we aimed to test if montelukast is more effective in children
      when the ratio of Cysteinyl LT inflammation is high relative to FENO (eosinophilic
      inflammation). This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of montelukast regarding
      the synthesis of Cys leukotrienes, lipoxin and FENO that will be measured from exhaled breath
      condensate, which is the mirror of the local inflammation in the airways in asthmatic
      children with atopy (food allergy). As we mentioned above another factor that we are planning
      to analyze is the ratio of Cys leukotriene to lipoxin, which is the natural antagonist of LT.
      This study will determine the ratio of Cyst LT to lipoxin and Cyst LT to FENO in the exhaled
      breath condensate and then there will be an analysis to see the correlation of these
      inflammatory markers with montelukast related changes on FEV1%, FEV1%/FVC.
