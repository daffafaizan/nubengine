    
      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab combined with cetuximab for patients with
      R/M HNSCC.

        1. Cohort 1 (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-naïve, cetuximab-naïve): clinical efficacy defined as
           overall response rate.

        2. Cohort 2 (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory, cetuximab-naïve): clinical efficacy defined
           as overall response rate.

        3. Cohort 3 (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory, cetuximab-refractory): clinical efficacy
           defined as overall response rate.

        4. Cohort 4 (cutaneous HNSCC): clinical efficacy defined as overall response rate.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine 12 month progression-free survival probability.

        2. To determine overall survival.

        3. To determine duration of response.

        4. To assess safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with cetuximab.

        5. To evaluate the correlation between molecular markers and disease outcome.
