      is not foreseen, statistical assumption is not planned and the sample size calculation was
      not performed.

      Taking into consideration the available data on the established safety profile of the therapy
      with statins and combination of ezetimibe with statins it has been suggested that a sample
      size of 750 patients will be sufficient to identify adverse events profile.

      The treatment effects will be characterized by descriptive and frequency parameters.
