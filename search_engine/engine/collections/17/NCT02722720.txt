      amount of adverse events associated with transfemoral approach such as bleeding or hematoma.
      Otherwise providing transradial approach is fraught with technical difficulties of common
      carotid artery canulation that can result in embolic complications. Taking into account the
      absence of studies in this area of medicine, providing investigation evaluating parameters of
      safety for both methodics is very actual.
