      impacts inflammatory and metabolic outcomes in the acute phase of sepsis. Preliminary data
      from our mouse models suggest that provision of dextrose via an intravenous route, even at
      low levels early in the course of sepsis, markedly impairs glucose tolerance and decreases
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. In contrast, provision of low-level dextrose by
      the enteral route at identical levels during the early phase of sepsis is associated with
      decreased inflammation, increased secretion of beneficial intestine-derived incretin
      hormones, and significant improvements in glucose metabolism. The goals of this clinical
      study are to translate findings on the beneficial role of early enteral dextrose in a pilot
      interventional trial in critically-ill patients with sepsis. This clinical trial will provide
      further insight into the optimal timing and route of early caloric support in the care of
      septic patients-an area of clinical practice that will benefit from further studies in
      fundamental biology and clear guidelines for physicians.
