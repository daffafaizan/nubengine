      Western Highlands of Guatemala. Absorption of zinc will be measured from maize tortillas and
      maize tortillas fortified with 20% amaranth as the major food staple which provides at least
      70% energy and at least 90% zinc and phytate of the diet. Participants will be randomized as
      to which type of tortilla they receive on the first and second day. Fractional absorption of
      zinc (FAZ) from all meals in one day for one type of tortilla and one day for the other will
      be measured by extrinsic labeling with stable isotopes of zinc. FAZ will be measured by a
      dual isotope tracer ratio (DITR) technique based on ratio of urine enrichment of orally
      versus intravenously administered zinc stable isotopes. Measurement of total zinc in
      duplicate diets on test days allow for determination of quantities of this micronutrient
      absorbed.
