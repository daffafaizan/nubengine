      maternal disease, reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma, and increase the titer of
      epitope-specific antibody. Also, active immunization has the potential to induce primary
      immunity in the fetus and to boost both T-cell and humoral immune responses to HIV in the
      mothers.

      Women are randomized to receive rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine or MF59 placebo. Patients receive the
      first immunization between 16 and 24 weeks gestation and monthly thereafter until delivery,
      for a maximum of five immunizations. Patients may continue to receive the immunization
      regimen to which they were originally assigned at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Maternal
      follow-up continues until 18 months postpartum; infants are followed until age 18 months.
