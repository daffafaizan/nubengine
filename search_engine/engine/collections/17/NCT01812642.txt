      participant receives), multi-center (conducted in more than one center), randomized
      (treatment group assigned by chance), and multiple-dose titration study of JNJ-37822681 in
      participants with stable schizophrenia. The total study duration will be approximately of 8
      weeks per participant, consists of 4 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study
      commences on Day 1); Double-blind treatment (14 days); Follow-up (7 to 14 days after last
      dose administration). Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with ascending dose
      levels of JNJ-37822681 once daily and twice daily. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale. Safety
      will be Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and Simpson Angus
      Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
