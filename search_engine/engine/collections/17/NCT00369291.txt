      Primary

        -  Determine whether CpG 7909 enhances immune function, as measured by the response to
           keyhole limpet hemocyanin (neo-antigen) and tetanus toxoid (memory antigen), in patients
           who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if dose escalation of CpG 7909, within a range of previously tested safe doses
           of CpG 7909, impacts upon the primary immune readouts.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study of CpG 7909.

      Patients receive CpG 7909 subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 7, and 14. Patients receive keyhole
      limpet hemocyanin SC and tetanus toxoid SC on day 7.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Cp6 7909 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Blood is collected at baseline and at approximately day 40 for immunological studies,
      including immunoenzyme techniques, antibody response assays, and immunophenotyping.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
