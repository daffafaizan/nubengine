      (AMI) with cardiogenic shock (CS) are often treated with Intra-aortic balloon pump
      counterpulsation (IABP) although the evidence to support this is limited. We conducted a
      prospective, randomised clinical trial, of IABP as an addition to PCI centred therapy, in
      patients with AMI complicated by CS.

      45 patients with AMI and CS undergoing PCI were randomised to care with or without IABP. Over
      4 days, APACHE II scores, haemodynamic parameters, inflammatory markers and BNP levels were
      collected to assess the impact of IABP treatment on CS triggered multi organ dysfunction
      syndrome (MODS).
