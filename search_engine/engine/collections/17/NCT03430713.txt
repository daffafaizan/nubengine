      aesthetics considerations.

      Tooth color is an effect of volume reflection, the passage of incident light through the
      tooth followed by backward emergence. Color can be categorized in different systems and CIE
      L*a*b* is the most common. For color acquision visual and digital methods are used.

      Tooth shade matching in daily clinical practice is still a cause of disagreement and
      discomfort for many professionals. The gold standard is the use of dental shade guides by the
      clinicans who make a comparison between the sample (tooth) and multiple standard guides
      (shade guide tabs).

      The gold standard visual system has been Vitapan Classical (VC). Other system is Toothguide
      3D-Master (VM) which applies more closely the accepted color perception concepts of hue,
      lightness, chroma.

      However, several limitations have been associated to visual procedure. The accuracy between
      clinicians is frequently low and there is a high variability.

      For this reason, many improvements in optical electronic devices have led to the expanded use
      of photometric and colorimetric techniques for the evaluation, specification and management
      of color.

      Although the effectiveness of these devices depends ultimately on the accuracy and precision
      with which the measurements are carried out.

      There is a deeply concern with the determination of the accuracy between different methods
      for colour acquision because color has to be communicated precisely.
