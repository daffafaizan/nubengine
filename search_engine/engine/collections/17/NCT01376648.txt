      untreated will be studied at the Endocrine Department of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University.
      All subjects are screened and examined by two senior investigators. Putative BAT activity is
      determined by the integrated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT. After the first PET
      scan, hyperthyroid patients will be treated with Methimazole following clinical guidelines.
      None of them uses beta adrenergic blockade. The initial dose of methimazole employed is 10mg
      thrice a day. During follow-up, the thyroid hormone levels (free triiodothyronine and free
      thyroxine) will be measured every twenty days. The PET-CT scans and assessments will be
      repeated when the symptoms have disappeared and the thyroid hormone levels return to normal
      range. Then the dose of methimazole will be adjusted accordingly.
