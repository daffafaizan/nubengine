      aids, are candidates for cochlear implantation. In many cases these devices provide access to
      sound and are successful in restoring speech understanding; however, there are instances
      where individuals might need additional assistance in the form of auditory training (AT).
      This study will involve comparison of two groups of individuals. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to the standard of care group OR the remote care group. Individuals who
      meet eligibility criteria will be contacted to assess their willingness to participate in
      additional auditory training (AT) sessions. These sessions will be conducted either
      face-to-face or via the Ontario Telehealth network as per random assignment. AT sessions will
      occur over the first 3 months following activation of the cochlear implant. Outcomes will be
      assessed using performance measures and questionnaires.
