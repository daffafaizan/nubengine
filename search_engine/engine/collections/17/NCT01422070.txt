      surviving intensive care die subsequently in hospital after the transfer to ward. Mortality
      rates after discharge from ICU have been reported to range from 6.1 to 27%

      In 2000, it was reported that premature discharge from ICU was more likely to occur at night
      and was associated with higher death rates. Suggested factors that might account for a worse
      outcome for night discharges were poorer quantity and quality of care available at night both
      during transfer and at the destination. The implication of this study for the health system
      was that many hospitals did not have enough ICU beds. To facilitate earlier ICU discharges of
      ICU patients who are thought to need more care than those which can be provided on wards,
      InterMediate Care Units (IMCU) with level of nursing staff (and costs) lower than ICU were
      proposed more than a decade ago.

      Despite the relevance of the topic, the literature on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      IMCU available at present shows variable results. And the potential benefits of IMCUs remain
      uncertain.

      The most striking are probably the following questions:

        -  Does IMCU decrease the hospital mortality rate of ICU patients?

        -  Does IMCU allow earlier ICU discharge and hence improve patients flux through the ICU
           and reduce ICU cost?

        -  Does IMCU permit a reduction of ICU readmissions? We propose to address these issues in
           a large multinational, multicentre study.
