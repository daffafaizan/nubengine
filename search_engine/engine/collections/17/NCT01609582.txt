    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-875. TAK-875 is being tested to treat
      people who have diabetes. This study will look at the number of cardiovascular events (for
      example, heart attacks) of people who take TAK-875 in comparison to placebo in addition to
      standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 5000 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-875 50 mg.

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have low blood sugar symptoms
      in a diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide, in approximately 700 sites. The overall
      time to participate in this study is 6 years. Participants will make up to approximately 24
      visits to the clinic, with telephone visits conducted on an alternate 6 month schedule
      starting from Month 27.

      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.
