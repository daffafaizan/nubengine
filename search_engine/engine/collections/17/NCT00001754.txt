      skeletal dysplasias and generalized short stature. Families with skeletal dysplasias or short
      stature of known or suspected genetic basis will be enrolled. Affected individuals or
      individuals suspected of having a skeletal dysplasia will undergo periodic clinical
      assessment and genetic analyses for the purpose of: 1) definition and characterization of
      phenotype, 2) determination of the natural history of the disorder, and 3) genotype/phenotype
      correlation. Genetic linkage studies may be performed for disorders in which the genetic
      bases is not yet known.
