    
      The ARISE FLUIDS study is a multicentre, randomised, parallel group clinical trial of a
      restricted fluids and early vasopressor strategy compared to a larger initial IV fluid volume
      and later vasopressors for the haemodynamic resuscitation of patients with septic shock
      presenting to the ED. It will be conducted in hospitals in Australia and New Zealand with
      1000 patients recruited over a 3-year period.

      Each patient meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomised to receive haemodynamic resuscitation using either a restricted fluid and early
      vasopressor regimen (vasopressors arm) or a larger initial fluid resuscitation volume (fluids
      arm) followed by later introduction of vasopressors (if required). The intervention will be
      commenced in the ED and delivered for at least 6 hours, and up to 24 hours post-randomisation
      if admitted to the ICU or other critical care area where the study protocol can be faithfully
      delivered. Treatment will revert to usual care as determined by the treating clinician when
      the patient is transferred to a non-critical care ward. All enrolled participants will be
      followed up and assessed for the defined study outcomes.

      Participants will be identified using a systematic approach to screening and assessment of
      patients with possible sepsis presenting to the ED in accordance with standard clinical
      practice.
