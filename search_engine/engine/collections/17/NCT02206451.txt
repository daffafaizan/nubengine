      ultimate goal of eradication of this disease. VIMTs work by inducing humoral responses in
      vaccinated individuals that inhibit the development of malaria parasites in the mosquito, and
      combined humoral and cellular responses that inhibit the establishment of infection in
      humans. Overall efficacy of these vaccines is evaluated by measuring reduction of infection
      and clinical cases among vaccinees and the parasite infectivity to mosquitoes,
      (human-to-mosquito transmissibility), before and after vaccination, and with or without
      vaccination. One of the candidate VIMTs, the PfSPZ Vaccine, is currently being tested in Mali
      for safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity.

      The objective of this Feeding Assay Protocol is to explore the effect of the PfSPZ Vaccine,
      on interrupting human-to-mosquito transmission. Individuals from the the PfSPZ Vaccine trial
      in 2014 who also consent to be enrolled in this Feeding Assay Protocol will be eligible to
      participate in procedures including direct skin feeds (DSF) and experimental huts (EH). The
      human-to-mosquito transmission will be evaluated by examining the presence of malaria
      parasites in the midgut of mosquitoes fed on study participants. The human-to-mosquito
      transmission by DSF and EH assay methods will be analyzed for potential correlation.
