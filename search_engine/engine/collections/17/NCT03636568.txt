    
      Any adult patient with a pituitary adenoma (either non-functioning, prolactin-secreting,
      growth hormone secreting, gonadotropin secreting, or TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
      secreting) or cyst scheduled to undergo transsphenoidal resection will be included in the
      study. Patients with chronic hyponatremia will be excluded.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      Group 1: these patients will be treated with moderate fluid restriction (1000 ml/24 hours for
      patients <100kg and 1200 ml of fluid/24 hours for >100 kg starting on postoperative day 1.
      Fluid restriction will be aborted if diabetes insipidus occurs. Diabetes insipidus occurs if
      a patient does not produce enough ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) which is needed to concentrate
      the urine. Diabetes insipidus causes increased urination and increased thirst and can cause
      hypernatremia (an increased sodium level). A person will be diagnosed with diabetes insipidus
      if they meet all of the following criteria: serum sodium level > 146, dilute urine with a
      urine specific gravity < 1.003 and increased urine output defined by urine output >
      300cc/hour for 2 consecutive hours( or > 6 liter/24 hours).

      Group 2: these patients will not be placed on fluid restriction, they will be allowed to
      drink water freely after surgery.

      All patients will be started on D5 Â½ normal saline IV fluids (Weight based) and will be
      allowed to eat and drink starting on POD 1.

      All the patients will receive a thirst questionnaire that will be completed daily starting on
      POD 1 until POD 13. The intensity of thirst will be assessed on a scale of 1--10, with 1
      being no thirst, 5 being normal thirst and 10 being unbearable thirst.

      Patients will have basic metabolic panels checked on post-surgical days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 13.
