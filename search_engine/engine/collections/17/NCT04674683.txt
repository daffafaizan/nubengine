    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of HBI-8000
      or Placebo combined with nivolumab. Randomization of eligible patients who are not
      adolescents or patients with new, progressive brain metastasis will be stratified by PD-L1
      expression (positive, â‰¥5% expression level versus negative, <5% expression level) and LDH
      (normal versus elevated). Adolescents and patients with new, progressive brain metastasis
      will be randomized in a separate stratum.

      All Eligible patients will be randomized within the appropriate stratum at a 1:1 ratio to the
      Test arm or the Control arm. Study treatment will be initiated within 3 days of
      randomization.

      A treatment cycle consists of 28 days. Patients will be treated with one of the following:

      Test arm: HBI-8000 30 mg oral BIW + nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W Control arm: Placebo oral BIW +
      nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W The Study Treatment of HBI-8000 or Placebo is administered at 30 mg
      orally twice a week (BIW), approximately 30 minutes after the first standard meal of the day.

      The Study Treatment (HBI-8000 or Placebo) will be administered twice a week on the following
      days of every 28-day cycle:

        -  CxW1: Days 1, 4

        -  CxW2: Days 8, 11

        -  CxW3: Days 15, 18

        -  CxW4: Days 22, 25 Study treatment must commence within 3 days after randomization and
           continue up to 2 years or until disease progression (confirmed), unacceptable toxicity
           or patient withdrawal of consent.

      In addition to Study Treatment, nivolumab is administered at 480 mg IV Q4W as an intravenous
      infusion over 30 minutes in accordance with the manufacturer regional product information
      insert and the institution's prescribing practice. For adolescents weighing < 40 kg,
      nivolumab will be dosed at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.

      Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Note: Adults with new, progressive
      brain metastasis, or adolescents with or without new progressive brain metastasis will be
      randomized as a separate cohort to ensure balanced randomization to the two arms.
