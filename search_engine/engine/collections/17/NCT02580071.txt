      University Hospital. Thereupon, patients will be consecutively recruited to treatment group
      (25 patients) where they will be prescribed Sheng Yu Tang (聖愈湯, SYT) 2 months following HSCT,
      for a period of 6 months, in conjunction with the standard-care treatment. We predict that
      not all patients will be interested in taking SYT, patients which are not interested in
      entering treatment group will be offered to join a control group (25 patients) which will
      receive standard-care treatment.

      Since HSCT patients go through routine blood examinations, this study will request to extract
      a further 20ml of peripheral blood once a month and an additional 20ml of bone marrow at
      beginning of HSCT and the following routine aspirations (est.:0, +3, +6, +9, +12 month). Both
      treatment and control group will be required to contribute peripheral blood and bone marrow
      sample.Blood samples will be collected until patients reach 1-year post-HSCT, and flow
      cytometry will be used to examine the difference in immune reconstitution rate between the
      two groups. As secondary outcome measurements, this study will make use of the minimal
      residual disease (MRD) measured, frequency of opportunistic infections, hospitalizations and
      results of other routine check-up which recorded in patient history.
