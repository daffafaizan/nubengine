      and feelings about what might be best for one's own body and child. Increasing awareness
      about the risks of vaginal delivery has led to an increasing rate of cesearean delivery on
      maternal request.

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate personal attitudes regarding mode of delivery
      among both medical health care professionals and non-professionals. The investigators are
      also investigating whether providing detailed information that might influence one's decision
      regarding mode of delivery (such as education on pelvic floor disorders or advantages or
      disadvantages of epidural anaesthesia) will change participantsÂ´ opinion how to determine
      their preferred mode of delivery.

      A secondary aim of the survey is to gather information about personal attitudes regarding:

        -  epidural anaesthesia for pain relief during delivery

        -  systems of risk stratification

        -  postnatal recovery exercises The data will be acquired with an online questionnaire
           designed for this study. There will be two groups in this study. The first group
           ("medical professionals") consists of gynecologists with either subspecialization
           (urogynecology , fetal and maternal medicine, obstetrics, other) and other non-OB/GYN
           health care providers and medical staff, regardless whether they are nurses, medical
           assistants, physicians, physiotherapists, midwifes, administration staff. The group of
           "non-professionals" consists of women who are currently pregnant, and are not healthcare
           professionals.
