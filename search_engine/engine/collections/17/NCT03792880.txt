      achieved. Telemedicine can be an effective tool to increase CPAP compliance with low cost.

      The researchers propose to carry out a randomized study about patients with severe OSAHS and
      few symptoms, who are expected to have low CPAP compliance.

      The main objective is to evaluate if a telematic control and self-management program can
      increase the compliance with CPAP treatment compared to conventional follow-up, getting at
      least 90% of patients to use CPAP ≥ 4 hours per day.

      Sixty patients from the Pneumology departments of two hospitals, diagnosed with severe OSAHS
      and with few symptoms (Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≤10) will be randomized to two follow-up
      groups, telematic and conventional, for 6 months. Patients in the intervention group
      (telematic monitoring) will collect variables related to symptoms of sleep apnea and side
      effects of CPAP treatment, using their own smartphone or a tablet provided during the study
      if they prefer. Other variables as the hours per day of CPAP use, leaks and residual
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be transmitted daily and automatically from latest generation
      CPAP. All information will be processed and each variable will generate alarms and
      instructions for each patient, allowing the self-management and an early solution of the
      possible problems related to the treatment. Alarms may also be generated in the database if
      the professional intervention is necessary.

      In addition, before starting CPAP treatment and after six months of treatment, patients will
      be monitored during a week with a watch-like device. Variables related to circadian rhythm
      will be collected and analyzed to know the effect of CPAP treatment in both groups (control
      and intervention groups).
