      chronic pain related to peripheral nerve will be enrolled by approximately 30 qualified
      sites. Subjects who are eligible for a StimRouter will be enrolled in order to evaluate the
      subject's experience at pre-implant, the implant, and post-implant for up to 60 months. Based
      on routine care, subjects will be seen at day of implant, within 2 weeks post-implant, 1
      month post-implant, 3 months post-implant, 6 months post-implant, 12 months post-implant, and
      annually thereafter for the duration of the study. Specific assessments will be completed by
      the subject and clinician at these visits.
