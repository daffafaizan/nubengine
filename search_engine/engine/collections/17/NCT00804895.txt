      accompanied by autonomic symptoms and restlessness. Though patients may respond to the
      standard prophylactic treatment of verapamil, some are refractory and continue to suffer from
      numerous attacks, with a limit of two doses of subcutaneous sumatriptan per day. Some
      patients also have contra-indications to standard prophylactic or acute treatments. Other
      preventive treatments like systemic steroids, lithium and methysergide may cause significant
      side effects. We intend to show the efficacy of occipital nerve injections with cortivazol,
      in adjunct to verapamil, in cluster headache patients. We expect a diminution of attack
      frequency over two weeks, with a protocol of three injections separated by two or three days
      each. Tolerance and safety will be examined.
