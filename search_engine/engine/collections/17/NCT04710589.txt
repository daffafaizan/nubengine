      cancer after surgery and radiotherapy will be included in the study if they meet the
      inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria. According to the clinical
      conditions of the patients, they will be assigned to groups A or B according to the doctor's
      recommendations and their own wishes. GTV of both groups are visible tumors. The CTV of group
      A is expanded by 3mm on the basis of GTV, and the CTV of group B is expanded by 6mm. Both
      groups A and B received prescription dose: 95% GTV (120-160) Gy, 95% CTV (90-120) Gy. The
      activities of 125I seeds will be 0.4mCi-0.7mCi. All patients will receive 3D printed
      template-assisted 125I seeds implantation and be followed up. The differences in local
      progression-free survival time, overall survival time, change of quality of life, and side
      effects between different groups will be prospectively analyzed.
