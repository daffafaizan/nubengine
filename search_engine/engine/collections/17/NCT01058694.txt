      effectiveness of ARV therapy (e.g Wools-Kaloustian et al. 2006). There is also evidence in
      that in some treatment programs in Africa, adherence rates are not always high (Gill et al.
      2005). Even in settings where adherence levels are found to be high, numerous factors have
      been identified as being relevant, although the causal effects are unknown (Castro, 2006). As
      ARV treatment programs are scaled up in Africa, it is essential to understand the
      socio-economic determinants of adherence to ARV treatment, as well as the impact of
      interventions to support high levels of adherence. A secondary objective of this study is to
      understand the socio-economic impacts of higher adherence.
