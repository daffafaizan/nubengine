    
      The study is designed as a double-blinded placebo controlled trial. We compare a 4 week
      course of therapy with silymarin tablets and a low-dose vitamin preparation (placebo) and
      then follow-up for a total of 8 weeks to assess treatment response. Outcomes of our
      randomized controlled trial are improvement in symptoms and signs, normalization of liver
      functions, time to resuming normal activities, and and sense of well-being. This protocol
      follows the standard therapeutic care for acute hepatitis except that the patients will
      receive either a herbal supplement (silymarin), which many patients are taking anyway, or a
      vitamin placebo.

      Freshly collected serum will be tested for anti-HAV IgM, anti-HBc Igm, anti-HBs, HBs Ag,
      anti-HCV antibody, HCV-RNA, anti-HDV IgM, anti-HEV IgM, CMV and EBV and for alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), AST, direct and total bilirubin.
