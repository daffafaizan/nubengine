    
      Subjects identified to receive a robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.were randomized
      to either a 16 French or 20 French catheter at the completion of the prostatectomy. All
      prostatectomies were performed by one of three surgeons at the investigator's institution.
      Preoperative demographics and operative data were recorded for each group. Catheters remained
      in place for 7-14 days. Subjects were asked on postoperative day 7 to report their
      catheter-related pain and amount of opioid medication used. Urinary symptoms and quality of
      life scores and pads per day were recorded at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-operatively.
