      injection pressure influences the spread of a given volume of injectate in the adductor
      canal, during adductor canal nerve block. The study population will be patients undergoing
      elective anterior cruciate ligament repair in the distal lower extremity and receiving
      preoperative adductor canal nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia. They will be randomized
      into two groups of 25 patients each. The investigators speculate that high injection
      pressures (>20 psi) will lead to greater spread of local anesthetic than low injection
      pressures (<15 psi) during mid-thigh adductor canal nerve blocks. The primary endpoint is the
      spread of injectate, defined as the distance between the uppermost and lowermost limits of
      spread of local anesthetic as assessed by ultrasound. The secondary endpoints are the
      incidence of femoral and sciatic nerve blocks 30 minutes after block placement, amount of IV
      opioid administered intraoperatively and postoperatively, preoperative and postoperative pain
      (Numeric Rating Scale, 0-10), and postoperative physical therapy milestone achievement.
