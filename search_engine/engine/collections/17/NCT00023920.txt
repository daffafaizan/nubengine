      I. Determine the anti-leukemic activity of bevacizumab, idarubicin, and cytarabine in
      patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      effect of bevacizumab on angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes once on day -13. Patients then receive
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes and idarubicin IV on days 1 and 15 and cytarabine
      subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a
      maximum of 3 courses. Patients with responding disease receive maintenance therapy comprising
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15, idarubicin IV on day 1, and cytarabine SC
      once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
