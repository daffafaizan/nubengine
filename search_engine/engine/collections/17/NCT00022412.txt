        -  Determine whether doxercalciferol modulates intermediate endpoint biomarkers in the
           development of prostate cancer in patients with localized prostate cancer.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxercalciferol once daily for 28 days. Patients then undergo
           prostatectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation for 28 days. Patients then undergo prostatectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      18 months.
