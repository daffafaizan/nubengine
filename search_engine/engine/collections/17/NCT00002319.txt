    
      Patients receive DOX-SL every 3 weeks for a maximum of 20 cycles (including any cycles from a
      previous DOX-SL study). KS lesions are evaluated prior to administration of each treatment,
      at the end of the final treatment cycle, and at 4 weeks following the end of the final
      treatment. Patients who respond will be followed every 2 months for up to 1 year. Study
      treatment may be interrupted for up to 4 months because of complete response, development of
      opportunistic infections, or adverse drug effects.
