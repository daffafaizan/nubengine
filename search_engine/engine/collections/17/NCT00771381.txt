      pre-treatment in viva and in vitro hypoxia could allow patient selection for more aggressive
      therapy or clinical trails focused on targeting hypoxia. We will use the PET radiotracer
      18F-FAZA to monitor hypoxia in the protocol. We will study pathological characteristics on
      the final tumour restriction specimen and correlate prognostic and predictive factors with
      PET scan data. Tumour banking is optional.
