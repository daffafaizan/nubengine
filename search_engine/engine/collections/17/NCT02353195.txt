    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: University community.

      Patients with myofascial chronic neck pain with active MTrP in one upper trapezius muscle
      were involved. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: a radiofrequency group
      (RFG), who (14 patients) received 8 sessions of a monopolar capacitive resistive
      radiofrequency (MCRRF) application over the upper trapezius muscle and ten patients received
      8 sessions of placebo radiofrequency (PG) over the same muscle. Main outcome measures: Visual
      analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI) and cervical range of motion (pre-treatment,
      immediately post-first session treatment and post-treatment.
