    
      To evaluate the long-term effects of 10 sessions of spinal manipulative therapy applied in a
      vertebral region-specific or region nonspecific level immediately after treatment and 3 and 6
      months after randomization.

      148 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain will be enrolled for this clinical
      trial. Patients will undergo to a specific physical examination in order to determine the
      ideal lumbar spine level to be manipulated. The outcomes of interest are pain intensity, pain
      pressure threshold, global perceived effect and disability associated with back pain. After
      the first assessment patients will be randomly assigned to two groups that will receive 10
      sessions of spinal manipulation over a period of four weeks, and may receive manipulation
      according to the findings on physical examination (specific manipulation) or may receive
      manipulation in the upper thoracic region, disregarding the physical examination findings
      (nonspecific manipulation).
