    
      Upon determination of eligibility, neo-adjuvant patients will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment arms:

        -  ARM A Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy + Surgery

        -  ARM B Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Surgery

      After surgery neo-adjuvant patients with a complete resection will either receive Paclitaxel
      + Carboplatin or no therapy, depending on their stage of disease at time of enrollment.
      Patients with incomplete resection Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy. Adjuvant
      patients who enter the study after complete resection will receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin
      with or without Radiation Therapy based on initial stage of disease.
