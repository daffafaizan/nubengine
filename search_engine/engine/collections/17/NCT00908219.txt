      (Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for a total of twelve (12) weeks on study. The primary
      endpoint will be time to the need for repeat abdominal paracentesis after the start of
      therapy. Secondary endpoints will include an analysis of the mean number of paracenteses
      required in each subject over the course of 3 months, determination of the repeat
      paracentesis response rate (proportion of subjects who have a doubling in baseline time to
      repeat paracentesis) and an assessment of the effect of treatment on quality of life using a
      subject questionnaire.
