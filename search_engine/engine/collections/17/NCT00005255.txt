      Previous studies have demonstrated that abdominal obesity can be predictive of ischemic heart
      disease. These prospective cohort studies employed simple indices of body-fat distribution
      such as waist-to-hip circumference ratio or subscapular skinfold. Their similar results
      suggested that increased abdominal obesity conferred a two-fold increased risk of ischemic
      heart disease among middle-aged men. The two proposed studies permitted testing of
      alternative fat-distribution indices which might be stronger risk factors for ischemic heart
      disease incidence than the waist-to-hip-ratio or the subscapular skinfold.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Two parallel case-control studies were conducted. In both studies, subjects were measured for
      girth, skinfold, abdominal sagittal diameter, height, and weight. Analyses for both protocols
      considered men and women separately. Possible confounders of the association between
      fat-distribution indices and ischemic heart disease were considered and if required, adjusted
      for in multivariate analyses. Possible confounders included race, age, tobacco use, alcohol
      use, diabetes, social class, hypertension, cholesterol levels, and physical activity levels.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
