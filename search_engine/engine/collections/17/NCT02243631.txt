      drug probenecid significantly decrease ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels in the
      synovial fluid of patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). The
      investigators have considerable evidence that synovial fluid ATP levels are high in patients
      with this disease and these high levels lead to calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal formation
      which then produces acute and chronic arthritis. The investigators have identified the
      transmembrane protein known as ANK as the chief regulator of ATP levels in and around
      cartilage. Probenecid blocks function of ANK in vitro. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if probenecid used at normal doses are sufficient to block ANK function in vivo and
      whether this results in reduced ATP and PPi levels in synovial fluid.

      Research design: This is a randomized un-controlled trial of probenecid vs. no drug in
      patients with a joint effusion and known CPPD.

      Methodology: Power analysis based on an 80% chance to show a 20% difference in ATP levels in
      the treatment group resulted in a sample size of 20 patients in each group. Patients with
      known CPPD and a joint effusion will have an arthrocentesis to remove 2 ml of synovial fluid
      from their joint. Fluid will be sent to the investigators' research laboratory and ATP and
      PPi levels will be measured. Patients will be randomized to treatment with 2 grams/day of
      probenecid or no therapy. After 5 days, the remainder of the joint fluid will be removed and
      tested for ATP and PPi levels. The investigators will compare differences in ATP and PPi
      levels in the probenecid treated and the untreated group.
