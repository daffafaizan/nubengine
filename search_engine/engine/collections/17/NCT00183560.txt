      and reduce the overall quality of life. Relapses in depressive episodes are common and may
      result in a patient's reluctance to follow a treatment regimen, thus making the episode more
      severe. Safe and effective therapies to prevent depression relapse are needed. This study
      will compare three different approaches to determine which is most effective in preventing
      relapses in depressive episodes.

      This study will comprise 2 parts. In Part 1, all participants will receive antidepressant
      medication for 6 months. Participants whose depression symptoms do not improve will complete
      their study participation at the end of Part 1. Participants who respond to their regimen
      will be enrolled in Part 2. This part will last 18 months. During Part 2, participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Participants in Group 1 will continue the drug
      regimen they began in Part 1. Participants in Group 2 will discontinue their antidepressants
      and attend an 8-week relapse prevention program. This MBCT program is designed to help
      participants learn skills that can increase their awareness and change their reaction to
      stressful events. Participants in Group 3 will have their antidepressant medication from
      Phase 1 switched to a placebo without their knowledge. Self-report scales will be used to
      assess the depressive symptoms of participants at the beginning of the study, at the end of
      Phase 1, and at the end of the study, after Phase 2.
