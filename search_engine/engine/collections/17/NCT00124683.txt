      individuals to aid in smoking cessation has been encouraging. The purpose of this study is to
      compare bupropion SR to a placebo to determine its effectiveness when used in combination
      with an NTP to help schizophrenic individuals quit smoking.

      Participants in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the NTP (21 mg/day) and placebo or the NTP and bupropion SR (300 mg/day).
      Participants will begin taking one pill each day of bupropion SR (150 mg/day) or placebo at
      the start of the second week of the study. After three days, the dose of bupropion SR or
      placebo will increase to 2 pills each day. Participants will continue this dosing regimen
      until the end of Week 10. Throughout the 10-week study, participants will receive weekly
      group therapy.
