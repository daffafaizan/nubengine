      investigators have seen that the therapy has acute effects which resulted in better knee
      function and later even in better healing of the ACL injury. This study should clear exactly
      which effects and pathways are involved in the therapy from multiple (interdisciplinary)
      point of views. Therefore the investigators will measure parameters that might be associated
      with this special technique directly before and after the therapy.
