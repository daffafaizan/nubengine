      aortic dissection, rheumatic heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, which may be a
      new marker for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of these diseases. However, there is
      few relevant studies about the Tenascin-C concentration in patients with acute coronary
      syndrome.This study valuates the serum Tenascin-C concentration in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome.
