      ultrasound for the diagnosis of adnexal torsion in women with suspected adnexal torsion.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To describe the perfusion parameters of the ovaries by contrast enhanced ultrasound

        2. To compare performance diagnosis of contrast ultrasound and bidimensional Doppler for
           the detection of adnexal torsion.

        3. To describe the perfusion parameters of the ovarian as a function of the degree of
           adnexal torsion.
