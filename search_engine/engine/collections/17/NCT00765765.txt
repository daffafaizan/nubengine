        -  The primary objective of this study is to assess the antitumor activity, measured by
           tumor response rate, in patients who receive this regimen as a third-line treatment.
           (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To measure the duration of response for responding patients.

        -  To measure the time to progressive disease.

        -  To measure survival time.

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To develop pharmacodynamic markers for autophagy detection in patient specimens.

        -  To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine on autophagy in patients in vivo.

        -  To investigate whether the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 status
           of breast tumors correlates with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of ixabepilone followed by a
      phase II study.

      During the first course, patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral
      hydroxychloroquine twice daily on days 3-21. On all subsequent courses, patients receive
      ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.
