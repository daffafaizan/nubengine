    
      A novel questionnaire (the "Oral symptom assessment scale" / OSAS) has been developed to
      assess a range of oral symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.

      The OSAS consists of 20 symptoms, which were chosen following a review of the literature /
      discussion with experts in the field. The OSAS was modelled on the Memorial Symptom
      Assessment Scale (MSAS), and asks about the presence of the symptoms, the frequency of the
      symptoms (i.e. "rarely"; "occasionally"; "frequently"; or "almost constantly"), the severity
      of the symptoms (i.e. "slight"; "moderate"; "severe"; or "very severe"), and how much
      distress they cause (i.e. "not at all"; "a little bit"; "somewhat"; "quite a bit"; or "very
      much"). The questions relate to the last week.

      Patients will be given the OSAS to complete, and also the short form of the MSAS (which asks
      about the presence, and related distress, of 32 physical / psychological symptoms, including
      a small number of oral symptoms). Demographic data, cancer diagnosis, and performance status
      will also be collected. The study involves a single visit / assessment.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to present the data, and hierarchical cluster analysis
      will be used to identify oral symptom clusters. Kappa tests will be used to compare analogous
      questions on the OSAS and short form MSAS (as part of the validation of the OSAS).
