      resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapy.

      However, HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages in Korea. Especially, HCCs with portal
      vein invasion are unresectable and they are not suitable for other curative therapies. For
      these patients, the optimal treatment remains largely controversial. As a palliative
      treatment, the benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown in patients
      with unresectable HCC and without portal vein invasion by several trials. In patients with
      main portal vein invasion, TACE is theoretically contraindicated because of the potential
      risk of hepatic failure resulting from ischemia after TACE. However, recent studies have
      revealed that TACE could safely be performed in these patients.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
      with adriamycin to transarterial chemoembolization with adriamycin/transarterial
      chemoinfusion (TACI) with cisplatin combination in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with
      portal vein invasion.
