    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the
      safety, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and PK, of TIMP-GLIA in subjects with well-controlled
      celiac disease (CD) following an oral gluten challenge. Subjects aged 18 to 70 years
      inclusive, with documented history of biopsy-proven confirmed CD, and on a gluten-free diet
      (GFD) for a minimum of 6 months, will be screened. Subjects who meet all inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria, and provide written informed consent, will be randomized within 45 days
      after Screening to receive 2 intravenous (IV) infusions of TIMP-GLIA, 8 mg/kg up to a maximum
      of 650 mg or placebo (normal saline) in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment with drug or placebo will be
      followed by 14 days gluten challenge.
