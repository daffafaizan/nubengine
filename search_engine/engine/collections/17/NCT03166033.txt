      which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to paresthesia, numbness and
      muscle weakness in the hand. It's the most common neuro-compressive disease. With the
      development of the modern life, the morbidity of CTS is also raised. As a common disease, the
      study on etiology is very important in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which can improve the life
      quality of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The risk factors include individual factors
      such as age, gender, diabetes, Hypothyroidism, obesity, complication of systematic diseases,
      tobacco, injury and occupational factors.

      As most of the research were based on the population in western country and the life style
      and the ethnicity between Chinese people and western country people is quite different, there
      may be some similarities and differences in epidemiology. There is seldom similar research in
      China so that this study was conducted to observe the characteristics of these risk factors
      in Chinese population.
