      I. To evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging for
      complete remission (CR) in patients receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging for
      complete remission.

      II. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of FLT PET/CT at complete remission
      detection.

      III. To evaluate pre-treatment FLT PET/CT activity as a predictor of complete remission.

      IV. To evaluate the change between pre-treatment and post-treatment FLT PET/CT activity as a
      predictor of complete remission.

      V. To correlate post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging parameters with day 28 bone marrow
      aspirate/biopsy and minimal residual disease assessment by flow cytometry.

      VI. To correlate FLT PET/CT imaging parameters (maximum FLT uptake across the total bone
      marrow compartment [SUVmax], mean FLT uptake across the total bone marrow compartment
      [SUVmean], heterogeneity) with biologic correlates (minimal residual disease [MRD]
      assessment).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anthracycline intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV on days 1-7
      for up to 2 courses. Patients then undergo FLT PET/CT within 3 days before or after the nadir
      bone marrow biopsy (between days 10-17 after initiation of first induction cycle and prior to
      reinduction). Patients may undergo an optional FLT PET/CT prior to induction chemotherapy if
      it does not interfere with commencement of treatment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at day 28-35.
