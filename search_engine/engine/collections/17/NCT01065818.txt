      ability-PET to identify pathCR patients who have esophageal carinoma or non-small cell lung
      cancer and undergo Neoadjuvant Therapy (Chemoradiotherapy, Chemotherapy or Radiation Therapy)
      prior to surgery. Achievement in pathCR after pre-operative Neoadjuvant Therapy is associated
      with improved patient outcomes; however, there is no effective method to predict pathological
      response before surgery. Thus, a patient with pathCR , for whom esophagectomy or thoracoscopy
      may be unnecessary, still undergoes surgery and faces the prohibitive side effects of this
      surgical procedure. Additionally, Neoadjuvant Therapy is associated with considerable
      morbidities and tool to predict and avoid ineffective therapy are lacking. Because
      deregulated proliferation is one of the hallmarks of cancer and its proliferation rate is
      associated with aggressive biologic behavior and response to therapy, imaging the
      proliferative state of cancer cells by non-invasive functional imaging is of great interest.
      Recently 18F-FLT (3'deoxy33'-18F- ﬂuorothymidine) has been reported as a promising PET
      radiopharmaceutical for imaging cancer proliferation and has been validated in several in
      vitro & in vivo models. However, only a few studies addressed its role in depicting changes
      in cancer proliferation and assessing response to Neoadjuvant Therapy, and none of these
      studies have focused on esophageal cancer and lung cancer. We propose to conduct a pilot
      study to learn the optimal FLT PET imaging timepoint during the early course of Neoadjuvant
      Therapy that has the highest predictive value for pathCR in patients with esophageal cancer
      or lung cancer.
