      adequate growth following early therapy of primary infection (initiated HAART during primary
      infection at less than 13 months of age) will not compromise clinical status or growth and
      may spare antiretroviral toxicity.

      Specific Aim/Primary Objective: To compare growth and morbidity in infants (who initiated
      HAART during primary infection at less than or equal to 13 months of age with subsequently
      normalized CD4% and growth following 24 months of HAART) randomized to deferred versus
      continuous therapy and followed for an additional 18 months.

      Secondary Aim/Secondary Objective: To determine predictors of non-progression of HIV among
      the infants, including: age, adherence, HIV-1 specific immune responses, baseline HIV-1 RNA,
      CD4 percent and immune activation.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial involving HIV-1 treatment of infants (<13 months old) for
      24 months, followed by randomization and 18 months follow-up of children randomized to
      continued versus deferred treatment. This trial is unblinded.

      Population: HIV-1 infected infants (<13 months) newly initiating HAART and HIV-1 infected
      infants already receiving HAART who initiated HAART at age <13 months will be enrolled. After
      24 months of treatment follow-up, children with CD4% > 25% and normalized growth will be
      retained in the study and randomized.

      Sample size: 150 infants will be enrolled of which 100 are expected to be eligible for
      randomization (50 in each arm).

      Treatment: All infants will be treated with HAART according to WHO and Kenyan national
      guidelines. The specific regimens that will be used as a part of this study are:

      First line regimen

        -  AZT/3TC/NVP (zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)

        -  d4T/3TC/NVP (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)

        -  AZT/3TC/ABC (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir)

        -  d4T/3TC/ABC (stavudine/lamivudine/abacavir)

        -  ABC/3TC/NVP (abacavir/lamivudine/nevirapine)

      Second line regimen - ddI/ABC/LPV/r (didanosine/abacavir/lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra))

      For infants with prior exposure to nevirapine as part of PMTCT:

      First line regimen

      - AZT/3TC/LPV/r (zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir (kaletra))
