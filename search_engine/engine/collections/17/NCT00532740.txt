        -  Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
           (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients who are not candidates for surgical resection of
           metastatic intrahepatic carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with yttrium Y 90 glass
           microspheres treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) into the liver tumor through
      a percutaneously placed catheter into the hepatic artery. Patients may receive additional
      therapy 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 weeks, 30 days, and then once a
      year for approximately 2 years.
