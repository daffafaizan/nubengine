      especially in target volume definition and after the treatment, in turn, the combination of
      MRI and [18F]FET-PET is diagnostically most useful to distinguish between radiation necrosis
      and a real progressive disease.

      The response to therapy is based on the newly formulated Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
      (RANO) criteria. Kinetic and static [18F]FET-PET scans are useful to supplement this modality
      and its own prognostic value concerning relapsing patients will be examined.

      The special feature of this study is the use of both modalities in parallel, allowing
      simultaneous acquisition of morphological changes, functional and molecular imaging.

      Secondary methodological issues are dealt with, such as the relationship between contrast
      uptake, perfusion and [18F]FET uptake. In this regard, the hybrid imaging may serve for
      hypothesis generation, as in parallel in a unique way of contrast enhancement and tracer
      kinetics can be investigated (simultaneous contrast-enhanced analysis and tracer
      application).

      In particular, FET kinetics are examined in more detail (for example, differences between
      increasing and decreasing kinetics) to find ways of how to use certain MRI sequences for
      better visualization of viable tumor tissue and vice versa .
