      I. To evaluate if the proposed patient care strategy, that includes use of simplified
      guidelines along with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) expert support, decreases the
      one-month induction mortality rate from 30% to under 15%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival 1 year after accrual is completed. II. To assess incidence
      and severity of differentiation syndrome. III. To correlate outcomes with time to initiation
      of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) from diagnosis or suspicion of diagnosis.

      IV. To compare outcomes between academic and community centers separately. V. To evaluate
      factors associated with outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care treatment for APL. Patients? doctors regularly discuss with
      an APL expert to identify and mange treatment.

      After diagnosis, patients are followed up for 1 year.
