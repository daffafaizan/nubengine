      with solid tumors that are refractory to standard chemotherapy.

      The study will take place in two stages. In both stages, patients will receive sunitinib
      orally with food once daily for 4 weeks and bortezomib by injection into a vein once a week
      for 4 weeks. This will be followed by 2 weeks of rest. This 6-week period is called one
      cycle.

      In stage 1, a maximum of 10 patients will be treated sequentially with increasing doses of
      sunitinib (and a fixed dose of bortezomib). Each dose level must be well tolerated for the
      next patient to start treatment at the next dose level. Whichever is the highest dose of
      sunitinib that is well tolerated will then be used for the next stage.

      In stage 2, a maximum of 20 patients will be treated sequentially with increasing doses of
      bortezomib (and a fixed dose of sunitinib). Each dose level must be well tolerated for the
      next patient to start treatment at the next dose level.

      Together, the two stages will determine the highest doses of both sunitinib and bortezomib
      that are well tolerated when given this combination. Determining these optimal doses is the
      primary aim of this study. Patients will also be followed to see whether their tumor responds
      to the treatment.

      If a patient's cancer remains stable or improves, they can repeat the treatment cycles. There
      is no defined end date to this study since patients will be followed for the duration of
      their survival.
