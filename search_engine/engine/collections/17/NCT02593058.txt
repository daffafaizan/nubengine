      capacity to experience (apathy, anhedonia) from those which are associated with a limited
      capacity for expression (emotional blunting, alogia). The apathy-anhedonia syndrome tends to
      be associated with a poorer prognosis than the symptoms related to diminished expression,
      suggesting that it is the more severe facet of the psychopathology. However the efficacy of
      drug-based treatments and psychological interventions on primary negative symptoms remains
      limited. There is a clear clinical need for developing treatments for negative symptoms.

      The Positive Emotions Programs for Schizophrenia (PEPS) teaches skills to help overcome
      defeatist thinking and to increase the anticipation and maintenance of positive emotions.
      PEPS involves eight one-hour group sessions, administered using visual and audio materials as
      part of a PowerPoint presentation of slides projected onto a screen.

      The goal of the study is to establish if PEPS is clinically effective by using a randomized,
      controlled and assessor-blind trial. A combination of PEPS plus treatment as usual will be
      compared to treatment as usual alone. Participants diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum
      disorder will undergo either intervention for eight weeks. Testing will evaluate individuals'
      current psychopathology and ability to savor pleasure and will be performed at the time of
      inclusion, at the end of the eight-week intervention and at six month follow-up.
