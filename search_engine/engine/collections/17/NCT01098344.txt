    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of MK0752 in combination with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in patients with unresectable stage III and IV pancreatic cancer. (Phase
           I)

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time to disease progression and 6 months and 1-year survival.

        -  To determine the percentage of change in CA19-9 levels.

      Tertiary

        -  To assess target inhibition of MK0752 in plasma.

        -  To explore the feasibility of measuring MK0752 levels in tumor tissue.

        -  To establish relationships between measures of tumor expression of molecular target and
           objective tumor response.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of MK0752 in plasma when administered with and
           without gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of MK0752 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients receive oral
      MK0752 on days -14, -7, 1, 8, 15, and 22 in course 1 only and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      beginning in course 2 and for all subsequent courses. Treatment with MK0752 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride repeats every 28 days* for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The first course is 42 days.

      Patients undergo biopsy of tumor at baseline and on day -7. Tumor samples are analyzed to
      determine Notch pathway inhibition via IHC and qualitative RT-PCR analysis and for MK0752
      concentrations. Hair follicle (from the head) samples are collected at baseline and on day -7
      to determine Notch pathway inhibition via RT-PCR. Blood samples are collected periodically to
      determine changes in CA 19-9 levels and MK0752 concentrations.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days and then every 2
      months for 1 year. Patients will then be followed up as part of their normal clinic visits
      for up to one year after the last patient was treated on the study.
