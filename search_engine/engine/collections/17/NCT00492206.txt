      NSCLC treated with cetuximab with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed by consolidation
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin/cetuximab. This is a multicenter study including 36
      subjects who will be males and females, both greater than 18 years of age. All subjects will
      initially receive radiation and cetuximab. Radiation will be given once a day (Monday-Friday)
      for approximately 6-8 weeks. During the course of radiation, cetuximab will be given
      intravenously once a week. Approximately 4-6 weeks after the last radiation dose, the
      subjects will be treated with chemotherapy, paclitaxel/carboplatin. Chemotherapy will be
      given intravenously once every 3 weeks for 3 cycles (1 cycle=3 weeks). Cetuximab intravenous
      administration will be continued throughout the entire study, once a week through week 26
      including during chemotherapy.
