      mortality. Attributing to its insidious onset and rapid progress, 70% of patients with
      gastric cancer were initially diagnosed at an advanced stage. In advanced gastric cancer,
      systemic treatment based on chemotherapy drugs, targeted drugs, and immune checkpoint
      inhibitors remains the main regimens. Among current standard treatment regimens, though
      HER2-positive and MSI-H/dMMR statuses indicate the treatment efficacy of trastuzumab and
      immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is still lack of robust biomarkers for predicting
      treatment efficacy. Tumor microenvironment as pivotal components of solid tumor,
      significantly influences therapeutic response and clinical outcome. The study is a
      single-center, observational study to evaluate the relationship between standard treatment
      efficacy and the tumor microenvironment in advanced gastric cancer. In addition, the study
      comprehensively evaluated the landscape of the tumor microenvironment characteristics of
      gastric cancer, and aimed at establishing robust biomarkers for predicting prognosis and
      treatment efficacy to finetune treatment strategies. Eligible subjects were selected
      according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. After successful screening, the
      patients were treated following the clinical guidelines and the actual conditions. The
      residual tissue samples of the primary tumor or metastatic foci were collected to conduct the
      tumor microenvironment detection analysis.
