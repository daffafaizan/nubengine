      ADL); Comorbidities; ICU-Admission (e.g. SOFA), ICU-Treatment, Survival (30 day and 3 months)

      Data are collected electronically through an e-CRF and with baseline documentation of the
      ICU. The database is located in Denmark, at the Department of Epidemiology, University of
      Aarhus. Each ICU will only have access through the database of their own patients, and
      patient ID is not registered (Names, birth-date or social security numbers) so it is in that
      sense anonymous.

      The goal is to recruit at up to 400 ICUs that will continuously collect data. Each center
      aims to recruit 20 patients, but more patients per center are possible.

      The COVIP Study has two diferent recruitment periods. Period 1 (march to May 2020) has
      finished representing the first wave of the pandemic in most countries. The second
      recruitment period has been definded beinng from Septmeber 1st to December 31st 2020
      representing the second wave in most countries.
