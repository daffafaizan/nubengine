    
      This trial will consist of 3 visits : Pretest and posttest.

        -  Pretest measurements (week 0)

           o Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups
           (n=400) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X) during 7 entire days prior to
           baseline measurements. (Timing : July 2018-July 2019)

           o Baseline measurements : during the start up moment of the program all participants
           from intervention and control groups will be asked : (Timing : July 2018-July 2019)

             -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey) : the survey is composed of
                existing validated scales : IPAQ, PSQI, SF-12, WEMWBS, HAQ-DI. (references of
                validated scales are provided in the 'outcome measures' section)

             -  To perform a walk test over 20 meters in order to determine the individual stride
                length

             -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and
                physical fitness (by Borg Scale) and to determine the individual entry level of the
                program (entry levels vary between 1-12)

             -  To wear the Pedometer (Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) on a daily basis and register
                the amount of daily steps in their personal registration forms

        -  Posttest measurements (week 12)

             -  Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups
                (n=400) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X®) during 7 days prior to
                posttest measurements. (Timing : September 2018 - December 2019)

             -  Posttest measurements : at the end of the program all participants will be asked :

      (Timing : September 2018 - December 2019)

        -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey). In addition to the pretest
           questionnaire, the validated scales ILI, Mael and Ashford (1992) and BREQ-3 will be
           added and will be filled out only by participants of the intervention groups

        -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and
           physical fitness (by Borg Scale)

        -  To inform the investigators on the amount of daily steps (measured with pedometer type :
           Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) during the 12 week program o Focus groups : a subsample
           will be invited to take part in focus groups. During these focus groups, participants
           will be encouraged to discuss the program and possible effects in small groups (5
           participants per group). A semi-structured interview guide will be used to guide the
           discussions.
