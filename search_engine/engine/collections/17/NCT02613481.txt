      affected individuals. Poly-L-Lactic Acid (Sculptraâ„¢) stimulates collagen production in the
      skin thereby replenishing some of the collagen lost to natural aging and ultraviolet damage.
      This study will assess the emotional and functional benefits of Poly-L-Lactic Acid treated
      subject's through self report measurement tools.
