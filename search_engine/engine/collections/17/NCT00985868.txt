      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Aurora kinase inhibitor AT9283 by
           characterizing the dose-limiting toxicities in children and adolescents with relapsed
           and refractory solid tumors.

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To demonstrate the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of this regimen in these patients by
           studying its effects in surrogate tissue.

        -  To assess preliminary evidence of activity of this regimen by using appropriate
           objective tumor measurements in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To demonstrate the PD activity of this regimen in these patients by studying its effects
           in both surrogate and tumor tissue (skin punch, bone marrow, and tumor biopsies).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive Aurora kinase inhibitor AT9283 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.If a patient is benefiting from treatment with AT9283 (i.e. has stable
      or responding disease as measured by RECIST) and the benefit risk balance is considered
      acceptable then further treatment may be given.

      Blood and skin tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during treatment for
      pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacodynamic and biomarker (M30, M65, pHH53, p53, PCNA and
      Ki67) analysis by IHC and ELISA assays.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
