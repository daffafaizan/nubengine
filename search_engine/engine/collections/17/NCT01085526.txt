    
      The investigators are recruiting 30 participants, which are randomized to receive SCIT (24)
      or no treatment (6) The following will be measured

        -  the development of immunoglobulin response

        -  plasma cells under updosing phase

        -  changes in basophil activity under updosing and maintenance treatment

        -  subtyping of allergic sensitization

        -  clinical outcome and quality of life

        -  changes in mast cells in the nasal mucosa

        -  changes in the cell biology of the basophils
