      medical cause of disability in adults. The outcome can be improved by early treatment with
      thrombolysis. Alteplase (r-tPA) is the only approved thrombolytic drug in the indication of
      acute ischemic stroke. However, the use of alteplase is currently restricted by the need to
      administer it within 3 hours of symptom onset. As the risk of transforming a cerebral infarct
      into haemorrhage probably rises as the time elapsed increases, a thrombolytic drug that
      carries a lower risk of haemorrhage than alteplase may offer a wider time-to-treatment window
      and improve the safety profile.

      Desmoteplase (DSPA) with its high fibrin specificity, lack of neurotoxicity, potential
      neuroprotective effect, non-activation by ÃŸ-amyloid, and long terminal half-life may account
      for an improved safety and efficacy profile within the first 9 hours after onset of symptoms.
