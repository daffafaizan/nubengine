      Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) combined with a smartphone-based
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for negative symptoms called, Mobile-assisted Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy for Negative Symptoms (mCBTn) can reduce defeatist performance attitudes
      in consumers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with persistent moderate-to-severe
      experiential negative symptoms.The project will also identify the optimal dose to engage the
      defeatist attitude target. Pupillary responses, an objective psychophysiological biomarker of
      effort, will be recorded during a cognitive task as a secondary outcome to determine its
      potential as an end point in clinical trials of motivation and effort.
