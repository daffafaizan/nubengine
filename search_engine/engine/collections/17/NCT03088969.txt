      literature, which recommend a double translation, then a double back - translation with
      synthesis of the data in every stage. A final commission deliberate then a final translation,
      culturally adapted.

      The second stage: the RTWSE is given to the patients with a Chronic Back Pain in the program
      of functional restoration of the rachis. Questionnaire FABQ, BARBECUE and Quebec are also
      given to the patient to obtain the status "faith" and the "functional" status. The
      questionnaire JDI as well as the analog visual scale is given to estimate the global
      professional satisfaction. The pain is estimated by a digital scale. The score IPAQ allows to
      estimate the level of physical activity of the patients. The HAD allows to estimate the level
      of anxiety and depression of the patients.

      The additional questionnaires used for several reasons: in routine for the evaluation of the
      patients with a Chronic Back Pain; to characterize the patients and within the framework of
      the study for the validity of convergence and difference of questionnaires RTWSE 10 and 19
      items.

      The third stage: the questionnaire RTWSE is given again to the patient at 72 hours interval
      while the state of the patient is considered as stable.

      The fourth stage: the questionnaires are given at J21 and in 2 months apart for the study of
      the sensibility in the change with the FABQ, BARBECUE, Quebec and the IPAQ.
