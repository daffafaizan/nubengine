      preconditioning (CICP) intervention group and the control group. (the Statistical Analysis
      System (SAS) software was used to generate a random number table and randomly divided into
      two groups). After the establishment of the cardiopulmonary bypass, the ascending aorta of
      the CICP group will be crossclamped 2 minutes, separated by a 3-minute rest interval, and
      repeated successively on 2 occasions.

      The recipients in the control group are to undergo routine cardiopulmonary bypass procedure
      of heart transplantation.
