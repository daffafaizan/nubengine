      alleviate PHE and secondary brain injury, thus improving clinical outcomes in patients with
      ICH. The investigators will enroll 60 acute supratentorial ICH patients. Patients will be
      assigned randomly to receive either Deproteinised Calf Blood Serum Injection or placebo
      treatment, which is blinded to evaluator and patients. All patients in the study will receive
      standard care treatment and clinical, diagnostic, laboratory, safety, and follow-up
      evaluations. Blood will be drawn and brain MRI will be done in different time course.
      Follow-up evaluations, including National Institute of Health stroke scale(NIHSS), Stroke
      impact scale , Glasgow Coma Scale ,Barthel index score and modified Rankin scale assessments,
      will be done periodically until 90 days after onset.
