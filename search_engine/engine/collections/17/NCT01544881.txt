    
      Subjects with Type 1 diabetes will be randomized to either one dose of TI inhaled using the
      Gen2C device, or one dose of subcutaneously injected Rapid Acting Analog (RAA) and crossed
      over.

      Crossover Sequences:

      Sequence #1: Period 1 - one 20 U cartridge of TI; Period 2 - 8 U of RAA

      Sequence #2: Period 1 - 8 U RAA; Period 2 - one 20 U cartridge of TI

      An euglycemic clamp procedure will be performed at each dosing visit. The purpose of this
      study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the one dose of TI Inhalation Powder
      using the Gen2C inhaler as compared to one dose of subcutaneous RAA.
