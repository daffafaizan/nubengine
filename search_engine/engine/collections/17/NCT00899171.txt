        -  To determine whether the expression of previously identified acute myeloid leukemia
           (AML)-specific and age-associated genes have prognostic significance in adult patients
           with AML.

        -  To examine, preliminarily, if AML-specific and age-associated expression changes occur
           in the most primitive hematopoietic leukemia blasts (i.e., CD34+/38-).

        -  To examine, preliminarily, whether methylation or histone modification of the IRF8 CPG
           island/promoter region is correlated with IRF8 gene expression in AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected specimens of RNA from pre-treatment marrow or peripheral blood are
      obtained from a repository of SWOG clinical trials (SWOG-S9031, SWOG-9126, SWOG-9333, and
      SWOG-9500). Samples are analyzed for absolute expression levels of 23 selected genes and
      relative expression levels of splice variants via quantitative RT/PCR and GeneScan assays and
      linked to clinical and outcome data from the main SWOG database. Samples from a subset of
      patients are analyzed to confirm aberrant expression of acute myeloid leukemia-specific and
      age-associated genes in highly enriched population of leukemic blasts (CD34+/CD38- and
      CD34+/CD38+). DNA samples are also analyzed for correlation of IRF8 gene expression with
      methylation or histone modification of the IRF8 CPG island/promoter region.
