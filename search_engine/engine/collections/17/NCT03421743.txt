      12-week follow up period. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be conducted up to 10 weeks
      prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) to determine eligibility. Adult subjects with a history
      of chronic Nontuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) infection with at least 2 positive cultures in
      the prior two years, of which at least one is within the last 6 months prior to Screening,
      will be considered for enrollment. Subjects should provide a positive NTM sputum culture at
      Screening to be eligible.

      Two subgroups of subjects will be recruited:

        -  Group 1: Subjects who remain sputum culture positive while currently on a multidrug NTM
           guideline based antimycobacterial regimen, which has been ongoing for at least 6 months
           prior to the Baseline Visit.

        -  Group 2: Subjects who remain sputum culture positive but have either stopped a multidrug
           NTM guideline based antimycobacterial regimen at least 28 days prior to Screening due to
           lack of response or intolerance, or never started such treatment.

      The study will include 30 subjects.
