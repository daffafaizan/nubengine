      products will be given as single doses at separate visits. Periods without Nicotine
      Replacement Therapy (NRT), lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate treatment visits.
      Blood will be sampled at each treatment visit for pharmacokinetic analyses pre-dose, and at
      5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, as well as 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after
      start of product administration. The time until complete product dissolution will be
      recorded. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur. The
      trial is open in the sense that subjects and study personnel will be aware of what product is
      administered at a given visit. However, the treatment labels will not be known by the people
      performing bioanalysis or analyzing pharmacokinetic data.
