      in codon 6 of the beta-globin gene which, in the homozygous state, produces an abnormal
      hemoglobin that is prone to polymer formation when deoxygenated. The polymerized hemoglobin
      leads to impaired deformability and sickling of red blood cells which subsequently lodge in
      end-arterioles producing the classic and most prominent feature of the disorder, repeated
      vasoocclusive crises. Despite knowledge of the precise genetic defect for decades, only
      recently has there been therapeutic impact based upon this knowledge when a clear benefit
      from treatment with hydroxyurea, a cell cycle-specific agent administered to induce
      production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) by stimulating gamma-globin synthesis, was reported in
      patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The reduction in the frequency and severity of
      vasoocclusive crises seen has been attributed to the increase in HbF levels in responsive
      patients. While the majority of patients demonstrate a rise in HbF, not all such patients
      benefit from treatment. Given these results, alternative agents that also stimulate the
      production of HbF warrant investigation in the treatment of SCD. Recombinant-methionyl human
      stem cell factor (SCF) is a hematopoietic growth factor with activity on immature
      hematopoietic progenitor cells. SCF stimulates the production of HbF in vitro and in vivo,
      and this effect is attainable without the myelosuppression associated with hydroxyurea. In
      this phase I/II trial, we will administer SCF in a dose escalating fashion to patients with
      sickling disorders. Parameters to be measured are HbF levels, F cell levels, peripheral blood
      CD34 levels, frequency, duration, and severity of vasoocclusive crises, and toxicity.
