      postoperative recovery following major abdominal surgery. However, the optimal fluid
      management is difficult to achieve using standard parameters (e.g., heart rate [HR], blood
      pressure [BP], central venous pressure[CVP], or urine output) that poorly estimate preload
      and preload responsiveness. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) was proposed by introducing
      different hemodynamic variables into a dynamic perspective of individual fluid loading with
      or without vasoactive substances to reach predefined goal of optimal preload and/or oxygen
      delivery.There have been increasing numbers of studies evaluating the effect of perioperative
      GDFT on postoperative recovery following major abdominal surgery. However, the evidence for
      the beneficial effect of GDFT on postoperative recovery remains inconsistent.
