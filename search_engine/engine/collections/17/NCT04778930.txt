      therapeutic education program will be carried out, with 6 telehealth sessions, which will
      include action observation therapy. Subjects in Group B (control group) will receive their
      usual Physiotherapy intervention regimen for 6 weeks at their referral center and the same
      telehealth Therapeutic Education program of the intervention group. The face-to-face sessions
      of the intervention group will be carried out in the Physiotherapy Teaching Unit of the

      Statistical Analysis: After assessments, the data will be analyzed to verify the results. It
      will be done: descriptive analysis of the sample (means, medians, standard deviations and
      quartiles; normality test; frequency distributions): homogeneity check of the groups
      (t-Student or Mann Withney's U - quantitative variables; Chi square or F of Fisher -
      categorical variables); effectiveness analysis (parametric tests or not of paired samples;
      multivariate models to adjust for possible confounding factors; multivariate model of
      repeated measures to evaluate the result of the intervention. The statistical package
