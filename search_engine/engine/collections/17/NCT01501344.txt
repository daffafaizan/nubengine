      terms of disability to an individual and cost to the global economy. As the world's
      population ages, this will present a major public health issue since a larger proportion of
      women remain undiagnosed and untreated even with the availability of therapies and calcium
      and vitamin D supplements. Consequently, it remains important to evaluate dairy products
      (milk, cheese, and yogurt) that can be safely provided as a supplement for bone health in
      addition to the current pharmacological treatments.

      The rationale of this study is to assess the beneficial effect of a daily dietary supplement
      of MBP 80 mg in a yogurt matrix with fortified calcium content on bone remodelling in healthy
      early postmenopausal women with neither osteoporosis nor estrogens/progestin therapy.
