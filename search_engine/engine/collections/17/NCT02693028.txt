        1. How does bacteria transmit from the mother to the fetus and placenta during pregnancy
           and to the infant during the first 2-6 weeks after birth?

        2. Does colonization of the pregnant mother and fetus/Child occur? How and when?

        3. Can orally given probiotic bacteria be found in the newborn 2-6 weeks after birth, and
           if so where?

        4. How is bacteria transported from the mother's intestinal lumen to the Child/fetus gut?

        5. What impact has these bacteria on the level of inflammation in maternal and fetal
           compartments, especially that normally seen in the intestine of all newborns?

        6. What impact has these bacteria in the bowel on a normal intestinal flora establishment?
