      maintenance and muscle function. Vitamin D is primarily obtained from endogenous synthesis in
      response to skin sunlight exposure and follows a seasonal pattern; whereby, vitamin D levels
      peak at the end of the summer and fall to a trough during winter. If winter vitamin D levels
      can be increased to match those found in summer using supplementation, it is proposed
      sufficient vitamin D levels will improve physical performance and reduce susceptibility to
      illness in military recruits.
