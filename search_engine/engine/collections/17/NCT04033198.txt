      countries would have appendicitis during their life 6 .In the United States, the estimated
      incidenc of acute appendicitis is 11 cases per 10,000 population 5 . However, in South
      Africa, the incidencewas estimated to be less than 9 per 100,000 6 .Appendectomy is

      Older patients with acute abdominal pain are high-risk patients, unlike their younger
      counterparts15 . Morbidity and mortality rates are greater in elderly due to atypical
      presentations and delay in diagnosis leading to increase rate of perforation and
