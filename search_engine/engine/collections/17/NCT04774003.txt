      tolerability of inclisiran in Chinese participants with elevated serum LDL-C to support
      inclisiran registration in China.Inclisiran is a long acting RNA therapeutic agent that
      inhibits the synthesis of PCSK9, leading to reduced circulating LDL-C levels. Three pivotal
      Phase III studies have been conducted primarily in non-Asian participants to support New Drug
      Application/Marketing Authorization Application approval of inclisiran globally. This study
      design is based on the hypothesis that the global inclisiran clinical data primarily obtained
      in Caucasian participants could be appropriately extrapolated to Chinese participants.
