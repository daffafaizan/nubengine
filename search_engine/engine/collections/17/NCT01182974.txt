      is depressed during severe illness such as sepsis, trauma etc. The study will examine the
      toxicity of therapeutic doses of paracetamol in patients in severe sepsis. We believe that
      during sepsis, paracetamol metabolites are not fully detoxified and therefore are toxic to
      the patient.

      Patients with fever and severe sepsis will be randomized to receive paracetamol or dypirone.
      The investigators will monitor blood glutathione (as a surrogate marker for liver
      glutathione), liver enzymes and various clinical data (such as length of hospitalization) to
      look for a potential toxicity.
