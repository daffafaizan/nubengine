      delivery to improve patient adherence and viral suppression, the ART adherence club model was
      piloted from 2007 with the aim of assessing whether this group-based, lay-counsellor led
      service, with an emphasis on social support and adherence, could help address retention in
      care and viral suppression. Since the initial pilots, the club model has been scaled up
      rapidly with more than 400 clubs meeting in the Cape Town metro. As this model is being
      scaled-up and implemented rapidly, there is an urgent necessity to further assess its
      effectiveness.

      Whilst adherence clubs have been shown to be locally implementable, popular (with buy-in by
      clinic staff and patients) and cost-effective, and whilst community-based interventions have
      been shown to improve retention, evidence of local adherence club effectiveness in improving
      viral suppression and retention has only been observationally obtained. This observational
      evidence is highly subject to selection bias.

      This trial aims to address this by using a randomised controlled trial design with two arms -
      ART patients receiving care in clinic as per the Standard-of-Care (this arm will have delayed
      referral to Adherence clubs at 12 months post-initiation) and ART patients receiving care in
      Adherence clubs (this arm will have early referral to Adherence clubs at 4 months
      post-initiation). By doing this the investigators hope to generate robust evidence regarding
      both the effectiveness of clubs and the optimal timing of club referral.
