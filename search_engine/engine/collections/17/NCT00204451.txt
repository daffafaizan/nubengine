      the pattern of ovarian follicular growth and regression in two groups of women. The first
      group will use Plan B, which is a progesterone only OC containing 0.75 levonorgestrel. The
      second group of women will use the Yuzpe regimen, which uses 50 mg ethinyl estradiol/0.5 mg
      levonorgestrel pills at different stages of the menstrual follicular cycle.
