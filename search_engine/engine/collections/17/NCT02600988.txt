      malignant blood diseases. Unfortunately, the progression free survival and the quality of
      life of transplanted patients is limited due to the development of graft-versus-host-disease
      (GVHD).

      The development of new prophylaxis strategies of GVHD based in the use of immunomodulator
      agents (allowing the generation of an immunotolerance state and avoiding the use of
      immunosuppression) is essential.

      The GVHD is due to the cytotoxic effect of the donor lymphocytes T against healthy organs and
      tissues of the receptor. Calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate or antibodies
      anti-lymphocytes T are used as standard prophylaxis. This type of antibodies has demonstrated
      efficacy to reduce GVHD, but have not increased survival due to increasing the risk of
      relapses and serious post-transplant infections.

      Due to its interactions with VDR (vitamin D receptor) present in immune system cells, vitamin
      D is able to inhibit the activation of dendritic cells and the proliferation and production
      of cytokines by lymphocytes T. Based on this effect, the peri- and post- transplant
      administration of vitamin D might decrease the risk of GVHD in allogeneic transplanted
      patients, subsequently decreasing the immunosuppressant treatment requirements and improving
      the prognosis of those patients.
