      dysfunction (pelvic organ prolapse and fecal and urinary incontinence). Prolonged labor,
      namely during the 2nd stage, is one of the main obstetric risk factors responsible for anal
      sphincter rupture and fecal incontinence. In addition, it is associated with increased
      maternal and neonatal morbidities including increased risk of lower genital tract
      lacerations. In an effort to shorten labor and decrease lower genital tract trauma many
      techniques have been investigated.
