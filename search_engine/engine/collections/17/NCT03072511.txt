      implicated in countless health consequences, and significant economic and societal costs.
      Less than 10% of smokers making a serious quit attempt remain abstinent from cigarettes 1
      year later, and outcomes from gold-standard behavioral interventions leave much room for
      improvement. Thus the development of new interventions and improvements to existing
      interventions is imperative. Behavioral interventions for smoking cessation have
      insufficiently integrated the findings from basic research on decision-making processes.
      Thus, there is extensive laboratory-based research indicating the potential for
      laboratory-based manipulations that affect decision making relevant for smoking, the
      examination of a coherent intervention that capitalizes on this knowledge is limited. The
      proposed research is the first step toward synthesizing insights from the research domains of
      addiction, behavioral analysis, and social cognition into a cohesive formulation with
      potential impact on smoking cessation. Specifically, the research targets impulsive decision
      making associated with cigarette smoking and relapse by incorporating the influential
      Construal Level Theory.
