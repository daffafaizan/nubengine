      multiple myeloma, for many years.

      Advances in systemic and supportive therapy increased remission rates and overall survival,
      but multiple myeloma still remains an incurable haematological malignancy. Several
      preliminary studies demonstrate the efficacy of thalidomide in refractory and relapsed
      multiple myeloma with an overall response rate of 30 to 60%.

      Due to its activity, Thalidomide will be evaluated in association with MP in a randomized
      study for newly diagnosed myeloma patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy.
