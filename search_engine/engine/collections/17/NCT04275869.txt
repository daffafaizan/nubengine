      infertility. The combination of diet and exercise to achieve weight loss are currently
      considered an effective intervention for the improvement of reproductive parameters in
      overweight or obese infertile women.

      Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of a 3-month internet-based program focusing on the
      promotion of healthy lifestyles (especially weight loss and healthy eating and physical
      exercise habits) in women who also have a diagnosis of infertility and are on the waiting
      list for IVF treatment.
