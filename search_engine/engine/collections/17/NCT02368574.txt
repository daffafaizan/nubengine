    
      This is a 1:1 multi-center randomized trial with class II hysterectomy plus node dissection
      as the experimental arm, and class III hysterectomy plus pelvic node dissection as the
      control arm. Primary endpoints are: (1). 3-year diseases-free survival (DFS) rate; (2) the
      rates of treatment-related toxicity; (3) post-operation QoL (including sexual function) and
      (4) treatment costs. Secondary endpoints areï¼š(1) the rates of pelvic and/or extra-pelvic
      relapse; (2) overall survival(OS) rate; (3) the numbers of retroperitoneal node dissection,
      and (4) the rates of parametrial, margins and pelvic/para-aortic nodes involvement.
