      concentrating, and hallucinations. Individuals with schizophrenia often experience reduced
      emotional, social, and occupational functioning. Data indicate that antipsychotic drug
      treatment and occupational training and support may be effective in helping people with
      schizophrenia maintain a stable job. Risperidone and olanzapine are antipsychotic drugs;
      participants in this study will be taking either risperidone or olanzapine for the duration
      of the study. This study will provide schizophrenia patients with employment support alone or
      with behavioral skills training to determine which combination is more effective in helping
      patients obtain and maintain a job.

      At study entry, participants will undergo a clinical and diagnostic evaluation to determine
      the severity of their schizophrenia. Participants will be tapered off their regular
      medication for schizophrenia over 4 weeks. At the end of Week 4, they will be randomly
      assigned to receive either risperidone or olanzapine. Participants will then be assigned an
      Individual Placement and Support (IPS) specialist to assist them in finding a job. After
      participants secure a job, they will be randomly assigned to receive IPS either alone or with
      the Workplace Fundamentals Skills Training Module for 2 years. Participants' risperidone or
      olanzapine treatment will continue during this 2-year period. Participants will have clinic
      visits at study entry and Months 7, 12, and 24. At each visit, participants will complete
      questionnaires and will be interviewed about their schizophrenia symptoms and occupational
      functioning.
