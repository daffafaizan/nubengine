      vessels, including arterioles, arterioles, capillaries, and venules, etc.The clinical
      manifestations of CSVD are complex and varied, but cognitive impairment is one of the core
      clinical manifestations of CSVD, and some patients have gait and sphincter dysfunction.At
      present, CSVD is an important subtype of vascular cognitive dysfunction and the most common
      cause of vascular dementia in clinic.Currently, the treatment of cognitive impairment in
      small cerebral vascular diseases is conducted in two aspects: the treatment and prevention of
      the structure and function of small cerebral vascular diseases, and the treatment of
      cognitive dysfunction.The treatments recommended by experts for cognitive dysfunction include
      cholinesterase inhibitors, nmda-receptor antagonists, and other drugs, but these drugs have
      not been specifically studied for the treatment of cognitive impairment in small cerebral
      vascular diseases.The treatment of cognitive impairment in small cerebral vascular disease is
      still in difficulty, and there is no effective and specific treatment at present.Mouse Nerve
      Growth Factor (mNGF) is a soluble protein which promotes Nerve Growth, isolated and purified
      successively by Levi-Montalcini and Cohen in 1959 and 1960.The discovery of NGF makes people
      realize that some factors are needed to promote the development, growth and maintain the
      activity of neurons in the process of nervous system, which opens up a new field of
      neurobiology, for which the two scholars won the 1986 Nobel Prize in physiology.Clinical use
      of NGF in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), NGF injection into Meynert basal ganglia
      showed that NGF can improve the symptoms of AD and AD induced brain atrophy.Meynert basal
      ganglia is considered to be the main source of cholinergic neurons and plays an important
      role in the pathogenesis of AD and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Similar studies in China have
      also confirmed that nerve growth factor can reduce the symptoms of vascular dementia in
      stroke patients and delay the development of cognitive dysfunction.It has been found that
      nerve growth factor, like other special types of macromolecular proteins, can pass through
      the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through receptor-mediated endocytosis.In the animal studies,
      BBB integrity was significantly damaged in rats with hypertensive white matter lesions, in
      which case, nerve growth factor can play a role in protecting neurons, preventing cell
      apoptosis and promoting nerve reconstruction through BBB.By carrying out this study, the
      researchers intend to explore the therapeutic effect of rat nerve growth factor on cognitive
      dysfunction caused by cerebral small vascular disease, and preliminarily explore its imaging
      mechanism, so as to provide a new direction for further research on drug treatment of
      cognitive dysfunction caused by cerebral small vascular disease.
