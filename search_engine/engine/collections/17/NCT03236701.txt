      It is responsible for severe complications such as mineral bone disease, and has a role in
      worsening the cardiovascular mortality of dialyzed patients. Therefore, a close control of
      serum phosphorus remains a cornerstone in the clinical management of dialyzed patients to
      improve their long term prognosis. There are multiple sources of phosphorus in the diet that
      could be the target of such a dietary intervention but, because of important differences in
      bioavailability, they are not all equally relevant in influencing phosphatemia. Among them
      animal proteins that have a bioavailability of about 60% represent an important target for
      phosphate-lowering nutritional interventions. However, lowering the protein content of the
      diet in hemodialysis (HD) patients may be dangerous because it may increase the the risk of
      malnutrition hence worsening their prognosis. In the present study we intend to explore an
      alternative strategy to lower the intake of phosphate with animal proteins by replacing the
      meat or fish included in two meals a week with egg white that is reach of proteins but has
      virtually no phosphate.
