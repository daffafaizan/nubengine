      multiple pregnancies has been extensively investigated. Arguably, the use of progesterone is
      biologically plausible given that uterine quiescence is maintained throughout pregnancy by
      progesterone and progesterone receptor-mediated inhibition of inflammation, which causes
      suppression of the contractile genes. There is no benefit of universal vaginal progesterone
      to reduce PTB rates in multiple pregnancies. One meta-analysis showed a benefit in adverse
      perinatal outcome in a subgroup of women with a short cervix â‰¤25 mm, suggesting it may be
      useful in this group, but the numbers in the study were small and further research is needed.
      There appears to be no long-term harm caused to infants exposed to progesterone in utero. So
      the aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two doses of vaginal
      progesterone(200mg versus400mg) and placebo in improving gestational age in twin pregnancy
      and its subsequent impact on perinatal outcome
