      chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. The study will evaluate the safety and clinical
      efficacy of a five day infusion of IV gallium nitrate (IV gallium). The purpose of this study
      is to assess the efficacy of IV gallium to improve pulmonary function as measured by a 5% or
      greater relative improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline
      to Day 28.
