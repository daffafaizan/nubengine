    
      Free serum cortisol is considered the active hormone.

      In patients with septic shock only the total serum cortisol level is available, however, the
      free cortisol level can be normal despite a low total cortisol level due to changes in the
      serum protein.

      The hormone can be replaced improperly in these patients and contribute to poor outcome in
      septic shock.

      We are studying adult MICU patients with septic shock who are not receiving corticosteroid
      replacement.

      This study does not include any intervention.

      In-hospital or 28-day mortality are registered in all the patients.
