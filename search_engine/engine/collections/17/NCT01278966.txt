      with drug-resistant epilepsy. The Modified Atkins Diet is a less restrictive diet than the
      classical ketogenic diet, which is usually offered to this group of patients. Twenty patients
      between 2 and 18 years are included in the study, and the study period is 6 months. The study
      will be conducted at the National Centre for Child Epilepsy in Norway.
