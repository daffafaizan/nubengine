      harvested and cryopreserved as a back up for use if non-engraftment/rejection is followed by
      failure to undergo autologous reconstitution.

      For HLA Mismatched donors, harvested peripheral blood stem cells will be enriched for CD34
      cells using the Clinimacs CD34 Reagent system.

      Fludarabine will be given as 5 daily intravenous infusions. Campath-1H will be given as 3
      daily intravenous infusions and will be followed by Anti-CD45 which will be given as four
      daily intravenous infusions that will be completed two days prior to stem cell infusion.
      Diphenydramine will be administered intravenously every 4 hours during the period of the
      course of each infusion.

      GVHD prophylaxis will be achieved through positive selection for CD34 resulting in > 3 log T
      cell depletion. Previous reports have indicated that there is a low frequency of severe
      (Grade II/IV) GvHD after haploidentical transplants if recipients receive stem cell
      populations containing <5 x 10e4 CD3 positive T cells. We hope to achieve such levels with
      our CD34 enrichment protocol. However, pharmacologic prophylaxis will be added if the CD34
      selected product contains more than 5 x 10e4 CD3+ve T cells/kg recipient weight. In addition,
      Campath 1H persists in the recipient circulation through the immediate transplant period and
      will contribute anti-GVHD activity, in vivo.
