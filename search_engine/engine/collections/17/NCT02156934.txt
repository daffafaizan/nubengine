      derived cells as therapy for stress urinary incontinence. A total of 20 women in whom stress
      urinary incontinence had not improved underwent intra-sphincter injection of low doses 50Ã—106
      of autologous muscle derived cells, which will be derived from biopsies of their deltoid
      muscle. Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell injection. Changes in
      stress urinary incontinence severity were evaluated by pad test, diary of incontinence
      episodes and quality of life surveys.
