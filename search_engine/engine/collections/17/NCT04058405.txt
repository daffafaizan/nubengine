      and mortality, especially in low-resource settings. Identifying mothers and babies at
      greatest risk of complications would enable intervention to be targeted to those most likely
      to benefit from them. However, current risk prediction models have a wide range of
      sensitivity (42-81%) and specificity (87-92%) indicating that improvements are needed.
      Furthermore, no predictive models have been developed or evaluated in Zimbabwe.

      This proposal describes a single centre retrospective cross-sectional study which will
      address the need to further develop and test statistical risk prediction models for adverse
      maternal and neonatal outcomes in low-resource settings; this will be the first such research
      to be carried out in Zimbabwe.

      Data will be collected on maternal demographics characteristics, outcome of prior
      pregnancies, past medical history, symptoms and signs on admission, results of biochemical
      and haematological investigations. Adverse outcome will be defined as a composite of maternal
      morbidity and mortality and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Association between variables
      and outcomes will be explored using multivariable logistic regression.

      Critically, new risk prediction models introduced for our clinical setting may reduce
      avoidable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality at local, national, regional and
      international level.
