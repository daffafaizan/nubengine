      glucose and postprandial blood glucose secretion, we adopted a combinational therapeutic
      model and will administer drug treatments during basic meals. Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic
      patients will be administered continuous subcutaneous Beinaglutide injections using a pump
      device. The efficacy, safety and disease control after terminating the drug treatments will
      be compared to those of patients who receive CSII treatment.

      This is a national-level, multicenter, randomized, open study with parallel controls. The
      study consists of two phases:

      a five-week treatment phase and a 48-week post-treatment follow-up period.
