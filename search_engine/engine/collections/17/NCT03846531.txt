    
      Evaluate Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) to clear or remove Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) lesions
      from off-facial areas of healthy adult subjects.

      The specific objectives of this study are to:

        -  Document the non-treated appearance of off-face SKs.

        -  Evaluate the clearance of SKs in off-face locations post-treatment versus pre-treated
           appearance of the same lesion.

        -  Evaluate the clearance of the treated SKs at various points in time over several weeks
           following the initial procedure, compared to the pre-treated SKs.
