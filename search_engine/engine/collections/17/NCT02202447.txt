    
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, oncology study to conducted in 2
      parts. Part A is a dose-escalation phase to determine the Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose and
      the following :

        -  Evaluate the administration of EC1169 QW on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule

        -  Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EC1169 and EC0652

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy results in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
           prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and
           previously treated with a taxane.

      The primary objective of Part B is to identify the radiographic progression-free survival
      (rPFS) in taxane-na√Øve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patients receiving treatment
      with EC1169.
