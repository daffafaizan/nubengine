      who will undergo cardiac surgery requiring extracorporeal circulation and standardized
      support will be given to them till the extracorporeal circulation period. Thereafter,
      remifentanil will be titrated by increments of 0,5, from 1 up to 5 ng ml-1 during the extra
      corporeal circulation period. In the awake state, at LOC and at each plateau level of
      remifentanil CeT, mean arterial pressure, and BIS will be recorded. Pupil size and dilatation
      after a 60 mA, 100 Hz tetanic stimulation will be measured at LOC and at each plateau level
      of remifentanil.
