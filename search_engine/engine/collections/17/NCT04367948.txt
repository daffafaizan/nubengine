    
      Subjects first undergo an 18F-FDG test, followed by 68Ga-NOTA-FAPI04 or 18F-NOTA-FAPI04 test
      in groups.Investigate the standardized uptake value(SUV) of 68Ga/ 18F-NOTA-FAPI04 for the
      target lesion, the ratio of the standardized uptake value(SUVR) of 68Ga/ 18F-NOTA-FAPI04 for
      the target lesion within each time window to that of the normal corresponding tissue.
