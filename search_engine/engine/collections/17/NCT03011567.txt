      in the postpartum period. The addition of NSAIDs to post-cesarean analgesic regimen has been
      shown to improve post-cesarean pain and reduce opioid requirements. However, concern has been
      raised over use of NSAIDs in hypertensive pregnant patients, as recent evidence suggests the
      potential for increased blood pressure in patients with chronic hypertensive disorders
      receiving these agents. Notably, these studies were conducted on patients with longstanding
      chronic hypertension, which included males and non-pregnant females, and it is therefore
      unclear whether this recommendation is appropriate for patients with transient hypertensive
      disorders of pregnancy.

      This protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate whether NSAIDs influence blood
      pressure parameters in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Patients with
      severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Severe HDP) will be studied separately from women
      with mild hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Mild HDP).
