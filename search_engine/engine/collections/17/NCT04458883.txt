      having built in-house the only two available prototypes of Fast Field-Cycling MRI in the
      world - and these already have clinical imaging capabilities. Fast Field-Cycling MRI switches
      rapidly over a range of field strengths (0.2 T to 200 ÂµT), providing a T1 dispersion curve.
      This information is invisible to fixed-field scanners and uncovers unique knowledge about
      motion and interaction between component molecules within a tissue (i.e. water/fat/proteins).
      In this application the investigators wish to use their in-house expertise further to extend
      the capability of our Fast Field-Cycling MRI to perform cardiac imaging by building the
      first-ever cardiac Fast Field-Cycling MRI coil and develop cardiac pulse sequences with ECG
      gating. The investigators will aim to establish the normalcy of T1 dispersion curves for left
      ventricular myocardium in healthy volunteers, and further on to distinguish the
      characteristics of post-myocardial infarction scar T1 dispersion curves.
