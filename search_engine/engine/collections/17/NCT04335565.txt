      different occasions (separated by 3-5 day washout period), where they will be administered
      water, sugar solution (65g), water and stevia extract (5g) solution. The solution will be
      followed by a consumption of a fixed meal (after 30 minutes). Breakfast will be standardised.
      Capillary blood glucose will be collected every 30 min until 2 hours post meal. Venous blood
      samples will be collected before the intake of the solution and at 2 hours after meal intake.
