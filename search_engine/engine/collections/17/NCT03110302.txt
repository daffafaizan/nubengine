      (PE), to military Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One hundred and
      seventy-five Veterans will participate in the study. The main study goal is to compare PE
      conducted in three different ways: (1) PE that is office-based (OB; Veterans come to a VA
      clinic and meet with a therapist via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), (2) PE
      delivered via home-based telehealth (HBT; Veterans stay at home and meet with the therapist
      via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), and (3) PE delivered in home, in person
      (IHIP; the therapist goes to the Veterans' homes to provide the psychotherapy). Symptoms of
      PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be examined at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at
      six-month follow up to determine if symptoms change over time. Study hypotheses state that
      the IHIP approach, compared to the other two approaches, will be more effective at reducing
      the PTSD symptoms experienced by these Veterans because it will help Veterans attend each
      session and complete the therapy "homework" assigned by the therapists (such as doing feared,
      but safe, activities around the house or the neighborhood). However, the delivery of IHIP may
      cost more than the delivery of PE via the other modalities.
