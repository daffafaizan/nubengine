    
      Primary Objective:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of BPM31510 plus vitamin K in subjects with
           high-grade glioma(HGG), defined as anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma (GB) that
           has recurred on a BEV containing regimen.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  Estimate the overall survival in subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen
           from the 1st day of infusion of BPM31510 plus vitamin K to death.

        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM31510 plus vitamin K on shifting HGG metabolism to aerobic
           respiration by PET imaging.

        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM1510 plus vitamin K on MRI imaging by Response Assessment
           in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria [specifically progression free survival (PFS) and
           response rate (RR)].

        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacodynamics (PD) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.
