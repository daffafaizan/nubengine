      cues, glucocorticoids will change neural activation in regions of the corticolimbic-striatal
      system that regulate feeding. It is anticipate that these changes will correlate with hunger
      ratings and food intake. Further, this research will also examine if glucocorticoids will
      increase the basal metabolic rate and alter multiple systemic appetite-regulating hormones
      compared to saline. It is expected that these changes will correlate positively with hunger
      ratings and food intake as well.
