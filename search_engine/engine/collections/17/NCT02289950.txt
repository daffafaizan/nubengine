      discretion: carboplatin plus paclitaxel or carboplatin plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin
      (PLD), and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly farletuzumab 5 mg/kg or placebo
      (ie, Test Article). All subjects will receive a loading dose for the first 2 weeks of 10
      mg/kg Test Article (farletuzumab or placebo). Subjects will be stratified at randomization by
      individual chemotherapy treatment regimen (targeted 1:1 ratio) and platinum-free interval
      following first-line therapy (6 to 12 months vs greater than 12 to 36 months).
