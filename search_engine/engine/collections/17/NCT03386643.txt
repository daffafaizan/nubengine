    
      This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial with symptomatic patients presenting OLP,
      which will be randomly assigned to either topical Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis HN019
      or clobetasol propionate 0.05%. The selected patients will receive capsules to be diluted in
      15 ml of water containing 6 x 109 CFUs of Bifidobacterium subsp. lactis HN019 (experimental
      group) or 0.05% clobetasol propionate (control group) for mouth washing, twice a day for 4
      weeks. Patients will be instructed to maintain normal brushing and not to use or consume
      another corticosteroid and /or probiotic during the study. Outcomes measures will be symptoms
      (VAS and Likert-like scale), quality of life (SF-36 form), and clinical changes (erythema,
      reticulation, erosion/ulcer based on clinical photographs), which will be performed at
      baseline, 15 days (only VAS, Likert-like scale and photographs) and and at one month of
      treatment. All patients will undergo biopsies for the diagnosis of OLP, and those who consent
      will be submitted to an optional biopsy at the end of the topical treatment for
      histopathological and immunopathological characterization.
