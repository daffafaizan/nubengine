      purposes. ATS guidelines provide a short five-breath dosimeter protocol using a five-step
      dilution schedule. The Viasys APS system enables a feasible and less time consuming
      provocation with incremental dosages. In 48 young adults with bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR)
      the ATS-protocol with a five-step protocol using a single dilution of 16 mg/ml methacholine
      should be compared.
