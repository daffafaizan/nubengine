      travel, most of this work has been limited to macrophage cell lines and has not considered
      how the effects of microgravity alter macrophages' ability to stimulate tissue repair and
      regeneration. Specifically, how the macrophage secretion profile and/or interaction with
      endothelial cells is altered during microgravity culture. Given the extensive data showing
      the consequence of simulated microgravity to alter endothelial cells, and the mounting
      evidence that simulated microgravity affects macrophage cells, the investigators hypothesize
      that microgravity alters the functional response of macrophages in close association with
      endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, the study team has established 2 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on endothelial and macrophage
      pro-healing states.

      Specific Aim 2: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on the pro-healing states of
      3-dimensional co-cultured macrophages and endothelial cells.

      Completion of the above described aims will lay a strong foundation of knowledge about the
      impact of simulated microgravity in important cell-cell interactions involved in tissue
      regeneration and healing
