      infections (HAI), making surgical site infections the most common HAI in US hospitals.
      Despite the routine use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics and improvements in surgical
      techniques, surgical site infections continue to be associated with significant morbidity,
      reduction in quality of life and overall cost following abdominal surgery.

      Ruthigen is conducting this Phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety and potential
      efficacy of RUT058-60 in preventing surgical deep incisional and organ space infection in
      subjects undergoing abdominal surgery as an adjunctive therapy to prophylactic systemic
      antibiotics.
