      will assure the collection and the data processing electrophysiological, the management of
      the data and the methodological follow-up, as well as the writing of the report and the
      distribution of the results.

      The quality assurance will be assured by a "minimal" monitoring by an assistant of clinical
      research for the department of the research and the innovation, to Montpellier, which will
      verify principally the consents.

      The electrophysiological data digitized will be stored in the form of computer files via
      PowerLab.

      All the analyses of treatment of signals required to highlight the potential evoked will be
      realized with the software Matlab.
