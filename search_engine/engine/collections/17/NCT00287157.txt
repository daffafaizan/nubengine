    
      Sublingual tizanidine, a novel test formulation of the known effective antispasticity agent,
      has been shown to have a unique pharmacokinetic profile [(i.e., nearly twice the
      bioavailability/AUC), but with little or no increase in peak plasma levels (Cmax), as
      compared to oral tizanidine (Zanaflex)]. When administered nightly to CP (Cerebral Palsy)
      patients to more effectively reduce the muscle spasms that disrupt sleep, it was shown to
      improve sleep efficiency, decrease sleep fragmentation and improve the sleep cycle. This
      improvement in night-time sleep was translated into a potential improvement in next-day
      functioning (improvement in next-day measures of spasticity and movement).

      It is hypothesized that a similar type of improvement in sleep with consequent positive
      impact on next day improvement in spasticity, cognition and function, may also be manifest in
      a similar patient population, children with traumatic brain injury.
