      participants who met initial eligibility criteria underwent a 28-day screening period,
      including a 14-day run-in with migalastat (150 milligrams [mg] migalastat once a day [QD]
      from Days -28 to -15) to assess eligibility for entering the treatment period of the study.
      Participants who entered the treatment period were required to have α-galactosidase A (α-Gal
      A) activity responsive to migalastat.

      Fifteen participants received at least 1 dose of study drug, however, 6 of these participants
      did not demonstrate α-Gal A activity responsive to migalastat and were thus screen failures
      (these participants are hereafter referred to as "dosed screen failures") due to not meeting
      all inclusion criteria for treatment. Therefore, 9 participants were enrolled into the
      treatment period (these participants are hereafter referred to as "eligible-enrolled").

      Eligible-enrolled participants (those who satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the study)
      received escalating doses of migalastat twice a day (BID) for 6 weeks (Days 1 to 42),
      followed by 6 weeks at 1 dose level BID (Days 43 to 84) during the treatment period.
      Participants could then opt to participate in the extension period. The study consisted of 2
      optional extension periods, the first through Week 48 and the second through Week 96. For
      participants who did not continue into the optional treatment extension, the study included a
      2-week follow-up period.
