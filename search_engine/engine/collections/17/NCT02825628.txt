    
      Males, diagnosed with CRPC, who fulfil the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The subject will be informed orally and
      in writing about the study procedures and give written informed consent, prior to study
      start.

      At the screening visit the following examinations are performed: Physical examination,
      medical history and concomitant medication. Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, height, body
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured. Blood samples are drawn and urine sample is
      collected. ECG is recorded. Bone scan and diagnostic CT scan are also performed. At the next
      visit, baseline, the subject is examined physically and heart rate, blood pressure, weight,
      body temperature and respiratory rate are measured, ECG is recorded, blood samples drawn and
      urine sample collected. FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L (European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions with 5
      levels) questionnaire are filled out by the subject. Adverse events and concomitant
      medication is documented and the first dose of the investigational product is given.

      The subject is surveyed for 3 hours at the hospital.

      The duration of the study for the individual subject will be approximately 20 weeks from
      screening to the follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose. Each subject will receive 10
      doses of investigational product. After the follow-up visit, the subject enters to long-term
      follow-up phase which lasts approximately 2 years.

      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be designated and will be responsible to
      monitor/review all study related safety data. After review of safety data the DMC will
      provide recommendation as to whether the dose escalation can proceed as planned according to
      the protocol.
