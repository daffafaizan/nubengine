      give adequate anesthesia and analgesia at significantly lower doses compared with the ones
      needed if only one drug was given to reach the same effect. A lot of research has been done
      to quantify these interactions with a focus on the desired effects (Tolerance of
      laryngoscopy, tolerance of shake and shout etc...), but the simultaneous interaction on the
      unwanted side effects is less well described. The response surface model of Bouillon et al.
      and other models predict combinations of propofol and remifentanil effect-site concentrations
      that lead to an equipotent desired effect. Due to the availability of the models, the
      anesthesiologists now could use the knowledge on interactions to target specific effects more
      accurately, using predefined equipotent combinations of drugs: for instance, a desirable 90%
      probability of tolerance of laryngoscopy (TOL90) in the population can be reached through
      either a high propofol/low remifentanil combination, but equally well through a low
      propofol-high remifentanil combination.

      However, at this time it is not known whether some of the combinations of propofol and
      remifentanil have a favorable hemodynamic stability compared to other equipotent
      combinations. The researcher in this study want to determine whether equipotent combinations
      of remifentanil and propofol (all deliberately selected to evoke 90% probability of
      "tolerance to laryngoscopy"), result in different effects on the undesired side effects of
      anesthetics, such as hemodynamic instability (hypotension, changes in heart rate or cardiac
      output), decreases in cerebral or tissue oxygenation (both measured with near infrared
      spectroscopy).
