    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the therapeutic effect
      and safety of adjunctive AKST4290 in subjects with bullous pemphigoid (BP). Subjects will
      receive topical mometasone furoate cream (MFC) therapy concurrently with study agent (placebo
      or AKST4290) in an inpatient setting until disease control is reached (duration of inpatient
      stay is dependent upon individual disease course, but is estimated between 1-3 weeks).

      Subjects will receive rescue therapy at any time if their clinical condition worsens or if
      their clinical condition fails to improve by the completion of Week 1 on study treatment, as
      assessed by the investigator. Rescue therapy will consist of whole-body clobetasol propionate
      cream (CPC) (15-50g) and/or oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg per day), as determined by the
      investigator. Subjects who receive rescue therapy will remain in the study until disease
      control, unless they are withdrawn or withdraw from participation.
