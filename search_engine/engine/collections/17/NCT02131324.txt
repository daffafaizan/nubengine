      Approximately 50 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were to be randomized to
      treatment with DFD-06 Cream or clobetasol propionate cream in a 1:1 ratio. Study products
      were applied twice daily for 15 days to all affected areas on the body excluding face, scalp,
      groin, axillae, and other intertriginous areas. Subject visits were scheduled at Screening,
      Baseline (Day 1), Day 8, Day 15, and Day 43 (if needed to confirm recovery). Clinical
      determinations of disease severity were conducted using the Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) for overall severity at each visit.
