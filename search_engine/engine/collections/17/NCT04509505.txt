      health, it will be assessed by questions about smoking habits, including smoking mode as well
      as duration (heads smoked per day) and extent of use (age of initiation and number of
      sessions per week) of waterpipe smoking.

      A full periodontal examination using UNC-15 periodontal probe will be done for all of the
      participants measuring the CAL, Probing Depth (PD), plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing
      (BOP) and gingival recession depth (GD). In subjects where attachment loss will be clinically
      detected, radiographic examination will be performed by digital periapical radiograph to
      detect the amount of bone loss, then staging will be done according to the new classification
      by the aid of radiographic examination.
