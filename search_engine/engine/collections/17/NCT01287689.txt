      interest to document the use of IgG under the conditions of everyday practice and to analyze
      the endpoints (outcomes). A prospective cohort study such as this is an important evidence
      source for such rare diseases as those mentioned above. The aim of this outcome study is to
      fill the gap of the lack of long-term data in these rare diseases treated with IgG.
