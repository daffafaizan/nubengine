    
      A multicentre randomised controlled open label parallel group medical device trial in
      approximately 8 hospitals in Belgium.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to three study arms based on a 1:1:1 allocation:

      Study arm 1 (on top of standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Smith & Nephew
           (Allevyn® brand).

      Study arm 2 (on top of standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Mölnlycke Health
           care (Mepilex® brand).

      Study arm 3 (standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  No silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings will be applied on the skin sites of
           interest for this trial (sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left).

      Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left) of patients
      at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)
      development will be assessed daily for a maximum period of 14 days.
