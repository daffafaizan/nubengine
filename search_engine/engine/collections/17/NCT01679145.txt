      matched controls. The main aim of this project is to assess 1) which behavioural and
      neuroimaging alterations (fMRI) associated with reward-based learning (see Projects 1 & 3)
      predict relapse within the follow-up period of 6 months, 2) how these interact with clinical
      and psychosocial factors which can modify the relapse risk, and 3) to provide data for
      genetic and imaging analyses and modelling. Furthermore, we will explore gender effects on
      functional imaging parameters of learning. Patients will be detoxified in an inpatient
      setting and followed for 6 months using the Form 90 and Time-Line Follow-Back Procedure.
      Clinical assessments, behavioral paradigms of learning, and brain imaging will be carried out
      within at least 4 half-lives after any psychotropic medication. Subjects will undergo medical
      management with bimonthly follow-ups and predefined in- and exclusion criteria as described
      previously. We will implement and apply functional imaging paradigms assessing
      Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and reversal learning as described in Projects 1 and 3. We
      will associate model parameters of learning with alcohol craving, intake and prospective
      relapse risk. Independent of these central questions, we will also assess comorbidity,
      psychosocial and neurobiological disease severity markers to control for specificity of
      findings.
