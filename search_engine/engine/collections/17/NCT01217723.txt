    
      This study is a non-blinded, randomized, multicentre trial testing the effect of
      Thymoglobulin® vs. placebo on the primary outcome of cGVHD. Subjects will be children and
      adults having unrelated donor transplants.

      Intervention: Infusion of Thymoglobulin® on three days prior to the transplant.

      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the use of Thymoglobulin® in the experimental group will
      result in an absolute 20% increase in the number of patients free of cGVHD at 12 months, the
      time of peak incidence, from 20% in the control group to 40% in the experimental group.

      Outcome Measures: The Primary Outcome Measure is freedom from cGVHD at 12 months from
      transplantation, defined as withdrawal of all systemic immunosuppressive agents and without
      resumption up to 12 months (a binary end-point, yes/no). Secondary outcome measures: Quality
      of Life, overall incidence of cGVHD (including untreated cases and resolved cases), the
      incidence of "extensive" cGVHD, time to non-relapse mortality, time to all-cause mortality,
      time to relapse of leukemia, graft rejection or failure (Yes vs. No), serious infection (Yes
      vs. No), CMV activation (Yes vs. No), organ-specific grading of chronic graft versus host
      disease, resumption of immunosuppressive agents after 12 months (Yes vs. No), doses of
      immunosuppressive drugs still required at 12 months, and incidence of acute graft versus host
      disease.
