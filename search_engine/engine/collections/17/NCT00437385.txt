      relapse rates and cognitive effects limit its long-term use. Continuation treatment after ECT
      with combinations of C-ECT or psychotherapy and medication may decrease relapse rates and
      cognitive side effects while changing cognitive psychological variables like dysfunctional
      attitudes in the long-term.

      CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS

        -  Evaluation of the efficacy of three continuation treatments aimed at preventing relapses
           after acute ECT

        -  Examination of the cognitive side effects and the changes of cognitive psychological
           variables during acute and continuation treatment

      METHODS In a prospective, randomized, controlled, long-term study we assign 60 depressed ECT
      responder either to antidepressant treatment alone, or C-ECT plus medication, or cognitive
      behavioral group therapy plus medication. Depressive symptoms and cognition were assessed
      before, during, immediately after acute ECT and two, four, six, and 12 months during
      continuation therapy.

      HYPOTHESES It is hypothesized that the use of combination continuation therapies after
      effective ECT leads to lower HAMD scores and lower relapse rates than the standard treatment
      with antidepressants alone after 6 months. In addition, we assume that the CBT group will
      establish more functional macro-patterns than the somatic treatments in the long term and
      will have the lowest HAMD scores and relapse rates after 1 year. With regard to the cognitive
      side effects, the autobiographical memory is expected to be the only specific part of memory
      being affected negatively by ECT in the short and long term.
