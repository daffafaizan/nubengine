    
      In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second
      leading cause of cancer mortality with over 56,000 deaths in 2004). Early detection through
      screening decreases the mortality associated with the disease. However, adherence with
      current screening recommendations is low. A survey of the general population indicates that
      only 53.1% of Americans, age 50 years and older for whom colorectal cancer screening is
      recommended, are up-to-date with this preventive service. While colorectal cancer screening
      rates with the VA Healthcare System (VHA) are better than in the general population (75% in
      Fiscal Year (FY) 2005), they are lower than performance rates for other types of cancer
      screening (e.g., mammography) in VHA. Further, numerous VA medical centers report colorectal
      cancer screening rates below the level considered satisfactory.
