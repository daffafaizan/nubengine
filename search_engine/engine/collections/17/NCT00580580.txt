      as well as detect myocardial perfusion following a routine intravenous injection of Definity
      (0.05-0.20 millimeters), Optison (0.1-0.4 millimeters) or PESDA (0.05-0.2 mL). Following
      these injections , we will attempt to Contrast Pulse Sequencing on the Siemens Acuson Sequoia
      system to image both the coronary and carotid arteries, as well as the Myocardial perfusion.
