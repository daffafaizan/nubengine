      nutritional supplementation on physical performance and the capacity to perform daily tasks
      in frail institutionalized older adults.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial, with a 6-month intervention period. Participants: 122
      frail institutionalized older adults aged 65 and older with no cognitive impairment.

      Intervention: After a baseline assessment, the participants will be randomly assigned to the
      control group or one of two intervention groups; multi-modal exercise program (EG) or
      exercise plus nutritional supplementation (SG). During 6 months, participants in the
      intervention groups will be performing the exercise routine based on the Otago exercise
      programme. Additionally, participants in the SG will receive a daily oral nutritional
      supplement.

      Measurements: The primary outcome measure will be mobility measured with the timed up and go
      test. Secondary outcomes will be the functional balance, hand-grip strength, lower limb
      functional capacity, gait speed and distance covered during the 6-minute walk test.
