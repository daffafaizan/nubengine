    
      This will be a prospective, single centre, randomized, contralateral, investigator-masked
      non-dispensing study. This study requires two visits of approx. 1 hour duration each.

      At the first visit, if possible, the order in which the hydrogel and silicone hydrogel
      contact lenses are allocated to the study participants will be randomized. At the second
      visit, participants will be crossed over to the alternate lens type (hydrogel or silicone
      hydrogel).

      At each visit, participants will be instructed to:

        -  Wash their hands prior to handling the contact lenses;

        -  Swab their thumb and two index fingers of the hand routinely used to conduct contact
           lens insertion using a sterile cotton swab moistened with sterile preservative free
           saline for the evaluation of skin microbiota;

        -  Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for lens insertion;

        -  Open the blister pack and insert the contact lens randomly assigned for the right eye;

        -  Open the blister pack and insert the contact lens assigned for the left eye;

        -  Contact lenses will be removed aseptically by a masked investigator after 45 minutes of
           lens wear.

      Lenses and finger swabs will be analysed for microbial contamination using established
      routine microbiology protocols. The number and species of organisms will be determined.

      A minimum washout period of 48 hours will occur between the two study visits.
