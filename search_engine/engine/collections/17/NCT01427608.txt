      significantly better than olanzapine alone in achieving remission of psychotic depression.
      This STOP-PD-II Sustaining Remission study aims to assess the long-term tolerability of
      taking this combination of medications and their efficacy at preventing a relapse of the
      symptoms. The acute phase of the study will monitor the efficacy and tolerability of the
      olanzapine and sertraline combination, including investigation of weight and metabolic
      variables, age effects on treatment response and tolerability, and the association of genetic
      polymorphisms to response or relapse. When subjects are stabilized on these medications for a
      period of 8 weeks they will be invited to participate in the randomized phase of the
      research: the olanzapine will be placebo-controlled, meaning half of the subjects will
      continue to take the olanzapine/sertraline combination and half will take a
      sertraline/placebo combination, for a period of 36 weeks. Symptoms and side effects will be
      monitored regularly throughout this phase. Randomization will be stratified on a 1:1 basis by
      age 60 and above.
