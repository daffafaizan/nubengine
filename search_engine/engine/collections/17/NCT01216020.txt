      Evaluation and comparison of the compliance of the two treatments;

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluation and comparison of the grade and incidence of acute toxicity; Evaluation and
      comparison of local control; Evaluation and comparison of event free survival (both local
      control and distant metastases); Evaluation and comparison of cause specific and overall
      survival.
