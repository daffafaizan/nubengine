      the early stage of liver cirrhosis, the prediction of esophageal varices is very important
      for guiding the clinical decision making of primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The
      investigators' recent systematic review evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of APRI, AAR,
      FIB-4, FI, King, Lok, Forns, and FibroIndex scores in predicting the presence of esophageal
      varices in liver cirrhosis. However, their diagnostic accuracy was low to moderate. Further
      study is warranted to establish a reliable score to predict the presence of high-risk
      esophageal varice in liver cirrhosis.
