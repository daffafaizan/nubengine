      in prior PTC-sponsored clinical studies in DBMD (Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study [PTC124-GD-007-DMD; NCT00592553] and the subsequent open-label extension study [Study
      PTC124-GD-007e-DMD; NCT00847379]). It is planned that up to ~96 participants will be
      enrolled.

      It is also planned that participants will receive ataluren 3 times per day (TID) at
      respective morning, midday, and evening doses of 10 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg), 10 mg/kg,
      and 20 mg/kg for approximately 336 weeks. Study assessments will be performed at clinic
      visits during screening, on the first day of ataluren dosing, and then every 48 weeks during
      the ataluren treatment period, except for weight, which will be measured every 24 weeks at a
      primary care physician (PCP).
