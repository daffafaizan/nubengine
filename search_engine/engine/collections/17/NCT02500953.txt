    
      <Part 1: Single ascending dose> Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ASP3325 in non-elderly,
           healthy adult Japanese male and female, and Caucasian male subjects

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between
           Japanese and Caucasians

      <Part 2: Multiple ascending dose> Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of ASP3325 in
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male and female subjects

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

      <Part 3: Evaluation of the effect of administration timing> Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the effect of administration timing on the pharmacodynamics of ASP3325
           orally administered three times a day at different administration timings of 30 minutes
           before a meal, during a meal, 30 minutes after a meal, and 2 hours after a meal in
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male subjects in a crossover design

      Secondary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
