      patients. Fractionated delivery of CO2 laser treatment leaved columns of undamaged skin to
      quickly re-epithelialize and has reduced the previously higher risk profile of unfractionated
      ablative laser delivery in terms of permanent pigmentation changes, higher rates of infection
      and scarring. The exact mechanisms of CO2 laser action are still unclear, but likely involve
      a combination of macroscopic ablative fenestration, microscopic thermal collagen alteration
      and molecular profile alterations.

      Use of AFCO2L for scar management is increasing amongst burn clinicians; consensus opinion
      and several large series have demonstrated safe and effective result, however robust
      randomised controlled evidence for the efficacy of CO2 laser on burns scarring is still
      lacking.
