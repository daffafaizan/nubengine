      cathodal tDCS will be applied over the primary motor cortex (C3 - active and contralateral
      supra-orbital region - reference) and visual cortex (Oz - active and Cz - reference). Dual
      tDCS (anodal and cathodal - optimized protocol) will be applied on C3 - active and Oz -
      active.

      Electrical cortical activity will be assessed on 14 migraineurs through: (i) MEP; (ii) MT;
      (iii) SICI; (iv) ICF; (v) PT and (vi) visual evoked-potential (VEP-habituation). An interval
      of 48hs between sessions will be taken. The order of the sessions will be randomized and
      counterbalanced among volunteers by site www.randomization.com.
