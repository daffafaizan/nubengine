    
      In this study, 30 participants with chronic spinal cord injury will undergo a 8-week training
      schedule for ambulation with the EKSO™ device.

      Ekso™ is a wearable bionic suit which enables individuals with any amount of lower extremity
      weakness to stand up and walk over ground with a natural, full weight bearing, reciprocal
      gait. Walking is achieved by the user's weight shifts to activate sensors in the device which
      initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs, replacing deficient neuromuscular
      function.

      Ekso provides functional based rehabilitation, over ground gait training, and upright, weight
      bearing exercise unlike any other. It has been designed for the needs of busy therapists
      treating a wide range of patients in a single day. The suit is strapped over the users´
      clothing with easy adjustments to transition between patients in as little as five minutes.

      Before, during and after training sessions the subjects will perform standardised assessments
      and complete questionnaires to assess the functional and psychological effects of the
      exoskeleton.
