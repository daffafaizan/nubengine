      terminating cardiac arrhythmias. Conventional wisdom indicates that external DC cardioversion
      causes myocardial injury. Previous research has shown that DC cardioversion resulted in
      myocardial injury as evidenced by increased levels of cardiac troponin, even though those
      changes were modest. Many of these studies evaluated monophasic defibrillators and older,
      less sensitive cardiac troponin assays. The current standard is now to use modern biphasic
      defibrillators and new high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays (hs-cTnT). It is conceivable
      that the newer defibrillators may not cause myocardial injury. It would be important to
      understand if myocardial injury occurs in this setting and its approximate magnitude as it
      would the interpretation of hs-cTnT values in patients and therefore influenced diagnoses. It
      may be if a threshold energy level can be identified that is would also influence the choice
      of energy used to deliver the shock in this situation.

      A previous preliminary study documented no evidence of myocardial injury after elective DC
      cardioversion with modern day defibrillators. We aim to validate and expand that study here
      at Mayo Clinic Rochester.
