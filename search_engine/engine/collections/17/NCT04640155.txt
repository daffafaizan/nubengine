      and provide a fecal sample for calprotectin measurement. Shortly after their screening visit,
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the low FODMAP diet (experimental) or regular diet
      (control) group. Patients in the experimental group will schedule a telephone visit with a
      registered dietician. During this approximately hour-long session, patients in the low FODMAP
      cohort will be counseled regarding FODMAP containing foods. They will be asked to adhere to
      this diet over the next 6 weeks. At the end of the 6 week period, subjects will complete a
      3-day food diary. Those in the regular diet group will be contacted by the dietician and
      given an educational handout at the beginning of the study period regarding best dietary
      practices. At the end of the 6 week study period, both groups will again be asked to complete
      another set of symptom surveys and provide a fecal sample for calprotectin measurement.
