    
      This clinical trial is a blinded before and after comparison of the effect on patients
      treated with a red-light LLLT therapy for acute lung inflammation as a result of COVID-19
      infection. Patients are enrolled to undergo LLLT therapy in addition to all standard ongoing
      therapies for COVID-19.

      Outcomes for patients receiving LLLT in addition to their standard care (the treatment group)
      are compared to the group receiving only standard therapy for COVID-19 (control group).
      Effects of LLLT treatment are measured immediately following treatment, and outcome
      measurements are compared to the pre-treatment baseline.
