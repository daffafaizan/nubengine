      of skin testing with beta lactam containing antibiotics other than penicillin .

      It is hypothesized that the concentrations that should be used for beta lactams are actually
      much lower than previously recommended and that the higher incidence of identifiable beta
      lactam induced allergic reactions during anesthesia in the past may be due to irritation of
      the skin rather than a true allergic reaction (false positives).
