    
      Materials and methods: Prospective cohort of 40 COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), positive patients from Tampere university hospital region are
      recruited to the study. Forty COVID-19 negative patients with similar symptoms act as a
      control group.

      All subjects are screened for other respiratory viruses with RT-PCR-multiplex tests. Viral
      loads of SARS-CoV-2 from anterior nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and saliva are evaluated
      by RT-PCR (Ct value) and antigen testing (RLU value).

      During the first visit NEWS (National Early Warning Score), recorded pulmonary auscultation
      (Thinklabs One, Thinklabs Medical LLC), impulse oscillometry (Tremoflo, THORASYS Thoracic
      Medical Systems Inc), FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide) and FnNO (fractional nasal
      nitric oxide) (NIOX VEROÂ®,Circassia) are conducted. All aforementioned and a spirometry are
      measured again after 2 months.

      Aims: To evaluate the relation of COVID-19 infection and its severity to upper and lower
      airway nitric oxide, viral load and lung function. To compare the capability of RT-PCR in
      detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva, anterior nasal swab samples and oropharyngeal swap
      samples vs. the golden standard of nasopharyngeal swab samples. To compare the results of
      RT-PCR and antigen test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 from nasal and pharyngeal sample sites.
