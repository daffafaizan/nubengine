    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and
           docetaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of phenoxodiol on the toxicity of docetaxel using a weekly
           treatment regimen.

        -  Determine if combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and docetaxel is more
           efficacious than docetaxel therapy alone.

        -  Determine if combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and docetaxel affects blood
           levels of either drug.

        -  Determine phenotypic differences in the tumor cells of "responders" and
           "non-responders."

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral placebo
           three times daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral phenoxodiol three times daily on days 1-21 and docetaxel
           as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
