    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients achieving a 50% reduction in serum PSA from
           baseline in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) receiving
           sorafenib tosylate and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival of patients with AIPC.

        -  To quantify the number and percent of patients who have stable disease at 6 months of
           therapy (failure to progress).

        -  To estimate median time to progression for all patients.

        -  To estimate the objective response rate of patients with AIPC treated with this regimen.

        -  To measure the percentage of patients surviving at 2 years.

        -  To determine the toxicities and estimate toxicity rates for patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To measure changes in tumor vasculature in response to therapy in selected patients with
           dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and correlate primary and secondary objectives
           to these measurement changes.

        -  To measure changes in serum HMGB1 in response to therapy and correlate primary and
           secondary objectives with these changes.

        -  To measure changes in serum cathepsin D in response to therapy and correlate primary and
           secondary objectives with these changes.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 2-19 and docetaxel IV
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses. Patients then receive oral
      sorafenib tosylate alone twice daily on days 1-19 with treatment repeating every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically to measure serum HMGB1 and cathepsin D levels
      before and after therapy.
