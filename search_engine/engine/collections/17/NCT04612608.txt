      patient positioning in a specialized upright bed, on outcomes of mechanically ventilated
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are in the ICU. This study is a
      prospective, non-blinded, feasibility, randomized study of ARDS patients, who will be
      randomized into two treatment groups. One treatment arm will deliver scheduled sessions of
      upright bed positioning (study intervention), while the other treatment arm receives routine
      bed position care (care provided exclusively with the bed in the supine position). ICU
      Practitioners know that positional changes improve clinical outcomes when turning patients
      from supine to prone (back to belly); however, other positional changes including upright
      positioning are far less studied. It is well known that in ARDS patients who become proned,
      an improvement in aeration occurs in the dorsal lung regions (prone positioning has been
      shown to reduce ARDS mortality). Thus the investigators predict that in this study, the
      upright positioning holds the potential to further recruit collapsed lung areas. Augmentation
      of aerated lung while in the upright position is expected to increase the highest value
      measured per ventilator day of the respiratory system compliance in the upright bed position
      arm, in a greater fashion than the highest value measured per ventilator day of daily total
      respiratory system compliance for the usual care arm.
