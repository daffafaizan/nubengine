      urgently needed. We assessed whether multimodal interventions based on rhythm-and-music
      therapy or horse-riding therapy could lead to increased perceived recovery and functional
      improvement in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.

      Methods: Participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy, horse-riding therapy, or
      control using concealed randomization, stratified with respect to sex and stroke laterality.
      Therapy was given twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in participants'
      perception of stroke recovery as assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale with an
      intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary objective outcome measures were changes in balance,
      gait, grip strength, and cognition. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline,
      postintervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.

      Results: One hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy
      (n=41), horse-riding therapy (n=41), or control (n=41). Post-intervention, the perception of
      stroke recovery (mean change from baseline on a scale ranging from 1 to 100) was higher among
      rhythm-and-music therapy (5.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-9.61]) and horse-riding therapy
      participants (9.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.00-13.66]), compared with controls (-0.5 [-3.20
      to 2.28]); P=0.001 (1-way ANOVA). The improvements were sustained in both intervention groups
      6 months later, and corresponding gains were observed for the secondary outcomes.

      Conclusions: Multimodal interventions can improve long-term perception of recovery, as well
      as balance, gait, grip strength, and working memory in a mixed population of individuals in
      late phase after stroke.
