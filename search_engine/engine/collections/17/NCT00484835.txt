    
      Patients booked for total abdominal hysterectomy in Southern Health will be offered
      participation in the trial, and randomised to two groups: one group undergoing the procedure
      with the gyrus forceps & the other group with the traditional clamp & suture method. Each
      patient will receive detailed information regarding the study both in document form as well
      as verbally by the Gynaecology doctors in the pre-admission clinic prior to obtaining
      consent.

      The researcher will collect relevant data including age of patient, medical & surgical
      history and data relating to both the primary & secondary outcome measures, which include
      length of operation, intra-operative blood loss,post-operative pain measures as well as
      length of hospital stay & cost.

      A qualified statistician will perform power calculations and analyse the data collected,
      looking at the outcome measures mentioned above.

      Electrical surgery has been used extensively in surgery, especially in laparoscopic surgery,
      and the use of these newer electrocoagulation forceps that can simultaneously haemostatically
      seal & cut tissue is again well established in laparoscopic surgery but only more recently
      introduced to open surgical procedures. To date, except for 1 pilot study, there are no
      randomised control trials that confirm the proposed benefits of these newer device in
      abdominal hysterectomy.
