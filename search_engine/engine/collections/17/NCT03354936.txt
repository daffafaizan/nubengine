    
      Primary Objective To evaluate clinical and biological safety of the use of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors in HIV infected patients with cancer treated by Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors
      (ICPi).

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate evolution of HIV immunological and virological data in HIV infected patients
           with cancer treated by Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICPi):

        -  HIV-RNA plasma viral load

        -  Evolution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells counts, CD4/CD8 ratio

        -  To assess the efficacy endpoint : progression-free survival, overall survival rate at 1
           year and 2 years.

        -  Potential Modification of antiretroviral therapy

      Secondary objectives of the Physiopathological Substudy "OncoVIRIM" (Limited to a few
      clinical centers with a suitable technical tray) :

        -  To evaluate response to ICPi treatment according to RECIST criteria (solid tumor) and
           CHESON criteria (lymphoma)

        -  Other immunological and virological explorations on HIV :

        -  To evaluate low level HIV replication and size of the HIV reservoir

        -  To evaluate effects of ICPi on HIV-specific immune responses

        -  To show the effects of ICPi on HIV-related immune alterations such as T cell
           differentiation, T cell activation/exhaustion and systemic inflammation

        -  To demonstrate an effect on other viruses-specific T cells and viremia (EBV, CMV, HHV-8,
           HBV et HCV (if co-infected)

        -  To better understand the pathophysiology of ICPi-related immune adverse effects,
           particularly the development of infraclinical auto-immunity : monitoring of
           autoantibodies and analysis of changes in B cell antibodies repertoires

        -  To find immune biomarkers predictive for clinical response to ICPi, MHC class I and II
           in particular and description of any gene of interest in the context of ICPi treatment
