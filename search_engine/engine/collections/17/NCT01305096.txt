    
      This randomized, controlled trial involving 44 male and females in Sweden will investigate
      whether yoga inversions and semi-inversions and other dynamic and static yoga postures will
      affect the following variables: heart rate variability, oxygen uptake, anthropometric
      variables, common symptoms in general practice, sleepiness, sleep quality and
      recovery/recuperation after sleep, blood pressure, blood lipids, blood proteins, blood sugar,
      salivary cortisol, hand grip strength, relaxation and recovery perceived stress, self-rated
      health, rating of perceived exertion, satisfaction with life, and work-family conflict.

      Participants will be divided into an intervention group and a passive control group. The
      intervention group will participate in six to ten weeks of yoga classes. The classes will be
      held 1-2 times a week for approximately one hour each and will include yoga poses and
      breathing techniques. The control group will not participate in any intervention but will
      conduct their lives as usual.

      The variables will be assessed at baseline; at the end of the intervention; and three, six,
      and twelve months after the end of the intervention.
