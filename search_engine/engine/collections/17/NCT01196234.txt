    
      A randomized phase II trial that compares paclitaxel/carboplatin (PC) to PC chemotherapy
      followed by gefitinib for 2 weeks in patients with NSCLC without EGFR mutations. While
      previous studies with cytotoxic agents and gefitinib failed to show any benefit, we altered
      the schedule of administration in hopes to gain synergy between agents.
