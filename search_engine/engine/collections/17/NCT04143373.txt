      mandibular third molar surgery, with normal saline of 25 ± 2 ° C and 37 ± 1 ° C for control
      and experimental sides, respectively. For this purpose, 40 mandibular impacted third molars
      will be randomly allocated to two groups and surgically removed with the abovementioned
      saline temperatures. Finally, the suctioned liquids and duration of the surgeries will be
      carefully measured and compared between both sides.
