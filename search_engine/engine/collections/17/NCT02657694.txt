    
      The high prices of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) medications in many
      countries have led patients to seek out less expensive generic alternatives.

      The efficacy and safety of these generic medications has not been formally demonstrated in
      clinical practice.

      The primary goal of REDEMPTION is to collate the clinical results of these generic
      medications.

      The secondary goal is to answer efficacy questions for which there is currently insufficient
      trial data available - for example Sofosbuvir+Daclatasvir appears to be an inexpensive pan
      genotypic solution to treat HCV globally but this is supported by a total n of less than
      1000, and in some common genotypes, such as HCV Genotype 2, by an n of only 52 making for a
      wide margin of error and a high degree of uncertainty.
