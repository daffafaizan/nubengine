        1. To compare several autonomic, electric and metabolic risk markers in a case-control
           study between the patients with coronary artery disease with and without type II
           diabetes at the time of diagnosis of CAD.

        2. To assess the prognostic significance of autonomic markers, electrical markers, coronary
           angiographic markers and metabolic markers in predicting the cardiac events among the
           CAD patients with and without diabetes

        3. To develop and test the feasibility of home-monitoring of biosignals among the type II
           diabetic patients with CAD.

        4. To further explore the molecular, cellular and genetic factors that predispose diabetics
           to cardiovascular diseases.

        5. To develop new methods for the early clinical diagnosis of vulnerable subjects
           susceptible to the complications of the coronary artery disease in Type 2 diabetes.

      5. To assess the effects of controlled exercise training programs to several autonomic,
      electrical and metabolic risk markers among the type II diabetic patients with CAD
