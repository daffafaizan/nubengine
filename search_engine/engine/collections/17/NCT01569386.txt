      arterial stiffening in atherosclerosis. In hemiplegics, disuse of the affected limb is
      associated with the muscle wasting leading to development of local atherosclerosis. The
      brachial-ankle aortic PWV (baPWV) is an indicator of early stage disuse syndrome, and is
      measured with a device that is particularly useful in elderly hemiplegics.

      The LIPA regime was designed to result in an increase of 3.3% (about 40 kcal/day) of daily
      energy consumption compared to their individual baseline values. This included aerobic
      exercises and half squats (70Â° knee flexion) for altogether about 20 minutes, once daily. In
      addition, the subjects performed passive ankle dorsiflexion-plantar flexion, 30 times/minute
      for 10 min, once daily. The LIPA was aimed at affecting the passive range of motion in ankle,
      knee, and hip, and weight bearing on the affected leg in standing position.
