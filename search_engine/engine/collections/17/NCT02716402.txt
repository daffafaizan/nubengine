      due to abnormal connection between the heart's right and left sides. The reduced oxygenation
      of the blood affects several organs of the body and a common complications to the disease is
      blood clots. Despite the patients are young and do not have typical risk factors, previous
      studies have shown, that they have a very high prevalence of thrombosis in the lungs and
      brain.

      The reason for the increased prevalence of blood clots is not known. A previous study
      investigated the prevalence of blood clots systematically in patients with cyanotic
      congenital heart disease and found that approximately 30-40% of the patients had had a clot
      in the lung or brain. Thus, the study could not predict, when the patient had had a
      thrombotic event, and most of the patients did not previously had imaging performed.
      Therefore the aim of this study is to re-examine previously examined cyanotic patients
      regardless of previous medical history, to assess how many of the patients have obtained
      additional blood clots since they were examined 8 years ago.
