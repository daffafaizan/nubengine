      groups : target concentration-delivered propofol-remifentanil versus sufentanil-sevoflurane.
      The primary judgement criterion will be the rapidity of awakening, defined as the time
      between the cessation of administration of the last anesthetic until extubation. Several
      secondary judgement criteria related to quality of postoperative recovery and complications
      will be collected. The hypothesis tested is a 30% reduction of the time necessary to extubate
      patients after cessation of anesthetic delivery in the propofol-remifentanil group. Based on
      previous works, using an risk of 20 % and an of 5 %, 100 patients must be included in this
      study (50 or each group). Statistical analysis will be performed by WILCOXON MANN, WHITNEY
      and X2 tests based on the type of variables.

      The results of this study should provide a first choice anaesthetic regimen to optimize
      postoperative recovery of neurosurgical patients undergoing resection of supratentorial brain
      tumours. They will contribute to the improvement in the management of patients suffering from
      cancer.
