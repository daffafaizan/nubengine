      series of tests at three different time points over a one year period: a baseline set of
      tests, tested when haemoglobin is maintained at 130-140g/L and repeat the tests when
      haemoglobin is maintained at 105-115g/L. The current recommendation for haemoglobin is
      110-120g/L. Patients will not be required to take any study medication but a specialist
      kidney doctor, using their usual medications of iron and erythropoietin therapy, will change
      their haemoglobin levels.
