      associated morbidity and mortality rates have escalated in recent years. Despite improvements
      in surveillance and clinical treatment strategies, the prognosis of HCC remains very poor due
      to high incidence of recurrence and metastasis. Recent clinical studies have provided
      evidence that circulating tumor cell (CTC) may directly participate in the metastasis cascade
      in various types of malignancies. The investigators previous data indicated that HCC patients
      with preoperative CTC levels ≥2 suffered significantly earlier recurrence (within 1 year)
      than patients with lower levels. However, the benefits of postoperative adjuvant therapies in
      preventing early recurrence in patients with preoperative CTC ≥2 remain to be elucidated.
      Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. The
      investigators design a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE
      after hepatectomy to reduce early recurrence rates in HCC patients with preoperative CTC
      level ≥2.
