      Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In this study the hypothesis is that the use of
      plerixafor and G-CSF as additional agents in conditioning regimen would offers advantages.
      The effect is based on mobilizing bone marrow stem cells into the peripheral blood and
      blocking CXCR4 chemokine receptors to prevent stem cell homing. Thus, some have hypothesized
      that plerixafor and G-CSF make free stromal space of the bone marrow available for donor stem
      cell engraftment. Moreover, stem cell release probably leads to liberation of host stem cells
      from the anti-apoptotic effects of the BM stroma for the more powerful effect of
      chemotherapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of
      myeloablative conditioning with Plerixafor and G-CSF as additional agents for prevention of
      graft failure after stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.
