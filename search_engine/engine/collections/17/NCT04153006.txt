      with rapid availability of results, has attracted much interest in the emergency department
      setting (ED) and seems feasible. These devices might enable earlier decisions, reduce stay at
      the ED and improve patient flow. While an elevated troponin in patients with suspected acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) confirms diagnosis and initiates adequate treatment, ruling out ACS
      aids in proper patient dismissal. A next step could be ruling out myocardial infarction by
      the general practitioner (GP) or fast responder using an on-site POC troponin test. However,
      drawing venous blood might not be easily available to every GP, especially not during peak
      hours. The Minicare cTnI is a bedside system which requires capillary blood, venous whole
      blood or plasma. The results of the troponin will be given within 10 minutes. It is a very
      sensitive troponin test, the most clinically sensitive available POC for c-Troponin.
      Currently Minicare prepares for a high sensitive troponin analysis targeting a reliable
      result within an hour after onset of chest pain. The objective of this study is to determine
      if high sensitive troponin testing by Minicare (POC HS cTnI) has the same analytical
      performance as standard high sensitivity troponin I testing in our central hospital
      laboratory ( CL HS cTnI ARCHITECT immunoassay analyzer, Abbott).
