      improve other subjective and objective qualities of hypertrophic and/or contracted burn scars
      with or without involvement of nearby mobile joints.

      The investigators hypothesize that fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy will increase
      range of motion and improve tissue compliance in all scars overlying a mobile joint that has
      been limited due to burn scar contracture. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the
      effect of fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy on common sequelae of hypertrophic and/or
      contracted burn scars.
