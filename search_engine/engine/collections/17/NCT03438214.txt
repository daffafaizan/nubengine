      gram-positive microorganisms and remains effective against multiresistant bacteria as the
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the main microorganism causing nosocomial
      infections. Around the world, the continuous infusion of vancomycin has been studied and
      associated with less rate of nephrotoxicity. This is a randomized, controlled multicenter
      clinical trial that will compare continuous infusion with the intermittent vancomycin
      infusion, the relationship between infusion type with rate of nephrotoxicity and the time to
      target therapeutic serum in critically ill patients at the intensive care units of the Cancer
      Institute of the State of Sao Paulo (ICESP) and the Heart Institute (Incor).
