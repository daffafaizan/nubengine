      I. Evaluate potential prognostic and predictive markers in patients receiving adjuvant
      chemotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. To perform cross-validation analyses for the predictive value of cyclin-dependent kinase
      inhibitor 1B (p27), excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), beta-tubulin and
      B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein (BAX).

      III. To perform cross-validation analyses for the prognostic value of mucin and breast cancer
      (BRCA)1 expression.

      IV. To perform a pooled analysis for the prognostic impact of p53 protein expression by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor protein p53 (p53) mutation, ras mutation and epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and Fas cell surface death receptor (Fas)/Fas ligand
      (FasL) expression by IHC.

      V. Validation of the 15-gene prognostic and predictive messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
      signature on Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE)-Bio formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
      (FFPE) tumor samples.

      VI. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of known potential
      oncogenic mutations using LACE-Bio FFPE.

      VII. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of gene copy variation
      using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples.

      VIII. Exploratory identification and evaluation of prognostic and predictive value of novel
      genomic aberrations discovered by Next Generation Sequencing on LACE-Bio tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed by IHC.
