      novel, family-based intervention that promotes PA within the context of evidence-based
      behavioral management training (BMT) for parents, enhanced with mobile health (mHealth)
      behavior change strategies. Our first aim is to test the feasibility and acceptability, of an
      8-week, family-based, multi-level intervention (BMT-Health) to promote PA in young children
      with ADHD. Our second aim is to derive an estimate of the effect size of the intervention on
      PA.
