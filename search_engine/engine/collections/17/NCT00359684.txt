      cysteamine since 1978. This therapy prevents or delays renal deterioration, improves growth,
      and depletes parenchymal tissues of cystine. Based largely upon data produced through this
      protocol, the Food and Drug Administration approved cysteamine bitartrate for use in
      cystinosis patients on August 15, 1994. Cysteamine is available as CystagonR through Mylan
      Pharmaceuticals in 50 mg and 150 mg capsules and as ProcysbiR in 75 mg capsules. By virtue of
      the current protocol, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for investigations
      every two years, except for cases of great interest or urgency. On each 1-3 day admission, a
      battery of tests is performed and the adequacy of cystine depletion by cysteamine is
      monitored. This protocol demonstrates the course of cystinosis patients treated with
      cysteamine, describes new complications of the disorder in poorly treated adults, and
      maintains NHGRI expertise in the field. Its monitoring and followup of patients over the
      course of 3 decades represents an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the natural
      history of this rare disease.
