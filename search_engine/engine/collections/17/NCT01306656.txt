      produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels. In
      primary hyperparathyroidism, high levels of PTH remove too much calcium from bones and
      deposit the excess calcium in the blood, which is then filtered into the urine by the
      kidneys. Bone health is threatened by the excess calcium loss which weakens the structure of
      the bones.

      Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism also have low vitamin D (25OHD) levels which
      is thought to further impair bone health. Recent medical guidelines recommend treating
      patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who have low vitamin D levels with oral vitamin D
      but the optimal vitamin D dose and rate of repletion is unclear. It is, therefore, important
      to determine if replenishing Vitamin D will improve bone health in primary
      hyperparathyroidism, and if so, to assess the impact of the rate of vitamin D repletion.
