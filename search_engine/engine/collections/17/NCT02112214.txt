      cancer is still an important global public health problem, especially in East Asian
      countries, where the burden of the disease is substantial. In the Republic of Korea, gastric
      cancer remains the leading cause of cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer in women.
      There is sufficient epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting a causal link
      between bacterial infection with H. pylori and gastric cancer development. However, evidence
      from clinical trials on the efficacy of H. pylori eradication with antimicrobial therapy to
      reduce the risk of gastric cancer is still limited. In addition, the beneficial or
      deleterious health impact of mass eradication at the population level has not been defined.
      In Korea, the prevalence of H. pylori infection in adults is still relatively high (~60%, >16
      years old), and despite important reductions in mortality attributed to the screening
      program, incidence of gastric cancer remains elevated.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial in Korea to
      evaluate the efficacy of H. pylori eradication to prevent gastric cancer incidence in
      different population subgroups including age and baseline gastric pathology. This study will
      be conducted in the context of the National Cancer Screening Program and the Korean Central
      Cancer Registry.

      The proposed study will be a collaborative investigation between the National Cancer Center,
      Korea and the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization.
