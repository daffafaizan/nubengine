      endoscope. Retroflection of the endoscope has blind areas and affects the precise operation.
      And, short-needle injection can easily lead to artificial ulcer and secondary bleeding. CAES
      is a new, minimally invasive endoscopic technique for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids
      and rectal prolapse. CAES was performed based on the requirement of the cap, endoscope,
      disposable endoscopic long injection needle, enough insufflated air and sclerosing agent. It
      can accurately control the injection angle, direction and depth under direct vision, and
      avoid iatrogenic injury caused by ectopic injection to the greatest possible extent. To
      investigate the effect of long needle and short needle on the outcome of CAES, participants
      with internal hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse were randomly assigned to a long needle group
      and a short needle group using a prospective, randomized, controlled study at multiple
      centers in China. The efficacy, adverse events and satisfaction of the two groups were
      observed.
