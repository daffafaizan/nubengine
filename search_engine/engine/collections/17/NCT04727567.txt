      the Atrium Health electronic data warehouse (EDW) by IAS Clinical Quality Analytics, and
      eligibility for the MVP program of patients on this list will be determined by the Population
      Health's Care Management team based on predefined eligibility criteria. IAS CORE will
      randomize eligible participants into one of two groups: 1) MVP program; or 2) usual care.

      Population Health's Multiple Visit Patient (MVP) care management program aims to manage
      health and lower hospital utilization among patients with a history of high inpatient
      hospital stays at Atrium Health. Patients eligible for the program have four or more
      inpatient visits over the 12-month period prior to enrollment. Once enrolled, each MVP
      program participant receives on-going support from an assigned MVP care manager and larger
      care management team, including the following core program components:

        1. customized care plan developed for each patient at the time of enrollment

        2. routine, virtual health monitoring and collaborative care management team-based review

        3. personalized navigation and coordination across multidisciplinary Atrium Health
           services, as needed

        4. education, health coaching, and support via telephonic and in-person interactions, as
           needed

      The control group will receive usual care.

      Upon completion of the 12-month period during which outcomes data will be accrued, the study
      will evaluate whether 12-month participation in the MVP program care management program,
      compared to usual care, reduced inpatient hospital use.
