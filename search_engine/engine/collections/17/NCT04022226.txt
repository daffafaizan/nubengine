      receiving ECT randomized to ketamine or methohexital where ketamine suppresses infra-slow
      waves. The rationale for this project is to identify biomarkers of treatment adequacy in ECT,
      which could lead to decreased morbidity and mortality with the procedure and lessen the
      burden of depression in our patient population.
