      (ICU), with an average age of 69 years, without neurologic disorder before initiation of a
      continuous piperacillin infusion at the standard dose and who underwent piperacillin serum
      concentration monitoring. The patients included consisted of adults who received continuous
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam at the standard dose adjusted to the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease
      (MDRD) formula (12 or 16 g/24 h for an estimated GFR [eGFR] of > 40 ml/liter/min/1.73 m2, 12
      g/24 h for an eGFR of > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 8 g/24h for an eGFR of <20 ml/min/1.73 m2) and
      who underwent monitoring of the piperacillin serum concentration over a 22-month period. The
      total serum concentration of piperacillin was measured after at least 48 h of treatment by a
      validated method combining high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array
      detection.

      Among them, 23 developed a neurologic disorder for which the piperacillin causality was
      chronologically and semiologically suggestive. A concentration threshold of 157.2 mg/liter
      independently predicted neurotoxicity with 96.7% specificity and 52.2% sensitivity and may
      constitute a limitation when targeting less susceptible pathogens.
