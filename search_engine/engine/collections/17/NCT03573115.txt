      substances for the external treatment of acne. Adapalene is a substance that resembles
      A-vitamin acid, which dissolves and prevents clog formation in the sebaceous glands. Benzoyl
      peroxide works by reducing the amount of bacteria while dissolving the clogs in the sebaceous
      glands. Epiduo is the only antibiotic-free combination for the treatment of acne.

      Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are non-invasive
      imaging technologies allowing for imaging of the upper skin layers. Gold microparticles have
      been shown to have a contrast effect on the images. In addition to the contrast effect on
      images, gold microparticles have proven to be effective in the treatment of skin disease
      acne. The treatment with gold microparticles uses a combination of the gold microparticles
      and a laser. The microparticles consist of very small particles of silica, surrounded by a
      shell of gold. These two components of the microparticles are selected from their way of
      absorbing light from a laser. The particles absorb the light from the laser and are thus
      heated. The surrounding skin can not absorb the light and therefore will maintain its normal
      temperature.
