      type 2 diabetes - promotora-led lifestyle intervention and metformin - vs. usual care (UC)
      among Latinas in a "real world" setting. The aims of this study are to 1) develop a
      protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk
      Latinas, and assess its feasibility; 2) compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic
      markers-hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood pressure-from baseline to 1 year between
      at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group versus metformin and usual care (UC)
      groups; and 3) understand the social and cultural context surrounding weight-related
      behaviors among Latinas at-risk for diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that Latinas
      assigned to PLI and metformin will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater
      improvements in cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC
