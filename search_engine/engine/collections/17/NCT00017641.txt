      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of
      cyclophosphamide and continuing until leukapheresis is complete. Leukapheresis continues
      daily until target number of cells is harvested. CD 34+ cells are isolated from peripheral
      blood stem cells (PBSC) in vitro.

      Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, anti-thymocyte
      globulin IV over 10 hours on days -4 to -2, and G-CSF SC beginning on day 0 and continuing
      until blood counts recover. Patients undergo reinfusion of CD34+ PBSC on day 0.

      Patients are followed weekly for 90 days, monthly for 1 year, and at 2 years.
