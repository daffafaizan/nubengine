      is currently used as a mucolytic agent in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. This prospective,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study should carry out whether the
      therapeutic use of rhDNase can be extended to adults who are undergoing long term ventilation
      at the intensive care. It is hypothesized that mechanically ventilated patients show elevated
      concentrations of DNA in airway secretions, and that these pathological DNA levels are
      reduced by rhDNase. The primary clinical goal of the study is to establish wether ventilation
      times are shortend under inhalation of rhDNAse during the ventilation time. hDNase (verum) is
      compared with equal amounts of 0.9% saline solution (placebo).
