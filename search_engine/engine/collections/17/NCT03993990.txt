      From August 2019 to July 2021, 160 subjects will be recruited at a medical center and
      randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison group. Participants in the intervention
      group will receive an assessment of their self-care demand and self-efficacy, as well as an
      empowerment-based program delivered by the project host. The program includes the
      identification of the problems of participants, clarification of their feelings and the
      significance of their problems, plan setting discussion, motivation for action, and
      evaluation of the execution of their plan. Empowerment-based strategies will be provided
      individually at the following time points: before discharge, on post-discharge days 3, 7, 14,
      21, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84, and at 6, 9, and 12 months post-discharge. Those in the
      comparison group will receive routine care only. Outcome measures include self-care
      behaviors, glycemic control (measured by HbA1C), diabetic foot ulcer infection, and diabetic
      foot ulcer recurrence. Data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after
      discharge
