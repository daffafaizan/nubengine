      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of both
      hospital acquired and community acquired infections. In particular, the increase in
      Enterobacteriaceae expressing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases
      that are resistant to all oral beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones in the community have
      resulted in many patients requiring admission just for IV antibiotics to treat their
      infections.

      Qpex Biopharma is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of QPX2015 (beta-lactam
      antibiotic) plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor.
