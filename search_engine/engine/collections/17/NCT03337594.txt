      or disease processes more clearly visible on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and
      therefore gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in medical imaging.
      Recently, new evidence suggests that following GBCA administration, gadolinium can be
      deposited in body tissues even in the presence of normal renal function. Therefore, it is
      essential to ensure that significant accumulation of free Gd3+ is not occurring in the bones
      of children undergoing clinical contrasted MRI scans. This is particularly important for
      those pediatric patients who will undergo multiple repeated MRI exams throughout their
      lifetime and thereby be exposed to a large cumulative dose of gadolinium contrast. As the
      differences in stability between the various GBCAs may be a factor in gadolinium exposure,
      the primary objective of this study is to assess gadolinium deposition in the bones of
      pediatric patients in two patient groups: 1. patients who received IV administration of
      gadolinium contrast agent (Dotarem) and 2. patients who received IV administration of
      gadolinium contrast agent (MultiHance).

      Once acquired the samples will be analyzed at an off-site facility, National Institute of
      Standards and Technology (NIST), using standardized equipment which has been certified for
      measuring gadolinium concentration in contrast agent samples. A signed agreement for the
      transfer of non-proprietary biological material between MUSC and NIST covers the transfer of
      the samples.
