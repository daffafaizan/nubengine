      patients. It is mostly prevalent following an antibiotic treatment. In recent years the
      investigators are witnessing an increase in severity, incidence and treatment-resistant
      cases.

      Treatment-resistant infection or recurrent infection put the patient at risk for severe
      complications, such as perforation, septic shock, megacolon and even death.

      New antibiotic treatments such as Rifaximin and Fidaxomicin are not yet available for routine
      use in Israel.

      It is known that normal intestinal microbiota protect against Clostridium Difficile
      infections, and as early as 1958, researchers have demonstrated that a transplantation of
      fecal microbiota had a beneficial effect on Clostridium Difficile Infection.

      In fact, previous data show that microbiota transplantation during colonoscopy, in patients
      with treatment-resistant infection or recurrent infections, is an effective method with a 90%
      success rate in a single treatment.

      The investigators propose testing whether fecal transplantation from a healthy donor can lead
      to a recovery from Clostridium Difficile infection.
