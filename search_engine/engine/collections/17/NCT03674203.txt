      methods: Prospective cohort with therapeutic intervention. Patients, female, with melasma
      were included. Changes in the melanin concentration of the face (MASI), degree of
      satisfaction (MELASQOL) and histological changes were clinically evaluated.

      The Sp-MELASQOL questionnaire, Fitzpatrick and MASI scales were applied, and photographs were
      taken with ambient light and with Wood's light with the Janus-II General Model. The patients
      were evaluated and classified, before and after the treatment by means of dermatoscopy, which
      was performed using a dermatoscope with polarized light (DermLite DL3NÂ®), which allows an
      increase from 6 to 400X.

      The dermatoscopy reported the findings of: Quantity, Density and Depth of melasma.
