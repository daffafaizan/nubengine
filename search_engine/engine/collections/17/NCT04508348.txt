    
      This is a single blinded (physician investigator), randomized, controlled trial to evaluate
      length of stay in infants with NAS and an exclusive human milk diet during their initial
      hospitalization after birth and through the 28 days of life or hospital discharge, whichever
      comes first.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups after at birth. Parents who decline
      participation for their infants in the study will be asked to consent to data gathering on
      their infants who will be treated and fed per institutional practice. The data on these
      individuals will be summarized and evaluated descriptively in comparison with the actual
      trial results.

      All experimental group participants will receive exclusive maternal human milk or donor human
      milk prior to randomization. Once randomized, patients in Group One will receive an exclusive
      human milk diet throughout the 28-day feeding period or until hospital discharge, whichever
      comes first. Patients in Group Two (Control Group) will receive maternal human milk or
      formula (per standard of care). Fortification will be implemented with a standard protocol.
