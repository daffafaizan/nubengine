      for crack users living in the "Crackland" region. To achieve this goal, regular treatment
      staff from Unidade Recomeço Helvétia treatment service will be capacitated in CM to latter-on
      apply the CM intervention in their respective services. The design will be a single-blind
      randomized clinical trial composed of a sample of 100 subjects with current diagnose for
      crack/cocaine dependence. Participants allocated to the control condition will receive 12
      weeks of the usual care treatment provided by these two treatment facilities. Participants
      allocated to the experimental condition will receive the exact same treatment as control
      participants associated with CM. CM procedure will occur 2 timer per week (every Monday and
      Thursday or Tuesday and Friday). Primary outcomes are: (1)retention in treatment; (2)
      reduction of crack use; (3) promotion of continuous crack cocaine abstinence. Secondary
      findings are reduction on psychiatric symptomatology. The investigator hypothesis is that
      participants in the CM condition will have a better treatment response in all studied
      outcomes.
