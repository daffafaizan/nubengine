      with breast cancer causes some complications and neuropathy is one of the most frequent that
      is dose limiting and even may cause to stop the therapy. n-3 fatty acids have very
      significant role in improvement the function of the neurons.n-3 fatty acids decrease the
      demyelination and toxicities resulting from taxanes. They also lower the level of of the
      neurotoxic inflammatory agents. So,n-3 fatty acids improve the quality of life in this
      patients. 52 patients with invasive breast cancer will be randomized in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled manner to receive either 640 mg oil fish pearls( 54% DHA, 10% EPA) 3 times
      a day or placebo( corn oil pearls) for 3 months(during the chemotherapy with taxanes).
      Neuropathy (using EMG-NCV test)and the level of IL-1,IL-6, TNF-alpha, hs-crp and serum level
      of EPA and DHA fatty acids will be measured before chemotherapy with taxanes and at the end
      of the therapy (after 3 months).
