      after minor cerebral ischemia of arterial origin. Anticoagulation (AC) has been proven highly
      effective in preventing vascular events after myocardial infarction and after cerebral
      ischemia in patients with atrial fibrillation. A previous study on the effects of AC after
      cerebral ischemia of arterial origin (SPIRIT) showed that high intensity AC (INR 3.0 to 4.5)
      is not safe, but that mild AC (INR 2.0 to 3.0) was. The 2nd European Stroke Prevention Trial
      (ESPS-2) reported a 22% relative risk reduction of the combination of ASA and dipyridamole
      (DIP) above that of ASA only; its results, however, are subject to debate.

      Study design: ESPRIT was an open randomised controlled trial allocating patients who
      experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a non-disabling ischemic stroke to either:

      A. oral AC (INR 2.0 to 3.0);

      B. the combination of DIP (400 mg daily) plus ASA (30-325 mg/day); or

      C. ASA only (same dose).

      The mean follow-up was three years. Primary outcome was the composite of vascular death,
      stroke, myocardial infarction or major bleeding. Outcome assessment is blind.
