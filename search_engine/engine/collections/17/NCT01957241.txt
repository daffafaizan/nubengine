      cancer progression or microenvironment interaction. However, the commonly used enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) requires the certain volume of each sample for specific antigen
      or antibody. It may not be practically efficient to test a broad spectrum of biomarkers with
      limited volumes of serum from cancer patients. Proximity ligation assay (PLA), an established
      concept and platform requiring very little sample volume to quantitatively detect a variety
      of biomarkers, is being developed with multiplex versions of improved sensitivity and dynamic
      range by the Stanford group. From the three completed trials ("In vivo/vitro
      radiation-induced liver disease in HBV carrier（9261700196）", "Bystander effect study of
      radiation-induced viral hepatitis B reactivation（9261700196）", and "Pre- and
      post-chemoradiation blood RNA-microarray analysis to predict response and outcome of locally
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma（200805061R）") and one ongoing trial ("A phase I
      dose escalation trial of conformal hypofractionated radiation therapy for patients with
      hepatitis B virus-related Child A cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma（200906051R）"), we
      have collected the pre-treatment and post-treatment serum samples of patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing definitive radiotherapy and patients with esophageal
      cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Altered patterns of failure for
      post-radiotherapy hepatocellular carcinoma, especially intrahepatic and extrahepatic
      metastasis, and treatment response for post-chemoradiotherapy esophageal cancer upon
      esophagectomy, demands the effective biomarkers for the early prediction and appropriate
      management. The limited sample volumes form the obstacle of testing adequate number of
      biomarkers by ELISA. In this study we plan to collaborate with the Stanford group, to send
      and process these samples (100 μL each) to measure the dynamic changes of up to 56 or more
      biomarkers. We try to find the potential biomarkers correlating with treatment responses and
      patterns of failure for the future clinical practice, and wish to set up this viable PLA
      platform in our institute through this collaboration.
