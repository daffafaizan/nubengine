      screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and
      the treatment phase, which included 2 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2 and Week 6 (or
      early exit). A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit
      1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were
      randomized to 1 of 4 study drug groups for 6 weeks. Study drug instillation began the morning
      after the second eligibility visit. The study was terminated by the sponsor out of caution
      due to microgel formation in the Brinz/Brim formulation. 13 remaining active subjects were
      discontinued. Further analysis revealed that neither the drop size nor the concentration of
      the active ingredients was affected.
