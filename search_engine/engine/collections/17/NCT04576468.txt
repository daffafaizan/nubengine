    
      A randomized (controlled) clinical trial which included forty sites with intrabony
      interproximal defects (2- or 3-wall) premolar/molar teeth assessed for clinical parameters.
      The four treatment modalities were randomly allocated by a predetermined computer generated
      randomization list (www.randomizer.org) into four equal groups; Group I (control group) open
      flap debridement (OFD): included intrabony defects treated by open flap debridement
      (OFD).Group II perforated membrane (PM): included intrabony defects treated by perforated
      membranes.Group III Leucocyte-platelet rich fibrin (L-PRF): included intrabony defects
      treated by leukocytes platelet rich fibrin (L-PRF). Group IV Leucocyte-platelet rich fibrin +
      perforated membrane (L-PRF + PM): included intrabony defects treated by Leucocyte platelet
      rich fibrin & perforated membranes.
