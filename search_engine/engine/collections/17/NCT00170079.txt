      such as hypertension in both general and preventive medicine is the concept of step care.
      Despite a high degree of interest in applying the step care model to smoking cessation
      (Abrams et al., 1996; Hughes, 1994), little empirical work has been conducted utilizing this
      treatment approach. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of a step
      care model for smoking cessation that is disseminable in primary care settings. With that
      introduction, we propose the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To enroll approximately 400 adult cigarette smokers recruited mainly from primary care
      settings;

      Aim 2: To randomize these participants to: 1) State of the Art Smoking Cessation + Recycling
      or 2) State of the Art Smoking Cessation + Step Care; and

      Aim 3: To evaluate the long-term (24 months post-randomization) relative success of the
      interventions. It is predicted that long-term cessation rates will be significantly higher in
      the step care condition.
