      regimen of 1500 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 600 mg every 12 hours thereafter)
      compared to oral linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours), each administered for 10 days, for Early
      Clinical Response (ECR) in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis set in subjects with acute
      bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Subjects with an ABSSSI caused by
      suspected or documented Gram-positive pathogen(s) at baseline will be randomized 1:1 to study
      treatment
