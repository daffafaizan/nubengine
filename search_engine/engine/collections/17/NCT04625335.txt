    
      Patients participated in two trials of a pain stimulus test that measured pain threshold and
      pain tolerance. One trial was titled "Massage Protocol" and the other, "No-Massage Protocol."
      During the "Massage Protocol," they received a therapeutic massage to the forearm before
      participating in the pain stimulus test. During the "No-Massage Protocol" they did not
      receive a massage before participating in the pain stimulus test. Their pain threshold and
      tolerance for both trials were compared against each other. Each patient was randomized as to
      which protocol they participated in first.
