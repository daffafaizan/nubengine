    
      The Impact of Text Messaging on Medication Adherence and Exercise Regimen among
      Post-Myocardial Infarction Patients includes two single-center randomized control trials to
      assess the impact of text message reminds on adherence to medications and exercise regimen in
      patients recently discharged from the hospital after MI.

      Recruitment conducted at Cambridge Cardiac Rehabilitation in Ontario, Canada for both the
      medication adherence and exercise trial. Potential study subjects are evaluated for inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, give written informed consent, and are randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to
      either intervention or usual care (control).

      Patients randomized to the intervention arm in the medication adherence trial receive an
      automated text message once per day at the time they are prescribed to take their medication.
      The text message does not contain any personal or pharmacological information.

      Patients randomized to the intervention arm in the exercise adherence trial receive four text
      messages per day at 7:30 am, 12:00 pm, 6:00 pm, and 9:00 pm, reminding them to exercise for
      30 minutes per day as per their health care provider.
