      vaporization of the prostate (PVP) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the
      treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement causing bladder
      outlet obstruction. The study requires use of the CE marked GreenLight XPSâ„¢ Laser System
      (GreenLight XPS) or a CE marked monopolar or bipolar loop TURP system for the treatment of
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that PVP is
      not inferior to TURP.
