    
      The study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled Phase IIb trial with
      TMC435 in participants with chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have
      failed standard treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-INF-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV).
      The study will compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of different regimens with
      TMC435 combined with standard treatment (Peg-INF-alfa-2a and RBV) versus standard treatment
      alone. The trial will consist of a screening period of maximum 6 weeks, a 48-week treatment
      period, and a 24-week follow-up period. Participants will be eligible to enroll in the trial
      if they failed to respond to a prior course of standard treatment or relapsed following
      standard treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive TMC435 with standard
      treatment for 12 weeks followed by standard treatment (plus placebo) for 36 weeks, TMC435
      (100 mg or 150 mg once a day) with standard treatment for 24 weeks followed by standard
      treatment (plus placebo) for 24 weeks, TMC435 (100 mg or 150 mg once a day) with standard
      treatment for 48 weeks, or a placebo with standard treatment for 48 weeks.
