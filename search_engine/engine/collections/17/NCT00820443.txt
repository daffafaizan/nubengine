    
      This investigational device study is a non-randomized, non-inferiority, multi-center,
      historically controlled study. The primary objective will be evaluated at the primary
      endpoint (24 months) by the primary efficacy and safety measures that define patient success.
      The proportion of patient success will determine whether the primary objective has been met
      (study success).

      The investigational device will be compared to a historical control comprised of patients
      from the TRANSCENDÂ® Ceramic on Ceramic IDE study. This comparison will be made using all
      primary and secondary measures. However, only primary measures will be used to determine
      study success.
