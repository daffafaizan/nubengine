    
      Fifty patients identified as having poor nutrition by the following criteria:

        1. Average of Serum Albumin for the consecutive two months prior to inclusion </= 3.7 g/dl
           and the serum albumin for the previous month is < 3.7 mg/dl.

        2. one of the four following criteria:

             1. Protein catabolic rate less than 1.0 g/kg/d on at least 2 occasions over the past 6
                months

             2. Progressive unintentional weight loss more than 2.5% of the initial or ideal body
                weight and/or patients who are less than 90% of Standard Body Weight

             3. Subjective Global Assessment Score consistent with Moderate to Severe Malnutrition
                within the last month

             4. Biochemical parameters of malnutrition defined by 1 of 2 of the following
                measurements (if available) over the consecutive two months prior to inclusion:

                  1. Serum transferrin concentration less than 225 mg/dl

                  2. Serum prealbumin concentration less than 32 mg/dl

      will be randomized to receive either ProStat 64 or placebo for 3 months. At Baseline a Dexa
      for lean body mass and labs for BUN, creatinine, glucose, serum albumin, prealbumin and
      C-reactive protein will be drawn. Cholesterol and transferrin will be recorded from the
      regular monthly labs if available. In addition, a protein catabolic rate will be calculated
      and a SGA will be completed.

      Patients will take the supplement/placebo twice a day. Measurements will be repeated at month
      3. At the end of these measurements, all patients will be switched to open label ProStat64
      for an additional 3 months. At month 6 all study procedures/labs are repeated and the study
      is complete.
