      inside a coronary artery. Already pressure measurements have proven their clinical value in
      the form of fractional flow reserve (FFR). However, myocardial function can remain intact
      with sufficient flow, even at a low perfusion pressure. Therefore, combined pressure and flow
      measurements provide a more complete description of physiologic stenosis severity as a guide
      to medical treatment versus revascularization. Based on existing work relating the most
      common flow measurement, coronary flow reserve (CFR), to FFR and linking both variables with
      subsequent prognosis, we hypothesize that lesions with an intact CFR>=2.0 can be reasonably
      treated with medical therapy despite a reduced FFR<=0.8.
