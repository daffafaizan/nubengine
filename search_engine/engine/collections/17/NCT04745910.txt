      I. To collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of a single dose of pegloticase in
      lowering serum uric acid levels to less than 6.0 mg/dl within 24 hours in patients with
      hyperuricemia in the setting of tumor lysis syndrome.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the time to a serum uric acid reduction to < 6.0 mg/dl within 24 hours after
      administration of pegloticase in patients with hyperuricemia in the setting of tumor lysis
      syndrome.

      II. To assess the effect of pegloticase on renal function in patients with hyperuricemia in
      the setting of tumor lysis syndrome as measured by changes in serum creatinine/estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine output.

      III. To estimate the rate of renal replacement therapy initiation for acute kidney injury
      secondary to tumor lysis syndrome among patients treated with pegloticase.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pegloticase intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes. Patients whose serum uric
      acid does not drop below 6 mg/dL within 24 hours receive a second dose of pegloticase IV over
      120 minutes on day 2. Patients whose serum uric acid does not drop below 6 mg/dL after two
      doses of pegloticase receive standard of care rasburicase IV once daily (QD) for 5 days.
