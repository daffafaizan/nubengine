    
      Exploratory, single-arm, ph II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial
      regimen consisting of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among patients with RMG. Primary endpoint of
      study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. Important secondary objective
      is to further assess safety of Etoposide & Bevacizumab for patients with recurrent malignant
      glioma.

      If study demonstrates that combinatorial regimen of Etoposide + Bevacizumab is associated
      with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with RMG, further assessment of regimen
      in additional phase II & possibly phase III studies, will be considered.
