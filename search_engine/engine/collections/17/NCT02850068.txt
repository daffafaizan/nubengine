    
      Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if geniculate artery embolization
      (GAE) will reduce the severity of pain as well as global disability (resulting from the
      combination of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee OA
      and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if GAE can result in the
      decreased necessity for ongoing conservative OA therapies such as medication therapy and
      joint injections.

      Participants: Twenty patients with knee osteoarthritis resulting in knee pain that is
      refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6
      months.

      Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population
      undergoing GAE to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will
      consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject
      meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate
      artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 & 6 months. An MRI will be
      performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to exclude
      complication.
