      patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. Neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity leads to high intravesical pressure and may induce reflux. Decreasing
      intravesical pressure and increasing bladder capacity is necessary to prevent reflux and
      secondary renal failure.
