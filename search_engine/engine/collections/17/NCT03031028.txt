      ketogenic diet (CKD) on an outpatient basis without fasting, caloric and fluid restriction in
      children with and adolescents with intractable epilepsy.

      30 children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy based on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria have been enrolled in the study, Investigators prescribe them classic ketogenic
      diet. Efficacy of the diet will be assessed through seizure rates, number of anti-epileptic
      drug used by the patients, and EEG changes. Seizure frequency will be assessed by seizure
      record diary that is filled out by family of the patients and will be compared with data that
      will be taken at 1, 3 months after start of the diet. EEG will be taken at baseline and 3
      months after start of the diet. Patients will be reviewed at 1, 3 months after start of the
      diet at outpatient clinic. Intolerances and Complications will be documented at each clinic
      visits and via telephone calling during clinic visits intervals to evaluate tolerability and
      safety of the KD. For close monitoring of the complications along with blood tests and
      urinalysis Investigators will do echocardiography and renal ultrasound at baseline and 3
      months after start of the diet. Laboratory values will be assessed at baseline and 3 months
      after start of the diet. Also, nutritional status and growth of children will be assessed at
      baseline and 1, 3 months after start of diet.
