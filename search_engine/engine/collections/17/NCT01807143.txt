      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Samples from the COG Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To use PET sequencing to analyze DNA from ten human primary osteosarcoma samples, along
      with matched normal tissue where available.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are analyzed for translocations and deletions and analyzed using polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
