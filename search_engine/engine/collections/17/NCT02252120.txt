      established reusable latex free, extraglottic airway device. A proximal (pharyngeal) and a
      distal (esophageal) cuff are inflated with a single cuff pilot line. In between lies the
      ventilation orifice. The LMA SupremeTM (Teleflex San Diego, CA, USA) is a single use well
      studied laryngeal mask airway. Both devices have a drain tube to allow access to the
      gastrointestinal tract. Actually there are no studies comparing Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM and
      LMA SupremeTM use in small children. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the
      clinical performance of the Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM compared to the LMA SupremeTM. The
      investigators hypothesized that design differences should lead to differences in efficacy of
      seal and anatomic position. In this randomized, crossover study, the investigators test the
      hypothesis that in non-paralyzed pediatric patients the oropharyngeal leak pressure and
      fiberoptic position differs between the size 2 Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM and the LMA SupremeTM.
