      post-test genetic results disclosure in people with Parkinson's disease. Participants will be
      randomized to receive different methods of genetic counseling using web-based, telephone, or
      telehealth methods. In both pre- and post-test counseling phases, remote genetic counseling
      methods will be compared to demonstrate equivalence. The primary outcomes will be equivalence
      on genetics knowledge and outcomes scales, and the revised impact of events scale. The
      purpose is to develop effective and scalable approaches to genetic counseling. This work is
      crucial for patient safety and will improve access to care through novel genetic counseling
      approaches.
