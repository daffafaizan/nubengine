      laboratory. New media are being introduced to the market. Clinical studies have shown that
      the use of the single-step Global medium for culture of human embryos from the zygote stage
      to the blastocyst stage has resulted in better in-vitro development than a variety of
      sequential media system.

      Global is a FDA approved commercial single-step medium for all embryo culture from Day 0 to
      the blastocyst stage.

      G-TL (Time-Lapse) is a FDA approved commercial single-step medium from Vitrolife. It was
      developed to be used with time-lapse devices as a continuous embryo culture medium from Day 0
      to Day 5/6.

      C3 is Cornell's in house made single-step buffered medium for embryo culture from oocyte
      fertilization to blastocyst stage used as standard of care.

      C1/C2 is Cornell's in house made buffered sequential medium otherwise known as multi step
      medium, use to culture embryos for development. It is formulated to meet the embryos
      requirements at two specific stages of development but require removal of the dish from the
      incubator to physically exchange the culture media surrounding the embryos. This medium will
      be the control.
