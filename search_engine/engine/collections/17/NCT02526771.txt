      malignant, more difficult treatment and worse prognosis compared to hepatocellular carcinoma
      and its incidence continues to rise. The main radical treatment is surgical resection,
      however, postoperative recurrence rate is extremely high. The 3-year recurrence rate is more
      than 50%. It is reported that lymph node metastasis rate of ICC is as high as 20% to 65%,
      which is the most significant factor of the poor prognosis. The probability of lymph node
      metastasis is 13% when lymph nodes metastasis were not found preoperative or intraoperative.
      It is highly controversial whether or not to undergo conventional lymph node dissection when
      lymph nodes metastasis were not found preoperative or intraoperative . A number of
      researchers approved of lymph node dissection at that situation. However, some authors such
      as Kim suggest that lymph node resection is not necessary. Others such as Yang think should
      consider in different condition. Clark CJ thinks that the evidence for dissection or not of
      lymph node is insufficient in view of the above reasons, the investigators have planned to
      implement a randomized controlled study to confirm the prognostic value of conventional or
      unconventional lymph node dissection during resection of Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
