      callers per day if they would be willing to answer a few health questions as part of a new
      2-1-1 service. Callers eligible to receive the invitation to screen for study eligibility
      will be: Missouri residents, calling for themselves, English-speaking, and not in acute
      crisis. Eligible smokers will then be asked if they are willing to share their contact
      information with a research team conducting a study to help smokers quit. Smokers who agree
      to share their contact information will be considered "enrolled". Trained 2-1-1 operators
      will record all recruitment screening data in a secure electronic database that is shared
      with research staff. Research staff will attempt to reach enrolled smokers by phone by the
      next business day.

      Alere, through the Missouri Tobacco Quitline, will provide quitline services to smokers in
      all study conditions. Contact information and study group assignment for smokers will be
      provided to Alere via secure data transfer.
