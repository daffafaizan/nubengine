      prostate cancer. However, the optimal radiation dose and treatment schedule remain unknown.
      The use of hypofractionation has a long and generally successful history in conformal proton
      beam therapy. Several reports detailing the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated conformal
      radiation therapy (with x-rays) of prostate cancer can be found in the literature.
      Hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy has become our institutional routine
      for the treatment of numerous solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine if a
      shortened overall treatment schedule will result in equivalent tumor control rates and no
      increased side effects as compared to our current institutional standard treatment of an
      equivalent dose given over a longer period of time.
