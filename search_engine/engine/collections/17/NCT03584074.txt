    
      The efficacy and safety of the association of celecoxib [a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibitor] and pregabalin (commonly used to control neuropathic pain), compared with
      monotherapy of each, were evaluated for the treatment of chronic low-back pain, a condition
      known to be due to neuropathic as well as nociceptive pain mechanisms.

      We will compare the efficacy of the combination of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib)
      and an antineuropathic drug, pregabalin, versus celecoxib only monotherapy, in the treatment
      of spinal stenosis.

      Each treatment lasted 8 weeks

      Primary outcome is mean pain reduction following different treatments regimes. Secondary
      outcomes are the changes of pain sensitivity, Oswestry disability index, adverse effects due
      to the treatments under study.
