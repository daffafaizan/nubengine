        -  To investigate if some of the differences in gene expression are also reflected at the
           protein level.

        -  To determine whether differences in gene expression that are also reflected at the
           protein level can be used to develop markers for early detection and disease
           surveillance.

        -  To identify targets for therapy.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for expression of standard
      immunohistological markers (e.g., p16, p53, and Ki-67) as well as expression of genes
      identified in a previous gene expression study. Protein expression data are tested for
      clinical and demographic correlates and compared with gene expression data.
