    
      POPULATION:

      Subjects with mixed dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dL and TG ≥ 150 mg/dL and ≤
      500 mg/dL) who completed the double-blind study (LCP-AtorFen-2001; NCT00504829), met the
      enrollment criteria (all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria), and
      elected to enter the open-label extension study.

      STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:

      This is a 52-week, open-label, single-treatment arm with 8 visits (Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36,
      48 and 52). A maximum of approximately 200 subjects will enter this open-label safety and
      efficacy extension study from the LCP AtorFen-2001 double-blind study. All subjects enrolled
      in this study will receive open-label LCP-AtorFen combination therapy. Visit 1 of the
      extension study corresponds to the last visit of the double-blind study (Visit 6 or Week 12).
