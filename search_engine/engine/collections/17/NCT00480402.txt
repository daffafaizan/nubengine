    
      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of natural progesterone supplementation in preventing
      preterm births in twins.

      Study Design: National multicenter randomized double blind controlled clinical trial.

      Setting: Six tertiary hospitals in the east of Spain (communities of Valencia and Murcia):
      Instituto Universitario IVI Valencia, Hospital Universitario La Fe (Valencia), Hospital
      Universitario Dr. Peset (Valencia), Hospital General Universitario (Alicante), Hospital Vega
      Baja de Orihuela (Alicante) y Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca (Murcia).

      Population: 246 bichorionic biamniotic twin pregnant women divided in three groups according
      to the allocated randomized treatment: (I) placebo (N=82); (II) 200 mg progesterone (N=82);
      and (III) 400 mg progesterone (N=82).

      Methods: All participant women will self-administer two vaginal pessaries at bedtime
      containing the allocated treatment. Vaginal pessaries will be identical externally but will
      contain either placebo or 200 mg of natural progesterone (Laboratorios Effik, Madrid, Spain).
      The treatment will be applied from the 20th week until the 34th week (or until delivery if it
      occurred earlier). Control visits will be performed at 24, 28, 32 and 34 weeks. Pregnancies
      will be managed according to each local protocol. An external statistical analysis will be
      performed on intention to treat basis.

      Main outcome measure: Preterm birth rate (<37 weeks). Secondary outcome measures: very
      preterm birth rate (<32 weeks); cervical length measured by vaginal ultrasound at each
      control visit; need for tocolytic treatments; rate of preterm premature rupture of membranes;
      and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

      Estimated period of study: 2006-2008.
