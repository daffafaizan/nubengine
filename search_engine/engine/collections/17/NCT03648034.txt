      the following two groups. After anesthesia induction but before skull-pin insertion, one
      group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.5% ropivacaine, whereas the other group will
      receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.9% saline. The patients' KPS scores at 3d after surgery and
      at discharge, serum levels of TNF-α、IL-6，IL-1β at 24h after surgery, satisfaction score after
      recovery, and VAS scores at 1, 2, 3 days post-surgery will be evaluated and compared between
      the two groups.
