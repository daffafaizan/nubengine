      affecting almost 1% of the world's population. although its overall prevalence is relatively
      low, the refractory nature of venous ulceration increases morbidity, mortality , the
      patient's quality of life, and have a significant financial burden on the global budget. the
      primary risk factors are: old age, obesity deep venous thrombosis, phlebitis and previous leg
      injuries.

      Iliac vein compression is a prevalent finding in patients with venous system pathology. It
      has a variety of causes, including May-Turner syndrome, endometriosis, bladder distension,
      common iliac artery aneurysm or internal iliac artery aneurysm.

      venous compression becomes clinically significant when there's an increase in venous
      pressure, which in turn causes venous insufficiency. This contributes to the development of a
      state of chronic venous stasis, which sequentially causes pooling of blood, triggers further
      capillary damage and activates inflammatory mediators with the end result of venous ulcer
      development and impaired wound healing.

      Located on bony prominences, venous ulcers are typically shallow, irregular with granulation
      tissue and fibrin present in their bases. A careful physical examination is required for a
      proper diagnosis, but he clinical challenge remains in its management, which includes
      prevention or the treatment of the clinical implications.

      Treatment modalities should always be directed to the cause of the ulcer; they can be divided
      into:

        -  non invasive management, such as medical therapy, bandaging and dressings.

        -  invasive, such as endovascular and surgical techniques.
