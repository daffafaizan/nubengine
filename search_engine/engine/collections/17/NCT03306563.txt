      degradation products which are released upon a brain injury and which become detectable in
      the body fluids. Patients with a traumatic brain injury are supposed to express these
      biomarkers in their body fluids while orthopedic trauma patients and healthy controls are
      supposed to be undetectable with respect to these biomolecules. The study is a case-control
      study where the study subjects with a property (injured) are compared to subjects without the
      property (healthy). The brain injury patient group will consist of subjects who entered the
      Emergency Department of the hospital with a suspected TBI. The orthopedic patient group will
      consists of patients who were admitted with a bone fracture in the limbs, but without a
      suspected TBI. The control group will consist of healthy subjects who will be recruited to
      the study by the activities of the study personnel.

      The entire study is split into two successive parts. In the first Part I, 18 - 24 subjects
      will be recruited in each group. In the second part, the number of the patients with
      suspected TBI will be added to up to 100 in order to receive an adequate number of samples
      and to gain sufficient statistical significance between the brain injury severities and in
      successive sampling time points.

      The collected samples and relevant clinical data of each subject will be supplied to the
      sponsor who will perform to the samples 1) Biochemical analysis for the presence and level of
      the biomarker, and 2) Biomarker profiling and structure analysis by LC/MS.
