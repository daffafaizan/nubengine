    
      Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that afflicts approximately 1% of the population
      (1). Often these patients have comorbid cocaine and amphetamine dependence, which increases
      the severity of psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia, decreases treatment
      compliance and worsens prognosis.

      The treatment of schizophrenia with comorbid cocaine and/or amphetamine dependence is complex
      and involves adherence to psychiatric medications, most often antipsychotic agents, along
      with participation in specific substance abuse treatment such as structured living,
      attendance at self-help group meetings, individual and group therapy and a commitment to
      sobriety. In the absence of specific pharmacotherapy of cocaine and amphetamine dependence,
      various antipsychotic medications have been compared to see if they impact comorbid cocaine
      and amphetamine abuse in addition to their antipsychotic effects.

      The primary objective of this study is to test whether Seroquel as a mono-therapy decreases
      cocaine and/or methamphetamine use in patients with schizophrenia as compared to risperidone.
