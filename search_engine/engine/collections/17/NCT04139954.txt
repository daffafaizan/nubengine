    
      In this study, investigators aimed to observe the examination findings, laboratory findings
      and drugs used in routine polyclinic controls of the participants using biological and
      targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and the doses and side
      effects of these drugs. The aim of this registry is to evaluate the real-life data of
      participants receiving these medications. Analysis of treatment follow-up, drug changes,
      causes of change, treatment-related paradoxic / immune reactions, compliance with adult
      vaccination programs, nutritional profiles, presence of metabolic syndrome, fertility status,
      pregnancy outcomes, and vitamin D levels will be recorded in the outpatient clinic.
      Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID and PSAID
      indexes), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), drug compliance,
      central sensitization and fall risk will be evaluated with verbal evaluation forms performed
      at policlinic controls in patients with spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is
      planned to conduct scientific analyzes and publish on various subjects from the recorded
      information on this registration system.

      Patients using biological and targeted synthetic DMARD treatments are closely monitored and
      evaluated in many ways due to the risk profiles and various characteristics of the drugs.
      With this registry system, it is aimed to evaluate the real-life data of the participants
      using these drugs. Real-life data are very valuable in monitoring the disease and the drugs.
