      primary care provider payment model to better incentive population health while bending the
      increasing trend of health spending in the state. Primary care and overall spending patterns
      will be studied to lay the foundation for a more rationally designed model. This model
      deliberately shifts away from FFS and includes three components: 1) a risk-adjusted
      per-member, per-month (PMPM) base payment, 2) an enhanced quality incentive program with
      larger bonus amounts and 3) a total cost of care incentive at the PO level. The aim is to
      build on the success of the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) program implemented by Blue
      Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Massachusetts. While the AQC is used as a starting point, the
      study introduces and tests a number of innovations using concepts from behavioral economics.
      First, the move away from the FFS chassis to a PMPM-based capitated payment. Second, 20% of
      the PMPM payment is at-risk based on metrics designed to increase engagement between HMSA and
      physicians and engagement with performance feedback. Third, the number of metrics in the
      quality incentive program is drastically reduced from over 60 metrics to 10-12 per specialty.
      Fourth, the scoring of quality incentives incorporates rewards for improvement, rather than
      exclusively attainment of thresholds, to activate physicians along the entire performance
      distribution. In addition to implementing the new payment model, the initial experiment will
      include a test of two additional behavioral concepts: social comparisons for physicians and a
      shared incentive for physicians and poorly controlled diabetics tied to improve glycemic
      control.
