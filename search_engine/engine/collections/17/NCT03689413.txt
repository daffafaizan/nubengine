      technique has been developed, and many clinicians use the technique for saving the concerned
      nerves. Many studies showed that the effect of sugammadex on reverse of neuromuscular
      blocking after tracheal intubation. However, optimal dosage was not founded for sugammadex.

      This randomized controlled trial is to compare 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg as dosage of sugammadex
      for optimal continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring in thyroid surgery to prevent vocal
      cord paralysis.
