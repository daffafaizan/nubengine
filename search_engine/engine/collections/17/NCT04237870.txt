      treatment for executive function deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder
      between 6 and 16 years of age. The study duration is approximately 1 months, with the cTBS
      sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5 times a week, for about 20min each. Several scales will be
      used to assess for symptom severity and adaptive functioning. The executive function will be
      evaluated by Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) questionnaire.
      Cognition will be assessed using functional near - infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).

      This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks daily cTBS to better understand the effects of
      cTBS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of
      different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow.
