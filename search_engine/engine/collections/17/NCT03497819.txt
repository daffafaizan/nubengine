      combination CARTmeso cells and CART19 cells in patients with pancreatic cancer following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide. Both cells contain CAR proteins consisting of a
      murine-derived single chain antibody fragment (scFv), cluster of differentiation antigen 137
      (41BB) co-stimulatory domain and cluster of differentiation antigen 3 zeta chain (CD3Î¶)
      signaling domain transduced by lentivirus
