      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor device and smartphone application in perioperative pain
      management. Patients undergoing major abdominal surgical procedures will be recruited to wear
      a ECG monitor device from the day before surgery until 1-3days after surgery. Patients will
      report their condition of pain twice daily on the corresponding smartphone application based
      on a structured and visualized pain report module. Patients will receive a telephone
      follow-up 30/60/90/365 days after surgery for assessment of postoperative chronic pain. A
      pilot study will be conducted to evaluate acceptability, safety and feasibility of the device
      and application using system usability scale and comprehensive product quality assessment.
      Further study will be conducted to evaluate the relationship between postoperative acute and
      chronic pain and heart rate variability (HRV) acquired from ECG device.
