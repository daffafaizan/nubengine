      study, a venous blood sample will be obtained from these subjects and from a group of normal
      weight volunteers. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the blood samples and analysed by
      standard molecular biology techniques.The allelic and genotype frequencies of the two ICAM-1
      variants will be calculated in the obese and control groups. The statistical significance of
      possible differences will be determined
