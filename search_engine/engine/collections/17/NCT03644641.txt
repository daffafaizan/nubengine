      addition to surgical factors, patients with glaucoma, uncontrolled hypertension,
      arthrosclerosis, and morbid obesity are at risk for potentially damaging optic nerve and loss
      of optic nerve function. Some studies found that intraocular pressure values were
      significantly lower in patients undergoing propofol total intravenous anesthesia than in
      patients undergoing desflurane anesthesia during intraoperative positional changes.
      Pronounced vasodilatation caused by desflurane might produced hyperaemia with higher
      intraocular pressure. Hemodynamic response to prone position measured by near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) on the prefrontal cortex could determine changes caused by prone
      position.
