      Hydrochlorothiazide 5/12.5 mg or Amlodipine plus Perindopril 5/4 mg or
      Perindopril/Hydrochlorothiazide 4/12.5 mg. These doses will increase at the two months visit,
      to Amlodipine/Hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg or AmlodipinePperindopril 10/8mg or
      Perindopril/Hydrochlorothiazide 8/25 mg.
