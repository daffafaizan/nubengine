      longer required. The literature reports two methods of extubation: the named traditional
      method (with suction and without positive pressure in the airways) and the positive pressure
      method. Laboratory studies suggest extubation at positive pressure because it reduces the
      volume of secretions filtered into the distal airway. Prior to apply it into clinical
      practice the investigators of this study consider is a priority to guarantee the safety of
      the positive pressure extubation method in terms of presence of complications.

      The aim of this non-inferiority study is to compare the incidence of complications between
      both extubation techniques in adult patients with invasive mechanical ventilation.

      The hypothesis of this study is that applying positive pressure during cuff deflation and
      extubation is not inferior to the traditional method in the incidence of complications.
