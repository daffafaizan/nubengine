      involved in the screening of these troubles and 2) when it is not.

      All the patients (75 and older) hospitalised in the internal medicine department of a
      suburban Parisian hospital are included in the study and their psycho-cognitive functions
      assessed by a geriatrics physician, using 3 validated tests.

      The result of this screening provides the rate of psycho-cognitive troubles among patients
      that would not have been tested by a geriatrics physician in usual care. It assesses the
      interest of a systematic evaluation of elderly patients by the geriatric mobile unit.
