    
      Eligible patients will undergo an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair augmented by mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs). The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of autologous mesenchymal stem cells treatment applied during arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair.

      The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, adverse
      events (AEs) will be elicited using a standard non-leading questions. In addition, any signs
      or symptoms will be observed. All AEs will be collected as:

        -  patient's positive response to questions about their health

        -  symptoms spontaneously reported by the patient

        -  clinically relevant changes and abnormalities observed by the Investigator (e.g. local
           and systemic tolerability, clinically significant laboratory measurements confirmed by
           repeated measurement, results of physical examinations).

      Clinical improvement will be measured by clinical outcome scores (Constant shoulder score and
      UCLA Shoulder rating scale) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after the surgery. MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) findings made preoperatively and at 12 months (1 year) after operation
      will be evaluated.

      During the indication visit, patient's history will be taken and preoperative MRI evaluated.
      Written consent form will be collected from the patient after detailed education of the
      patient by the investigator.
