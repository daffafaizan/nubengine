      arresting malignant transformation. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used
      in treating CAG and preventing GC in China. To date, few study has been conducted to assess
      the syndrome features of different stages of CAG malignant transformation combining TCM
      indicators.

      The present study aims to explore TCM syndrome features in different stages of CAG malignant
      transformation. The proposed study is a registry study based participant survey conducted in
      4 hospitals in Beijing, China. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 2000 eligible
      study patients will berecruited on-site in hospitals.

      Comparative analysis of prevalence of presenting TCM features is conducted using frequency
      analysis and chi-squared tests, and expressed with composition ratios. Exploratory factor
      analysis,correspondence analysis, association rule analysis, hierarchical clustering
      analysis, and complex system entropy clustering analysis will be performed respectively for
      validating features of syndrome in different stages of CAG malignant transformation.

      Previous reports on TCM syndrome features for CAG exist, but no studies have been undertaken
      base on large-sampled study design and detailed analysis in different stages of CAG malignant
      transformation respectively.

      The outcome of our study has the potential to clerify core TCM pathogenesis of CAG,
      facilitate early intervention, and promote optimization of treatment strategies of CAG
      malignant transformation by TCM.
