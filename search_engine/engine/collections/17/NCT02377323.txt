    
      With this study the investigator plans to evaluate the impact of Rebif on the Real-Life
      Outcomes (RLO) of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients followed at the Clinic within the last two
      years, and with a follow-up of up to 18 years.

      The investigator will evaluate the employment outcomes with a questionnaire designed to
      document eventual changes in the employment status and other variables in the work conditions
      of the study participants.

      Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of life (QoL),eligible patients will be asked to
      complete the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54 Instrument, contains 52 items
      distributed into 12 scales, and two single items. This MS-specific QoL assessment tool uses
      the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) as its generic core measure and includes 18 additional
      items under the following categories: health distress, sexual function, satisfaction with
      sexual function (one item), overall quality of life, cognitive function, energy, pain, and
      social function.

      A sub-group of patients will be selected to come to the clinic to undergo the cognitive
      portion of the study, using the well-known and validated battery of tests named Minimal
      Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS battery).

      Socio-demographic data on education level, marital and family life will also be collected.
      All questionnaires (including the MSQoL-54) will be available by means of an online survey.
