      ventilatory demand (largely dictated by chemical stimuli) and the capacity to respond to that
      demand (dictated by mechanical/muscular factors). Our preliminary studies have indicated that
      treatment with opioids in COPD patients can improve activity related dyspnea by reducing
      central respiratory neural drive and breathing frequency without a significant change in the
      respiratory mechanics. By contrast, a reduction in exertional dyspnea following inhaled
      bronchodilators in COPD was mainly related to an improved respiratory mechanics with
      increased inspiratory capacity, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume etcetera. By
      comparing the physiological mechanisms of dyspnea relief during the opiate and bronchodilator
      therapy, we hope to gain new insights into the mechanisms of dyspnea in COPD by selectively
      manipulating inspiratory neural drive (nebulized opiates) and abnormal respiratory mechanics
      (nebulized bronchodilators) within the same individuals. As such, the primary objective of
      this study is to compare the effects of inhaled opiate with oxygen versus bronchodilator
      treatments on the intensity of dyspnea, electromyographic estimates of inspiratory neural
      drive and respiratory mechanics and their interactions during a standardized exercise test
      using a randomized, controlled, crossover design in patients with COPD.
