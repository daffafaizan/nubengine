      type dementia. Studies in animal models of this disorder as well as in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that drugs capable of activating central cholinergic
      transmission can improve cognitive function. Nevertheless, no currently available drug of
      this or any other type consistently confers clinically significant benefit. To further
      evaluate the cholinergic hypothesis for symptom palliation with a mechanistically novel
      pharmacologic tool, the acute safety and antidementia efficacy of nefiracetam will be studied
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design. In contrast to the
      currently available cholinesterase inhibitors, nefiracetam enhances the activity of nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors by interacting with a protein kinase C pathway and accelerates
      acetylcholine turnover and release. Efficacy in patients with mild to moderate dementia will
      be assessed through application of standardized neuropsychological test instruments in this
      first double-blind, randomized controlled trial of nefiracetam in AD. Safety will be
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
