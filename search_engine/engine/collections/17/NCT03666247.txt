      platform as a public health strategy for improving participants' self-reported sexual health
      and prevention behaviors, beliefs and attitudes. The study will enroll 1,206 men into a
      randomized controlled trial. They will be assigned to either the immediate intervention group
      ("intervention arm") or the waitlist-control group ("waitlist-control arm"). All participants
      will take an assessment survey at baseline, and the intervention group will be oriented on
      the installation and use of the messaging app upon randomization to that group. All men in
      the randomized controlled trial will complete short follow-up surveys at 3-month intervals
      during the 9-month follow-up period. When the intervention arm activities and assessments
      have concluded, participants in the waitlist-control arm will then be given the option of
      accessing to the intervention app and participation in intervention post-test activities.
