      during 2019 were enrolled. The participants were randomly allocated into three parallel
      groups: interactive multimedia (n=55), illustrated booklet (n= 55), and the control (n= 43).
      The study samples were blinded to intervention and control groups. A researcher-made
      questionnaire was completed by the eligible subjects before, after, and four weeks after the
      intervention to assess their knowledge, attitude and behavior in preventing chronic lower
      back pain amongst working nurses.
