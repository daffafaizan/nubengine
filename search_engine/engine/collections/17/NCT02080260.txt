    
      This is a single arm, single stage Phase II study designed to evaluate progression free
      survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed at least one
      prior line of therapy and treatment with gemcitabine. This study is open at the Levine Cancer
      Institute (LCI). A total of 32 patients will be enrolled over a two years. Following informed
      consent and eligibility check, all patients will start oral regorafenib therapy (120 mg daily
      for 3 weeks on / 1 week off; 28 day cycle) with a built-in dose escalation to 160mg after the
      first cycle as tolerated, and will continue therapy until progression or patient withdrawal.
      Patients will undergo radiological staging after the first two cycles of regorafenib therapy.
      Patients with progressive disease will be removed from the study. Patients who have at least
      stable disease will continue regorafenib therapy, at the Investigator's discretion, and will
      be radiologically restaged bimonthly.
