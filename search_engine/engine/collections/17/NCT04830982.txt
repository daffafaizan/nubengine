    
      This is a randomized blinded Phase I clinical trial. Thirty patients total will be randomized
      on a 2:1 basis to treatment (IV Diazoxide added to cardioplegia) vs control (cardioplegia
      alone). Diazoxide will be added to the first dose of cardioplegia only. Subsequent doses of
      cardioplegia will not contain additives.
