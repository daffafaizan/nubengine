      compared with 30 patients in dialysis, who are not treated with glucocorticoids. Adrenal
      function is evaluated using a 250µg Synacthen® test, performed fasting, in the morning, 48 h
      after the last prednisolone dose.

      Cut-off for normal adrenal function is locally validated assay specific cut-off of 30 min
      P-cortisol >420 nmol/l. The primary outcome measure of this study is P-cortisol
      concentrations 30 minutes after Synacthen® injection in prednisolone treated patients
      compared with comtrols. Secondary, 30 minutes P-cortisol is examined in relation to
      glucocorticoid receptor haplotypes.

      The genotyping is determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      The questionnaires used in this study includes EQ-5D, SF-36, Patient Life Situation Form,
      CushingQol and ADDOQol.
