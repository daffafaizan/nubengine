      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved BVD-523 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      BVD-523 has been tested in patients with solid tumors to determine the highest dose of
      BVD-523 that can be safely given to patients.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the role of BVD-523 in the treatment
      of patients with uveal melanoma. Genetic changes within metastatic uveal melanoma activate
      proteins in the MAPK protein signaling pathway which leads to tumor growth. In the laboratory
      BVD-523 works against one of these proteins called ERK to decrease tumor growth. In this
      study, the investigators are testing BVD-523 to see if it works to treat metastatic uveal
      melanoma.
