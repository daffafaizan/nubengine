    
      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study. Subjects referred for a screening,
      surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled. This study aims to
      compare the number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC) between an Endocuff colonoscopy
      and an AmplifEYE colonoscopy.

      It is estimated that the Endocuff Vision will result in an APC of 2.3. The investigators
      consider that a clinically acceptable ADR for the Medivators device would be within 20% of
      this value or 1.5.
