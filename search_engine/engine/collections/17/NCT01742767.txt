      pemetrexed with high efficacy, excellent treatment compliance, administration convenience and
      the possibility to open up easier outpatient administration of the chemotherapy protocol.
      Dosing of cisplatinum at 40 mg/m2 d 1 and day 8 seems to be very effective and useful for
      this strategy. The current trial will address this issue within a prospective randomized
      phase-II trial. Treatment will be given on day 1 and 8 in the split-dose arm. A comparator
      arm of the current three-weekly higher cisplatinum schedule will be added to this study. For
      evaluation of this strategy observation of the toxicity/efficacy ratio within this trial will
      be of major importance. Efficacy will be analyzed by objective response rate, symptom control
      and life-quality. Toxicity will be looked at with treatment toxicity, treatment compliance
      and adherence to protocol.
