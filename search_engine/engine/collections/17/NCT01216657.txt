    
      This is a single agent 2-step phase 2 study with a one-year follow-up to evaluate the
      antitumor activity of Sunitinib administered in treatment cycles of 6 weeks duration (4 weeks
      treatment and 2 weeks rest) in patients with chemo-refractory melanoma. If the first step
      shows sufficient efficacy and tolerability the study will continue to step 2. Treatment will
      continue for 9 months or until disease progression or until intolerable adverse events occur.
      Subsequently the patients will be followed up for 1 year. Tumor assessment will be performed
      at baseline, at the end of cycle 1,2,3 and subsequently at the end of every uneven cycle
      (5,7,9,â€¦).

      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this trial.
