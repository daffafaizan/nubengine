      patients from 5 medical centers in China. All the participants are randomly divided into two
      groups to orally intake either probiotic supplements (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 4 weeks
      in addition with high dose dexamethasone(40 mg/d for 4 days). Platelet count, bleeding and
      other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study.
