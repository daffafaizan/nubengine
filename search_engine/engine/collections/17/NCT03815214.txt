    
      The TOPS trial is designed as a PROBE study to test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of
      a 12-week high protein, calorie restricted, partial meal replacement program, compared to
      enhanced standard care, in achieving clinically significant weight loss without impairment of
      motor recovery when initiated within 30 days following ischemic stroke in patients with BMI
      27-to-49.9 kg/m2 and an upper-extremity motor deficit.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1-1 ratio to the partial meal replacement program (diet
      intervention) or enhanced standard care (control) with randomization stratified by
      recruitment center (BIDMC, Yale) and baseline diet consistency status (Modified Consistency
      Diet vs Regular Consistency Diet). Baseline diet consistency status was selected as a
      stratification factor because it is expected that patients with difficulty swallowing
      (dysphagia) after stroke that results in need for modifications to food/liquids will have a
      different weight loss trajectory than patients who are able to safely consume a regular
      diet.The follow-up duration will be 12 weeks for all subjects.
