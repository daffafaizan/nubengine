      strategies for human motion.Volunteers will serve as subjects after they complete a
      neuromusculoskeletal screening exam. Subjects will be asked to perform one or more tasks
      related to the execution of activities of daily living such as: walking on the ground,
      walking on a treadmill, quiet and perturbed standing, stair ascent and descent, turning and
      jumping, cycling, elliptical training, and isolated upper and lower extremity limb movements
      or trunk movements. The subjects movement patterns will be recorded using a three-dimensional
      motion tracking system. Motion data will be analyzed using a rigid body six degree-of-freedom
      approach when applicable. Temporal/spatial, kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyographic
      variables will be collected and calculated. When only temporal-spatial parameters are of
      interest, an instrumented portable walkway system may be used.

      Many factors affect the ability to move. The ones we are mainly interested in investigating
      include muscle weakness, spasticity, and dynamic balance. To quantify strength or spasticity,
      a force transducer is needed such as a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer which is a standard
      rehabilitation assessment and training device, or a more simple handheld dynamometer can be
      used that the person presses against as force is recorded. For the spasticity tests, a person
      or a machine such as the Biodex moves a joint through an arc of motion (e.g. elbow, knee, or
      ankle) at a range of speeds from 5-240 degrees per second while resistance to motion is being
      recorded or graded subjectively. EMG and joint position may be collected simultaneously
      during the passive movements. The dynamic balance tests will be performed on a force plate or
      using a clinical balance testing device, the Equitest, by Neurcom. To determine if electrical
      stimulation (ES) improves limb movement, walking, and balance, a device such as the WalkAide
      may be used in patients who have some dysfunction in their lower extremities. Only persons
      with central nervous system injuries who have a foot drop gait pattern will be given the
      opportunity to use this device for 3-6 months. The WalkAide is worn below the knee and
      delivers individually programmed ES to aid in muscle function of the ankle.

      Patient groups will be identified clinically or statistically. Group means and standard
      deviations will then be computed. It is hoped the database developed may serve as a tool by
      which individual patient data may be compared in order to facilitate the diagnosis and
      optimize the treatment and clinical outcome of patients with movement related problems.

      An over ground harness system may be used for some of the over ground or instrumented gait
      and balance assessments if there is concern that the patient is too weak or unbalanced and
      therefore may trip or fall during the activity, or to help facilitate more normal patterns by
      decreasing the load borne by the trunk and/or legs.
