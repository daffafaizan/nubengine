    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which
      utilizes SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the dynamic
      changes in the viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot lysis.
      Viscoelastic testing performed using existing technologies is typically performed on arterial
      samples obtained from patients undergoing surgical procedures, although reference ranges for
      these tests have been established for venous blood only.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate potential differences between Quantra measurements
      determined in arterial versus venous blood samples obtained from patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.
