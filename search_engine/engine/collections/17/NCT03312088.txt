    
      The clinical investigation is designed to be prospective to ensure that the population is
      representative of the type of population for which the Freedom Total KneeÂ® System with the
      revision components is intended to treat. Subjects with a primary diagnosis of end-stage
      symptomatic revision knee who require a uni-lateral knee prosthesis and have been evaluated
      as appropriate candidates for a revision total knee arthroplasty, by the Investigator, will
      be invited to take part in this clinical investigation. Patients will be drawn from hospital
      clinics focusing on this type of treatment.

      The treatment period of 36 months is considered sufficient to monitor the safety and clinical
      performance of the device. However, the patients will be contacted annually for 10 years or
      as long as the patient is willing to monitor their long-term progress.

      An interim report will be issued when at least 120 patients will complete the 12-month
      follow-up.

      No treatments will be withheld as part of this clinical investigation although any other
      treatments that need to be administered during the clinical investigation will be recorded.
