      thrombus in patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for quantitative elastography
      performed at D0, D7, D30.

      The ability to analyze the structural properties of the thrombus should allow us to then
      correlate these properties to the evolving nature of the thrombus (embolic migration or not,
      recanalization or not), and the effect of different treatment on the evolution of the
      thrombus
