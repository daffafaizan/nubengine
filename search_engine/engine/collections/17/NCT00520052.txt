      However they are associated with accelerated bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures. Previous
      studied looking at the use of zoledronic acid have predominantly studied men with a normal or
      osteopenic bone mineral density. However, it has been shown that upto 40% of men presenting
      with prostate cancer have osteoporosis and it is these who are at most risk of osteoporotic
      fractures. Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of zoledronic acid in 2 groups of
      osteoporotic patients, those undergoing treatment with LHRH agonists and with
      antiandrogens.Peripheral and axial bone densitometry will be used to measure percentage
      changes in bone mineral density over 3 years. The first year with the patients on LHRH or
      antiandrogen, the second year continuing with their androgen deprivation therapy and
      zoledronic acid. Then bone mineral density will be measured one year following the last
      infusion of zoledronic acid to ascertain the optimum frequency of administration.

      The study will also involve monitoring serum and urine bone turnover markers.
