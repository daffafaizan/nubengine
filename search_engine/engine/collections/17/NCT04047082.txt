    
      OVAL (Online Videodensitometric Assessment of Aortic Regurgitation in the Cath-Lab) is a
      single centre, prospective, proof-of-principle, feasibility study performed in the Academic
      Medical Centre (Amsterdam). One hundred consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and
      indication to undergo TAVR by the Institution's Heart team are being enrolled in OVAL. All
      final aortograms will be performed according to predetermined acquisition protocol and
      analysed immediately after the acquisition in the cath-lab. All aortograms will also be
      analysed off-line by an independent core laboratory in the Netherlands (Cardialysis,
      Rotterdam, The Netherlands).

      The primary endpoint of the study is the feasibility of the on-line assessment of
      regurgitation (percentage of analysable cases). The secondary endpoint is the reproducibility
      of results between the on-line assessment and the off-line analysis by the independent core
      laboratory.
