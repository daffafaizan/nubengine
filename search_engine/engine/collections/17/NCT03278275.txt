    
      68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR),
      which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. A total of 120 NET patients
      will be subjected to a uPAR-PET/CT scan. Follow-up will be performed (from the time of the
      angiogenesis PET/ CT) at 6 months for disease specific survival (DSS) and a 1 year follow-up
      for PFS and OS. The uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in tumor lesions will be quantified as
      Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean) and compared with PFS, DSS and OS (dichotomized
      above/below median SUVmax and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier)
