      toxicity is unpredictable in the individual patient. Paclitaxel is removed (eliminated) from
      the organism by oxidation. CYP2C8 is the enzyme mainly responsible. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is
      an efflux transport protein natural to the human organism. Pgp is responsible for excretion
      of drugs via the bile and the kidneys and is thought to play a role in chemotherapy
      resistance. Paclitaxel is substrate for Pgp. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are possible
      causes for variation in both CYP2C8 and Pgp expression/function. We will study a possible
      role of these genetic variations as predictors of paclitaxel toxicity and effect and the
      possible implications for individual dosing in the future.

      We want to determine the metabolic capacity of approximately 100 ovarian cancer patients and
      comparing this with genotypes, acute toxicity(eg. bone marrow suppression and neuropathy) and
      response to treatment(ie. CA125 response, progression free survival and overall survival).
      The metabolic capacity is estimated using a "sparse sampling" approach applying advanced
      computerized pharmacokinetic/dynamic modelling as opposed to traditional "frequent sampling"
      pharmacokinetic studies which burden the individual patient more.

      Patients are recruited in collaboration with Oncological departments throughout Scandinavia.
