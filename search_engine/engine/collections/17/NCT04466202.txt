      anxiety during TRUS prostate biopsy, only one study has been found examining the effect of
      stress management (music and one-to-one simulation training) on patients' pain and anxiety
      levels. In addition, there is only one study on the effectiveness of the training method
      (written and video-based training) on anxiety levels of patients related to prostate biopsy.
      For this reason, it is thought that music will be more effective on pain and anxiety levels
      along with structured verbal training to alleviate the discomfort associated with patients'
      biopsy procedure.
