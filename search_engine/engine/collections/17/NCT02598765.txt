    
      This study is a randomized, double-masked (study participants and outcome assessors) trial.
      During the enrollment period, consecutive patients from LEI who are planning to have
      trabeculectomy surgery and who meet the study enrollment criteria will be randomized to
      receive standard trabeculectomy or microtrabeculectomy. The primary outcome is complications
      and change in intraocular pressure after a 3 month follow-up period. We will perform subgroup
      analyses by stratifying the population according to skin pigmentation to determine whether
      pigmentation is a predictor of treatment success.
