      according to standard of care at each center. Subjects will be approached for participation
      in this study after they have made the decision to undergo a primary or revision shoulder
      arthroplasty procedure. The treating surgeon will obtain verbal consent from the patient for
      a research coordinator to screen for eligibility. Patients who meet all criteria will be
      offered enrollment into the study. The total enrollment goal is a minimum of 500 anatomic
      shoulder arthroplasty and 500 reverse shoulder arthroplasty subjects enrolled in the
      multi-center registry.
