      diagnostic testing methodology, and methods of therapy for arrhythmias in individuals with
      myotonic muscular dystrophy. The goal is a more adequate definition of appropriate diagnosis
      and therapy for arrhythmias in order to decrease the likelihood of cardiac morbidity and
      mortality in this disorder.

      The specific aims of the study involve an initial survey of individuals with myotonic
      muscular dystrophy detailing multiple factors. Non-invasive electrocardiographic testing will
      be done. Using this initial data and subsequent follow-up data collected yearly the cohort of
      patients will be followed as to arrhythmia development over a minimum of five years and
      likely longer with a long-term registry and evaluation of National Death Records and
      Ancestry.com. This project is unique in that it characterizes a non-neurologic abnormality
      associated with a neuromuscular disease, myotonic muscular dystrophy.
