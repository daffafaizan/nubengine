      of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome - a t(9:22) translocation that results in the production
      of a BCR/ABL fusion protein with Abl kinase activity.

      Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) specifically targets a limited set of protein tyrosine kinases -
      ABL, Arg (Abl-related gene), c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) - and
      their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR/ABL Imatinib is also a potent inhibitor of a
      receptor-type c-Kit tyrosine kinase. Therefore imatinib was examined for therapeutic efficacy
      against malignant gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) Recent articles have drawn
      attention to the development of new Ph-negative, cytogenetically unrelated clones after
      therapy of Ph-positive CML with imatinib. Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are the most frequent
      defects, but other aberrations have also been reported. Some of these cytogenetic
      abnormalities are associated with acute myeloid leukemia and MDS.
