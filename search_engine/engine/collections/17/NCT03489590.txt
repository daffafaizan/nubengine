      perfluorinated gases (19F) mixed with oxygen to detect changes in ventilation using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). A secondary goal is to assess the repeatability and the
      within-subject variability of these findings in CF lung disease. This is an open label pilot
      study expanding on work by other investigators currently using this technique in human
      subjects. Projection images using controlled breathing techniques will be obtained using 19F
      MRI, correlating spirometric variables with regional distribution of the gases.
