      conducted at multiple sites. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine to be
      used in this study includes a mix of recombinant H1, H3, and two B hemagglutinin proteins
      expressed as VLPs for the 2017-2018 influenza virus strains.

      Approximately 10,000 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 64 years will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio into one of two parallel treatment groups, such that approximately 5,000
      subjects will receive the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine at a dose of 30 Î¼g/strain and
      approximately 5,000 subjects will receive the placebo. Within the two treatment groups,
      subjects will be stratified by site and two age groups (18-49 years of age and 50-64 years of
      age in a 1:1 ratio).

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately eight to ten months, during which a
      first visit will be scheduled on Day 0 for screening and vaccine administration.
