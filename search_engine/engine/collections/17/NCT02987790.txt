    
      All adult patients (aged> 17 years), hospitalized at the ICU (total of 50 beds) of the
      Hospital das Cl√≠nicas - UFMG, with an assumed or proven infection, will be considered for
      inclusion. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be allocated randomly
      into one of the following groups: 1) PCR group: antibiotic therapy will be discontinued
      according to serum CRP levels; 2) "Best Practice" group, length of antibiotic therapy based
      on the most recent guidelines in the medical literature, according to the focus and / or
      causative micro-organism. PCR assays shall be performed daily on serum obtained from blood
      collected for routine intensive care examinations up to 2 days after antibiotic withdrawal.
      In the PCR group, antibiotic suspension will be encouraged when levels of this marker are
      <35mg / L (if peak PCR below 100mg / L); or reduce 50% of the highest value (if PCR peak >
      100mg / L), with a limit of seven days, if there is clinical improvement. Primary outcomes
      will be duration of antibiotic therapy and antibiotic-free live days corrected for 1000 days
      of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes will be costs, clinical cure rate, therapeutic
      failure, 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay,
      nosocomial infection rate, recurrence of infection, and isolation of multidrug-resistant
      bacteria
