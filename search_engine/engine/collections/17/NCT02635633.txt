           This is an open label prospective pilot trial of continuous thetaburst stimulation
           (cTBS) in patients with unifocal neocortical epilepsy.

           The study comprises a 13-week period, consisting of 4 weeks baseline seizure frequency
           assessment, a one-week treatment period with baseline assessments on Monday (T0) and
           stimulation sessions from Tuesday to Friday (T1-T4), and an 8-week follow-up period with
           short-term assessments immediately after the final stimulation session on Friday
           afternoon (T4) and long-term assessments after 2 weeks (FU2) and 8 weeks (FU8).

        2. Objectives:

           The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of cTBS in
           refractory epilepsy patients. The secondary objectives are to assess the clinical
           efficacy and associated mechanism of action of cTBS in unifocal neocortical epilepsy.

        3. Rationale:

      An open label prospective design allows to make a first estimate on the safety, feasibility
      and tolerability of cTBS in refractory epilepsy patients. There are currently no reports
      available of cTBS performed in epilepsy patients. The ultimate aim is to assess clinical
      efficacy of cTBS with regard to seizure frequency, but a feasibility and safety study is a
      prerequisite in order to achieve this goal.
