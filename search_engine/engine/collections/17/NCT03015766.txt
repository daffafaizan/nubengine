      hemodialysis (MHD) patients and impairs their quality of life and long term outcome. Hypnotic
      sedative agents are often reluctantly prescribed with doses mounting up. Patients are
      concerned about drug dependence and drug-related adverse effects. As a non-drug therapy,
      auricular acupressure therapy (AAT) is attractive to both patients and practitioners and is
      widely used to treat many conditions in China. The investigators had been applying AAT for
      MHD patients with insomnia in recent years and yielded favorable results. However, the effect
      and safety of AAT for insomnia in MHD population still lacks high quality evidence.
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to perform a randomized controlled clinical trial in MHD
      patients with insomnia to evaluate the effect and safety of AAT.
