      uncontrolled clinical trial in NASH patients show promising results, with improvement of
      liver enzymes in treated patients.

      RESEARCH GOALS:

      A. To assess the degree of SIBO in NAFLD patients vs. healthy controls. B. To evaluate the
      effect of probiotics vs. placebo on SIBO in NAFLD patients. C. To evaluate the effect of
      probiotics vs. placebo on disease severity (inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis) in NAFLD
      patients.
