      HCl or placebo in three successive dose escalating cohorts of 8 subjects each (2 placebo and
      6 active drug per dose level). Subjects will receive multiple oral CT-044 HCl doses for 7
      days. Subjects will be monitored in-house for vital signs, physical examination,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), safety laboratory testing and documentation of adverse signs and
      symptoms. Serial blood and urine samples will be collected to evaluate CT-044 HCl levels in
      plasma and urine.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit on the day prior to dosing (Day
      -1) and remain in house until Day 9 (discharge day). Subjects will return to the Clinical
      Trial Unit on an outpatient basis for follow-up (Day 13, Â± 1 day).
