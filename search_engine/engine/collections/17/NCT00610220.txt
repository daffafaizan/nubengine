      prognosis because of the unique capacity of skeletally immature bones to heal via remodeling.
      Their management varies widely and there is virtually no scientific evidence supporting one
      treatment modality over another. Importantly, the most common treatment modality of cast
      application for four to six weeks is associated with many inconveniences. There are
      commercially available wrist splints that offer a more convenient alternative. Wrist splints
      likely have comparable immobilization and symptom relief, while simultaneously allowing for
      easier bathing and less reliance on subspeciality care. Preliminary adult evidence suggests
      that, in a comparable adult fracture, splinting may offer a safe alternative to casting, with
      earlier resumption of the usual activities. However, this treatment modality needs to be
      compared to the traditional casting management in the pediatric population before it can be
      recommended for clinical practice.

      This study will be the first to challenge the current practice of routine casting and compare
      it to a commercially available wrist splint with respect to recovery of physical function in
      children with acceptably angulated wrist fractures. In addition, standardized treatment of
      these fractures with a splint may be associated with lower morbidity, reduced use of health
      care resources, and have the potential for cost savings.

      This study will compare, in skeletally immature children, the functional outcomes that result
      from treatment with a prefabricated wrist splint versus a short arm cast in acceptably
      angulated distal radius fractures. Secondly, the cost-effectiveness of the splint relative to
      the cast will be evaluated.
