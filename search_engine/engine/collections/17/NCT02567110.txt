      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Goals of this study are to determine the impact of
      inflammation on glutamate concentrations in the basal ganglia and on the integrity of white
      matter tracts in the basal ganglia and other subcortical regions of middle-aged depressed
      versus non-depressed individuals and to associated the impact of glutamate and white matter
      changes on behavioral symptoms among the same group of patients.
