      radiotherapy increases the disease-free survival rate of patients with locally advanced head
      and neck carcinomas at high risk of recurrence following radical surgery.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are registered and randomized to treatment within 25 days
      of surgery. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Irradiation of the preoperative primary tumor site with a
      boost to areas at high risk for recurrence using Co60 equipment, 4-6 MV linear accelerators,
      or 6-12 MeV electrons. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Irradiation as in
      Arm I; plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 338 evaluable patients will be studied.
