      assigned into one of two groups: 1. manual lysis of placenta 15 minutes after delivery. 2.
      waiting 30 minutes and then manual lysis of placenta. Both groups will be managed actively
      during the 3rd stage of delivery, including oxytocin administration and controlled cord
      traction. Women who develop active bleeding will be promptly treated with manual lysis and
      excluded from the study. Manual lysis will be performed under epidural analgesia, and
      prophylactic antibiotics will be administered. Primary outcome of comparison between the two
      groups: hemoglobin drop after delivery. Secondary outcomes include: maternal satisfaction,
      time to first breastfeeding, length of hospital stay, infection rate etc.
