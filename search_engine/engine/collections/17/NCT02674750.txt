    
      Patients with RR DLBCL will be eligible for treatment with CUDC-907, as long as they have
      tumor tissue available that can be tested for MYC-altered disease based on one of the
      following:

        -  Fresh tumor tissue obtained from biopsy accessible lesions , or

        -  Archived tumor tissue (most recent available)

      Subjects will be required to submit archival tumor samples (most recent available) or fresh
      tumor samples for central FISH and IHC testing. Subjects whose tumors have been previously
      characterized as MYC-altered are strongly encouraged to enter the study. For subjects who
      enter the study with unconfirmed MYC-altered disease, fresh tumor samples are preferred.
