      guidelines that recommend Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis after the failure of
      other more conservative therapies and medications. Nevertheless, much is not known about
      using Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis including the mechanism of action, the
      ideal dose, how best to monitor for side effects and in particular whether kidney damage can
      occur at the low doses used in these studies. In this study, to examine the mechanism of
      action, blood and urine samples will be collected before, during and after therapy to look at
      "biomarkers", chemical substances that can be associated with inflammation and tissue injury.
      We will also test effects of therapy on skin sensation and pain perception because the
      molecule which Cyclosporine binds to (calcineurin) is also found in nerves that conduct pain
      signals.

      This study is only being done at the Cleveland Clinic and will involve about 30 patients with
      Interstitial Cystitis.
