      topotecan in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II.
      Assess the toxic effects of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive continuous intravenous infusions of topotecan and carboplatin for 5
      days. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks during induction (two courses) and every 6-10 weeks
      during consolidation. No more than four courses of treatment are given. Patients are followed
      every 6 months for 5 years.
