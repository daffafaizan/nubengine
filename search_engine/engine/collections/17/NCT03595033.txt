      with surgically treated hydrocephalus. The deficits are often mild/moderate at early school
      age although the gap may widen as the children grow older, leading to increasing adverse
      impact on school performance and academic achievement. The proposed study will generate
      initial pilot data for the usage of iPad application based therapy intervention for the
      treatment of cognitive deficits common to pediatric hydrocephalus. It will help determine the
      optimal intensity and duration of training protocol adapted for the study. In addition, the
      sensitivity of neuroimaging (DTI) in response to the therapy will be assessed and validated
      as a biomarker that reflects the neuroanatomical alterations underpinning the outcome
      changes. This study will generate the crucial data to support the design of future Phase III
      clinical trial with the long term goal as changing the current standard of care in order to
      prevent neurocognitive and sensorimotor deficits before the injury to neural circuitry
      becomes irreversible.

      The participants who meet the inclusion criteria and do not opt-out of participation will be
      called by a study coordinator to ensure eligibility and to schedule the initial assessment
      date. Participation in this study will include 8-10 study visits. These visits include 2
      neuropsychological assessments, 2 MRI visits, and 6 weekly visits during intervention phase.
      MRI visit can be combined with the neuropsychological assessment visit if possible at both
      the pre- and post intervention time points.
