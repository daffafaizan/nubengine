    
      This is a randomised clinical trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy of Compound Zhenzhu
      Tiaozhi capsules in the treatment of NAFLD and analyze the relationship between improvement
      in NAFLD parameters and changes in intestinal functions. In this study, the investigators
      will (1)evaluate the relationship between the function of intestinal mucosal barrier, SIBO,
      and NAFLD;(2)assess the effects of Compound Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules on intrahepatic fat
      content, hepatic noninvasive score, liver biochemical parameters, blood lipid, and insulin
      resistance. To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Compound Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules on the
      treatment of NAFLD, and determine whether the risk stratification of atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and quality of life (using the 36-Item Short Form Health
      Survey [SF-36]) can be improved in NAFLD patients with Compound Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules;(3)
      compare the therapeutic effects of Compound Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules with conventional
      medications in the treatment of NAFLD, and to compare their efficacies in improving the risk
      stratification of ASCVD and quality of life, as assessed by the SF-36; (4) analyze the
      relationship of Compound Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules in improving NAFLD and parameters related
      to the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and SIBO.
