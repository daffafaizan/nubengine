    
      Primary Study Objective: Occlusion rate: angiographic occlusion, improvement or no change in
      the post-coiling appearance of the aneurysm as judged by an independent core lab on follow-up
      angiography at 12-18 months after endovascular embolization.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Treatment related morbidity and mortality, as measured by the NIH stroke scale.

        2. Packing density as measured by volumetric filling of the aneurysm.

        3. Clinical outcome at 3-6 and 12-18 months post-coiling, as measured by the modified
           Rankin scale.

        4. Re-hemorrhage and re-treatment rates.

      Study Design: FEAT will be a prospective, randomized trial comparing the utilization of
      0.014-0.0155" coils versus smaller diameter coils in mid-sized aneurysm treatment. The
      0.014-0.0155" bare platinum coils (Stryker, Natick, MA) are FDA-approved and in common use at
      institutions in this country and across the world. Patients will be enrolled who meet the
      inclusion criteria and consent to participate. Patients will be randomly assigned by a
      central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to either the framing coil treatment or the
      non-framing coil treatment. Data on each patient will be collected at the time of enrollment
      and treatment, and at first and second follow-up visits.
