      sensor (CardioMEMS device) are offered participation in the registry. Routine heart-failure
      parameters, lab values, medication and QoL as obtained on the regular outpatients visits in
      the department are entered into a registry-specific database.

      The investigators plan to asses the impact of telemonitoring on mortality, morbidity and QoL
      as well as on Guideline-recommended heart failure medication. In addition, it is planned to
      quantify the input in person time for telemonitoring.
