      vessels themselves; vessel caliber (VC), defined as the mean diameter of the corneal vessels;
      and invasion area (IA), defined as the fraction of the total cornea into which the vessels
      extend. The occurrence of ocular and systemic adverse events was closely monitored throughout
      the course of the study.
