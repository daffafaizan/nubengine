      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of a home-based walking and progressive-resistance exercise
           program in reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      site, chemotherapy course length (2 weeks vs 3 weeks), gender, and degree of fatigue reported
      on the study assessment questionnaire (â‰¤ 5 vs > 5). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a home-based walking kit comprising an Exercise for Cancer
           Patients Manual, a pedometer, and therapeutic resistance bands. Patients undergo
           moderately intense aerobic exercise (walking) monitored by a pedometer, and low to
           moderately intense progressive-resistance exercise using therapeutic resistance bands
           for 6 weeks. Patients also receive standard chemotherapy.

      Patients in both arms undergo assessment of their aerobic capacity and strength by the
      6-minute walk test and handgrip dynamometry at baseline and at day 41. They also have a
      fasting blood draw and wear an actigraph for one week at baseline and week 6. Patients
      complete Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and -Cognitive Subscales,
      Brief Fatigue Inventory, Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Center for
      Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Inventory, Profile of Mood States, Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study Physical
      Activity, and Symptom Inventory questionnaires at baseline and at day 41 and keep a daily
      exercise diary during study intervention.
