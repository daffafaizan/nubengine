    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter, first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of VK-2019 in patients with EBV-positive
      NPC.

      This trial is divided into three parts: Phase 1 Dose Escalation, Phase 1 Dose Expansion, and
      Phase 2s Dose Expansion.

      The objectives of the dose escalation part are to determine the safety, tolerability, MTD,
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of orally
      administered VK-2019 monotherapy. Additional objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of VK-2019.

      VK-2019 will be dosed once daily (QD).
