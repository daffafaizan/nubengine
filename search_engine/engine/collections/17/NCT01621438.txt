    
      Primary Analysis The Primary Analysis will be performed after 2-year follow-up data will be
      completed.

      Pre-specified Subgroup Analysis

      The pre-specified subgroup analysis will perform after 1-year follow-up data will be
      completed according to the following subjects:

        -  Concordant and discordant results between FFR and angiographic stenosis severity
           (patients and lesions with pre-PCI FFR will be analyzed.).

             -  Association between total atherosclerotic burden and total ischemic burden,
                coronary CT angiography substudy (after 2-year follow-up will be completed).

                  -  Validation of total ischemic burden (sum of 3 vessel FFR) with Duke score,
                     measured by treadmill test.

                       -  Comparison of clinical outcomes of deferred lesions according to pre-PCI
                          FFR levels (Pre-PCI FFR <0.75, 0.75-0.80, and >0.80).

                            -  Comparison of clinical outcomes of deferred lesions according to iFR
                               and FFR values â‘¥ Prognosis of functional complete revascularization
                               versus incomplete revascularization
