      endometrial cancer (EC) show that metformin reduces cellular proliferation by PI3K-AKT-mTOR
      inhibition. The investigators tested the hypothesis that short-term presurgical metformin
      reduces cellular proliferation in endometrial cancer. However, no good quality of evidence
      base supports the effectiveness of metformin for deceasing proliferative marker in
      endometrial cancer.
