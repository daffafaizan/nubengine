    
      This is an open-label, single dose, randomized, five-period, crossover design study to
      evaluate the relative bioavailability of a single oral dose of tadalafil gummy 10 mg (Test)
      and tadalafil oral tablets 10 mg (Reference) under fasted conditions in healthy adult male
      and female subjects, and the impact on the bioavailability of tadalafil gummy sugar free 10
      mg when administered with food, when administered with or without water, and when chewed or
      swallowed whole.

      Each subject will receive tadalafil gummy (10 mg) or tadalafil tablet and thereby will be
      his/hers own control.
