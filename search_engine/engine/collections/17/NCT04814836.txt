      study. The non-carious cervical lesions in each patient were divided into five groups
      (total-etch mode with phosphoric acid, selective-etch mode with phosphoric acid, total-etch
      mode with laser, selective-etch mode with laser and self-etch mode) according to different
      modes and application methods of universal adhesive (Clearfil Universal Bond Quick, Kuraray).
      Lesions were restored with a resin composite, Clearfil Majesty ES-2 (Kuraray). All
      restorative procedures were performed by a single operator. Restorations were evaluated at
      one week (baseline), at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month according to modified USPHS criteria
      (retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, color match, postoperative
      sensitivity, and secondary caries) by two experienced and calibrated investigators.
