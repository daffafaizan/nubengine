      and glucose control. Clinical practice guidelines for hypertension and diabetes both assign
      the highest grade of evidence for healthy eating behavior to treat these conditions.
      Unfortunately, fewer than one-quarter of patients adhere to dietary recommendations, with the
      largest disparities among lower socioeconomic groups and racial minorities. Patient adherence
      to nutrition guidelines are deeply hindered by poor access to fresh produce and inadequate
      knowledge about preparing medically-indicated foods. The proposed Produce Drop pilot study
      will evaluate the feasibility and potential health benefits of a fresh fruit and vegetable
      home-delivery program, with and without additional small-group culinary medicine cooking
      classes, among low-income, Medicaid patients with suboptimal blood pressure and glucose
      control. Patients (n=100) from OU-Tulsa Schusterman Internal Medicine Clinic will be
      randomized to 1) a fresh fruit and vegetable home-delivery program, or 2) the same home
      delivery program with supplementary small-group culinary medicine cooking classes. In
      addition, we will include a third arm of control patients (n=50) who will receive the
      standard of care. We will track blood pressure and glucose control in all three groups to
      determine the comparative impact of each intervention. The proposed pilot study, informed by
      the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's "Triple Aim" framework, will provide the formative
      information needed to develop a larger-scale intervention to enhance the patient care
      experience, improve population health status, and reduce the per capita cost of care.
