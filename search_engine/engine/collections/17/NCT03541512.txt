      intervention combined with education for the treatment of the pain and distress associated
      with Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV). Women with PLV will be randomized to either an app-
      based mindfulness program (HeadspaceÂ®) with online education or online education only. Pain
      and sexual distress with be evaluated through a number of measures. The primary outcome of
      the study will be the change in distress relating to sexual activity over the 8-week
      intervention period, which will be measured by a change (reduction) in the Female Sexual
      Distress Scale (FSDS). Participants will additionally perform a weekly Tampon Test and fill
      out a weekly survey regarding their perceived pain as well as the frequency of use and
      completion of the weekly education materials
