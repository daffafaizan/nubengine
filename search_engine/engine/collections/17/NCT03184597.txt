      recruited. A HLA screening will be conducted before these patients start aromatic AEDs
      treatments. According to the HLA genotype, these patients will be divided into four groups
      that are three positive groups with different risk alleles and one negative group with no
      known risk allele. Aromatic AEDs were avoided or administrated with caution according to the
      risk level in the three positive groups, while they can be prescribed in the negative group.
      The effectiveness of HLA screening prior to the beginning of aromatic AEDs administration
      will be observed by the reduction of overall incidence of AEDs-induced cADRs.
