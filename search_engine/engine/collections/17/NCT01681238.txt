      venous, and L3-4 intrathecal catheterizations. A T12 sensory level block was attained with
      ropivacaine through the intrathecal catheter. Besides currently recommended monitoring during
      the intraoperative period, arterial blood pressure, stroke volume (Edwards Lifesciences,
      Irvine, Calif.), and central venous oxygen saturation (Edwards Lifesciences) will be measured
      and recorded. All Patients will receive intranasal oxygen 2 mL/min and be kept normothermic
      (body temperature > 36Â°C). Patients in both groups receive 8 mL/kg/hour of Ringer's lactate
      solution from 30 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia through the end of surgery, when
      the rate will be decreased to 100 mL/hour. In addition, boluses of colloid will be given to
      different protocol group according to the study arm to which the patient
      allocated.Postoperative care and discharge criteria were predefined using the hospital care
      map and protocol.
