      for potential study enrollment. If participants agree to participate, they will be randomized
      into either the suprazygomatic maxillary nerve (SZaMN) block treatment cohort or the control
      cohort i.e standard of care.

      After anesthesia induction, patients randomized into the SZaMN- treatment group will receive
      a bilateral single injection SZaMN block under general anesthesia in the operating room. The
      injection will occur near the temples above the cheek bones.

      Participants enrolled into the control group will receive standard of care with no changes to
      their anesthetic or surgical care. Both groups will be asked for their verbal pain scores in
      the PACU and we will track their opioid consumption throughout the next few days after their
      procedure.
