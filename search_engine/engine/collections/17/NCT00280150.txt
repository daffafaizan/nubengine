      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, controlled, phase I (closed to accrual as of
      1/3/2008), dose-escalation study of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride, followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008):

             -  Induction therapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over
                15-30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
                every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to
                chemoradiotherapy.

             -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy according to their assigned
                dose cohort:

                  -  Cohort 1: Patients undergo thoracic conformal radiotherapy (TCRT) on days 1-5,
                     8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Patients also receive carboplatin
                     IV and paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and bevacizumab IV
                     over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.

                  -  Cohort 2: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
                     bevacizumab as in cohort 1. Patients also receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride
                     on days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26, 30-33, 37-40, and 44-47.

                  -  Cohort 3: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
                     bevacizumab as in cohort 1. Patients also receive higher doses of oral
                     erlotinib hydrochloride on days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26, 30-33, 37-40, and
                     44-47.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive chemoradiotherapy as described above until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      (with grade 4 toxicity) or 3 (with grade 3 toxicity) of 5 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      Three to 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to consolidation
      therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1 and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Phase II:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive induction therapy as in phase I (closed to accrual
           as of 1/3/2008).

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin and paclitaxel as in
           phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008). Patients also receive bevacizumab and
           erlotinib hydrochloride as in phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008) at the MTD/drug
           combination determined in phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008).

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive consolidation therapy as in phase I (closed to
           accrual as of 1/3/2008).

      Tumor tissue and peripheral blood is collected at baseline for future correlative and
      biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 4
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
