      the reactivation of labor epidural catheters which are used as the anesthetic technique for
      PPTL following vaginal delivery. It is proposed that continuous epidural saline infusion will
      decrease the incidence of catheter obstruction by preventing clot, fibrosis, or tissue
      plugging and therefore improve reactivation rates. To our knowledge, this is a novel method
      for attempting to improve epidural reactivation rate and if successful, it would challenge
      the current practice of only capping epidurals following delivery and later attempting
      reactivation prior to PPTL. This may, possibly, become a new technique used to improve the
      rate of epidural reactivation for PPTL.

      If study results show improved labor epidural reactivation rates, benefits would include
      decreased patient morbidity and greater patient comfort and satisfaction by avoiding the
      risks of additional neuraxial procedures as well as general anesthesia. These risks include
      difficult or failed intubation, aspiration, hypotension, headache, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting, and sore throat. Improving epidural reactivation rate could also result in greater
      OR efficiency and decreased costs for the patient and hospital.

      The investigators also hope to elucidate factors associated with catheter migration or
      dislodgement and subsequent failure of epidural reactivation. Additionally, we hope to
      determine what effect obesity and length of time prior epidural reactivation have on epidural
      reactivation rates.
