      of a metronome beat in an MP3 format (30 - 130 BPM) [38] onto a DVD-Rom. A user manual was
      created with a set of instructions that gives each physiotherapist a step-by-step guide on
      how to calculate the correct beat for their participants and how to successfully upload this
      beat onto the iPod. In addition physiotherapists in participating centres attended a training
      session on how to complete the tasks. A pack including the DVD-Rom, user manual, information
      leaflet and consent was sent to participating centres. Recruitment is due to commence in
      September 2008.
