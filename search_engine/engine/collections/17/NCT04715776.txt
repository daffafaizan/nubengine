      effects on suppressing fat accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation in liver. The
      refined seaweed compounds such as low-molecular-weight-fucoidan (LMF) and high stability
      fucoxanthin (HSFx), have not been well studied for its biological function.

      The high stability fucoxanthin (HSFx) and the low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMF) were
      produced by HiQ Marine Biotech Company in Taiwan. Study use fucoidan-fucoxanthin mixture
      (abbreviated as LMF-HSFx, each capsule contains 275 mg LMF and 275 mg HSFx).

      Insulin resistance has a high correlation with fatty liver. Our research team conducted a
      previous human clinical trial of brown algae and conducted liver and metabolic indicators of
      brown algae to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and found brown algae extract
      (LMF-HSFx, commodity In addition to reducing the liver function index, HbA1c in some patients
      with early stage diabetes or type 2 diabetes has an improved effect. In the mouse model of
      type 2 diabetes, comprehensive anti-hyperglycemia, anti-hyperlipidemia and hepatoprotective
      activity were studied using LMF-HSFx. Intake of LMF-HSFx reduced fasting blood glucose,
      increased adiponectin levels, reduced urine glucose, and improved hepatic glucose metabolism.
      LMF-HSFx can improve glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue of diabetic mice, and
      inflammatory factors such as TNF-Î± and IL-6 can also be reduced.

      Based on these studies, we hope to further explore whether LMF-HSFx can improve insulin
      resistance and thus assist blood glucose control.In this study,subjects will be given
      Fuco-HiQ, and their effects on blood glucose and various metabolic indicators will be
      evaluated.
