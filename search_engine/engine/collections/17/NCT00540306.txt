      correlate to quantitative changes in Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy functional parameters such
      as hemoglobin, lipid and water concentration and tissue scattering. Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy imaging can show increase blood flow in breast tissue after ovulation with a
      concomitant increase in mitotic activity, changes in hemoglobin concentration and in tissue
      scattering. Increases in fibroglandular breast tissue after ovulation have also been
      observed. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy imaging can determine after time of ovulation has been
      detected during the two months of self-monitoring.
