      Arm 2:OE 10 mg Norvasc tablet+matched placebo for OE Celebrex capsule (amlodipine+placebo
      arm)

      Arm 3:Matched placebo for OE Norvasc tablet+matched placebo for OE Celebrex capsule
      (placebo+placebo arm).

      Following an up to 14-day screening phase, eligible subjects were randomized to one of the 3
      treatment arms. All drugs were to be administered orally qd for 14 days for a total of 14
      doses. Visits at the clinic took place at the start and at the end of the screening phase, at
      Study Day 0 (start of treatment), Day 6, Day 7, Day 13 (end of treatment), Day 14 and Day 28
