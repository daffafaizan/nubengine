      ionizing radiation to cause damage in tumor cells. After radical surgical treatment of
      gynecological tumors, pathological findings, such as extension of the myometrium invasion,
      histologic grade, and vascular- lymphatic invasion predict the risk of locoregional
      recurrence of disease and, consequently, the need for adjuvant treatment. There are two main
      methods of adjuvant therapy after hysterectomy for malignant neoplasm of the cervix or
      endometrium: external beam radiotherapy with or without booster dose of vaginal vault
      brachytherapy or brachytherapy alone. There are few data in the literature and clinical
      experience with brachytherapy dimensional (3D) for adjuvant treatment of vaginal vault .

      Objective: To demonstrate the limitations of conventional dosimetry (2D) for the adjuvant
      brachytherapy treatment and assess whether tridimensional dosimetry relates more faithfully
      with the occurrence of adverse effect.

      Methods: A prospective study in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Antonio Candido Camargo
      Cancer Center will be developed with an expected duration of 14 months and will include 60
      patients. Dosimetric parameters of brachytherapy treatment of vaginal vault, able to
      influence the incidence of adverse effects will be evaluated. Computed tomography for
      planning of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy planning will be used, after
      placement of intra- vaginal applicator and urinary catheter. For planning brachytherapy two
      fast acquisition sequences, one with a urinary catheter not pulled and pulled another with
      the probe will be obtained. The prescription dose obey the standard indication of document of
      the International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU 38).
