    
      Patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Rochester for a clinically indicated high resolution
      impedance manometry (HRIM), 24 hour impedance pH (MII-pH) study, and
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be recruited. Gastroesophageal reflux will be defined
      as a total 24 hour esophageal acid exposure time ≥5% regardless of concomitant Proton Pump
      inhibitor (PPI) use. A negative 24 hour MII-pH study will be defined as an acid exposure time
      ≤2% off PPI therapy or ≤1% if on PPI therapy.
