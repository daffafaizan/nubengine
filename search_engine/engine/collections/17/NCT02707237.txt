      and significantly improved the survival of extremely preterm infants. An important component
      of medical management before a preterm delivery is counseling the parents about probabilities
      of survival and long term complications.

      Hypothesis: Preterm counseling is more effective when parents receive verbal counseling
      supplemented with written and pictorial information then verbal counseling alone.

      Methodology: There will be two groups of study (verbal, pictorial and written vs verbal
      alone). All patients admitted to the L and D department of Stroger hospital between 23 to 34
      weeks of gestation with threatened premature delivery will be enrolled in the study. They
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. After counseling, parents will be asked to
      complete a 32 point questionnaire to check their knowledge of outcomes of prematurity.

      To reach statistically significant results, the investigators will need 40 patients in each
      group. The study will be done over a period of one year
