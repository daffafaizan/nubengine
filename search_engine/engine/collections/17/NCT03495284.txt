      provided with a potato based side dish (equivalent to one medium sized potato) or an
      isocaloric refined grain based side dish every day for 4 weeks, in random order. The
      treatment periods will be separated by a minimum two-week break. Endpoint testing will be
      conducted over two days at baseline and the end of each diet period.
