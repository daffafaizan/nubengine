      intervention. Reporters are responsible for recommended objects and measure their blood
      pressure personally. By observing personally the change of blood pressure pre and post
      low-sodium salt intervention, reporters will increase their confidence and come to the
      conclusion that the low salt diet is an economical way to reduce blood pressure. Those
      reporters would share their experiment with other people including their colleagues,
      Hopefully, those reporters that took part in the trial would consciously keep a sustained
      focus to this topic, thereby retaining a long-time education in mass media.There were two
      interventions. One is low-sodium salt intervention and the other is informational
      intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was carried out on those family members
      recommended by reporters, and informational intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was
      only on the reporters. The evaluation criteria of low-sodium salt intervention is the blood
      pressure value, and the evaluation criteria of informational intervention are the numbers of
      related articles in certain newspaper and the awareness of related knowledges in local
      population.
