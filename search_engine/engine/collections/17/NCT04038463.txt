      perception are affected throughout the different phases of the menstrual cycle and if the
      perception can be modified through resistance training. To the best of our knowledge, only
      one study has analyzed the effects of the menstrual cycle on body image perception. However,
      research analyzing the effects of the menstrual cycle on both body image perception and, body
      composition is lacking. Furthermore, research in the effects of resistance training on
      menstrual cycle-related changes on both perceived and measured body composition are
      inexistent. Findings from this study have the potential to increase the knowledge about
      resistance training's effects in modulating body image perception throughout the menstrual
      cycle. Further understanding of these responses may set the groundwork to develop exercise
      intervention programs to reduce the risk of developing more serious mental conditions linked
      to unhealthy body image perception.
