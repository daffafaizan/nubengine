      first IVF treatment cycle cancelled because of high risk for OHSS will be enrolled and
      randomized in two treatment arms.

      In their second IVF attempt, the experimental group will receive metformin (500 mg, 3 times
      daily) pre-treatment for two weeks and co-administration during gonadotropins ovarian
      stimulation; the control group will be treated with placebo (2 cps daily) pre-treatment and
      co-administration by using the same schedule of the experimental group. In all patients,
      ovarian stimulation will be carried out with a personalized step-down gonadotropin in
      association with a minidose flare-up GnRH agonist protocol.
