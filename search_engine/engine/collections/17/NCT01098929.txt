      to better understand the genetic basis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Ongoing projects
      at Massachusetts General Hospital include identification of novel genes affecting diaphragm
      and lung development in a) mouse models using laser capture, microdissection, expression
      arrays, and statistical and bioinformatics analysis and b) human kindreds with multiple
      affected family members using linkage analysis and exome sequencing.

      Research projects based at Children's Hospital Boston include a) continued recruitment of a
      population of patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who are carefully phenotyped for
      entry into an extensive database, b) collection of biological samples belonging to the
      phenotyped cohort of patients, c) next-generation sequencing on candidate genes and d)
      molecular cytogenetic studies such as comparative genomic hybridization and subtelomeric
      fluorescence in situ hybridization.

      Over 500 patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and their families have been recruited
      to date and efforts are ongoing to double this number. The investigators hope that the
      information gained through identifying the genes that contribute to congenital diaphragmatic
      hernia will provide the foundation for future efforts to develop effective interventions for
      the treatment of this disease.
