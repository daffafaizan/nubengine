      community health centers in Boston, which demonstrated a positive impact on provider
      referrals, discussion, and family receipt of resources.

      This study will specifically test the effectiveness of a further strengthened intervention
      "WE CARE 2.0" on provider referrals and family receipt of resources, along with its impact on
      child health, health care utilization, and developmental outcomes. Finally, we will gather
      information from stakeholders at the health centers in order to learn more about the
      facilitators and barriers to implementation of the model.

      The study will take place at six community health centers in the Greater Boston area. The
      centers will be randomized to either an intervention or control site. Data will be collected
      on referrals, receipt of resources, and child outcomes from the child's electronic medical
      record (EMR) from birth to age 3. Focus groups will be used to gather implementation data
      from intervention health center personnel.

      The WE CARE 2.0 intervention consists of: 1) WE CARE surveys which parents complete prior to
      their child's well-child visits; 2) information technology (IT) generated provider referrals
      which providers use to provide families with resource information sheets; 3) peer patient
      navigators who assist families in connecting to available resources and updating providers;
      and 4) training sessions for providers and office staff.

      Families attending the control health centers will receive standard of care. Of note, since
      the health centers share a common EMR and for ethical reasons, control sites will have access
      to the IT generated referral mechanism.
