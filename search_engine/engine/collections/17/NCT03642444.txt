    
      Aim: To investigate the effect of replacing canes with an elasticated orthotic-garment on
      gait and balance in chronic stroke subjects.

      Design Experimental, multiple baseline N-of-1 series with an ABC design with randomised
      period duration.

      Participants Four cane using chronic stroke subjects. Interventions Phase A (9-12 weeks)
      usual cane-walking to establish baseline values; Phase B (9-19 weeks) intervention:
      orthotic-garment worn throughout the day with maximal cane reduction; Phase C (9-10 weeks)
      individually determined follow-up: either no walking-aid, orthotic-garment or cane.

      Weekly measurement of Outcome Measures for gait and balance function
