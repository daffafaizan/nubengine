      fibrillation/flutter in patients who have had an embolic stroke within six months, where no
      cause of stroke was found. Following informed consent, an external cardiac rhythm monitor
      will be attached to each participant. Participants will be instructed to wear the device as
      much as possible over the 30 day study period. If atrial fibrillation/flutter is detected
      before 30 days, participants may stop wearing the monitor and will be contacted to discuss
      changing their antithrombotic strategy for stroke secondary prevention as per standard of
      care. Recorded cardiac rhythm data will be transmitted for central interpretation and results
      will be sent to the PI, with copies provided for the patient's stroke neurologist and primary
      care practitioner for clinical continuity of care.

      Participants will be contacted by telephone once per week for the duration of the 30 day
      study period. Following device return patients will be followed for two years and will
      receive telephone follow-ups at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years.

      The aim of the PROPhecy study is to prospectively validate those features on holter monitor
      and echocardiography identified as predictive of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients
      with embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Our overall goal is to determine whether
      all patients with ESUS should be referred for extended rhythm monitoring, or whether these
      criteria can be used to refer patients more selectively for this more resource-intensive
      diagnostic procedure.
