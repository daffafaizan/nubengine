      the ventilation mode, controlled pressure and controlled volume, modifies the risk of
      bleeding.

        -  group Volume controlled ventilation: tidal volume of 7 mL/kg ideal body weight,
           frequency of 12 cycles/minute, I/E ratio of 1:2, no positive end expiratory pressure.
           Ventilatory frequency is changed if necessary to maintain end-expiratory pressure of CO2
           between 35 and 40 mmHg.

        -  group Pressure-controlled ventilation: initial pressure of 15 cm H2O, frequency of 12
           cycles/minute, I/E ratio of 1:2, no positive end expiratory pressure. Pressure is
           modified to maintain a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg of ideal body weight and frequency
           ventilation is modified to maintain end-expiratory pressure of CO2 between 35 and 40
           mmHg.

        -  In both groups, the fraction of inspired oxygen is 50%. A recruitment maneuver is
           performed if the blood oxygen saturation became less than 92%.
