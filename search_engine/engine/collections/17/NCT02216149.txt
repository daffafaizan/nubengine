      receive two 3-weekly cycles of either XELOX (intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 d.1 followed
      by oral capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day divided in 2 daily doses d1-14) or SOX (intravenous
      oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 d. 1 followed by oral S-1 25 mg/m2/day BID d1-14). A cross-over between
      the 2 arms is carried out after the first 2 cycles; patients allocated to XELOX will receive
      2 cycles of SOX (cycles 3 and 4), and those allocated to SOX will receive XELOX (cycles 3 and
      4). Monitoring of the coronary artery flow, cardiac arrythmias, cardiac symptoms and blood
      biochemistry is done at baseline, during each chemotherapy cycle (cycles 1 to 4) and after
      treatment.Study treatment will continue until all patients have discontinued from treatment
      or maximum 24 weeks from the date of the first day of treatment, whichever occurs first. At
      that point, treatment may continue at the discretion of the Investigator. Each patient will
      be followed for survival status for a minimum of 12 months after first dose of study
      medication. Tumor assessments will be performed throughout the study period and analyzed
      using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Version 1.1, 2009).
      Computed tomography (CT) scans will be performed at the end of every 2 cycles. Cardiac
      assessments will be performed and analyzed using non-invasive transthoracic Doppler
      echocardiography, 24-h Holter registration, and plasma troponin concentration.
