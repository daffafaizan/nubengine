      and BVBlue Test) that give results in 10 minutes are as accurate as standard tests (that take
      up to 7 days to get results) to diagnose common vaginal infections (Trichomonas and bacterial
      vaginosis).

      Both rapid tests (OSOM and BVBlue) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      be used by healthcare professionals to aid in the diagnosis of these infections. This study
      is being done to validate (or confirm)the accuracy of these tests. This study may help
      researchers decide if these tests could be used in remote research settings (in place of the
      standard office testing) to increase diagnosis and prompt treatment of these vaginal
      infections.
