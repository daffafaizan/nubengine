      The study will serve as a vehicle for a three-pronged approach (clinical observation,
      biological basis and therapeutic intervention) reflects the applicants professional interest
      in translational pediatric obesity research If the investigators find that BMI-dependent
      disparity exists in Post Tonsillectomy Pain (PTP) and that preoperative down regulation of
      inflammatory response with one preoperative dose of corticosteroids reduces PTP, our findings
      should ultimately lead to improved postoperative pain management of pediatric PTP especially
      in obese children.
