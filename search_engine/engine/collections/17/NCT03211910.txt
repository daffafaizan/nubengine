    
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the ability of the product "Sacral
      Savers." to prevent and/or help healing of bed sores, in patients in health care facilities.

      The Sacral saver device consists of a sheet of strong bubble-wrap -like material, folded at
      one end and covered by a nylon sham with a pocket in which the bubble wrap is placed. The
      assembled device is placed under the bed sheet in such a way that the small of the back rests
      on the fold. This will lift the back and reduce the pressure of the buttocks on the bed. When
      lying on the side, it will reduce the pressure on the hip.

      Participants are being asked to participate in this study because you are at risk for, or
      already have a bedsore on the buttocks or the hip.
