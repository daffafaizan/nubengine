      I. To assess the feasibility of daily cryocompression therapy in multiple myeloma patients
      with bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the change in patient-reported assessment of neuropathy based on the sensory,
      motor and autonomic neuropathy scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Cancer-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
      (CIPN20) (patient-reported outcome [PRO]) from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after the start of
      cryocompression therapy.

      II. To examine the change in physician graded assessment of peripheral neuropathy by National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0
      criteria from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after the start of cryocompression therapy.

      III. To assess the effect on sensory and motor nerve function via nerve conduction study
      (NCS) (e.g. conduction velocity, latency, and amplitude) and neuro-ultrasound after 8 weeks
      of daily cryocompression therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effect of 8 weeks of cryocompression on changes in digital artery perfusion
      as measured by ultrasound (US).

      II. To examine the associations among the peripheral nerve assessment measures (nerve
      conduction and peripheral nerve US) with the patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20,
      PRO-CTCAE) at baseline, week 4, week 8, and for the change from baseline to week 8.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo home cryocompression therapy treatments on their non-dominant hand and foot
      over 30 minutes daily for 8 weeks.

      After completion of cryocompression therapy, patients are followed up at 30 days.
