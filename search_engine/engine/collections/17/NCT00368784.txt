      mediated skin disease (e.g. psoriasis and mycosis fungoides). Peripheral blood with be
      collected from volunteers with psoriasis, mycosis fungoides and age matched controls. Fifteen
      tablespoons of blood will be collected prior to the initiation of treatment and again after
      the patient shows a clinical response to treatment. The time between blood draws will be no
      less than 3 months. There will be no more than two blood draws per patient. Blood samples
      will be used to determine the patient's HLA haplotype via PCR and DNA sequencing. After the
      patient's haplotype has been established the activated T cell repertoire will be analyzed for
      clonal expansions. Clonal expansions in the T cell repertoire will be determined by
      immunoscope analysis, which is a PCR based technique.
