      practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. The investigators recently published
      practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of this 5-year multisite
      randomized clinical trial is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses'
      knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. The investigators expect that
      increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will
      result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 17 hospitals will
      participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline
      measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The
      intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain
      change. The online education will include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia
      monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The strategies to implement and
      sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the
      designation of "champions" on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the
      practice standards.
