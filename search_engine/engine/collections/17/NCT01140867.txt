      therapy in patients with uncontrolled partial epilepsy. Subject takes zonisamide for 16 weeks
      (4 weeks-titration period, 8 weeks maintenance period). Dose range of zonisamide is 100 ~ 400
      mg/day and target dose is 300 mg/day. After 16 weeks, zonisamide efficacy is measured by
      seizure reduction rate (Each type of seizure: simple partial seizures [SPS], complex partial
      seizures [CPS], simple partial seizures evolving into generalized tonic-clonic convulsions
      [SGTC] and total seizure frequency), seizure free rate, responder rate, quality of life in
      epilepsy (QOLIE-31) and investigator's global evaluation scale. Safety of zonisamide in this
      study will be estimated by adverse event profile, retention rate and dose of exposure. The
      duration of this clinical study is 2 years including period of subject enrollment.
