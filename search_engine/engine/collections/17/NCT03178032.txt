      approaches for these tumors have failed, leaving a terrible prospect with median survival
      under one year, and survival at 5 years virtually of zero. Moreover, most of the long term
      survivors suffer from long-term side effects of the aggressive treatment. Thus, new
      therapeutic strategies are required that allow not only for more effective treatments of
      these tumors but also that defer the severe side effects derived from the current therapeutic
      choices. DNX-2401 is an oncolytic virus engineered to replicate specifically in tumor cells
      with an abnormal retinoblastoma (RB) pathway. Moreover, this virus infects cells through
      integrins, which are more abundant in glioma cells. Here we propose a phase I, unicentric,
      non-randomized clinical trial to study the safety and potential efficacy of intratumoral
      administration of DNX-2401 in DIPG. The virus administration will be done after stereotactic
      tumor biopsy, using the same trajectory, after verification of catheter position with
      intraoperative MRI. After 3-4 weeks patients will receive standard radiotherapy and/or
      chemotherapy. The primary objective is to confirm the safety of the target dose known from
      adults trials. Secondary endpoints are overall survival at 12 months (OS12), percentage of
      responses and induced immune response against tumor. The follow up includes close monitoring
      of neurological status, blood tests and brain MRI. If this trial shows evidence of safety and
      efficacy will propel a multicenter clinical trial.
