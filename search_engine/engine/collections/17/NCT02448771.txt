      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet
      approved Palbociclib in combination with Bazedoxifene for use in participants with your type
      of cancer, but it has been approved for other uses (metastatic breast cancer).

      Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of
      two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur), called
      Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a sequence of
      steps which is known to control cell growth. Laboratory testing has shown that palbociclib
      may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

      Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking the activity of the estrogen
      receptor. During this study the endocrine therapy will be bazedoxifene.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating how safe palbociclib is and how well
      palbociclib in combination with bazedoxifene, a form of endocrine treatment, works in
      participants with a history of stage four breast cancer.
