      poor sleep alters the perception of pain and sleep is a vulnerable state of breathing. The
      central system sensitization affecting the sensation of widespread pain in FM is due to a
      decrease in the neurophysiologic inhibition of perception of painful stimuli. This is caused
      by disturbed sleep. Rheumatic disease pathology can be understood in the light of the
      interference of cytokines and cellular immune functions with the sleeping/waking brain. Sleep
      disturbances such as unrefreshing sleep, difficulty falling asleep and frequent night
      awakenings have been reported by over 90% of FM patients. Sleep disturbances may be related
      to depression through pain and alteration of physical functioning. Depression and sleep
      disturbances have been proven to contribute to fatigue in FM patients. Although
      non-restorative sleep and fatigue are the most commonly reported symptoms by FM patients, the
      exact cause of these problems is not well understood. A study reported that 50% of the women
      with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or upper airway resistance syndrome had chronic pain
      and more than 11 tender points. One case report has suggested OSA as a possible cause for FM.
      No studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effect of CPAP treatment on symptoms of FM
      syndrome in patients with OSA.
