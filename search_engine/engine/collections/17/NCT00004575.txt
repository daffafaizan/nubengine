      oxide (NO), prostacyclin and an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). EDHF
      release is stimulated by receptor-dependent agonists such as acetylcholine and bradykinin
      (BK), and leads to hyperpolarization of the underlying smooth muscle cells presumably by
      opening Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Indirect pharmacologic evidence suggests that EDHF is
      a cytochrome P450-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, presumably an epoxide.

      Numerous inhibitors of EDHF have been defined in animal tissues. Of these, miconazole has
      proven to be safe when administered to humans as a topical and parenteral antifungal agent.
      At levels that are attained with routine clinical use, it has a rapid onset of action with
      high specificity of inhibition of EDHF in animal models. This study is designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial miconazole in inhibiting BK-mediated
      forearm vasodilation in normal volunteers.
