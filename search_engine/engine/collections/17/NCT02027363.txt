    
      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who achieved objective response or stable disease
      after 4-6 months first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to one of two groups, to
      receive either capecitabine (2000 mg/m2 per day on days 1-14,Q3W) as maintenance therapy or
      observation. The treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
