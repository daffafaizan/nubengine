      activity and energy balance promote the maintenance of weight loss in healthy overweight and
      obese individuals. The study compares two approaches designed to help individuals monitor
      physical activity and to adjust their calorie intake to maintain a reasonable energy balance
      (bodybuggÂ® & Step Diet Book systems). Full subject participation in the study spans two
      years. Participants periodically report to a pre-arranged location to be measured by a
      qualified fitness professional for height, weight, circumferences, and estimated body fat
      using a bioelectric impedance scale (body fat scale).
