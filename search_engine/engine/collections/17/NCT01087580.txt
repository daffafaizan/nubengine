      study all participants will receive the standard chemotherapy. In addition, half the
      participants will also receive radiation therapy. It is hoped that the radiation therapy will
      provide additional benefit. The use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy for patients with
      this kind of cancer is not considered standard treatment at the present time.

      Participants will be randomized into groups (or Arms) by a computer program. Participants
      randomized to Arm 1 will receive chemotherapy alone. Participants in Arm 2 will receive
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Participants in both groups (Arm 1 and Arm 2) will
      receive standard chemotherapy with docetaxel and prednisone. Docetaxel is given through a
      needle in a vein in the arm every 3 weeks or 21 days. Participants will take a prednisone
      tablet once per day until 21 days after the last dose of docetaxel. In addition, all
      participants will be given a drug called dexamethasone twice daily for 6 doses to help with
      the side effects of docetaxel. Participants in Arm 2 will first receive radiation therapy to
      the pelvis and prostate gland. Radiation therapy will be delivered once a day, five days a
      week for a total of 8-9 weeks. Then beginning 4-6 weeks after the end of radiation therapy,
      chemotherapy will be given, as described above. In both Arms, the total number of cycles of
      docetaxel and prednisone will depend upon how the tumor responds to these drugs. All patients
      should receive a minimum of three cycles of chemotherapy.
