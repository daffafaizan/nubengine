      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including thrombus aspiration and stenting.
      There is, however, still a high incidence of impaired post-procedural myocardial perfusion,
      which is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Intravenous (IV) administration of the
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab during primary PCI plays an important role in the
      treatment of patients with STEMI. With higher local drug concentrations, abciximab may have
      additional anti-platelet, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory features. These possible
      benefits may be obtained by intracoronary (IC) administration of abciximab. Recent small- to
      medium-scaled studies have suggested that IC administration of abciximab instead of the (IV)
      route is associated with improved post-procedural myocardial perfusion and a clinically
      relevant reduction of major adverse cardiac events.

      Because of the limited number of patients included in these studies, a larger randomized
      clinical trial is needed to evaluate the effect of IC abciximab in patients with STEMI.
      Furthermore, the combined strategy of PCI with thrombus aspiration and IC use of abciximab
      has not been investigated.

      Therefore, the investigators intend to evaluate the effect of IC bolus administration of
      abciximab compared to IV bolus administration on post-procedural myocardial perfusion as
      assessed by the extent of ST-segment elevation resolution in patients with STEMI undergoing
      primary PCI. The study is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial with blinded
      evaluation of endpoints.
