    
      Healthy subjects will be randomised to either arm A (sequential metoprolol single dose and
      Pyramax 3 days course + metoprolol on the last day starting 7 days after Pyramax single dose
      followed by Pyramax redosing with another 3 days course 90 days later) or arm B (2 courses of
      3-days Pyramax separated by 60 days). Each arm will include 22 subjects.

      Subjects will be followed for tolerability and pharmacokinetics for 42 days following each
      start of Pyramax dosing period.

      Subjects will be considered to have completed the study at Day 140 (arm A) or at Day 103 (arm
      B).

      Any adverse event ongoing at the time of study completion will be followed until resolution
      unless no further change is expected according to the investigator.
