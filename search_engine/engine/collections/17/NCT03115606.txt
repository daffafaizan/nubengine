      fastrach LMA have performed well but neck motion can be occured. Endotracheal intubation will
      be performed under fluoroscopy. In this study the neck motion angles will be investigated
      during intubation . The angles will be assessed on fluoroscopy images. A Angle: Angle of the
      line between occipital protuberance and anterior process of the foramen magnum with the line
      between central point of spinous process C1 vertebrae and the anterior process of foramen
      magnum. The reference line for the occiput is defined as a line between the base of the sella
      and the opisthion (lineA), and the C1 reference line as a line between the lower cortical
      margin of the spinous process (line B). The C2 reference line is defined as a line between
      the anterior , inferior margin of the C2 body and the lower cortical margin of the C2 spinous
      process (lineC). The C5 reference line is a tangent along the superior endplate of the C5
      vertebral body (line D). The groups will be compared statistically.
