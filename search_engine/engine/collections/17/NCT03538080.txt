      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. No register of non-included
      patients will be kept. In included patients, in parallel to the standard ultrasound
      investigation for marking of saphenous veins for which the patient is referred, AccuVeinÂ®
      system will be performed as explained later in arm description.

      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the
      end of the participation of the subjects.
