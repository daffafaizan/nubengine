      increased risk of debilitating and\ or life-threatening bleedings due to low platelet
      numbers. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment of WAS and all its
      symptoms yet requires time for donor search and is not widely utilized in cases with mild WAS
      with isolated thrombocytopenia. TPO-RAs have been used in individual WAS patients, wherein
      publications describing large WAS cohorts treated with TPO-RAs are lacking.

      Based on the previous reports, WAS patients in our Center have been receiving treatment with
      TPO-RA romiplostim since 2012.

      The aim of the study is to retrospective analyze patients' data in order to asses treatment
      efficacy and safety of romiplostim in WAS thrombocytopenia.

      The study will collect and analyze information that is already in the patients' medical
      records. Information about clinical data (assessment of bleeding tendency with a modified
      World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale), laboratory values (such as clinical and
      biochemical analysis of blood) will be included.

      Evaluation of the efficacy therapy was based on the results of physical examination,
      including bleeding events at the time of diagnosis and after 6-month TPO-RA was initiated and
      platelet response. A complete response was defined as a platelet count >100 x 109/L in the
      absence of bleeding symptoms, partial - 30 x 109/L higher than the patient's pretreatment
      baseline count to 100 x 109/L. Non-response was defined as not achieving a platelet count of
      > 30 x 109/L from the baseline count.
