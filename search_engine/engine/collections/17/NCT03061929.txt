    
      The study is a 5-month prospective observational cohort study. Approximately 258
      mother-infant pairs in 33-42 weeks of pregnancy will be recruited. Eligibility assessment
      will be done for the mother at enrolment and for the mother-infant pair at delivery. Based on
      the recorded anthropometric data and BMI (kg/m2) calculated based on the self-reported
      pre-pregnancy weight or earliest recorded body weight from their first trimester, mothers
      consenting to the study will be categorized as either well-nourished or malnourished. All
      study centers will recruit equal number of participants in each group at their respective
      sites. As per standard of care, mothers will continue to take the prenatal supplement
      primarily consisting of folic acid, elemental iron, calcium and will be encouraged to breast
      feed their infants during prenatal visits. Breastfeeding advice normally consists of messages
      on the benefits of breastfeeding, instructions on early initiation of breastfeeding and
      proper breastfeeding techniques, and recommendation on exclusive breastfeeding for the first
      6 months. Mothers will be provided with a diary to make a note about their supplement intake
      and the frequency of breastfeeding. The entry of the details will be enquired telephonically
      (biweekly) and restated during the face follow-up sessions at study visits 3 and 4.
