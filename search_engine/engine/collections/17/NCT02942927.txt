      appointment 6 months later. Initial baseline data collection from the patient include data on
      demographics, medications, and illness characteristics. The patient will then attend an
      appointment with a pharmacist to review medications appropriate for discontinuation/dose
      reduction, after which the patient will meet with their family physician to discuss patient
      preferences for discontinuation/dose reduction. Both health care providers will have access
      to TaperMD, a web based program linked to evidence and tools to support reduction in
      polypharamcy. Follow-up research assessments will take place at one week, 3 months and 6
      months (study end). Outcome assessments and a semi-structured interview will take place at
      the 6 month appointment.
