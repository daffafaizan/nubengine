      analyzing sequence of initiation of motion and sequence of maximum contribution in segmental
      translation and rotation of each vertebra L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 and S1 by using flexion and
      extension cinematographic recordings in asymptomatic male participants. Participants will
      undergo two cinematographic recordings with an interval of two weeks. Segmental translation
      and rotation of each segment will be plotted against total range of motion of the lumbar
      spine for each individual participant. With these graphs the investigators can analyze if
      there are specific physiological motion patterns during flexion and extension of the lumbar
      spine. In the future, the investigators hope to compare these physiological motion patterns
      to potential abnormal motion patterns in patients suffering from lumbar spinal pathology or
      after lumbar spine surgery to gain knowledge about complaints and, for example, adjacent
      level disease.
