        -  Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF) or
           pegfilgrastim in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent uterine
           leiomyosarcoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior pelvic
      radiotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 9-15 OR
      pegfilgrastim SC on day 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28
      months.
