      the study site over a period of approximately 14 weeks. Subjects will be titrated to an
      optimum dose of study treatment and assessed for safety and efficacy. Dermal response will be
      evaluated at each visit by the investigator. Subjects with high dermal response scores or
      scores that persist at the same application site and have no improvement after up to 4
      evaluations (not to exceed a two week period) will be discontinued from the study and
      referred to a study specific dermatologist for specialized skin sensitivity skin patch
      testing.
