    
      Primary objective :

      To estimate progression free survival (PFS) probability of patient who recurrent SCLC treated
      with IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound paclitaxel following progression on
      platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

      I.To evaluate the objective remission rate (ORR), disease control rate. (DCR),durative time
      of remission ( DoRï¼‰and overall survival (OS) of IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound
      paclitaxel following progression on platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

      II.To evaluate the safety of IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound paclitaxel
      following progression on platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

      Exploratory Objectives To evaluate the correlation of biomarkers with efficacy and toxicity.
