      with both Alzheimer's disease and sleep apnea, and in that it focuses on the impact of
      treatment on these patient's cognitive abilities, particularly on their executive
      abilities.We aim to provide practitioners with evidence-based arguments for screening and
      treating sleep apnea in dementia patients in order to care for these patients, whose
      treatment options are often scarce.
