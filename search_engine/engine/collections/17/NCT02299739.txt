      medicine is most frequently used. The low prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
      gives rise to the need for large-scale patient studies. The objective of this study is to
      report on the incidence of liver injury from herbal medicine in musculoskeletal disease
      patients as large-scale studies are scarce.

      Of 32,675 inpatients taking herbal medicine at 7 locations of a Korean medicine hospital
      between 2005 and 2013, we screened for liver injury in 6,894 patients with liver function
      tests (LFTs) at admission and discharge. LFTs included t-bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP. We
      assessed for risk factors for liver injury at discharge.

      Participants received the most frequently used complementary and alternative medicine
      treatment contents (herbal medicine, acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, bee venom
      pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manipulation) administered to musculoskeletal disease patients at
      this hospital.
