      shown that preparation prior to colonoscopy remains one of the biggest deterrents for
      patients considering colon screening (1).

      In addition to the bowel cleansing agents another important aspect of the preparation is the
      diet consumed prior to the procedure. Currently 48 hours prior to colonoscopy patients are
      asked to consume a low residue diet. The day before the procedure they are switched to a
      clear fluid only diet which many patients find difficult to follow due to hunger and can lead
      to non-compliance with the preparation.

      There have been no trials to date which have answered the question whether the consumption of
      breakfast alters colon cleansing with the cleansing agents currently used in Canada.
      Investigators found that in patients receiving sodium phosphate preparations, a full
      breakfast or low residue lunch had no effect on colon cleansing scores and improved hunger
      and energy levels (2). Several studies have looked at the result of low residue diet kits
      taken the day prior to the procedure and showed no difference in colon cleansing or
      tolerability compared to the traditional clear fluid regime (3,4).

      This study aims to test whether patients who consume a low residue breakfast the day prior to
      colonoscopy have a difference in the quality of their colon cleansing or tolerability of the
      preparation compared to those who consume a clear fluid diet. The investigators hypothesize
      that there will be no difference in bowel preparation scores and will be better tolerated.
