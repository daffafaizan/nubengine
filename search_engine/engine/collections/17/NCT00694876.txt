      States (Juzych, M, et al., 2008; Muir, KW, et al., 2006). Low adherence in glaucoma patients
      leads to increased intraocular pressure, optic nerve damage, and blindness. To date, no
      research has been done with health literacy and patient adherence in the developing world.

      We will use TOFHLA and REALM to assess the health literacy of glaucoma patients in Tamil
      Nadu, India. We will also survey other demographic information and patient knowledge of
      glaucoma. This information will be compared with follow-up rates to identify barriers to
      patient adherence.
