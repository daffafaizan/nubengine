      etiology in previously healthy women. Only a minority of patients recovers completely while
      the majority of PPCM patients develop persistent ventricular dysfunction and may experience
      severe heart failure leading to cardiac transplantation. Thus, these young patients are very
      sick at a time when the newborn would need a healthy mother. Many of PPCM patients need
      lifelong treatment causing a large financial and social burden. Indeed, a better
      understanding of the disease and more efficient therapeutic options are urgently needed. To
      date, no specific therapy is available so that patients are treated by medical
      pharmacotherapy for heart failure.

      Diagnosis of PPCM is usually made at advanced stages of the disease in severely symptomatic
      women but prognosis of affected women is poor with reported mortality rates of 15% and
      recovery in only 23% to 54% of PPCM patients despite optimal medical treatment. Therefore
      strategies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk and novel therapeutic approaches
      are required to improve poor prognosis of affected women.

      The trial would establish a new specific therapeutic regimen for PPCM and the investigators
      can expect that such a novel approach would be rapidly adopted in the clinical management of
      this disease. Since the trial design follows state-of the-art guidelines, the investigators
      assume that bromocriptine would shortly be adopted into clinical guidelines of the German
      Cardiac Society, European Cardiac Society, and the American Heart Association.
