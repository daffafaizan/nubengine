      metastatic process well. CTCs are important for the development of metastases and there is
      interest in isolating and culturing them ex vivo to better characterize their biology,
      metastatic potential, and response to different therapies. The investigators have previously
      demonstrated efficient capture and enumeration of CTCs in 4 unique patient cohorts
      (metastatic prostate and locally advanced rectal, cervical and head and neck cancers) in the
      investigators prospective clinical study, LCCC 1408 (Investigation of Circulating Tumor Cells
      from Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy). However, CTCs are difficult to culture
      with conventional methods. The investigators propose to culture CTCs using novel
      decellularized tissue matrices. Blood will be collected from cancer patients with metastatic
      solid tissue tumors prior to starting definitive or palliative radiotherapy. The
      investigators will then isolate CTCs and attempt to grow them on various decellularized
      matrices. If this study is successful and feasibility is demonstrated, important pilot
      information will also be gathered which will then be used in power and sample size
      considerations for future CTCs studies.
