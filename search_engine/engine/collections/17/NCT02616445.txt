    
      Part 1 of this study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
      dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD in healthy participants dosed twice
      daily at levels of 10, 20 and 35mg for 10 days.This part of the study will recruit 3 groups
      of 8 participants each.

      Part 2 is a cross-over study to assess the effects of food on the PK of UE2343 in healthy
      participants dosed with two single doses at a level decided from Part 1. This part of the
      study will recruit a total of 12 participants.

      Part 3 seeks to determine the PK of the UE2343 in CSF of healthy participants dosed twice
      daily for 4 days with a dose level determined from Part 1 and 2. This part of the study will
      recruit 4 participants.

      Strategies to ensure adherence to the study include the requirement that participants remain
      at the clinical research facility for the duration of their participation in the study; drug
      accountability checks (i.e. reconciliation of used and unused capsules) by an independent
      clinical research associate; and administration of the capsules to the participant by a
      member of the study site team.
