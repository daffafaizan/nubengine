      post-vaccinal viremia was assessed at Visit 2 from a subset of toddlers. The dengue
      immunogenicity was assessed 28 days after CYD dengue dose 2 and dose 3 from a subset of
      toddlers. Participants were followed-up for safety after each vaccine dose and for 6 months
      after the last dengue vaccination.
