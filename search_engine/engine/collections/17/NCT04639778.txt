      increased threefold between 2001 and 2015, from 16,000 to 50,000 per year. This rapid
      development is explained by the well-demonstrated benefits of surgery: spectacular
      improvement in the quality of life, reduction in co-morbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular
      diseases, and steatohepatitis), and significant reduction in mortality linked to severe
      obesity. However, the benefits of surgery may decrease over time and may be associated with
      side effects.

      Current guideline recommend yearly multidisciplinary postoperative follow-up after bariatric
      surgery. However, practices remain very heterogeneous, and only a fraction of patients are
      still follow-up beyond two years after the operation. The current recommendations therefore
      do not seem adapted to clinical reality. They do not prevent the regain of weight in many
      patients, which frequently leads to re-operations. Even more worrying is the possible
      occurrence of late complications, sometimes serious and life-threatening.

      This study will assess a new care pathway in which the patients are follow-up according to
      weight evolution measured by the patient using a connected scale.
