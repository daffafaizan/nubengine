      old. The principal investigator will recruit participants through contact with different
      sports clubs in Portugal. Athletes who demonstrate interest will go through a Screening
      interview (previously authorized by your legal guardian) by a licensed psychologist that aims
      explain the structure and arms of the investigation, to collect demographic data, and whether
      the athlete meets the inclusion criteria for the study. Athletes who meet the inclusion
      criteria and demonstrate interest in participating in the study, will sign an informed
      consent.

      All ethical requirements for research with humans are guaranteed. Afterwards, participants
      will be randomized in two groups (experimental and control group). Additionally, the
      experimental group will enroll in the PLAYwithHEART programme, also provided by a licensed
      psychologist and a co-therapist.

      Both groups will concurrently complete a protocol of self-report measures (to measure: a)
      psychological processes; b) quality of life and sports anxiety. These assessments will occur
      in three different times: before the start of the PLAYwithHEART programme (M0), after the
      final session of the programme (M1), and 6 months after that (M3).
