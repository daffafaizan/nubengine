      and fetal adverse outcomes. Mothers are at increased risk of preeclampsia, polyhydramnios,
      and caesarean sections. Infants of mothers with diabetes have increased rates of congenital
      anomalies, premature delivery, macrosomia, stillbirth and NICU admissions. Macrosomia itself
      is associated with numerous adverse fetal outcomes including shoulder dystocia, birth injury,
      neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome and NICU admissions,
      asphyxia and death. Postprandial blood sugars in particular have been associated with
      increased macrosomia rates.

      Numerous studies have shown that pregnancy outcomes can be reduced with improved glycemic
      control. In particular, pre-pregnancy care has been shown to assist women improve glucose
      control during the crucial period of organogenesis, and is associated with reduced rates of
      adverse pregnancy outcome including major congenital malformation, stillbirth and neonatal
      death.

      Technological advances aimed at reducing glycemic excursions and improving glucose control in
      patients with diabetes include the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. We hypothesize
      that real-time CGM will assist women with type 1 diabetes to improve their glycemic control
      before and during pregnancy.
