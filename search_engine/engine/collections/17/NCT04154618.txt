    
      This study is conducted for the purposes of understanding the feasibility and acceptability
      of routine wireless continuous monitoring on healthy newborns as a standard practice & its
      effect on existing workflows and as a future tool for the early detection of undiagnosed
      problems. All infants will receive routine newborn nursing care .

      Once alarm limits have been determined, the monitoring data will be analyzed in real time and
      out of range vital signs will alert the nurse to perform standard assessment of the newborn.

      Nurse and parents will complete surveys regarding their experience with continuous vital sign
      monitoring.
