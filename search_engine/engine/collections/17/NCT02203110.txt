    
      Basic demographic data of the patients (age, gender), data on concomitant diseases and
      epidemiological circumstances will be collected

      Severity of illness will be assessed by APACHE II (at day 1) and SOFA (at day 1,2,3 and 7)
      scoring system

      Following laboratory tests will be performed at day 1, 2,3 and 7.:

        -  blood count analysis

        -  differential blood count

        -  C- reactive protein, procalcitonin

        -  glucose, urea, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, creatinine, bilirubin, protein,
           albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase,
           gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase , alpha-amylase, lipase, creatine kinase, lactate
           dehydrogenase, myoglobin

        -  arterial blood gas analysis

        -  tests of hemostasis.

      Additional 2 mL of blood will be taken at day 1 and day 21 (or later), due to paired
      serologic testing

      To establish the presence of potential pathogens we will perform following microbiological
      investigations:

        -  cultivation of 2 pairs of blood cultures in all patients

        -  cultivation of sputum or quantitative cultivation of tracheal aspirate in nonintubated
           patients

        -  quantitative cultivation of tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated
           patients

        -  testing the presence of soluble Legionella antigen in urine in all patients

        -  testing the presence of genetic material of respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza
           B, respiratory syncytial virus , adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus,
           parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus) by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
           nasopharyngeal swabs in all patients, in the tracheal aspirate in nonintubated patients
           and in tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in intubated patients

        -  testing the presence of mycoplasmal, legionella and chlamydial DNA by qualitative PCR in
           nasopharyngeal smears in all patients, in the tracheal aspirate in nonintubated patients
           and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or in tracheal aspirate in intubated patients
