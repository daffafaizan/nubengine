      with the higher corneal astigmatism (study eye) was assigned to Cohort 1 and received the
      HARMONI® Modular Intraocular Lens System with a toric optic. The fellow eye was assigned to
      Cohort 2 and received the HARMONI® Modular Intraocular Lens System with a non-toric optic
      during primary implantation, which was replaced with the appropriate optic power (toric or
      non-toric) during an intraoperative exchange (IOE) procedure. A total of 7 study visits were
      planned, including a preoperative visit, operative visits for each eye, and 4 follow-up
      visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperative. The total duration of
      participation for each subject was up to 6 months, which included a Day -90 to Day -0
      preoperative period.
