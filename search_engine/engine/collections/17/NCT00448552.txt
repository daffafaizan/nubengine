      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with chemotherapy na√Øve relapsed or
           metastatic head and neck cancer treated with oxaliplatin and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the one-year survival and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 2-15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
