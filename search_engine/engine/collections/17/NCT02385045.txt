      histological samples to make a diagnosis in order to reduce complication rates, cost and
      time. There are a number of imaging techniques which promise to improve our diagnostic rates
      for pathology, but there have been few comparative studies.

      This is randomized controlled parallel trial in a 1:1 ratio with examination of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract with WLE followed by either NBI or iscan.

      Patients attending the department for routine examinations for dyspepsia and abdominal pain
      will be randomised into 2 study arms (1WLE and NBI, and the other - WLE and iscan).

      The investigator carrying out the procedure will be blinded to the indication for the
      procedure until a full examination with both white light endoscopy and either NBI or iscan
      has been used as this could lead to bias. They will determine if H pylori is present, and if
      so the severity of infection with WLE and again with either NBI or iscan depending on their
      study arm. Histopathological confirmation of H pylori and an assessment to the degree of
      infection will be assessed with samples taken using the updated Sydney system (5 gastric
      samples from different parts of the stomach).

      The endoscopists reviewing the images will be blinded to all patient information and
      indications throughout the study period. Questionnaires will then be given to the
      endoscopists to determine what endoscopic features led them to their diagnosis.
