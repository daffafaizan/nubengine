      for ovarian cancer, or who have an ovarian mass possibly suggestive of a malignancy and are
      counseled to undergo oophorectomy. Patients will be identified by the GYN physicians and
      consented by the study coordinator prior to the date of the scheduled surgical procedure.

      In exploratory objectives, the investigators will consent patients who are at risk for
      ovarian cancer and wish to be followed within one or two years before making decision to
      undergo prophylactic oophorectomy. Patients will be identified based on the eligibility
      criteria by the physicians and consented by the study coordinator prior to the follow up
      studies.
