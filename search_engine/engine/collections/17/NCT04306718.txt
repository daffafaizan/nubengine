      the potential to contribute to development of epiretinal membranes (ERM) in presence of
      vitreoschisis. For macular holes, hyalocytes located on the ILM are hypothesized to
      contribute to the closure of the macular hole after application of the inverted ILM flap
      technique.

      ILM is routinely excised during surgical repair of macular holes. During peeling of ERM it is
      excised in case of persisting wrinkling of the retinal surface or partial en bloc excision
      with the ERM. Furthermore, excision of ILM during ERM peeling is associated with
      significantly lower recurrence rates of ERM and better Long term visual acuity, according to
      the results reported by Chang et al. Removal of ERM and ILM is part of the surgical routine
      during surgical repair of macular holes and peeling of epiretinal membranes. Therefore,
      cultivation of excised ERM and ILM samples does not increase risks for patients in any way.
      During study it is planned to cultivate hyalocytes for investigation of their role in macular
      hole closure.
