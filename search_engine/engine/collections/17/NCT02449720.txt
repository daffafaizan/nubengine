    
      The purpose of this randomised controlled blinded trial is to determine the effectiveness in
      every day practice of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA) infusion on postoperative
      recovery following bowel resection in an optimised Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      setting.

      The investigators hypothesise that, in an optimised ERAS setting, intraperitoneal
      instillation and infusion of the local anaesthetic ropivacaine to the site of maximal
      visceral dissection for 48 hrs will result in an improved functional postoperative recovery
      following both open and laparoscopic bowel surgery.

      This research will provide evidence to allow recommendation on the routine inclusion of IPLA
      into the multimodal analgesia component of ERAS programs for bowel surgery.
