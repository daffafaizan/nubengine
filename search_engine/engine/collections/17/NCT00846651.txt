      low blood pressure may result in nausea, vomiting dizziness and impairment of uterine blood
      flow.The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for preventing low blood pressure
      associated with spinal anesthesia during Cesarean sections. In both methods, we will attempt
      to prevent low blood pressure using phenylephrine infusion that has been shown to be
      effective in recent research. In addition to receiving phenylephrine one group of patients
      will receive standard salt solution (Ringer's lactate solution), while the other group will
      receive a different, intravenous fluid called hydroxyethylstarch.
