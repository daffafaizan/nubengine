    
      Primary Objective:The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the toxicity and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib when added to a standard BEAM
      (carmustine (BCNU), etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) conditioning regimen followed by
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

      Secondary Objective: The secondary objective of the study is to obtain a preliminary estimate
      of the overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival
      (OS) with this regimen.

      Enrolled subjects will receive bortezomib in combination with BEAM (carmustine (BCNU),
      etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (AHSCT). Phase I treatment will administer bortezomib in four dose cohorts,in addition to the
      BEAM and ASCT. Three patients will be accrued in each dose cohort with enrollment starting at
      dose cohort. These subjects will be evaluated to establish the maximum tolerated dose of
      bortezomib in combination with BEAM autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
      Once established, the maximum tolerated dose will be utilized in treating an additional 20
      subjects.

      Follow-Up: Data collected will be utilized to obtain a preliminary estimate of the overall
      response rate, progressions free survival and overall survival using this regimen.
