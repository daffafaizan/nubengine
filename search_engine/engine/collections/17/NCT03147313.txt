      Defocused low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has gained acceptance as a
      therapeutic tool in different medical settings. It has been shown, that shock waves stimulate
      of the metabolic activity of different cell type, including osteoblasts, tenocytes,
      endothelial cells and chondrocytes. Furthermore, it has proved effective in clinical
      applications relating to bone and wound healing and myocardial ischaemia. Until now, no
      studies have been performed regarding the effects of ESWT on regeneration of peripheral nerve
      injuries in humans.
