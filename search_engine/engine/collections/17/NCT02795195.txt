    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with the fraction size of 3 GyE in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 54GyE
      (3GyE/daily fraction) to potentially 63GyE (3GyE/daily fraction) to evaluate the maximal
      tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4
      months after the completion of CIRT. The classic 3+3 method is used for the phase I dose
      escalating part of the trial and approximately 4-18 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD
      for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to
      patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II
      part of the trial will be a single phase single arm study.
