      study in cancer subjects requiring treatment with background opioids for pain due to bone
      metastasis.

      Approximately 144 subjects will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio
      (approximately 72 subjects per group). Subjects will receive a total of 3 subcutaneous
      injections, separated by 8 weeks in addition to background opioids administered throughout
      the study.

      Treatment groups will include: 1. Placebo SC (matching tanezumab SC) in addition to
      background opioid therapy. 2. Tanezumab 20 mg SC in addition to background opioid therapy.

      The study consists of three periods: Pre-Treatment (up to 37 days), Double-Blind Treatment
      (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks).
