    
      Patients referred for exercise oximetry have buttocks thighs and calves recording during
      exercise and in the recovery period for a minimum of 10 minutes.

      For each limb probe the decrease from rest of oxygen pressure (DROP) index is calculated as a
      subtraction of chest changes from limb changes throughout rest, exercise and recovery. DROP
      was measured as a routine on buttocks, thighs and calves and a minimal DROP lower than minus
      15 mmHg considered indicative of the presence of regional blood flow impairment (ischemia) in
      the considered area.

      Recordings and patients characteristics are recorded on a institutionally validated database.

      A comparison will be performed of symptoms by history to symptoms reported on treadmill and
      hemodynamic results attained through DROP values.

      Re-analysis of the recordings after ethical approval will be performed in an aim at
      estimating the duration of 50% and 90% recovery of DROP at the different levels (buttocks
      tigh and calves) to account for hemodynamic impairmenty not only at the calf (calves) level.
