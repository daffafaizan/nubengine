      and we will monitor its impact on CVI symptoms, features, and consequences (item) of the
      disease listed below: limb edema, walking, daily tasks performance, pain/burning symptoms,
      pruritus/paresthesis, sensation of heaviness/fatigue, time wasted in the management of the
      disease, social burden, disease impact on self-confidence, and its impact on physical
      exercise/recreational activities. Results of related clinical trials were published before
      showing that this is an active field in clinical reasearch.
