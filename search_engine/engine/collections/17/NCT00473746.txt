    
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of
      what a drug does to the body), and anti-tumor activities of abiraterone acetate (also known
      as CB7630) in patients with HRPC. The study will be conducted in 2 phases (Phase 1 and Phase
      2). In the first part of the study (Phase 1), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of abiraterone
      acetate will be determined for use in the second part of the study (Phase 2) where the number
      of patients who achieve at least a 50% decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) during
      treatment with abiraterone acetate will be assessed (MTD from Phase 1). Abiraterone acetate
      will be taken orally (by mouth) in fed and fasted patients once daily. Doses of abiraterone
      acetate (starting at 250 mg up to a maximum of 2000 mg) will be taken for 28-day treatment
      periods to determine the MTD. Patients will take MTD of abiraterone acetate for up to twelve
      28 day cycles (12 months; patients will be given the option of staying on abiraterone acetate
      treatment if they are deriving benefit). In Phase 2, prednisone or dexamethasone will be
      administered concurrently with abiraterone acetate. Serial pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
