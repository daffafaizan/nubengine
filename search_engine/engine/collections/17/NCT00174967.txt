      progressive disease characterized by joint and bone destruction from tophaceous deposits and
      renal impairment due to gouty nephropathy. Hyperuricemia, defined as a serum urate
      concentration of >7.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), is the underlying metabolic
      aberration leading to urate crystal deposition in gout. Gout has several clinical
      presentations, including: recurrent acute attacks of inflammatory arthritis; deposition of
      monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in joints, bones and even parenchymal organs
      (tophaceous gout); renal impairment; and uric acid nephrolithiasis. As serum urate levels
      increase beyond >7.0 mg/dL, the risks for gouty arthritis or for renal calculi increase.

      Currently allopurinol is the only xanthine oxidase inhibitor available. Allopurinol is the
      agent of choice for reduction of serum urate levels in patients with: uric acid
      overproduction; unresponsive or intolerant to uricosuric agents; impaired renal function;
      uric acid urolithiasis; or tophi.

      Febuxostat (TMX-67) is a non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor being developed as
      an orally administered agent for management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.
