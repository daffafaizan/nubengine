      a 4% solution of Icodextrin has been tested as a possible agent of reducing adhesions by
      acting as a barrier between peritoneal surfaces. Some data support a reduction af adhesions
      (van den Tool et al., Brown et al.). However, is not known whether icodextrin reduces the
      need for surgery or hospitalisation for small bowel obstruction.This study aims to study
      these parameters as well as complications and survival.

      Patients with colorectal cancer and scheduled for surgery with curative intent will be (after
      patients acceptance) randomized to have icodextrin 4% instilled in the abdominal cavity or
      not. Patients allocated to icodextrin arm will have 100 ml of icodextrin 4% instilled every
      30 minutes during surgery and at end of operation further 1000 ml instilled in the abdominal
      cavity. Postoperative care is performed according to each hospital praxis.

      Follow-up data will be collected from the Swedish National Colorectal cancer registry. Data
      30 days postoperatively will be analysed for early small bowel obstruction and other early
      complications. The study ends 5 years postoperatively with analysis of surgery and
      hospitalization for small bowel obstruction as well as survival and longterm complications.

      A safety analysis is planned after the first 300 randomized patients with respect to early
      (30 days) complications. These data will analysed blindly by external reviewers.

      Randomization (1:1) will be performed at the Regional Cancer Centrum in the Uppsala-Ã–rebro
      region. The study aims to randomise 1800 patients.
