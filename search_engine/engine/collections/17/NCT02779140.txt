    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled dose escalation trial to
      evaluate NTM-1632 in three dose cohorts (A: 0.033 mg/kg, B: 0.165 mg/kg, and C: 0.33 mg/kg).
      NTM-1632 is a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies designed to treat botulinum neurotoxin
      BoNT/B poisoning in adults. Dose cohorts A, B, and C will be randomized 2:6,
      placebo:therapeutic, with a total study population of 24. The study duration is projected to
      be approximately 8 months, with subject participation in cohort A being approximately 13
      weeks, and subject participation in cohort B and C being approximately 17weeks. The primary
      objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      NTM-1632 administered intravenously in healthy adults. The secondary objectives are to 1)
      assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NTM-1632 following a single intravenous
      administration and 2) assess the immunogenicity of NTM-1632 following a single intravenous
      administration.
