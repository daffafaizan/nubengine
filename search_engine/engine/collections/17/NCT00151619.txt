      digoxin and a diuretic has shown benefits on morbidity and mortality. However, 40% of these
      patients have persistant symptoms. The rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in
      patients with chronic heart failure lies in their vasodilating action, antiischemic effect,
      ability to reduce left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The objective of our study is to
      evaluate the regional and systemic hemodynamic, hormonal and vascular effects and the
      tolerance to stress test of a 3-months treatment with amlodipine. Patients with stable
      chronic heart failure (III/IV NYHA) and treated with a combination of enalapril, furosemide
      and digoxin will be randomized to receive amlodipine 5 or 10 mg or a placebo for a 3-months
      period.
