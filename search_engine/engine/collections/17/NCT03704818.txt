      effect on the amount of glucagon (a hormone produced by the pancreas and stomach that
      stimulates liver glucose production) produced by the body and if that change will improve
      recovery time from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in participants with Type 1 Diabetes. The
      study is a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design, where participants will receive
      dapagliflozin during one treatment period and placebo during a separate treatment period with
      neither the study team nor participants knowing what they are receiving at any given time.
      Participants will have 9 clinic visits over the course of 14-16 weeks, with 3 of those visits
      being overnight stays. The overnight stays are intended to control blood sugars in a normal
      state throughout the night and then participants will complete a hypoglycemic challenge the
      following morning. The body's response to the hypoglycemic challenge will provide the
      information needed to determine if dapagliflozin had an effect on recovery time from
      hypoglycemia.
