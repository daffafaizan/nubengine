    
      The purpose of this research is to study how red blood cells (RBCs) survive in a person's
      circulation, and how that survival may be different in red blood cells that are donated and
      stored prior to being transfused.

      In this study, blood is collected from healthy subjects, processed into packed red blood cell
      units, and either immediately afterwards or 40-42 days later the packed red blood cells are
      labeled with biotin. The biotin-labeled red blood cells are then re-infused back to the donor
      (autologous transfusion). Blood samples are then taken from the subject every week for up to
      70 days (10 weeks) to track survival of the labeled red blood cells.

      This study also seeks to demonstrate that biotin-labeled RBCs can be safely transfused back
      to autologous subjects without any adverse reactions. All participants will be followed to
      watch for the development of antibodies against biotin-labeled RBCs.
