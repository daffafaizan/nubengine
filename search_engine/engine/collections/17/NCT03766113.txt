      real-time information about the participant brain function NF approaches in stroke are
      usually based on real-time monitoring of brain activity using EEG-NF and involve chronic
      stroke. Recent studies have revealed the potential of combining EEG and fMRI to achieve a
      more efficient and specific self-regulation, which may be critical in clinical applications.

      The aim of this study is to optimize the neurofeedback method coupling EEG and fMRI in
      healthy subjects then to evaluate the effect of an EEG-NF and a neurofeedback coupling EEG
      and fMRI versus motor imagery on recovery in the early and chronic stage after stroke.
