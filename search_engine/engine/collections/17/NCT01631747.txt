    
      A Randomized Control Trial is planned among ethnically diverse OW/OB pregnant women ages
      18-45 years to be randomly assigned to the MOMFIT Active Intervention Group (AIG) or the
      Educational Control Group (ECG) plus standard obstetrical care. The Dietary Approaches to
      Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, along with moderate physical activity and group intervention
      as utilized in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), will be adapted for pregnant and
      postpartum women through individual visits to tailor calorie/nutrient/activity goals, plus
      group coaching sessions and electronic self-monitoring behavior. Evidence based motivational
      interviewing and state of the art self-monitoring tools involving the LoseIt app will be
      adapted for pregnant/postpartum women via smartphone or Internet access, along with tailored
      feedback and encouragement from the Lifestyle Coach. Prevention of excessive GWG and
      achievement of the Institute Of Medicine (IOM) weight gain goals will be compared between
      groups, whether ongoing adherence to the lifestyle interventions can be sustained through
      postpartum intervention. Approximately one third of the participants are expected to be
      minorities and/or from low income backgrounds. The primary outcome is gestational weight gain
      from baseline (self-reported prepregnancy weight) to near delivery (36 weeks) compared with
      IOM goals in both groups and postpartum weight retention between 6 weeks and 12 months
      postpartum. Additional outcome variables include changes in maternal Body Mass Index (BMI)
      and adiposity postpartum, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),
      C-reactive Protein (CRP), and lipids, diet quality, and physical activity levels, offspring
      adiposity and anthropometrics, and glucose and C-peptide in cord blood
