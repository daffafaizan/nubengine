    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (sham filtration) 3-way crossover trial
      comparing the effectiveness of two strategies (bedroom-only portable indoor air filtration
      units [AFUs] use vs. 2-room AFU use) to reduce personal PM2.5 exposures and improve
      cardiometabolic health. The health benefits (primary outcome: resting BP) of both active AFU
      strategies will be evaluated over acute (4-day) and long-term (4-week) periods in 50
      nonsmoking elderly adults living in a senior facility impacted by near-roadway pollutants.
