      a naturally occurring homolog of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) in children and young
      adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). CBDV has effects independent of CB1 and CB2 receptor
      activation and a good safety profile. This proposal addresses the Foundation for Prader Willi
      Research's five year PWS Research Plan: Program 1, Clinical Care Research: seeks to evaluate
      treatments that aim to reduce behavioral symptoms, such as irritability, in order to improve
      the quality of life of both the individual with PWS and their families. GW Pharmaceuticals
      will provide the CBDV drug and matching placebo and additional funding to the site.
