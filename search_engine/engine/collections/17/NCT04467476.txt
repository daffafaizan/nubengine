    
      In this study, a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design
      will be used. The 50 participants will be randomized into two groups: (1) Anodal tDCS(real)
      and (2) Sham tDCS. A single session of anodal and sham tDCS will be performed on each task
      (pre and post-jump test).

      All evaluations will be performed by a single researcher who, like the participants, will not
      know which stimulation group will be participating. Subjects who agree to the conditions and
      sign the consent form may participate in the study. Participants who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be included in the study.
