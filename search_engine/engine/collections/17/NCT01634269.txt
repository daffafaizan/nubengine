    
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the MDT-2111 TAV
      system in subjects with small annuli and symptomatic severe AS deemed difficult for surgical
      intervention. The primary endpoint is a composite of functional effectiveness as measured by
      improvement of at least 1 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class from baseline to 6 months
      and anatomical effectiveness as measured by Effective Orifice Area (EOA) ≥1.0 cm² at 6
      months.
