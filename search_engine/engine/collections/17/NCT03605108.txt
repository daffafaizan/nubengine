      such as acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis. Previous studies have shown that oral
      probiotics may be beneficial for skin disesaes such as atopic dermatitis and acne, but a
      mechanism for how the gut communicates to the skin remains elusive.

      The balance between short chain fatty acids and long chain fatty acids has been proposed as
      one factor in how bacteria in the gut are able to communicate with the rest of the body.
      Studies in Dr. Sivamani's lab have shown that subjects with acne have a reduced level of
      short chain fatty acids in their blood when compared to age-matched control (unpublished).

      The aim of this study is to understand how oral probiotics may alter the gut microbiome and
      if they can augment the short chain fatty acids in the blood lipidome. Ultimately, the
      investigator's goal is to find suitable alternatives for the use of antibiotics in the
      treatment of chronic skin conditions so that the amount of antibiotics that are in use can be
      reduced.
