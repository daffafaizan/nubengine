      of obesity. Increases of physical activity and modifications of eating behaviors are
      first-line interventions which, however, are not easily implemented, and lack of time to
      exercise and difficulties in coping with different diets are common reasons for failure.
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a "faster" alternative to moderate-intensity
      continuous training (CT). Conversely, intermittent fasting is also an alternative to more
      complex diets, as it restricts caloric intake to a specified period of time without major
      diet composition changes. The combination of HIIT and fasting may therefore provide
      incremental benefits.

      Sedentary women aged ≥ 30 years and ≤50 years, with body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 and
      cardiometabolic risk factors, will be randomized to HIIT performed in the fasting state, HIIT
      performed in the fed state, CT in the fasting state or CT in the fed state. Cardiometabolic
      parameters, anthropometric indices, cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life and
      microvascular function (cutaneous capillary density and microvascular reactivity evaluated by
      laser speckle contrast imaging) will be evaluated before the initiation of the interventions
      and 4 weeks thereafter.
