      biomechanical and densitometric bone characteristics in patients with longstanding type 1
      diabetes and age- and sex-matches controls. The investigators examine whether the presence of
      microvascular disease and/or poor diabetic control is associated with an altered bone
      microarchitecture and whether any such effect is independent of bone mineral density.
      Furthermore, the investigators aim to look into the relationship between an altered bone
      microarchitecture and advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation as well as biochemical
      markers of bone formation and bone turnover. The study aims to identify type 1 diabetic
      patients with high fracture risk by assessing the discriminatory power of parameters of
      cortical and trabecular microstructure measured via high resolution peripheral quantitative
      computed tomography (HR-pQCT) of the distal radius and tibia and high resolution quantitative
      computed tomography (HR-QCT) of the proximal femur and tibia with and without adjustment for
      bone density.
