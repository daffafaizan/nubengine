    
      This is an open label, prospective, randomised, multicentre, controlled, clinical study
      comparing EVARREST to SURGICEL (oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)) (Control) as an adjunct
      to haemostasis when conventional methods of controlling mild or moderate bleeding are
      ineffective or impractical during surgery in paediatric patients.

      At least 40 qualified paediatric subjects with an appropriate mild or moderate bleeding
      Target Bleeding Site (TBS) will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either EVARREST or
      SURGICEL (control). Absolute time to haemostasis will be assessed as well as haemostasis at 4
      and 10 minutes from randomisation.

      Enrolment will be staggered by age (as required by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
      Paediatric Committee). The first 36 subjects enrolled will be aged ≥1 years to <18 years of
      age. Enrolment of a subsequent group will include 4 subjects from 1 month (≥ 28 days from
      birth) to <1 year of age will follow. Ongoing safety assessment will ensure adequate safety
      monitoring occur during the staged enrolment.

      Subjects will be followed post-operatively through hospital discharge and at 30 days (+/-14
      days) post-surgery.
