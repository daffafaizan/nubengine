    
      Patients with suspected primary breast cancer on mammography and clinical examination will be
      assessed for eligibility by having a needle core biopsy to confirm invasive carcinoma.

      A fresh unfixed tumor specimen, incisional or core biopsy will be sent to Agendia to
      determine the MammaPrint risk profile, the BluePrint molecular subtyping profile, the
      TargetPrint ER, PR and HER2 single gene readout, the 56-geneTheraPrint Research Gene Panel
      and the additional genes as measured on the whole genome (44k) array.

      Surgical Protocol:

        1. Determination of nodal status:

             -  For clinically node-negative patients: Axillary ultra sound, followed by Sentinel
                Lymph Node (SLN) biopsy

             -  For clinically node-positive patients: ultra sound-guided Fine Needle Aspirate
                (FNA), followed by core biopsy

        2. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy

        3. Definitive surgery:

             -  For node-positive patients: lumpectomy, repeat SLN biopsy, Axillary Lymph Node
                Dissection (ALND)

             -  For node-negative patients: lumpectomy, repeat SLN biopsy (optional), no ALND

      Response will be measured by pathological Complete Response (pCR) and by centrally assessed
      Residual Cancer Burden (RCB).
