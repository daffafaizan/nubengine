    
      To characterise the safety and tolerability of NG-641 in patients with metastatic or advanced
      epithelial tumours.

      The Phase Ia part of the study is a dose escalation and dose expansion phase investigating
      NG-641 administration by intratumorural injection (IT) and intravenous (IV) infusion in a
      range of tumour types

      The Phase Ib part of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of NG-641 as monotherapy
      or in combination with chemotherapy agents and/or checkpoint inhibitors in separate efficacy
      cohorts of patients with specific epithelial tumour types.
