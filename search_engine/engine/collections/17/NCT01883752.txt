      respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter waveform amplitude by volume loading has
      potential to decrease postoperative morbidity and length of stay in the hospital in patients
      undergoing routine, moderate-risk elective surgery.

      In this study the investigators will test the impact of hemodynamic optimization based on the
      respiratory variations in the plethysmographic waveform amplitude to decrease postoperative
      morbidity and length of stay in the hospital in patients undergoing routine, moderate-risk
      elective surgery. The primary outcome variable is the incidence of postoperative
      complications. Secondary outcome variables are the duration of hospital and ICU stays,
      postoperative mortality, and cost of surgery.
