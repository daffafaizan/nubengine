      with advanced proximal gastric cancer. Although lymph nodes dissection along with the splenic
      hilum (No.10) is recommended by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines, however,
      complete removal of the No. 10 is technically challenging due to the tortuous splenic vessels
      and the high possibility of injury to the parenchyma of the spleen and pancreas. Recently,
      the application of minimally invasive surgery for advanced gastric cancer is gaining
      popularity. However, laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) with standard D2 lymphadenectomy
      was still not widely performed, because pancreas- and spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph
      node dissection were mainly challenging manipulations for laparoscopic surgeons.
      Therefore,the investigators aim to investigate the safety and feasibility of LTG with
      spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph node dissection for proximal advanced gastric cancer
      and compare the early results of this procedure with open total gastrectomy (OTG).
