      men of reproductive age. Significant evidence exists that they may be harmful for paternal
      fertility potential in both animal and human studies. However, high quality data is lacking,
      particularly among commonly used SSRI's such as escitalopram. As such, it is important to
      properly evaluate the potential effect of escitalopram in a randomized placebo controlled
      fashion. Results will be important in guiding urologists, psychiatrists and family
      practitioners regarding discussion surrounding SSRI use in their patients interested in
      fertility.
