      Acthar to myositis patients to determine what specific characteristics each patient has based
      on biopsy analysis, laboratory results, and clinical exams. Through biopsy analysis,
      subcategories of IIM will be determined and could illustrate which of these IIMs may be more
      responsive to Acthar therapy.
