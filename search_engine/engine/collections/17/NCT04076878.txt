      stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and in cerebral palsy and is associated with
      increased impairments and disabilities. Spasticity may be associated with pain and
      contractures, caused by muscle weakness, reduced muscle length and volume that add to the
      disability.Treatments of spasticity comprise physical therapy, pharmacological agents and
      surgical treatment. Recently, a systematic review concluded that transcutaneous, electric
      nerve stimulation may have beneficial effects on spasticity and activity performance after
      stroke, which lends support to the new treatment method Mollii, which will be evaluated in
      this study.The Mollii method has been developed by Inervetions, which is a small Swedish
      med-tech company, and represents an innovative approach for non-invasive electro-stimulation
      to reduce spasticity and improve motor function. The theoretical background of this treatment
      method primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from
      a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of
      Mollii aims at stimulating a muscle, e.g. the anterior tibial muscle of the lower leg in
      order to reduce reflex mediated over-activity, i.e. spasticity, in calf muscles by inducing
      reciprocal inhibition.
