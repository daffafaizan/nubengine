      home hemodialysis (HD) patients. We have developed a recycling system using 25-30 l dialysate
      per dialysis. In vitro investigations show that this results in adequate dialysis.

      12 HD patients will be studied during two dialysis sessions. The first HD will be a
      conventional 4 hour dialysis, using single pass dialysate. The second will be an 8-hour HD
      using multipass (recycled) dialysate 25-30 l. Clearance of urea, creatinine, phosphate and
      cobalamin will be measured both in the patient and the dialysate. Patient symptoms will be
      recorded.
