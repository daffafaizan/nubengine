      within the patient's eye socket. A poor fitting ocular prosthesis will lead to poor motility,
      patient discomfort and increased mucus discharge, and can risk the integrity of the anterior
      surface of the implanted orbit. Currently the method to determine best fit of the ocular
      prosthesis is dependent upon the ocularist's skill in adding or subtracting material from the
      wax model that is replicated from an initial alginate impression of the patient's eye socket.

      The proposal of this study is to utilise digital imaging to capture images to measure the
      motility of both the orbital implant and the ocular prosthesis. Two methods will be compared:
      excursion measurements on a photograph using digital software (Image J) versus use of a smart
      phone app (an iOS app known as mediGrid (IRISS Medical Technologies, UK; CE Marked, HIPAA
      compliant). This study will evaluate the degree of translational movement loss from orbital
      implant to ocular prosthesis and analysis will include comparisons between hydroxyapatite and
      acrylic implants and in patients without an orbital implant, also known as post-enucleation
      socket syndrome (PESS). A part of this study will also evaluate the accuracy of the two
      softwares Image J as well as the mediGrid smartphone app in measuring prosthesis motility by
      comparing it to the ruler as a "gold" standard.
