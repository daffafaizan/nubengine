      ventricular dysfunction. While significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic
      basis of cardiomyopathy in adults, molecular diagnosis in children has proven more
      challenging and current algorithms do not incorporate mutation analysis in the clinical
      protocol. However, recent studies indicate that cardiomyopathy outcomes in children are
      origin specific, highlighting the importance of precise diagnosis. The goal of this study is
      to identify the genetic causes of pediatric cardiomyopathy. Rapid, comprehensive and
      cost-effective detection of genetic causes of cardiomyopathy will aid management and
      development of novel treatment strategies.
