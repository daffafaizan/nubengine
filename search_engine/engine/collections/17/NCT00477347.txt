      hypothesized that BIS can also indicate the adequacy of analgesia. Therefore we built a
      combined closed-loop anesthesia system using BIS as control variable and two
      proportional-differential control algorithms, a propofol and a remifentanil target-controlled
      infusion system. The effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia system has been
      demonstrated in a prospective, randomized study.

      Elimination of anesthetic agents, propofol in particular, is strongly reduced during liver
      transplantation. Closed-loop anesthesia could provide adequacy for requirements in respect to
      the various phases of transplantation. Two groups of patients are compared: one in which
      propofol and remifentanil are administered by the anesthesiologist, using target-controlled
      infusion systems, and one in which propofol and remifentanil are administered automatically
      by the combined closed-loop anesthesia system. In both groups the goal is to maintain BIS
      between 40 and 60, the range recommended by the manufacturer during anesthesia. We expect the
      combined closed-loop anesthesia system group to do better: i.e. diminished consumption of
      propofol (primary outcome measure).
