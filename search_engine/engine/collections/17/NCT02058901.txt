      exhibit improved efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile. In the present phase I trial,
      we aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose of sunitinib when administered high-dose, once
      weekly or once every two weeks. Furthermore, by acquiring skin and tumor biopsies, we will
      assess intratumoral concentrations of sunitinib, correlate these to skin and plasma
      concentrations and gain more insight into the biological effects of the drug. Additionally,
      we aim to preliminary assess the efficacy of sunitinib administered at the MTD level in both
      schedules. Known serum angiogenesis markers will be correlated to efficacy endpoints.
