      of portal hypertension (PHT) is the main determinant of decompensation that appears when
      portal pressure gradient (PPG) is â‰¥10mmHg (clinically significant HTP). 40% of compensated
      cirrhotic patients have mild PHT. However, with progression of disease 41% develop clinically
      significant PHT. In cirrhosis, PHT results from increased resistance to blood flow, with a
      dynamic component due to decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. In advanced disease
      increased portal venous inflow also contributes to PHT. Beta-blockers have not been useful in
      compensated cirrhosis with mild PHT. In early cirrhosis, vasodilators may be more adequate.
      Statins, drugs that inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, induce selective hepatic
      vasodilation due to an enhanced bioavailability of NO. Acutely, they decreases hepatic
      resistance, while with long-term use statins decreases PPG without deleterious effects on
      systemic circulation. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study is
      aimed at assessing whether treatment with simvastatin may prevent progression of mild PHT
      (with PPG between 6 and 10 mmHg) to clinically significant PHT. Patients with compensated
      cirrhosis, without previous decompensation, without esophageal varices at risk and with PPG
      between 6 and 10 mmHg will be included. The calculated sample size is 80 patients and the
      duration of the study 4 years (2 years including and a follow-up of at least 2 year).
