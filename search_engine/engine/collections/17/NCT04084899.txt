    
      Rationale:

      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive closure of upper airways
      leading to apnoea (complete airflow cessation) or hypopnoea (airflow limitation > 50% + blood
      oxygen desaturation > 3% or airflow limitation > 30% blood oxygen desaturation > 4%). The
      prevalence of lung hyperinflations in sleep apnoea patients and effect of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is not known.

      Process:

      Subjects included in the study will be obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients diagnosed by
      respiratory polysomnography performed in the Sleep Laboratory, Department of Respiratory
      Medicine, University Hospital Olomouc.

      Bodypletysmography will be performed in the time of OSA diagnosis and after 3 months of CPAP
      therapy.

      Data will be statistically evaluated after completion of the target number of subjects.
