      anxiety. Using fMRI, the anxiolytic medication, lorazepam, has previously been found to
      decrease activation in these areas during the processing of emotional stimuli. This study
      aims to replicate those results but by using a different medication, alprazolam. An eventual
      aim of this study, in combination with future studies, is to evaluate the utility of fMRI as
      a tool to identify anxiolytic function in both established and novel compounds that may be
      used to treat anxiety.
