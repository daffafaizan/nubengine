      investigating an intravenous and an oral CY dosing schedule in combination with LEN and
      low-dose DEX in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. In phase I MTD of CY will be
      determined using a common dose escalation scheme with 3 to 6 patients per dose level. In
      phase II, efficacy and safety of the treatment regimens at the MTD will be investigated in 20
      patients.
