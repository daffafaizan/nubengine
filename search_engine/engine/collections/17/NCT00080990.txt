      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol when given in combination with
      oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine,
      preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the recommended phase II dose of flavopiridol
      when administered with this regimen in these patients.

      V. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. VI. Correlate
      p21, p53, and apoptotic markers with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of flavopiridol.

      Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours,
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours on days 1,
      15, and 29. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, the cohort is
      expanded and an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose.
