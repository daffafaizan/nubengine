      major degree when lower edge of placenta lies within 2 cm from internal os , and minor degree
      if lower edge of placenta at lower uterine segment but more than 2 cm from internal os .

      There are many risk factors for developing placenta previa including multi parity , multiple
      pregnancy , increased maternal age (>35y ) , previous uterine surgery , history of placenta
      previa (4-8%) .

      A significant degree of uterine contractility has been observed with symptomatic placenta
      previa. It is directly associated with vaginal bleeding. However, a large percentage of women
      who have placenta previa associated with haemorrhage will experience subclinical uterine
      contractions before the onset of overt vaginal bleeding. Therefore, the use of tocolytic
      agents in management of placenta previa seems reasonable .

      Magnesium sulfate alters calcium up take, binding and distribution in smooth muscles of the
      uterus, so reduces the frequency of cell depolarization and inhibits myometrial contraction .

      In addition to its tocolytic action magnesium sulfate also provide neuroprotection to preterm
      infant . .

      At women Health Hospital, Assiut University, Egypt our policy is using magnesium sulfate as
      first line for tocolysis for placenta previa patients with preterm uterine contractions. By
      giving a loading dose of 4 g on 150 ml saline intravenous infusion over 20 minutes, and a
      maintenance dose of 6g/6h on 500 ml saline slow intra venous infusion
