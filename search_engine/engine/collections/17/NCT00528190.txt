      Aspergillus Fumigatus will be effective at preventing respiratory exacerbations and improving
      pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) who are chronically
      colonized/infected with aspergillus. This aim will be accompanied by means of a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial incorporating two parallel treatment arms.
