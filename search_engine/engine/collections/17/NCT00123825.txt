      followed by a one week rest period (1 cycle is 3 weeks). On day one and eight of each cycle
      the patient will have a physical exam and blood work. During the first two cycles, additional
      blood work will be drawn on day 15 as well. Reassessment of the tumor will be performed at 6
      weeks, 12 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients will remain on treatment until
      further evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects occur.
