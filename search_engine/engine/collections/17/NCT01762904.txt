      preparation for surgery or insertion of intravascular catheters, thereby decreasing the
      incidence of infections. The preparation of the skin with antiseptics, helps mechanically
      clean the surface of the skin to be subjected to surgical intervention, removing fat, sweat,
      dead cells and kill bacteria that are in the skin. It has been shown that 2% chlorhexidine in
      solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol has greater activity than chlorhexidine in aqueous
      solution. The constant use of triclosan causes resistance of some microorganisms on some
      antibiotics.It has been shown that 0.5% of triclosan in 60% alcohol isopropyl chlorhexidine
      is more effective than alcohol. The aim of the study is to know if 2% chlorhexidine has more
      residual effect than triclosan 1%, both antiseptic diluted in 70% isopropyl alcohol.
