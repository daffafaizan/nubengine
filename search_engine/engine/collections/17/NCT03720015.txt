      frequent cause of death overall. Among non-pharmacological treatment, physical exercise has
      shown improvements in different types of cancer and patients, but it is important to define
      the optimal dose. Our aim is to determine the effects of a concurrent training program and a
      nutritional management developed during radiotherapy treatment on physical performance and
      body composition. A patient with an oral cavity cancer will develop three sessions per week
      of concurrent training: resistance training included 9 standard exercises involving major
      muscle groups (4x8-12 RM), and cardiovascular training included a High-Intensity Interval
      Training (HIIT). Nutritional management will include a diet controlling macronutrients
      (~4g/kg/day for carbohidrates, ~2g/kg/day for proteins, and ~1g/kg/day for fats), along with
      some nutritional supplements such as beta-hydroxybeta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine,
      glutamine, omega-3 fish oil concentrate, and BCAA's during training sessions. Intervention
      took place during radiotherapy period (7 weeks). We expect that body composition will remain
      invariable, and 1RM will increased. VO2max is expected to be almost the same, but intensity
      tolerated at maximum VO2max could be higher. If our results confirm that, we could conclude
      that a combination between resistance exercise and HIIT along with a nutritional management
      developed during radiotherapy could be effective to prevent muscle mass loss and muscle
      function decrease in a young patient with oral cavity cancer.
