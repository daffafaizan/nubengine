    
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor that usually has a poor
      prognosis. The combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed has recently become the standard of
      care in the first-line treatment of MPM. For patients who are unfit to receive a
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy, pemetrexed alone [7] or combined with carboplatin [8] has been
      proposed as an alternative treatment choice. The identification of molecular predictors of
      effective therapy is important for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless
      treatment in cancer patients.
