      population is asymptomatic carrier of gallbladder stones and among them, 35% will present a
      symptomatic form which will cause the indication of cholecystectomy. As a result, around
      120,000 cholecystectomies are performed per year in France, and around 750,000 in the United
      States for this indication. Cholecystectomy is therefore the most widely performed procedure
      in the world. However, in 3 to 20% of cases, common bile duct stones will be associated and
      to be treated. Different strategies are proposed: a treatment called "all surgical" or an
      endoscopic treatment (usually a sphincterotomy) before, after or during a cholecystectomy.
      The investigators defined two groups of patients: one group with success of fully
      laparoscopic surgical treatment (cholecystectomy and laparoscopic exploration of the common
      bile duct at the same time), and one group treated by laparoscopic cholecystectomy and
      management of the common bile duct stone(s) by an ERCP performed intra, per ou
      postoperatively. The primary outcome was the failure of surgical management, defined as the
      requirement of ERCP for extraction of common bile duct stones, which permit us to identify
      risk factors of failure in the fullfil surgical treatment process. The secondary outcome was
      to study the morbimortality in each group, and length of stay.
