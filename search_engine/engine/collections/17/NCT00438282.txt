      enrolled in a randomized trail that compared prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses
      versus paraprofessionals. Both groups of visitors in each study employed essentially the same
      program model. The program model has proven to be effective using nurses when focused on
      European-American and African Americans in earlier trails conducted over the past 20 years.
      Paraprofessional visitors in the current trail share many of the social characteristics of
      the families they visited. The current study also allows us to examine the extent to which
      these different visitor types produce effects with Mexican Americans that are similar to
      those achieved with European-Americans and African Americans in previous trails of this
      program using nurse home visitors. The sample is composed of low-income women who had no
      previous live births and who were substantially ethnic minorities (46 percent Mexican
      American, 16 percent African American, and 3 percent Native American/Asian), unmarried (87
      percent), and less than 19 years of age (58 percent) at the time of registration during
      pregnancy.

      In earlier phases of assessment, the nurse-visitor program was found to reduce women's use of
      tobacco during pregnancy; to improve the home environments and quality of care that mothers
      provided to their children; to improve the language and mental development of children born
      to mothers with low psychological resources (where psychological resources were defined as
      high rates of mental disorder symptoms, limited intellectual functioning, and little belief
      in their control over their life circumstances); and to improve maternal life-course, as
      reflected in fewer subsequent pregnancies and increases in employment. The paraprofessional
      program produced smaller, mostly non-significant and inconsistent effects while the program
      was in operation, but recent evidence from a 4-year follow up of the sample now suggests that
      paraprofessional program effects on parental caregiving and child development may be
      increasing as the children mature. The current proposal seeks support to determine whether
      the beneficial effects of the nurse home visiting program endure through the children's
      completion of kindergarten at age six, and whether beneficial effects emerge at this later
      time period for families visited by paraprofessionals.
