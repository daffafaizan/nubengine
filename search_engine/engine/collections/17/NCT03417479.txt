    
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury and surgical repair occurs in 200,000 active
      adolescent and young adult patients each year. ACL repair is associated with significant
      postoperative pain. Current methodologies for pain include regional nerve blocks, opioid or
      non-steroidal analgesia. Few studies have evaluated use of neuro-inhibitors such as
      gabapentin to limit pain response.

      The purpose of this study then is to examine the use of gabapentin in reducing postoperative
      pain in adolescent ACL patients. The investigators hypothesize one 15mg/kg (up to 600mg) dose
      of gabapentin preoperatively would reduce: 1) self-reported postoperative pain and, 2) opioid
      use compared to patients who do not receive preoperative gabapentin.

      This double blind randomized control trial will enroll 100 participants ages 12-18 years,
      undergoing ACL repair. Participants receive gabapentin or placebo preoperatively. Outcome
      measurements of self-reported pain score using scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worse
      obtained from the EMR and participant interviews with a phone nurse for five days
      postoperatively to determine severity of pain as well as use of opioids.

      Outcome measurements will give a more comprehensive description of the postoperative
      experience and test gabapentin's opioid sparing effect. Due to paucity of literature on pain
      relief in this population, this pilot study will inform a larger multi-site study.
