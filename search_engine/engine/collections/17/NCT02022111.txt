      synergistic benefits. Since diabetes patients in India tend to access specialists (government
      or private) for their diabetes and other health care needs, they at least have a point of
      contact with the health system which can be leveraged to also reduce depressive symptoms. The
      investigators aim to assess if interventions for depression can be integrated into routine
      diabetes care delivery with only modest modifications. The integrated multi-condition
      (depression and diabetes) intervention model merges experiences from TEAMCare and an ongoing
      trial of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in India (CARRS Trial) and involves: 1.
      enhancing the role of care coordinators and training them in disease management; 2.
      integrating 'intelligent' technology; and 3. weekly physician oversight to review
      poorly-controlled cases and make responsive treatment adjustments. The investigators propose
      to take this model from research to practice using an implementation sciences approach. The
      investigators will first gather formative qualitative data and endeavor to make the
      intervention more patient-centered, develop locally-understandable educational materials, and
      identify ways to overcome stigma of mental health disorders and facilitate trustful
      therapeutic relationships between care coordinators and patients and their families. The
      investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention
      model in a randomized controlled trial.
