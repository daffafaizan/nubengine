      heightened sensitivity to or abnormal processing of internal sensations, it has also been
      suggested that patients with tic and TS experience abnormal processing of external
      sensations/stimuli. While this sensitivity to external stimuli does not appear to trigger
      motor or vocal tics, it can significantly affect quality of life. These sensitivities can be
      a source of irritation, discomfort, and distraction that can be equally or more disruptive
      than vocal or motor tics. Heightened sensitivity to external stimuli or other abnormalities
      of external sensory processing have been identified in other neuropsychological disorders
      such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . TS often presents with co-morbid diagnoses including
      attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
      but it is not currently known whether sensitivity to external stimuli is due to a central
      processing abnormality common to these disorders.

      This study's objective is to use a variety of questionnaires to determine how external
      stimuli along with the presence of other disorders effect sensory processing.
