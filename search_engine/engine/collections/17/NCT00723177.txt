      to the affective and physiological aspects of withdrawal. Furthermore, cytokine release
      following opioid administration has been hypothesized to be a limiting factor in both the
      duration and magnitude of opioid-induced analgesia. The two primary goals of our study are to
      assess AV411's ability to 1) reduce the opioid-withdrawal syndrome and 2) increase and
      prolong the analgesic effects of the mu-opioid agonist, oxycodone. To explore whether AV411
      decreases opioid-induced glial cell activation, some participants assigned to the placebo and
      high dose AV411 groups (n = 6 for each dose condition) will be studied twice with
      [11C]PK11195, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer used to measure the peripheral
      benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the human brain. The PBR is a receptor located on the
      mitochondria of the microglia and can be used to examine microglial activation in various
      brain regions.
