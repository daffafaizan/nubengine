      Part A: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, single dose study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of a single oral supratherapeutic dose of zanubrutinib in eight
      (8) subjects.

      Part B: This is a randomized, placebo and positive-controlled, double-blind, 4-way crossover
      study being conducted in about 28 subjects to investigate the effect of a single therapeutic
      dose of zanubrutinib, a supratherapeutic dose of zanubrutinib and placebo on cardiac
      repolarization. Open-label Moxifloxacin (400 mg), a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibiotic
      will be used as a positive control.
