    
      This is a prospective, open-label, phase II trial with 1:1 randomization to either Arm A
      biomarker directed therapy (patients with ctDNA fraction <2% receive enzalutamide, and ctDNA
      fraction â‰¥2% receive docetaxel), versus Arm B clinician's choice of enzalutamide or
      docetaxel, in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer post abiraterone.
      At time of progression, patient will cross-over to the other therapy (e.g., enzalutamide to
      docetaxel, and docetaxel to enzalutamide).
