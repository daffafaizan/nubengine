      program in the community setting incorporating TMC+ will improve walking ability compared
      with patients who receive the standard of care (exercise advice). Secondary hypotheses
      include a significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes, an improvement in functional
      ability or a significant increase in volume of physical activity for patients who complete
      community-based walking exercise when compared with patients receiving the standard of care.
      Exploratory hypotheses include a significant improvement in PWT for 1) patients receiving a
      combination of lower extremity endovascular therapy (ET) and community-based walking exercise
      or 2) open peripheral intervention and community-based walking exercise compared to patients
      who do not receive endovascular therapy or open intervention and receive only the standard of
      care.
