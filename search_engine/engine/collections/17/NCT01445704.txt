      The daily supplementation of a probiotic will increase weight loss compared to a placebo
      supplement in the post-operative gastric bypass patients.

      Study Design:

      All patients in this study will be scheduled to undergo the RNYGB (Gastric Bypass) procedure
      to assist in weight loss. Patients in this study will be randomized to one of two groups:
      Group 1 (Probiotics) or Group 2 (Placebo). Patients will begin supplementation at the
      beginning of their 4 week pre-surgery OptifastÂ© 800 diet. All patients will take supplements
      for a total of 12 weeks. Nutritional education and support will be provided to each patient
      enrolled in the study. Weight loss will be measured using a machine that measures body
      composition. All patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire with regard to
      gastrointestinal health and a hair loss survey pre treatment and at the end of the study.
