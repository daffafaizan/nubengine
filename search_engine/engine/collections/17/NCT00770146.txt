      Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for CHD.

      Mipomersen is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called
      apolipoprotein B (apo-B). Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C
      is an independent risk factor for the development of CHD or other diseases of blood vessels.
      It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major
      adverse cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to determine whether mipomersen
      safely and effectively lowers LDL-C in patients with high cholesterol who are at high risk
      for CHD and who are already on the maximally tolerated dose of statin.

      This study consisted of a 26-week treatment period and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up
      period. Participants who finished treatment or who discontinued prematurely from the study
      for any reason were assessed for safety for 24 weeks after the last study drug dose.
