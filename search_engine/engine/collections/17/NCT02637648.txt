      headache and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic and episodic cluster headache using
      a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study, parallel group design. Patients with
      predominant nocturnal attacks and poor sleep quality will be evaluated; At least 1 attack
      every other day and at least 8 attacks cumulatively by the time prior to randomization are
      required. Sodium oxybate will be orally administered, 3-9g per night, starting with 3g in two
      nightly dosages of 1.5g (the first at bedtime and the second 4 hours later). Dosage will be
      gradually increased by steps of 1.5g every second night until treatment response during a
      titration period of 14 days. Effects od sodium oxybate will be monitored via pain and sleep
      diaries during a 14 days stable treatment phase by reviewing sleep/pain diaries and Quality
      of life assessement. Primary outcomes are frequency of nocturnal pain attacks; Main secondary
      outcomes are frequency, intensity and duration of daytime pain attacks, improvement of sleep
      quality, quality of life, duration and rates of pain free episodes, decrease in escape
      medication for acute headache attacks (use of triptans). Safety parameters are ECG,
      laboratory, depressions scales, vital signs, respiratory polygraphy. Intent-to treat
      analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with depending variable (reduction of
      pain frequency and pain intensity of nocturnal attacks) and the co-variates (age, sex ,
      chronic vs. episodic CH).
