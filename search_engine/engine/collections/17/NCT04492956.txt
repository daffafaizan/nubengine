    
      At the Baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a target
      steady-state dose of ecopipam HCl ~2 mg/kg/day or matching placebo for a 12-week Treatment
      Period consisting of a 4-week Titration Phase followed by an 8-week Maintenance Phase.

      Subjects will return to the clinic at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after Randomization and Follow-up
      visits 7 and 14 days after completing the Treatment Period or Early Discontinuation. Efficacy
      assessments will be conducted at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and safety assessments will be conducted
      at all visits. Subjects will have adverse events and other safety parameters assessed by
      phone or video conference at Weeks 2, 6 and 10 and 30 days after the last study drug
      administration. Signs or symptoms of withdrawal, abuse, and dependence will be monitored
      throughout the study.

      At the end of the Treatment Period or Early Discontinuation, subjects will taper study drug
      by 25 mg/day until off study drug, for up to 1 week.
