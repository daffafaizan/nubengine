      physical and psychological health, due to the disease itself or aggressive treatments.
      Physical activity, with specific treatments, improves physical and psychological health in
      solid tumors patients. However, in hematologic malignancies, there is unsatisfactory quality
      of evidence that physical activity alone improves the various dimensions of quality of life.

      Recent studies on heart-brain connections suggest that a high level of coherence in the heart
      rate variability may induce psychophysiological positive effects. Cardiac coherence is
      reached when the heart rhythm pattern becomes sine-wave-like at a frequency around 0.1 Hz.
      This status can be increased by the mean of deep and slow breathing control and/or positive
      emotions. By using a heart rate variability biofeedback training, previous studies have shown
      effects on physiological variables such as reduction of blood pressure or increase of vagal
      heart rate control, and also on psychological variables such as reduction of stress, anxiety,
      and depression.

      The APACCHE protocol investigate if cardiac coherence biofeedback training, associated with
      an adapted physical activity program, can improve health related quality of life in adult
      hematologic patients.

      70 patients are randomly assigned to receive either ten sessions of cardiac coherence
      biofeedback (CC-BF) and the adapted physical activity program (APA) or just APA. Both
      interventions are conducted simultaneously over 12 weeks, with 10 sessions of CC-BF (45mn)
      weekly and 24 sessions of APA (1h30) bi-weekly.

      Data are collected at enrollment(T1), at 6 weeks (T2), at intervention ending at 12 weeks
      (T3) and after a 24 weeks follow-up (T4).
