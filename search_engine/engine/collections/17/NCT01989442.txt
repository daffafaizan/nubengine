      nasal mask use in NIV for newborns. By using esophageal pressure transducers we will evaluate
      the pressure supplied by the ventilation mode and compare it with more commonly used nasal
      prongs. The investigators will test the hypothesis of equivalence of nasal mask in comparison
      to prongs with better safety parameters.
