      24-27.5-hour closed-loop phases in an outpatient/hotel environment. Prior to the closed-loop
      phases, each subject will undergo a 7-day data collection period consisting of his or her
      usual free-living conditions along with 3 meals of known carbohydrate content. Data from the
      insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGM), diet and exercise records will be
      collected during this period. These data from this 7-day period will be analyzed in order to
      come up with adapted basal insulin infusion rates and bolus insulin to carbohydrate (I:C)
      ratios.
