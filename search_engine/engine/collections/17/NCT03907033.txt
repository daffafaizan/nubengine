    
      Prior to surgery, patients are assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to receive either the
      bupivacaine HCl injection at the time of surgery or bupivacaine HCl plus liposomal
      bupivacaine. Patients and the Principal Investigator cannot choose the study group. Patients
      will have a 50% chance of being assigned to either group; however, regardless of which group
      they are assigned to, the medical record will show that they received liposomal bupivacaine.
      The injections will be given in the vaginal area when the patient is under anesthesia.

      After surgery, patients will be asked to record their pain, medication use, pain scores and
      symptoms in a diary for each 12 hour interval up to 72 hours. Someone will also call twice a
      day during the 72 hours after surgery to ask about pain level and pain medication use.

      Patients will also receive a phone call 7-10 days after the surgery to ask about their
      recovery and pain level.
