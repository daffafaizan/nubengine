      I. To determine the 6-month overall survival of patients with previously treated gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride)-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the
      combination of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and everolimus.

      II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose of everolimus when administered in combination
      with sorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate, median survival, time to progression, CA 19.9 decline and
      toxicity spectrum of the combination in this patient population.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of sorafenib and everolimus when given
      in combination.

      III. To explore the biomarkers that correlate with response to the study combination in
      patients previously treated with gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreas cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive everolimus (PO) once daily and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.
