      been shown to decrease the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and are recommended
      by a recent practice guideline in certain patient groups.1 Besides protection from ischemia,
      there are other situations where beta-receptor antagonists are used intraoperatively such as
      control of the sympathetic response to tracheal intubation and certain types of surgical
      stimuli.

      There is new evidence suggesting that administration of esmolol, a short-acting beta-receptor
      antagonist, might reduce the actual anesthetic requirement. This was initially shown by
      studies in which esmolol decreased the amount of anesthetic required to prevent movement
      after skin incision.2;3 Subsequent studies used bispectral index (BIS) as an endpoint and
      demonstrated decreased BIS values in subjects receiving esmolol during general anesthesia.
      4;5

      This anesthetic-sparing effect observed with esmolol has not been prospectively studied with
      other beta-receptor antagonists. Since perioperative beta-blockade is commonly achieved using
      longer acting agents such as metoprolol or atenolol, it is clinically relevant to understand
      the effects of these medications on anesthetic requirement. We aim to conduct a prospective,
      randomized, controlled, double-blind study to compare the anesthetic-sparing effect of
      metoprolol and esmolol administered intraoperatively.
