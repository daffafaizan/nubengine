      serious common complication of AF is ischemic stroke. Many AF cases are undiagnosed due to
      the asymptomatic and intermittent nature of AF (silent AF). Today there is no simple and
      inexpensive method of detecting silent AF and thus preventing stroke. The ECG247 Sensor is a
      new Norwegian digital clinical tool for out-of-hospital self-testing of AF. The innovation
      project has originated from the University of Agder and Sorlandet Hospital. The COVID19
      pandemic is realizing more than ever the need for single-use self-testing out-of-hospital
      diagnostic tools.

      The general aim of this open non-randomized study is to investigate the yield of AF screening
      with a continuous ECG monitor (ECG247) and to estimate the prevalence of silent AF in a
      cohort of 1500 65-year-old individuals with additional risk factors for stroke.

      If the study results indicate that easy-to-use continuous AF-screening-devices designed for
      self-testing can identify people with previously unrecognized AF, this study may contribute
      to change the approach to screening for AF in the community. Consequently, the study may
      prevent stroke in the future. By preventing stroke, major personal and socio-economic
      consequences can be avoided.
