    
      Peri-prosthetic infection is an uncommon but severe complication of joint replacement
      (arthroplasty) with a reported rate between 0.6 to 2.2%. Although the likelihood of infection
      is relatively small, the psychological and economic impact, as well as long-term implications
      to both the patient and healthcare system, can be catastrophic.

      The current gold standard treatment for peri-prosthetic infection is a two-stage strategy,
      where the artificial hip joint is removed and a new replacement delayed for at least 8 weeks
      until clear evidence of infection eradication is obtained. During this time the patient may
      be non-ambulatory, non- or partial-weight bearing and then a wait for re-listing for the
      second surgery.

      An alternative treatment that has recently been more widely used is to perform a single stage
      revision. That involves removing the implants and then irrigating and debriding and finally
      implanting the new replacements prostheses. This is all done in one surgery. The advantage of
      this technique is that there is only one procedure and usually the patient is allowed to bear
      weight on the joint.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare pain and physical function assessed by the Oxford hip score, between the single
      and two-stage revision surgery for a periprosthetic hip infection in adults

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare pain, function, quality of life, rates of reinfection, complications,
      cost-effectiveness and health economic impact.

      Tertiary Objectives:

      To involve building partnerships between patients, researchers and clinicians. Patients will
      be engaged in the trial development and knowledge translation.
