      of impairments in communication and social reciprocity and increases in repetitive/restricted
      interests and behaviors. ASD includes: autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive
      developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett's syndrome, and childhood
      disintegrative disorder as pervasive developmental disorders (American Psychiatric
      Association [DSM-IV-TR], 2000).

      Few disabilities appear to be more taxing on parents than ASDs.Parents of children with ASD
      fare worse on a variety of measures of well-being than parents of children without
      disabilities as well as parents of children with other types of disabilities.

      Studies investigating the impact of a child with disabilities, specifically ASD, are
      inconclusive. However, parents of children with ASD may be at increased risk for divorce due
      to a variety of personal and disability related factors. In Israel the relationship of having
      a child with autism on the probability of divorce has not been tested yet. The aim of this
      study is to profile this relationship and determine the magnitude and directionality of the
      effect raising ASD children has on the resilience of the institution of marriage and the
      satisfaction both partners derive. This will be tested using a short telephone survey.
