      myocardial ischemia in the perioperative setting - the so-called "preconditioning". However
      the observed response of preconditioning in clinical trials is not consistent.

      An increased perioperative insulin resistance especially in diabetic patients resulting in an
      increased postoperative morbidity and mortality may be responsible for these findings.

      In an animal model, the use of propofol that is being routinely applied for general
      anesthesia was associated with a change of the insulin receptor substrate via phosphorylation
      and thus a change of insulin resistance.

      Avoiding a total intravenous anesthesia and applying a volatile anesthesia may result in an
      increased cardioprotective effect by a reduction of the perioperative insulin resistance.
