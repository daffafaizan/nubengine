      breast cancer survivors, up to 70% of female breast survivors are not meeting minimum
      recommended physical activity guidelines. The purpose of this research was to develop,
      implement and assess the feasibility of Project MOVE, an innovative approach to increase
      physical activity among breast cancer survivors through the use of Action Grants, a
      combination of microgrants (small amounts of money awarded to groups of individuals to
      support a physical activity initiative) and financial incentives. Twelve groups of 8-12 adult
      women who are breast cancer survivors (N=132) were recruited for the study via face-to-face
      meetings with breast cancer-related stakeholders, local print and radio media, social media,
      and pamphlets and posters at community organisations and medical clinics. Each group
      submitted a microgrant application outlining their proposed physical activity initiative.
      Successful applicants were determined by a grant review panel and informed of a financial
      incentive upon meeting their physical activity goals. Primary (program feasibility) and
      secondary (physical activity, quality of life, motivation to exercise and social connection)
      outcome measures were evaluated using a mixed-methods approach including focus groups,
      self-reported questionnaires, semi-structured telephone interviews and objective physical
      activity measures. Measures were collected at baseline, post-intervention (6 months) and
      12-month follow-up. Findings from this study were used to asses the implementation and
      feasibility of Project MOVE as a strategy for increasing physical activity among breast
      cancer survivors.
