      investigation. According to the results of a previous retrospective study conducted in
      Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital comparing the clinical outcomes between perforated appendicitis
      patients treated by laparoscopic and open approach showed favored clinical outcomes for LA.
      Same as a few studies indicated that laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and effective
      procedure for treating patients with perforated appendicitis in terms of hospital stay and
      wound complications. One the other hand, some authors still concern about the adverse effects
      of laparoscopy for ruptured appendicitis patients in terms of longer operation time and
      increased rates of postoperative abscess formation. We hypothesize that prolonged CO2
      pneumoperitoneum will produce transient mesenteric ischemic and reperfusion injury when CO2
      disinflation, and the free radicals and oxidative proteins provoked by reperfusion injury are
      responsible for the adverse reaction of LA. The objective of this prospective non-randomized
      controlled study is to examine the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic appendectomy and
      compare its outcome with that of the conventional approach for perforated appendicitis
      patients, with special emphasis on postoperative complication and oxidative stress resulted
      from pneumoperitoneum..
