    
      The main aim is to study the incidence of major delivery complications and perineal injuries
      during vaginal delivery in Palestine. A manual support technique of perineum will be
      introduced.

        1. To assess the incidence of perineal tears, episiotomies, obstetric anal sphincter
           injuries and major obstetric complications in Palestine in a multicenter study involving
           three hospitals on the West Bank and three hospitals in Gaza.

        2. To assess the present treatment of obstetric anal sphincter tears in Palestine.

        3. To study whether intervention with bed-side training of the hands-on "the
           Norwegian-Finnish" support technique reduce the incidence of obstetric anal sphincter
           tears.

        4. To study whether training by animated instructions of the same hands-on support
           technique, using smart phones or tablet computers, reduce the incidence of obstetric
           anal sphincter injuries.

        5. To compare results between the two different training methods.

        6. To study midwives' and doctors' attitudes towards "hands-on" training compared to
           training by animated instructions. The main aim is to assess the incidence of perineal
           injuries during vaginal delivery in Palestine, and to introduce a manual support
           technique of perineum. Norwegian intervention studies have shown that the incidence of
           obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) can be reduced by 40-70% by improving hands-on
           delivering techniques. The reduction was achieved by educating all staff on the delivery
           unit, implementing a new hands-on delivering technique. Some previous research has shown
           that non-interactive training by animated instructions or videos in emergency obstetric
           care, might be equally effective as conventional interactive hands-on training. However,
           the effectiveness of training by animated instructions compared to conventional training
           programs remains to be assessed properly. By performing a multicentre intervention
           study, the investigators will explore the effect of interactive hands-on training on the
           incidence of perineal injuries. Likewise the investigators will study effect of
           non-interactive training by animated instructions. Three hospitals on the West Bank (WB)
           and three in Gaza have accepted to participate. The investigators will also assess
           whether attitudes towards training methods influence the results.

      The steps of observation, training and interventions in this study:

        1. Intervention 1 (1 month):

           Education in diagnosis and repair of perineal injuries and implementation of system to
           register data.

        2. Observation 1 (6 months):

           Data-registration baseline.

        3. Intervention 2, (6 months):

           First part:

           In all participating hospitals, the training in hands-on manual perineal protection will
           be communicated by animated instruction accessible on tablet computers and smart phones.
           The information and instructions how to perform the manual perineal protection is
           transferred for the users by instruction video showing the method as an animation with
           voice-over in Arabic and English. All 6 hospitals implement this intervention
           simultaneously.

           Second part, the stepped wedge approach:

           After one month the first hospitals starts with the traditional bedside hands-on
           training of the midwives and physicians. Norwegian midwives and obstetricians support
           this training. The traditional bedside training then starts stepwise in the 6 hospitals,
           one month after each other, in a stepped wedge model.

        4. Observation 2 (12 months):

      There will be a one year observational period where all data is collected.
