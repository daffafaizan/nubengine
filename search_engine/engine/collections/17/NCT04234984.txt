      radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves in patients diagnosed with chronic knee pain
      due to osteoarthritis of the knee or PPSP at six weeks post treatment. Secondary objectives
      are evaluation of treatment effect at a third time point at the end of the inclusion period,
      subgroup analysis of treatment success based on indication to treatment, evaluation of
      subjective functional improvement and change in analgesics, estimation of the duration of
      effect of the treatment and adverse events.

      This study includes all patients treated with radiofrequency ablation in the
      multidisciplinary chronic pain center in Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Campus Sint-Barbara between
      1 September 2017 and 31 December 2019 with exclusion of patients with chronic widespread
      pain.

      The main study outcome is the proportion of patients with a global perceived effect of at
      least 50% at 6 weeks post intervention. Secondary outcomes include reduction in pain
      intensity, measured by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at six weeks and at a third time point,
      global perceived effect at a third time point, subjective change in physical functioning,
      duration effect of the treatment, use of strong opioids, and adverse events.
