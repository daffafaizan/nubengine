      recorded PEF to inform patients and as the basis of prescribing decisions achieves better
      inhaler adherence and technique and also allows physicians to make appropriate prescribing
      decisions, compared to current best practice.

      The investigators will compare two asthma education interventions, standard BTS/SIGN
      Guideline recommended practice and feedback from the individual's own INCA device, which
      assesses inhaler adherence and relates adherence with changes in PEF and symptom scores over
      time.

      This education phase is followed by a medication optimisation phase (weeks 12-32) in which
      there are 3 cycles of medication optimisation guided by a digital script. The script either
      adjusts the medications following the GINA recommendation or uses the GINA recommendation but
      is supplemented with data on adherence and PEF that are recorded to digital, time-stamped,
      recording devices.

      The aim of the study is to improve and maintain adherence to preventer therapy, so that
      medication and other costs as well as the quality of life, exacerbation rates are optimal.
