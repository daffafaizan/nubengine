      hypermelanoses of the face. The exact pathogenesis of melasma is still unknown. Several
      hormones are thought to play a role, including thyroid hormone. Although melasma is not
      life-threatening, it affects greatly on the quality of life of patients. Study's objectives
      are to determine proportion of melasma cases in hyperthyroid patients and to compare severity
      of melasma before and after medications of three months hyperthyroid therapy using mMASI
      score. An experimental (before and after) study was conducted in Jakarta in August
      2019-February 2020. Twenty three newly-diagnosed hyperthyroid patients or had taken
      hyperthyroid medications of maximum 3 months with melasma were recruited. The severity of
      melasma were scored with mMASI and dermoscopy of the lesions were collected. The same
      procedures were done after 3 months of hyperthyroid therapy. The data collected was
      statistically analyzed using Stata version 15.0
