      patients are recruited and are made familiar with the new Guided Exercise (GEx) training
      system during exercise training; they are supervised and provided with training instructions
      by a medicine for 3 times a week 3 weeks long. At the beginning and at the end of the study
      the patient has to undergo several tests of the clinical routine such as a cardiopulmonary
      test (CPX), echocardiography and lactate measurement;additionally, this test will be
      registered by the system to obtain information about the detection of heart rate rise for
      example. Data will be analyzed for quality of heart rate measurement and data acquisition by
      the device.

      In a second step the GEx system is handed to these 30 patients when they leave in-patient
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The pre-trial serves to gather information about the
      practicability and technical problem during real-life use. Therefore at home these 30
      patients will continue with moderate endurance training like walking, cycling or running
      while wearing the GEx system three times a week for 3 weeks. After three weeks patients will
      come back to the clinic to undergo the end examination and to report the feasibility of
      usage. The ECG data and breathing frequency data will be analyzed to see if data are recorded
      and transmitted well in regard to technical problems.

      If accurate and safe data are received the following GEx- main- trial (ID 11-020) will
      investigate the GEx- system for CAD patients in regard to improvement of physical capacities
      obtained in long term adherence to home based rehabilitation programs (phase III) including
      feedback to patients compared to national standard rehabilitation.
