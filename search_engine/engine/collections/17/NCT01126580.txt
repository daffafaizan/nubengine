      antidiabetic medication for the management of severe, persistent hyperglycemia or alternative
      antidiabetic medication following study drug discontinuation. For efficacy analyses,
      participants who received rescue medication were included in the analysis population, but
      only measurements obtained prior to taking rescue therapy were included in the efficacy
      analysis. For safety analyses, with the exception of hypoglycemia outcomes, all measurements
      including those obtained after taking rescue therapy were included in the analysis.
