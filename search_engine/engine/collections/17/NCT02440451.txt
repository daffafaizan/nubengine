      interpretation of the emotional and mental state of others (Baron-Cohen 2001). An important
      skill to this end (impaired in ASD patients), is to appropriately recognize and discriminate
      emotional expressions.

      The main brain regions involved in face processing the inferior occipital gyri, lateral
      portion of the fusiform gyrus (especially a region deemed the fusiform face area or FFA), and
      posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) (Haxby et al. 2000). STS plays a key role on
      several basic aspects in social information processing, and deficits in ASD have been found
      associated to this region.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of neurofeedback considering a social
      cognition brain region (i.e. pSTS) on the identification of facial expressions in ASD
      patients. The intervention comprehends seven BCI sessions spread over four months. The first
      four sessions are weekly, and the rest monthly. In each session, the subjects are asked to
      imagine different facial expressions and their brain activity (i.e. BOLD activation in the
      pSTS region) is interpreted and used to estimate a feedback signal.The hypothesis is that the
      training induced up-regulation of the target region, improves clinical symptoms.
