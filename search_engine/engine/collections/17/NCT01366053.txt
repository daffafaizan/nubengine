      therapy after failing on GnRH agonists but prior to use of secondary hormonal treatments such
      as antiandrogens. The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of Degarelix's direct
      mode of action on androgen levels and whether continuous use of Degarelix improves disease
      progression.

      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase IV observational trial with s.c. injections of
      Degarelix one-month depot in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      The visit frequency is once a month (28-day intervals), with eCRF data entry at every 4
      months. All patients will be treated with a one-month starting dose followed by 23 monthly
      maintenance doses for a duration of 672 days. The primary endpoints will be evaluated after
      24 treatment months.

      In total, 25 visits are scheduled for all patients.
