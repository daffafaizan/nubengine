    
      Phase 1:

        -  Primary purpose is to determine the safety of KD019.

        -  Dosing is for 28 days daily. After the 28-day treatment period, subjects will, at the
           discretion of the investigator, continue to receive study treatment for 24 months from
           their first dose or until the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or
           withdrawal of consent by the subject, or investigator decision. Subjects may continue
           beyond 24 months at the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the
           medical monitor.

        -  All participants receive active KD019 study drug.

        -  KD019 is an oral once daily tablet. Tablets are 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg in strength.
           Participants will enroll into three sequential dosing cohort levels (50 mg, 100 mg and
           150 mg.). Participants in Phase 1b will have their dose increased or decreased to the
           MTD.

        -  Study participants will have MRI of the abdomen (kidneys) at Screening and 6 months
           thereafter to explore effects of KD019.

        -  Echocardiogram will be performed at Screening, Day 28, months 3 and 6 and every 6 months
           thereafter.

      Phase 2:

        -  Primary purpose is to compare the annualized change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
           in subjects with ADPKD when treated with KD019.

        -  Two alternate dosing schedules will be explored to determine if they are more tolerable
           than daily dosing when used chronically in subjects with ADPKD.

        -  Subjects will receive study treatment for 24 months from their first dose or until the
           development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent by the
           subject, or investigator decision. Subjects may continue beyond 24 months at the
           discretion of the investigator after consultation with the sponsor.

        -  All participants receive active KD019 study drug.

        -  Tablets are 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg in strength.

        -  Study participants will have MRI of the abdomen (kidneys) at Screening and Month 6 visit
           and every 6 months after to explore effects of KD019.

        -  Echocardiogram will be performed at Screening, Day 28, and Months 3 and 6 and 6 months
           thereafter.
