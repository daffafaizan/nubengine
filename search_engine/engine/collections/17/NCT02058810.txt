      Improvement of the cardiorenal syndrome type1 measured by the improvement of creatine
      clearance and the Serum-Creatinin of patients undergoing High-Flow treatment.

      Secondary endpoints:

      death) Duration of hospital stay (in days) 90-day mortality Readmittance to hospital within 3
      months Intrathoracic bloodvolume at hospital discharge Change of dyspnea at 3h, 6h, 24h >
      VAS-0-100 (visual analog scale) Change in the diameter of the IVC (inferior vena cava) as a
      non-invasive parameter for assessing the degree of decompensation Change in the BNP (hospital
      admission vs. discharge, after 3 months) Weight loss in hospital Amount of diuretics
