      follow up prostate MRIs during a 6 month time period, while the participant is having their
      ADT/EBRT treatment. These follow-up prostate MRIs will use a standard imaging protocol
      without the use of an endorectal coil. The participant will also have a total of 4 blood
      samples to measure serum PSA. 1-2 mls (just less than Â½ teaspoon) will be taken for each
      sample.

      Research Study Plan

        -  Baseline Visit (routine standard of care screening visit): PSA blood test and prostate
           MRI

        -  Visit 1 (8 weeks after starting ADT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

        -  Visit 2 (6 weeks after starting EBRT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

        -  Visit 3 (on last day of EBRT): PSA blood test

        -  Visit 4 (6 months after starting ADT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

      Planned Follow-up: The investigator would like to keep track of the participant's prostate
      cancer status while they continue to see their doctor at DFCI. The investigators would like
      to do this by collecting the following data from the participant's medical records, to look
      at long-term outcome of their ADT/EBRT treatment.

        -  PSA values

        -  Clinical results of your treatment. The investigator will not contact the participant to
           obtain this information.
