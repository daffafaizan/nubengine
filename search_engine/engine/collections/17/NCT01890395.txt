      Associated Molecular Patterns (mtDAMPs) accumulate in the circulation after severe injury.
      Furthermore our own studies in severely injured patients identify that the mtDAMPS are
      increased 3-28 fold in those patients who eventually develop multiple organ dysfunction
      syndrome (MODS) compared to those severely traumatized patients who did not develop MODS. The
      relative risk of death from MODS after severe trauma was increased 8-20 times in those
      patients with elevated mt DAMP levels.

      This study is then being done to correlate mitochondrial damp levels in surgical trauma to
      assess the time course and the levels of mtDAMPs with the type of surgical procedure. We
      believe that this information will help us to determine the time course of events and the
      triggers for development of multiple organ dysfunction seen after surgery.
