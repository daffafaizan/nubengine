    
      Patients planned for CEA (carotid endarterectomy) due to carotid stenosis will be examined
      with one extra CT and MRI before surgery. The CEA specimen is stored in the BiKE-registry (a
      biobank of operated carotid plaque at the Karolinska Institute). In that registry the
      patients will be given a personal code which is used to identify the CT, MRI and histology
      data further on.

      Approved by regional ethical review board in Stockholm and local radiation comity at
      Karolinska University Hospital Solna (Dnr K2435-2014). Informed consent from the
      participating patients.
