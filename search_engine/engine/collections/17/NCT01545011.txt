      distension, objectified by measuring inspiratory capacity (IC), which places the diaphragm at
      a disadvantage to be effective, which raises the sensation of dyspnea.

      Currently, inspiratory muscles training is recommended by the French-language Society of
      Pneumology, in case of an objective reduction of the strength of these muscles (corresponding
      to maximum inspiratory pressure <60 cm H20).
