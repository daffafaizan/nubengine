      and technological developments related to intensive care treatments and the rate of discharge
      from intensive care unit (ICU) has increased. However, as the length of hospitalization in
      the intensive care unit prolonged, the functionalities of the patients were restricted due to
      changes in the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. Inactivity, inflammation, the use
      of pharmacological agents and the presence of neuromuscular syndromes associated with the
      critical disease lead to decreased muscle dysfunction and exercise tolerance in patients in
      the intensive care unit. These changes cause the health-related quality of life to be worse
      in people with critical illness a few months after discharge. Balance; muscle strength is
      affected by changes in sensory information, postural control and vestibular arrangements from
      the lower extremity. Studies on equilibrium assessment in different research groups; It
      includes measurements that assess the seating balance, which does not require complex
      measurements or ambulation. In the literature, there is no clear information about balance
      effect in intensive care patients who can not be ambulated due to loss of advanced muscle
      strength, especially in the early period. The Ottowa Sitting Scale is a scale in which the
      balance is evaluated in the sitting position and there is no validity and reliability in
      Turkish. For this reason, the aim of this study is to examine the reliability and validity
      between measurements and measurements of the Ottowa Sitting Scale's Turkish version. More
      than one physiotherapist scores patients for validity between the measurements. For the
      validity of the measurements, a physiotherapist scores the patient twice in two weeks
      intervals.
