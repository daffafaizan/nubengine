      patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the
      development of choroidal neovascular membrane formation (CNVM). Several clinical trials have
      proven that eyes with "well-defined" CNVM or lesions that can be readily demarcated with
      fluorescein angiography can be successfully treated with laser photocoagulation. However, up
      to 87% of eyes present with "ill-defined" CNVM or lesions that cannot be well demarcated on
      fluorescein angiography and are not amenable to laser photocoagulation. No beneficial
      treatment for this form of choroidal neovascularization has been established.

      Histopathologic study has demonstrated the presence of inflammatory and reparative responses
      in the retina of patients with ill-defined choroidal neovascularization. Since
      corticosteroids have been shown to downregulate many of the cellular factors involved in both
      inflammation and repair, the present study is designed to assess the ability of
      corticosteroid injection around the eye to prevent severe vision loss associated with
      "ill-defined" choroidal neovascularization in the setting of age-related macular
      degeneration. The study will be organized as a randomized open label control clinical trial
      involving 2 phases. Phase 1 involving 40 patients will establish the feasibility and safety
      of this treatment modality. Phase 2 will place emphasis on efficacy of the study.
