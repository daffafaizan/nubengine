      schedule (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) will be compared with the currently used
      conventional fractionation schedule (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) for
      postoperative radiotherapy with photons or protons in patients with NSCLC. The primary
      endpoint is locoregional tumour control after 36 months. Secondary endpoints are overall
      survival of patients, local recurrence-free and distant metastases-free survival after 36
      months, acute and late toxicity as well as quality of life for both treatment methods.
