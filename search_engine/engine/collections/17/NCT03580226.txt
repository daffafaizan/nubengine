    
      Adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) with type 2 diabetes which are diagnosed under ICD-10
      coding of E-11 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria are patients with primary
      diagnosis of E11and have visited the clinic at least twice with a complete record of glucose,
      uric acid, lipid and kidney profile. Participants were grouped into 2 groups - good and poor
      glycemic control based on their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Good glycemic control is
      defined according to the American Diabetes Association and the Indonesian Association of
      Endocrinologists (PERKENI) cut off of HbA1c < 7.0.

      Data such as age, sex, ethnic, education, BMI, glucose, uric acid, lipid, and kidney profile
      as well as comorbidities and type of drug used were collected from the patients' medical
      records. Comorbid conditions were defined as either concomitant hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      chronic kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or combinations of them as diagnosed in the medical
      records. Diabetic complications of interest include macrovascular (heart disease, stroke),
      microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) and a combination of both as well as
      infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia). These complications were also based on the
      medical records. Management modalities included were lifestyle modification, use of oral
      antidiabetic medications or insulin, or both.
