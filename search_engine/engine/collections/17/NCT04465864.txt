      intraocular lens implant in conjunction with minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) more
      specifically iStent, iStent inject or KDB with an intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg)
      insert, inserted four days (+/- 1 day) prior to surgery as compared to insertion on day of
      surgery. Patients with either primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension
      (OHTN) requiring cataract surgery with IOL implant, will be separated into two groups.

      Group 1: intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insertion four days (+/- 1 day) prior to
      cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implant and MIGS (iStent, iStent inject or KDB)
      insertion. (Patient to use antibiotic three days prior to surgery) Group 2: intracanalicular
      dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insertion on the day of cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL)
      implant and MIGS (iStent, iStent inject or KDB) insertion. (Patient to use antibiotic three
      days prior to surgery)
