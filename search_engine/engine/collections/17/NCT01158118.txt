      plerixafor with sargramostim in donors of blood-forming cells (stem cells). Stem cells can be
      taken from the bone marrow of the pelvic bones or from the blood following treatment with
      drugs called growth factors; sargramostim is such a drug. Once stem cells leave the bone
      marrow and circulate in the blood, they are called peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). These
      cells can be collected through a routine procedure called apheresis, which involves placing
      two IVs into the arm which are connected to an apheresis machine; the machine then takes
      blood from the body, removes the stem cells, and returns the blood to the body.

      Normally, a growth factor called filgrastim is given to donors in order to collect the stem
      cells used for transplantation. However, when stem cells collected using filgrastim are
      transplanted in patients, a possible unpredictable complication is graft versus host disease.
      It's thought that using a different growth factor such as sargramostim might reduce the
      occurrences of graft versus host disease in patients. However, sargramostim alone does not
      provide as many stem cells for transplantation as other growth factors. Plerixafor is another
      drug that can increase the number of PBSCs in a donor, but like with sargramostim, plerixafor
      alone does not always provide enough stem cells. This is why sargramostim and plerixafor are
      being combined in this study: the investigators believe that the two drugs together will
      provide enough stem cells for transplantation and may also reduce the risk of graft versus
      host disease.
