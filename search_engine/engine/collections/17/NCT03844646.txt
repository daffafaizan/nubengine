      insulin therapy and its utility can also be harnessed to help individuals with prediabetes
      make healthful lifestyle changes. Successful weight loss requires adherence to lower
      calories, regular exercise, and self-monitoring. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
      intermittent CGM will facilitate all of these components for successful weight loss by
      functioning as a continuous self-monitor and guiding healthful food choices and physical
      activity.
