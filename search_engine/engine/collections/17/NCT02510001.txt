    
      This is a two stage study. Firstly a dose escalation step is used to define the best dose for
      the drug combination, using the rolling 6 design where up to 6 patients are recruited at each
      dose level, and increasing the dose of one or other agent according to the side effects of
      treatment. An initial dose escalation phase was completed where 25 patients were enrolled,
      using the study treatment combination of PD-0325901 with PF-02341066. Following
      discontinuation of the MEKi (inihibitor), PD-0325901, the study was updated to include a
      further dose escalation phase using the new combination study treatment, MEKi, Binimetinib
      with METi, PF-02341066. The effects of this drug combination will be assessed to define the
      recommended dose level for the dose expansion phase of the study.

      Second the new drug combination is observed in 42-98 patients with bowel cancer for its
      efficacy and tolerability. Patients who give consent will have their archival tumour samples
      tested for RAS and c-MET status.

      Potential participants will, after giving consent, undergo screening tests to ensure that it
      is safe for them to take part. These involve a detailed medical history, physical exam, blood
      tests, ophthalmology exam, ECG and ultrasound and skin biopsies. The size and extent of
      tumours is also assessed by CT and/or MRI scan.

      For the initial dose escalation phase, on assurance that the test results are satisfactory,
      patients start on PD-0325901 first for one week. On Day -7 a physical exam, ECG and blood
      test is performed, with a repeat blood test on Day -6. End of first week PD samples of blood
      are taken to observe the level of PD-0325901. Day 1 PF-02341066 is introduced after further
      clinical safety assessments. There are further blood samples taken over 24 hours to measure
      levels of PD-0325901 and PF-02341066 on days 21 and 28 of the first cycle.

      For the further dose escalation phase, again assuming that the screening test results are
      satisfactory, patients start on Day 1 with the combined treatment of PF-02341066 with
      Binimetinib. A physical exam, ECG and blood test is performed, with a repeat blood test on
      Day 2. There are further blood samples taken over 24 hours to measure levels of Binimetinib
      and PF-02341066 on day 21of the first cycle.

      Patients have weekly visits when side effects are reviewed and a physical examination is
      performed. On Day 15 a second skin biopsy is taken along with blood tests to assess liver and
      renal function. At the end of the first 4 weeks cycle, for the initial dose escalation phase,
      and at end of 8 weeks for the new combination therapy dose escalation phase, an ophthalmology
      exam is compared with the baseline assessment.

      For subsequent cycles in both the initial dose escalation and further dose escalation phases,
      visits remain weekly and include safety assessments as per Day 1. Blood levels of PD-0325901
      or Binimetinib and PF-02341066 are measured on day 21 of even numbered cycles. In addition
      the tumour size is checked every second cycle, and the study treatment stopped if the tumour
      continues to grow.

      When patients stop taking the study treatment they will be reviewed after 4 weeks for any
      side effects and have a physical examination and other safety tests performed.

      For patients entering the expansion phase of the trial the procedures are similar, except
      that there is a pre-screening stage where tumour biopsies are required. Patients will have a
      sample of their tumour assessed, following consent, to determine their RAS and cMET status.
      This may involve a fresh biopsy. If suitable, the patient will be entered into the screening
      for the dose expansion phase and a fresh tumour biopsy may be taken if not already done so.
      The study schedule is the same as for the escalation phase using Binimetinib with
      PF-02341066. At the end of treatment a further, optional, tumour biopsy may be taken.

      After trial participation patients will be offered further care with the trial team or their
      referring oncology team as appropriate.
