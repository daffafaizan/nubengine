      clinical applicability is lacking. This study investigates temperature changes on the upper
      extremity before and after a suprathreshold stimulation (painful stimulus) with a digital
      algometer over the infraspinatus muscle. The same procedure is performed in two consecutive
      days, 24 hours apart (Day-1 and Day-2). At the end of Day-1, an eccentric exercise is
      performed in order to to induce delayed onset muscle soreness on the external rotators of the
      shoulder.
