      parameters separately.

      In hip study hip functional parameters will be evaluated for determining the correlation
      between scoliosis degree/pattern and hip functions.

      In jaw study jaw functional parameters will be evaluated for determining the correlation
      between scoliosis degree/pattern and hip functions.
