      with those with higher expression of this nucleoside transporter. Nonclinical studies
      indicate that CO-1.01, a gemcitabine derivative, is effective independent of such
      transporters. Thus patients with low or no meaningful expression of hENT1 who failed to
      respond to gemcitabine might derive benefit from CO1.01 before needing alternative
      (combination) chemotherapy. Furthermore, the PK profiles of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are
      dissimilar and this may confer additional clinical benefit on CO1.01.
