      novice and experienced meditators, as well as initial versus final biometric responses in all
      participants stratified by cohort. Investigators hypothesize that novice meditators will
      experience a measurable change in response to mediation over the week-long retreat, whereas
      experienced meditators will demonstrate a more robust response than novice meditators on the
      first day of the retreat with less change over the retreat.
