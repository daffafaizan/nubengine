      rhinitis. On a baseline visit, allergy skin prick tests, spirometry, methacholine
      bronchoprovocation and induced sputum (IS) with differential leukocyte count will be
      obtained.

      In a second step, mild asthmatic subjects will undergo conventional bronchial allergen
      challenge. IS will be obtained at 6h (corresponding to the late asthmatic response) and 24h
      following the challenge. The rhinitic subjects and asthmatic subjects will undergo a 4-day
      low dose allergen bronchial challenge as well as a nasal allergen challenge. Sputum samples
      will be obtained following days 2 and 4 of the low dose challenge and one week later, and 24h
      following nasal challenge.

      Induced sputum will be analyzed for differential cell count. Total mRNA will be extracted
      from IS cells and used for RT-PCR.
