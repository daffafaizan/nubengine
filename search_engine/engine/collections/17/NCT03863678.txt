      neurodevelopmental therapy on spasticity, upper and lower extremity functions, balance and
      independence level in patients with stroke who have spasticity. In this study, goniometric
      measurement, Modified Ashworth Scale, Nine Hole Peg Test, 10 Meter Walking Test, Fullerton
      Advanced Balance Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be used for outcome
      measurement. The participants will be randomised into two groups; Group 1 will receive NDT
      and Group 2 will receive both NDT and dry needling therapy. Both groups will be given 45
      minutes of NDT, 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions). Group 2 will
      also receive dry needling therapy 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12
      sessions). Dry needling will be applied on M. Gastrocnemius, M.Quadriceps, M.Flexor Carpi
      Radialis and M.Biceps Brachii muscles. The application time on each muscle will be 60 seconds
      (sec). Fast in and fast out technique will be used for dry needling therapy. All patients
      will be measured before treatment (T1) and after treatment (T3). An inter-measurement will be
      performed after the treatment session (T2) in addition to T1 and T3 measurements in the Group
      2, to evaluate the acute effects of dry needling therapy. No additional treatment will be
      applied to the Group 1. All assessments will be performed by the same physiotherapist.
