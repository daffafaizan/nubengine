           undergo a directed medical history and examination, echocardiogram (if not done within
           one year), limited ABI test, and maximal treadmill test with oxygen kinetics.

        2. Measure fitness level at the beginning of the exercise training, at 10 and 20 weeks:
           DEXA scan, body fat analysis, strength and balance measurements, and blood tests.

        3. Train for 10 weeks in a supervised small group format. Classes meet three times a week
           for an hour. Participants are randomly assigned to:

      1) Flexibility and toning exercises + health education, or 2) Functional circuit training +
      home activities + tailored physical activity guidance.

      4. Follow-up phone calls for an additional 10 weeks.
