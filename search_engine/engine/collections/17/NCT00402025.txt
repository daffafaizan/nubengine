      designed for use in solid tumors. It has been specifically modified to replicate in tumors
      and to provide a local source of the immune-stimulating cytokine, granulocyte macrophage
      colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is injected directly into cancer tumors and is
      believed to destroy tumor cells by direct infection of the tumor cells and an enhanced immune
      response due to the release of tumor antigens and GM-CSF expression.

      This was an open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      talimogene laherparepvec administered by direct injection into pancreatic tumors using
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle injection (FNI). Only 1 tumor mass within the
      body and tail of the pancreas was injected in any participant. The protocol called for
      evaluation of 4 dosing regimens in sequential cohorts of participants; however, cohort 4 was
      not opened for enrollment.
