    
      This is a proof-of-principle single-arm phase 2 study in patients with previously treated
      CUP. All patients receive pembrolizumab combined with RT to a metastatic site, so as to
      induce an abscopal tumor response. The treatment combination will be repeated with RT
      delivery to a second metastatic site in a non-overlapping RT field.

      The results will be compared with historical control. The primary endpoint is the confirmed
      response rate (RR) in a non-irradiated site based on best responding abscopal lesion. This
      study will also evaluate the following secondary endpoints: RR in a non-irradiated site based
      on RECIST 1.1, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
      time-to-progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR).
