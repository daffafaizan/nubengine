    
      Randomized trial among depressed Medicaid patients aged 18 years and older in 2 primary care
      practices in Western NC comparing an intervention with a GCM to usual care (UC) between July
      2003 and February 2005. GCMs, already providing diabetes and asthma services, were further
      trained and given ongoing supervision to provide algorithm-based depression care to enhance
      guideline concordant treatment. GCMs provided elements of self-management, decision support,
      use of information systems, and core care management components.
