      during the Treatment Period (Chemotherapy Period) until disease progression, completion of 6
      cycles, toxicity or voluntary participant withdrawal. Participants who do not have documented
      disease progression and have completed a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy continue to
      receive weekly Study Drug maintenance therapy during the Maintenance Period until disease
      progression or the participant fulfills one of the other reasons for withdrawal from protocol
      treatment, unless they have been discontinued from protocol treatment for unacceptable
      toxicity related to study drug. All participants have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit when
      they are withdrawn from all study treatment (chemotherapy and maintenance). All participants
      are followed until documented disease progression. Once disease progression is documented,
      participants enter a Survival Follow-up Period during which data are collected regarding
      further cancer therapy, secondary malignancy, and survival status.
