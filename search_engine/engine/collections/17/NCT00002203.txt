      inhibitor is clinically equivalent in its effect on plasma HIV-1 RNA level to a conventional
      regimen of 3TC, ZDV, and a protease inhibitor.

      Patients are stratified according to their current protease inhibitor therapy and randomized
      to receive open-label therapy of 1 Combivir tablet bid (Arm II) or an equivalent dose of 3TC
      and ZDV (Arm I), plus their current protease inhibitor for 16 weeks.
