      risk of colonization and central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) than other
      sites (jugular or subclavian). In pediatric patients, the femoral site is more commonly used
      than in adult patients, but there is no sound data on catheter colonization and CLABSI
      related to the insertion site. The experimental hypothesis of this randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) is that the jugular insertion site is less likely to induce catheter colonization
      and CLABSI than the femoral site.

      Methods: 160 patients under 1 year and scheduled for cardiac surgery will be included in this
      RCT; patients will be randomly allocated to the jugular (J Group) or Femoral (F Group). CVC
      insertion will be performed by one out of three selected expert operators.

      The primary endpoint is the catheter colonization based on identification of bacterial grow
      into the catheter at removal time; CLABSI and CRBSI rate based on the same bacterial
      identification into the catheter tip and in the blood culture performed in case of signs and
      symptoms of infection.

      Secondary endpoints are mechanical complications defined as arterial puncture immediately
      identified during procedure, hemothorax and pneumothorax; and procedural difficulty during
      insertion defined as number of attempts, no guidewire progress, duration of the procedure
      (time from the completion of the sterile precaution barriers and the catheter fixation.
