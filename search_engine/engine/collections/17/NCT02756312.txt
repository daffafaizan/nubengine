      possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression and patient
      mortality, current evidence from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics
      might influence the outcome of the patients.There are many thousands of patients with a
      cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery every year, and in the context of biological
      plausibility, it should lead to the urgent undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the
      association between the anesthetic management and patient outcome.
