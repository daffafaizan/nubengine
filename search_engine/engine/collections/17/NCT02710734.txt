      special instrument inserted through the urethra) followed by accelerated methotrexate,
      vinblastine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, and radiation therapy work in treating
      patients with bladder cancer that has spread to the muscle. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cisplatin work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
