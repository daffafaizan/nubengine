      specific manual therapy treatments result in better outcomes than standard neck exercises in
      people with neck pain. Clinical tests and measurements as well as patient questionnaires will
      be completed and compared between groups.

      A secondary purpose is to determine if self report of activity is correlated with functional
      improvements. We hypothesize that a specifically applied home exercise that augments the
      effects of the manual therapy intervention will lead to improvements in outcomes in patients
      with neck pain. We hypothesize that higher reports of self activity will be correlated with
      improvements in outcomes.
