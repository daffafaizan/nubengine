      first identified in New York city in 1999. It is transmitted by mosquitoes from birds to
      humans and can cause severe disease in some individuals. There is no specific treatment for
      West Nile Disease. The target population for a West Nile vaccine is older people, as they are
      more susceptible to severe disease. This trial includes a dose-finding part with a placebo
      control in young healthy adults, followed by a placebo-controlled examination of the chosen
      dose in older healthy adults.

      Outcome measures include a comparison of adverse events between active treatment and placebo,
      a comparison of antibody and viremia measurements between dose levels and across age groups
      for the dose chosen for Part 2.
