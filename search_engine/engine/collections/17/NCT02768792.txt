    
      Primary Objective

      1. Estimate the objective overall rate of CR (CR+CRi) for age-adjusted HiDAC (age <60 years:
      2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5; age >60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5) followed by
      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 14 in relapsed and refractory AML patients

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Estimate the rate of unacceptable toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab as induction therapy

        2. Estimate the objective overall response rates (PR+CR+CRi) for HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab.

        3. Characterize the toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab as induction
           therapy

        4. Characterize the toxicity associated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks when used as
           monotherapy maintenance after an initial response to induction phase HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab

        5. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients
           receiving maintenance pembrolizumab

        6. Estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients who received induction phase treatment.
