      of early community services, including a brief nurse home visiting program. The proposed
      study will be conducted in partnership with the brief nurse home visiting program and Sinai
      Hospital, both located in Baltimore, MD. For the purposes of this study, Sinai Hospital will
      serve as the community/catchment area. Nurse home visitors enroll new mothers into the nurse
      home visiting program while they are still in the hospital/maternity ward. When the current
      study officially begins, nurse home visitors will recruit new mothers into the nurse home
      visiting program every other day only (on odd dates). Research staff will recruit all
      Baltimore City residents who give birth at Sinai Hospital, regardless of odd/even birth date,
      while they are still in the hospital/maternity ward.
