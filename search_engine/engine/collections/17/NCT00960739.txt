      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of iodobenzylguanidine meta-I131 (^131I-MIBG) and
           topotecan in young patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the hematological and extra-hematological toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      During the 21 days before treatment begins, autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      collected.

      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 and
      iodobenzylguanidine meta-^131I IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      2 courses. Patients also undergo total-body irradiation.

      On day 10 of the second course, autologous PBSC are reinfused.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.
