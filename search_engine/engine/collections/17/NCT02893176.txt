      amelioration of the fibrous airway obliteration associated with blockade of the
      renin-angiotension and the endothelin system implementing the ERA antagonist, BOSENTAN (100
      mg/kg). Clinical studies have indeed demonstrated that the mitogenic and profibrotic peptide,
      ET-1, may represent a potential biomarker in clinical BOS. Detection of levels of ET-1 mRNA
      were significantly increased in the lung allografts of those with versus those without BOS at
      3 and 12 months post-transplantation while ET-1 concentrations were significantly elevated
      both in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with BOS. Additional
      studies have further demonstrated a pronounced inhibitory effect elicited by chronic ET(A)
      receptor blockade in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy, on both plasma levels and
      transcriptional regulation of inflammatory chemokines in a rat heterotopic heart transplant
      model of chronic rejection .

      MACITENTAN, a novel, competitive ERA with significantly slower receptor dissociation kinetics
      than currently approved ERAs, may represent a renewed hope for patients suffering from
      progressive CLAD post-transplantation. The efficacy of MACITENTAN was not realized in the
      exploratory Phase II MUSIC Trial for IPF for the primary endpoint measure of forced vital
      capacity (FVC), nevertheless, mechanistic disparities in the pathobiology of CLAD versus IPF,
      therefore should not preclude a separate therapeutic trial. Further, in vitro treatment with
      MACITENTAN and its major metabolite (ACT-132577) decreases alpha smooth muscle actin
      elaboration by dermal fibroblasts in systemic sclerosis fibrotic skin lesions, therefore
      offering significant promise for potential disease modulation. Most importantly, the MUSIC
      Trial has further demonstrated the "clinical safety" of this pharmacologic therapy in 178
      patients with IPF with mean drug exposure of approximately 14 months and without statistical
      differences in incidence of abnormal liver function studies. Recent pharmacokinetic studies
      of MACITENTAN have suggested no "clinically significant" drug-drug interaction with respect
      to Cytochrome P4503A4 for concurrent post-transplant immunosuppressive type therapies, such
      as cyclosporine, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil; while insignificant interaction with
      the frequently implemented "azole-type antibiotics" was also observed.
