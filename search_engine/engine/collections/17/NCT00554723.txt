      have shown that NeuroAiD increase stroke patients'recovery in terms of neurological
      disability and functional outcome{Chen et al,2009}and thus may be beneficial as part of a
      post-stroke rehabilitation programme.

      In the CHIMES study,we seek to test the hypothesis that NeuroAiD is superior to a placebo in
      reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients recruited within
      72 h after the ischemic stroke with intermediate range of severity {6<_NIHSS<_14}.More
      details of the study protocol have recently been published {Venketasubramanian et al,2009}.
