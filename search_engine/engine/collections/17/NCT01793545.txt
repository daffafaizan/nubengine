      deaths in 2012. Most endometrial cancers develop slowly through progression of well
      characterized precursors, many of which regress with progesterone treatment or are curable
      with hysterectomy. Thus, early detection of endometrial cancer precursors can prevent many
      endometrial cancers and reduce mortality. Using DNA methylation profiling in the Polish
      Endometrial Cancer Study (PECS) and the Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation (BRTE) Study,
      we identified a panel of markers that is strongly and specifically linked to endometrial
      cancer. Concurrently, we have developed two sampling methods for detecting endometrial cancer
      and its precursors via DNA methylation analysis: vaginal tampons and endometrial brushings.
      Preliminary data demonstrate that DNA methylation markers are detectable in tampons and
      endometrial brushings and can identify women with endometrial cancer. We propose to extend
      the effort by collecting vaginal tampons and endometrial brushings from about 2000 women who
      are at increased risk of endometrial cancer and who present at the Mayo Clinic Division of
      Medical Gynecology. We will test our candidate panel of DNA methylation markers in this
      population and evaluate the clinical performance to detect endometrial hyperplasia and
      endometrial cancer. Success of this project could lead to development of early detection
      tests, including self-sampling strategies that would improve management of abnormal vaginal
      bleeding, endometrial cancer and its precursors.
