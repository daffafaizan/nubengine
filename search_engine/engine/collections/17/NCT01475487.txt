      neck circumference, thyromental distance)

      The primary outcome measure was the complication rate as assessed by the severity of
      injuries; defined as the incidence and severity of posterior laryngeal and tracheal wall
      injuries, as graded by two anesthesiologists using the grading system described by Murphy et
      al,( none (no injury); mild (< 5 mm laceration); moderate (> 5mm laceration or partial
      puncture); severe (> 10 mm laceration or full puncture)). For clinical relevance and analysis
      of data we dichotomized the scale to none-mild and moderate - severe injuries.

      The secondary outcomes include: 1) insertion time, measured in seconds (s) from the time of
      palpation of the skin to insertion of the Portex device in the trachea; 2) failure, with a
      'failure' defined as any attempt in which the trachea was not cannulated, or which required >
      300 s to perform; and 3) correct land-marking, defined as having the Portex device inserted
      via the CM.
