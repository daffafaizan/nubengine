    
      This is a multicenter, placebo- and positive-controlled, randomized study consisting of 3
      periods: a screening period of up to 14 days (including a 5-day washout period), a
      double-blind period of 10 days (including the treatment phase [Days 1 to 8] and the
      posttreatment phase [Days 9 and 10]), and an end-of-study evaluation. Eligible patients will
      be randomly assigned to treatment with either paliperidone or moxifloxacin. Patients randomly
      assigned to receive paliperidone will receive placebo on Day 1, paliperidone 4 mg on Day 2,
      paliperidone 6 mg on Day 3, and paliperidone 8 mg on Days 4 through 8. Patients assigned to
      receive moxifloxacin will receive placebo on Days 1 through 7 and moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day
      8. The moxifloxacin treatment group will provide a concurrent active control to confirm that
      the study is adequate to detect a drug effect (i.e., assay sensitivity) on QTc interval.
      Baseline ECGs will be recorded on the last day of the washout period (Day 1). Serial time
      matched 12 lead ECG triplicate readings will be recorded on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (predose), 8,
      9, and 10. This study is being conducted to thoroughly assess potential QT/QTc interval
      changes following administration of paliperidone. The results from this safety study, along
      with the ECG results from all paliperidone clinical studies, will be used in the evaluation
      of the cardiovascular safety of paliperidone. Paliperidone IR orally once daily: 4 mg on Day
      2, 6 mg on Day 3, and 8 mg on Days 4 through 8; Active control: a single oral dose of
      moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 8
