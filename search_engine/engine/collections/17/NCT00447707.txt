      the Positive Choice intervention achieved significant reductions in drug use. These findings
      were reported in a poster presentation at the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto,
      Canada, in August 2006. A final analysis of outcomes data was conducted in fall 2006
      (September - December). Aggregate results from all five study sites are summarized below.

      We found a high prevalence of risky behaviors in our sample (497/918, or 54%) and achieved
      high retention for follow-up in both groups (>80%). We found significant elimination of any
      drug use in the intervention group at both follow-ups. Among all participants who reported
      drug use at baseline, 66% of intervention participants continued their drug use at 3-month
      follow-up compared to 85% of control participants (OR 0.356, p<0.01). At 6-month follow-up,
      59% of intervention participants continued their drug use compared to 88% of the control
      group (<0.001). Among participants who reported methamphetamine use at baseline, 58%
      continued their methamphetamine use at 3-month follow-up compared to 83% of control
      participants (OR 0.285, p=0.02). At 6-month follow-up, 53% of intervention participants
      continued their methamphetamine use compared to 73% of the control group (OR 0.344, p=0.03).
      We also found significantly less unprotected sex with casual partners by intervention
      participants at 3-month follow up (69% vs. 87%, OR 0.313, p=0.04), and fewer intervention
      participants who exceeded the recommended number of drinks per week at 3-months (53% vs. 78%,
      OR 0.310, p=0.02) Our findings indicate that the Positive Choice program was effective at
      reducing important behavioral risks among HIV-positive adults in care. Positive Choice is an
      appropriate and effective adjunct to routine medical care for HIV-positive adults.
