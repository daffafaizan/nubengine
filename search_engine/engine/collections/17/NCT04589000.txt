      Numerous integrative treatments support to overcome this problem.

      This randomized controlled experimental study will conduct to determine the effect of
      acupressure on lactation in non-breastfeeding mothers following preterm caesarean delivery.

      The sample of the study will comprise of 64 mothers (32 acupressure-experimental and 32
      control group), who will randomly select from among the primipara mothers of premature
      newborns delivered through cesarean section at Dursun Odabaş Medical Center of Van Yüzüncü
      Yıl University. Before the implementation, the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale and the
      Richard Campbell Sleep Quality Scale will apply. In post-operative three days, 15-minute
      acupressure will implement in the morning/evening, for acupressure-group mothers and pump
      milking will apply; control group mothers will only milked in mornings and evenings.
      Lactation symptoms will evaluate with Visual Analog Scale and acupressure satisfaction with
      Analog Patient Satisfaction Scale, and milk quantities will record.
