      patients with a greater burden of NOAF complicating AMI were challenged by a poor prognosis.
      In the present study, we aim to design a multicenter, prospective, hospital-based registry to
      validate the preceding findings. We plan to enroll patients who were admitted for AMI in 9
      tertiary medical centers from Shanghai, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces and developed NOAF
      during the index hospitalization. All eligible patients' demographics, cardiovascular risk
      factors, comorbidities, laboratory tests, echocardiography data, angiography data, and
      medications will be collected. NOAF burden is calculated by dividing the total AF duration by
      the total continuous electronic monitoring (CEM) duration. Other NOAF related
      characteristics, such as AF pattern, AF frequency, and symptomatic or silent AF, and the
      longest AF episode duration will also be evaluated. All patients who are discharged alive
      will be followed for at least 2 years and cardiovascular outcomes will be recorded.
