      etiologically significant Attention Biases (AB) favoring threatening cues. However, the
      specific facets of AB that drive this vulnerability as well as their neurocognitive
      correlates are unclear, due in large part to the poor psychometric properties of the
      traditional assessment of AB in this field. By using both a standard behavioral task and a
      novel eye-tracking task, this study aims to unpack the nuanced facets of AB related to
      anxiety risks. Additionally, well-controlled Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) tasks
      designed to train attention away from threatening cues can be used to experimentally
      manipulate the causal mechanisms of interest, and to test whether ABM reduces symptoms and
      alters patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC, the intrinsic brain activity
      that occurs outside specific tasks) that characterize anxiety risks.

      This study will recruit 60 11-13-year-old healthy adolescents with heightened anxious
      symptoms but without clinically significant anxiety disorders. They will be randomized to a
      six-session ABM training or a placebo task. Both before and after the training, the
      investigators will assess their anxious symptoms, AB, and rsFC. By examining the risk
      processes prior to the onset of clinically significant anxiety disorders, our work will make
      important new contributions to our understanding of how AB eventuates in anxiety and will
      have direct implications for early identification of youth at highest risk for anxiety
      disorders, and the targets that should be focused on in preventative efforts.
