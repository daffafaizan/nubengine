    
      An open-label, single arm, multicentre study to determine the virologic and immunologic
      responsiveness of women, who previously received a regimen of nevirapine for the prevention
      of MTCT, to a regimen of nevirapine and ZDV+3TC treatment. As well as to evaluate the
      proportion of patients who fail this treatment at 24 and 48 weeks, and to evaluate the
      resistance profile of HIV isolates from patients who fail nevirapine and ZDV+3TC treatment.

      Study Hypothesis:

      When a drug leading to selection of a resistant viral population is withdrawn the original
      wildtype virus, over time, becomes the predominant virus again. However, low frequency (below
      level of detection) of drug resistant viral sub-populations may be retained which could mean
      that the drug resistant variant might reappear rapidly should the same drug be reintroduced
      as part of combination therapy at a later stage.Therefore this study is proposed to evaluate
      whether there is an impact of single dose nevirapine for the prevention of MTCT on the
      subsequent response to a standard HAART regimen that contains nevirapine.
