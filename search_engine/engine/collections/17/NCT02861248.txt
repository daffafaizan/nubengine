      various techniques, fractional microplasma radiofrequency technology (FMRT) has proved to be
      effective for various types of scars and skin conditions such as rhytids, striae distensae,
      and hyperpigmentation.

      Method: A prospective clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      FMRT for treating non-hypertrophic post-burn scars in an Asian population. All patients
      underwent three to five treatment sessions at intervals of 8-16 weeks. The patient and
      observer scar assessment scales (POSAS) were use to evaluate changes in the burn scars before
      and after treatment. Intermediate and long-term adverse events were recorded for outcome
      analysis.
