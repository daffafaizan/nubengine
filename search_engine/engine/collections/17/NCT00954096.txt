      basis of smoking induced tissue injury remains unclear but considerable evidence supports a
      role for oxidant stress (OS).

      Arterial function has been shown to be impaired in smokers even before the onset of
      angiographically demonstrable atherosclerosis. Defects in endothelium dependant flow mediated
      vasodilatation (FMD) are seen in those at risk of or with overt vascular disease.

      Cigarette smoking is highly addictive. Spontaneous quit rates approximate 3%. Even those
      using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) have high relapse rates (67-75%) on completion of
      the 8-12 week course of NRT. Thus there is interest in the use of extended NRT as a "safer"
      alternative to cigarette smoking. However such assumptions may be premature. Nicotine
      demonstrates proxidant effects in vitro and in small studies has been associated with
      endothelial dysfunction. Studies simultaneously assessing the effects of nicotine on
      oxidative stress and arterial function in humans have not been performed.

      The current proposal will address the hypothesis that nicotine, like cigarette smoking acting
      as a pro-oxidant may have adverse effects on arterial function.
