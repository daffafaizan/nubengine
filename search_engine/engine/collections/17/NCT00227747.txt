      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising radiotherapy and
           capecitabine with vs without oxaliplatin followed by total mesorectal excision, in terms
           of the rate of complete surgical resection, in patients with resectable stage II or III
           rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall and disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare clinical tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare acute and late toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine biological parameters that predict tumor response and treatment-related
           toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare sphincter preservation and function in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week and receive capecitabine
           once daily 5 days a week in weeks 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patient undergo radiotherapy and receive capecitabine as in arm I. Patients also
           receive oxaliplatin once weekly in weeks 1-5.

      All patients undergo total mesorectal excision 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients will be accrued for this study.
