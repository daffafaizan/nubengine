    
      A prospective, randomized postmarket trial to assess the efficacy of the Select TENSâ„¢ Pain
      Management System, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, for reducing
      pain and narcotics requirement in patients managed with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This
      will be a placebo-controlled study involving 116 patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA
      procedures; 58 patients will be randomly selected to be treated postoperatively with an
      active TENS unit and the other 58 patients will be randomly selected to be treated with the
      placebo TENS unit (control group). Patients will be enrolled at two sites within the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System (Main Campus and Lutheran Hospital). Both treatment and
      control groups will receive a femoral nerve catheter, standard during a primary TKA. It is
      hypothesized that TENS (in combination with a femoral nerve catheter) can reduce narcotic
      usage, reduce pain, and allow for a quicker return to function following TKA.
