      elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation - is a key pathogenetic mechanism for
      morbidity and mortality in ALI/ARDS, and is associated with tissue insensitivity and/or
      resistance to inappropriately elevated endogenous glucocorticoids. In one study, prolonged
      methylprednisolone treatment of ARDS patients resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in
      circulating and pulmonary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and procollagen.

      Preliminary work. Two recent metanalysis evaluating the use of low doses of corticosteroids
      in acute lung injury/ARDS in adults reported a significant physiological improvement, a
      sizable reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and reduction
      in mortality.

      Hypothesis. We hypothesized that prolonged administration of low doses of methylprednisolone
      in pediatric ALI/ARDS is safe and downregulates systemic inflammation and leads to earlier
      resolution of pulmonary and extra pulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of
      mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

      Objective. To investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone infusion on
      pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days), extra pulmonary organ function (PMODS
      score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6 (Interleukine 6), TNFÎ± (Tumor
      Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10) and length of Pediatric
      Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children.

      Study design. Prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.
