      recovering from anesthesia is unknown. Indeed, many studies are achieved in reanimation or
      ICU. That's why this prospective study is about patients' satisfaction after their stay in
      the post-anesthesia care unit. In a first part, noise is just measured with a sound level
      meter and patients are asked about their experience. Before the second part, during few days,
      nurses will be informed about noise consequences on heath. With some precaution, a decrease
      of the sound level in a room (ex: decrease scope alarms, speaking quietly, not slamming the
      drawer, noise warning deviceâ€¦) will be expected. The main objective is to determine the
      patient's satisfaction in the post-anesthesia care unit before and after installation of a
      noise warning device.
