      Moderate to severe psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life. Psoriasis is
      associated with an increased risk of depression, social isolation, unemployment. In addition,
      it has recently be shown that patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have an increased
      incidence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, overweight, hyperlipidemia and
      exposure to tobacco and alcohol. These so-called comorbidites may have a negative impact on
      psoriasis management. They also may account for the reduced life expectancy reported in
      patients with severe psoriasis. Therapeutic education is a structured process whose objective
      is to help patients to acquire or to maintain competencies that are required to live with a
      chronic disease. Therapeutic education is an important process to be integrated into the
      therapeutic strategy. It has to take into account co-morbidities, social and psychological
      context and its priorities need to be defined with the patient.
