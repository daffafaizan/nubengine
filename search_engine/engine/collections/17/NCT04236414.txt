    
      A Phase I open-label, multicentre study to determine the RP2D of olaparib monotherapy in the
      paediatric population, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PDx and preliminary
      efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in paediatric patients from â‰¥6 months to <18 years of age at
      enrolment, with relapsed or refractory solid or primary CNS tumours (excluding lymphoid
      malignancies) for whom there are no standard treatment options. It is anticipated that
      eligible patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria, will include but will not be limited to those with osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
      non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and
      glioma.
