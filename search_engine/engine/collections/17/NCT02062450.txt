      "Dual Mobility Cup" used during primary total hip replacement or hip replacement revision
      surgery at a minimum of 24 months post-implantation. The primary endpoint is to determine the
      dislocation rate observed during post-surgical follow-up. The secondary endpoints are to
      assess, in the short-term, the following: clinical performance on the basis of clinical
      scores and hip mobility; radiological performance, particularly in terms of positioning and
      fixation of the implant; as well as the reliability of the implantation of this acetabular
      cup on the basis of any complications observed
