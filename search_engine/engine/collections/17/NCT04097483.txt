      of life and increased mortality rates due to complications, comorbid depression or both.
      Prognosis in diabetes and depression comorbidity can be improved by increasing treatment
      adherence. Nurse-led, telephonic-based, and psychoeducational interventions, centred on
      motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy for adherence and depression,
      have separately improved prognosis and emotional distress in diabetic patients with comorbid
      depression.

      The Telephonic Monitoring on Diabetes and co-morbid Depression (TELE-DD) Project aims to
      integrate prior well-stablished clinical research with collaborative care. A whole population
      cohort of adults (21+) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and comorbid depression from twenty-three
      Health Centres from a whole Health System Region in Spain, will be approached for inclusion
      in the TELE-DD Project (N=7,271). Patients with confirmed diagnoses and pharmacological
      treatment for both diseases will be included in Phase I baseline cohort. In Phase II, 400
      participants diagnosed with depression and T2D with no treatment adherence will be selected
      to participate in the randomised controlled trial (RCT). The TELE-DD Project is a three-stage
      both observational and comparative effectiveness study that includes a population-based
      cohort study (Phases I and III), and a nurse-led randomised controlled trial (Phase II),
      aimed to compare a telephonic-based psychoeducational intervention (TIG) vs treatment as
      usual (TAU) to improve treatment adherence (TA), and a further two- to five-year prognosis
      and cost-effectiveness study, in T2D patients with comorbid clinical depression from Primary
      Care (PC) services.

      The integration in the TELE-DD Project of previous clinical research and a robust
      epidemiological design, will improve treatment adherence and further prognosis in these
      through maximising clinical outcomes improvement, while guaranteeing cost-effectiveness and
      the long-term sustainability of findings translation to PC clinical practice services and
      public health programs.
