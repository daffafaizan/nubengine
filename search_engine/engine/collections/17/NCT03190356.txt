      disorder (AUD) and are enrolled in MAP's System where dedicated Case Managers are monitoring
      the Client's relapse risk levels. Soberlink's remote alcohol system will provide data to
      inform the Case Manager if the Client has relapsed or is at risk of relapsing through the use
      of testing data compiled by the Soberlink System. Integrating Soberlink results into MAP's
      EMR will allow Case Manager to make better clinical decisions and reduce costs by mitigating
      the chances recidivism through early intervention. Clients will use the Soberlink Device for
      a period of 90 days.
