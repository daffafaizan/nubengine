      clinician. Current prediction studies report non-conclusive results on the most important
      predictors and are limited by used computational methods. Traditional statistical analyses
      which focus on correlations are biased by predictor- and confounder-selection by the
      investigators. Modern computational methods like machine learning prediction models are less
      limited by sample size and can consider a wider range of predictors which leads to less
      selection-bias.

      Retrospective patient data is collected from multiple international centers. This
      retrospective, multicenter cohort is used to validate the model which is developed based on a
      single-center retrospective cohort.

      The goal is to develop a prediction tool that provides the clinician with a probability for
      weak response during the preoperative phase. This could support the clinician in including or
      informing the patient during preoperative counseling.
