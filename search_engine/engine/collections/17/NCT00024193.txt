        -  Determine the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and
           consolidation chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
           patients with metastatic neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the tolerability and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the medium and long-term results in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 6 hours on days 1
      and 2 and doxorubicin IV continuously and vincristine IV continuously over days 1-3 of
      courses 1, 2, 4, and 6. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and etoposide
      IV over 2 hours on days 1-3 of induction courses 3, 5, and 7. Patients also receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 of courses 3, 5, and 7
      and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days.

      At the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection. Patients in
      complete remission receive high-dose consolidation chemotherapy comprising oral busulfan
      every 6 hours on days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV over 2 minutes on day -2. Autologous
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are reinfused on day 0. Patients with n-myc tumor
      amplification undergo radiotherapy at least 70 days after PBSC transplantation.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
