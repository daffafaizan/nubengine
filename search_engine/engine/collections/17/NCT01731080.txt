      calcifying inherited autosomal disease, exhibited specific structural and functionnal
      features within the peripheral arteries. We now want to quantify and determine the
      preferential sites of the arterial wall calcification (Agatston score) between these patients
      compared to diabetics and patients with chronic renal insufficiency with mediacalcosis.

      All variables will be collected from a cohort of PXE monitored in our PXE Health and Care
      centre at the university hospital of Angers. Quantification of the arterial wall calcium load
      will be performed using helicoidal CT-scan. These variables will be compared to the same
      measurements performed in type 2 diabetic and chronic kidney disease patients paired by age
      and gender.
