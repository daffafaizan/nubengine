      OCT, designed to examine choroidal and microvascular retinal structure in patients with
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in age and sex matched healthy controls. The
      study is non-invasive and takes only a few seconds to acquire these complex images. The
      Centre, where the images will be captured and where image analysis systems are located, is on
      the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) site close to the RIE outpatient clinics, making
      recruitment easy.
