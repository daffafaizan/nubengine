      functional status of the affected joints. This may provide clinicians with an understanding
      of the different treatment modalities that may improve the quality of life of patients
      suffering from chronic knee OA. Which may benefit a wide range of individuals affected by
      this chronic and widespread disease all over the world.

      Although little is known about the efficacy or mechanism of action of what has been termed
      ''high-intensity laser therapy'' using Nd: YAG lasers it has become commercially available in
      veterinary practice and is being marketed for the treatment of musculoskeletal disease.
      clinical research specific to Nd: YAG high-intensity laser therapy is required, as it is
      being used with little supporting evidence.

      As there was no evidence about the best protocol for the treatment of knee OA as each study
      was using different doses, different sites of application, different number of phases,
      frequency of sessions, and the interval between sessions that make it difficult to have the
      best results. Specifically, the dosage range in literature was ranged from 1250 to 3000 J as
      total energy transmitted during one treatment session. The current study is an attempt to
      answer the question of which dosage of the energy of high-intensity LASER is more effective
      on pain and functional activities in patients with chronic knee OA at the third degree of
      osteoarthritis as determined by (Kellgren/Lawrence grading system) as it was recommended that
      LASER is an ideal treatment for subjects in the later stages of OA .
