      population. The limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions stimulates the search for
      other options, in order to increase the therapeutic success. Acupuncture is widely used for
      pain control in several pathologies. A modality of intramuscular stimulation to quantify the
      intensity of the stimulus is electro acupuncture (EAC) that the intensity of 2 Hz accelerates
      the release of enkephalins, endorphins and beta-endorphins. The application of electric
      currents to modify brain function is a very old technique. The transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is based on applying transcranial direct weak current (usually above 2mA)
      through electrodes in a non-invasive, simple and painless. Other advantages include low cost
      and the possibility of a placebo reliable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      ability to reduce pain and improve functionality in chronic pain for knee osteoarthritis with
      two techniques, one that promotes a bottom-up approach (EAC) and other top-down (tDCS). We
      will seek to analyze the efficacy of them separately and together, seeking summation of
      results.
