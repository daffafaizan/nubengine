    
      Lean and Obese post pubertal adolescents perform an aerobic exercise program 30 minx4/week at
      a heart rate corresponding to at least 70% of that obtained at VO2 peak. The exercise program
      is preceded and followed by a 7 d diet delivered by the metabolic research kitchen (identical
      on both study occasions); metabolic studies (identical on both study occasions) including 24h
      calorimetry, measurements of glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity and
      secretion using compounds labelled with stable i.e. non radioactive isotopes and gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry.Fat mass and lean body mass are measured by DXA and
      visceral/subcutaneous, hepatic and intramyocellular fat by MRI/MRS. Since we want to
      specifically determine the effects of exercise, there is no intent of weight loss. The
      subjects are weighed twice a week to assure weight stability.
