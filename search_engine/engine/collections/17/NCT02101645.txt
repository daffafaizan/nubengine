      Primary: Proof-of-concept study of bioimpedance measurement based method for monitoring of
      chronic wound healing and assessment of efficacy of compression therapy. Gathering
      bioimpedance data from the patients with a lower extremity ulcer of venous etiology over
      their healing process. The investigators will seek methods for processing the collected data
      to find the best correlation with visually observed healing of the wound.

      Secondary: Proof-of-concept study of periodical LIDC wound stimulation. The investigators
      will compare the LIDC enhanced healing outcome with appropriate archived data of previous
      studies performed in TAYS.

      Other: Analysis of the received data and reliability evaluation of the methods. Gathering
      relevant user feedback from medical personnel and patients.
