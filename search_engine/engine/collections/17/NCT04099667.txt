    
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of
      a single-dose of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with lower limb monoplegia
      or hemiplegia spasticity due to stroke or TBI, followed by an open-label extension safety
      study of multiple doses. The primary goal is to assess efficacy of MYOBLOC versus placebo in
      the treatment of adult lower limb spasticity. The secondary goals are: to establish a safe
      and efficacious dose of MYOBLOC (administered intramuscularly as a single total dose, to
      assess the duration of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC after a single administration, and to
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC after multiple administrations at
      13-week intervals over a minimum duration of 1 year.
