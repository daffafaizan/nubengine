      evidence-based treatment in improving exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and
      quality of life. Oxygen supplementation during exercise induced dose-dependent improvement in
      endurance and symptom perception in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Recently,
      nasal high flow therapy which consists of high flow gas with an FiO2 ranging from 0.21 to
      nearly 1.0 adjusted by an oxygen blender, brought to body temperature, and saturated with
      water through an in-line humidifier is available.

      The present study is randomised to compare the effect of exercise endurance between oxygen
      therapy with rehabilitation and nasal high flow therapy with rehabilitation for the patients
      with chronic respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.
