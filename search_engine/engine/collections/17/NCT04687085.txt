      intervention on anxiety and satisfaction regarding epidural catheter placement for laboring
      parturients.The investigators hypothesize that a brief mindful meditation intervention,
      consisting of a 10 minute auditory instructional practice, implemented before epidural
      catheter placement will:

        1. Decrease anxiety

        2. Increase satisfaction

      compared to a neutral 10 minute auditory recording control, in participants undergoing labor
      epidural catheter placement.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate whether anesthesia providers experience
      a difference in satisfaction with labor epidural catheter placement in participants who
      listen to a brief mindful meditation intervention prior to epidural catheter placement. The
      investigators hypothesize that anesthesia providers placing labor epidural catheters in
      patients who listen to a brief mindful meditation intervention prior to labor epidural
      catheter placement will:

      1. Experience an increase in satisfaction with labor epidural catheter placement.
