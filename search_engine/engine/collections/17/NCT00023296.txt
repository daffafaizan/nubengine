      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.
      Pulmonary hypertension has now been identified as a major cause of death in adults with
      sickle cell disease. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as a possible therapy for
      both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, a number of recent studies
      have suggested that NO may have a favorable impact on sickle red cells at the molecular level
      and could improve the abnormal microvascular perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell
      anemia. In addition, chronic exchange transfusion therapy may reduce the progression and/or
      severity of pulmonary hypertension in these patients.

      This clinical trial is designed (1) to determine the pathophysiologic processes that are
      associated with and potentially contribute to secondary pulmonary hypertension in adult
      patients with sickle cell anemia, by comparing the cardio-pulmonary status of patients with
      sickle cell disease with and without pulmonary hypertension (2) to determine the relative
      acute vasodilatory effects of oxygen, intravenous prostacyclin, and inhaled nitric oxide on
      pulmonary artery pressures and other hemodynamic parameters in patients with secondary
      pulmonary hypertension and sickle cell anemia, (3) to determine the effects of two months of
      inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary artery pressures, other hemodynamic parameters, exercise
      tolerance, and symptoms in this patient population, and (4) to determine the effects of three
      months of exchange transfusion on pulmonary artery pressures, other hemodynamic parameters,
      exercise tolerance, and symptoms in patients who do not receive or fail to respond to NO
      therapy.
