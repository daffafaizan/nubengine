      million people in the United States. Making healthy food choices, such as those in the DASH
      (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, has been shown to improve blood pressure
      control in people with high blood pressure. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      source of dietary protein (pork or chicken/fish) as a part of the DASH diet affects blood
      pressure control in adults with high blood pressure.
