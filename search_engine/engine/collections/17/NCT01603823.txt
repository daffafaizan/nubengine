      been introduced and allows for higher-resolution imaging. Based on this technology we can
      identify variable changes at the retinal surface such as, retinal thickening with cyst
      formation, swelling in the inner and outer nuclear layers and subretinal fluid. The
      introduction of an eye-tracking mode has allowed a better insight into the development of
      retinal morphologic changes The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and
      structural morphology of PCME after successful uncomplicated cataract surgery in patients
      with previous pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and indocyanine green-assisted peeling of an
      epiretinal membrane and the internal limiting membrane (ILM).
