    
      Two-arm, parallel design with participants randomized (15 per group) to reduced-carbohydrate
      diet or a reduced-fat diet for 8 weeks. Anthropometric evaluations, lab work for lipid
      levels, insulin and C peptide levels, resting energy expenditure evaluation, DXA scan and
      cardiovascular markers will occur at baseline during the initial clinic visit. Individual
      dietary counseling will be provided at baseline and as well as weekly diet-specific support
      will be provided with a phone call from the PI. Dietary intake will be assessed with weekly
      food records (weeks 1-8). The return visit on week 8 will include a visit identical to the
      initial visit except the resting energy expenditure will not be revaluated, and the
      participants will be asked to answer a questionnaire about the diet they were consuming.
