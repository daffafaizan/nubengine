      Mutation carriers were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal resection was performed upon
      pending malignancy. Resectable desmoid tumors were excised, whereas large tumors of the
      abdominal wall were treated by a combination of brachytherapy (BT) and radiotherapy (RT).
      Outcome was analyzed with respect to length of tumor-free survival, and morbidity from
      surgery or radiotherapy. Results: 37 of 105 family members have GS. Preventive colorectal
      resections were performed in 16 patients (15%), with one death due to subsequent gastric
      cancer. In 4 patients who denied screening endoscopy, invasive tumors of the colon (3
      patients) and stomach (one patient each) developed. Of 33 desmoid tumors, 10 (30%) were
      located in the mesentery, 17 (52%) in the abdominal wall, and 6 (18%) in extra-abdominal
      sites. Excision of 12 desmoids was performed in 8 patients (36%), and 4 were treated by a
      combination of BT and RT. Following BT/RT, all patients showed full or partial remission.
