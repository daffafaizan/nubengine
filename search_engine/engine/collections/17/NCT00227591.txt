      I. To evaluate the rate of complete or partial remission from treatment with a combination of
      lenalidomide and prednisone in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine drug toxicity. II. To examine duration of response. III. To examine the effect
      of treatment on bone marrow fibrosis, angiogenesis, and cytogenetics.

      OUTLINE:

      For courses 1 and 2, patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily and oral prednisone once
      daily on days 1-28. For course 3, patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28
      and oral prednisone once on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27.
      Patients with stable or responding disease after course 3 receive oral lenalidomide alone
      once daily on days 1-28 for courses 4-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 5 years from study entry.
