      people who have newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. This study will look at the efficacy of ponatinib in
      participants in addition to standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 230-320 participants. Participants will be randomized in
      a 2:1 ratio to receive oral ponatinib or imatinib (Cohort A and Cohort B, respectively) daily
      throughout the study.

      All participants will be asked to take ponatinib or imatinib at the same time each day with
      reduced-intensity chemotherapy in induction phase (Cycles 1 to 3), consolidation phase
      (Cycles 4 to 9) and maintenance phase (Cycles 10 to 20). At the end of the 20 cycles,
      participants will remain on ponatinib or imatinib (administered as a single agent). The dose
      of ponatinib in consolidation and maintenance phase will start with the last dose given in
      the previous phase. The dose can be modified based on MRD-negative CR results.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Brazil,
      Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, France, Mexico, Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea, Republic Of, Poland,
      Romania, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Province Of China, Turkey, Finland and the United States.
      Participants including those who achieve a clinical response, may receive study drug until
      they are deceased, have failed to achieve the primary endpoint, have experienced relapse from
      CR or have progressive disease, have an unacceptable toxicity, have withdrawn consent, have
      proceeded to HSCT, or until the sponsor terminates the study, whichever occurs first. After
      disease progression, all participants will be contacted every 3 months for survival
      follow-up. Participants will be followed until completion of the study or until the
      participant's death has been reported.
