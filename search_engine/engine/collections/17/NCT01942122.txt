      will be randomized to receive any of the following regimens: 1) DLBS1442 at a dose of 3 x 100
      mg daily, or 2) DLBS1442 at a dose of 3 x 200 mg daily; or 3) mefenamic acid at a dose of 3 x
      500 mg daily. DLBS1442 will be taken every day along the study period (8 weeks), while
      mefenamic acid will only be taken for five (5) days during the menstrual period, i.e. day 1st
      to day 5th of menstrual period. Study treatment will be given at a standardized starting
      point for all subjects, i.e. on the first day of their respective menstrual periods. Clinical
      and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and safety will
      be performed at baseline and every 4-week interval throughout the study period.
