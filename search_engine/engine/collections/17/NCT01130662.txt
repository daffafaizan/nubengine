      providing significant disease control is a priority for most clinicians. To address the need
      for less toxic, more effective treatments for older patients with AML, the purpose of this
      Phase 1 single institution study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of midostaurin and
      decitabine administered in combination.

      Decitabine is an epigenetic modifier of gene expression that has been shown to be
      well-tolerated in this population at the dose schedule proposed in this study, with
      reasonable efficacy. Although its precise mechanism of action is incompletely understood, it
      is postulated to work by reactivating the expression of key tumor suppressor genes silenced
      in tumor cells by reversing a pattern of hypermethylation of promotor elements.

      Midostaurin is an oral agent that has been shown to inhibit FLT3 kinase in preclinical in
      vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinically in patients with both ITD and TKD FLT3
      mutations (FLT3mut). Both directly and indirectly, midostaurin also potently inhibits
      multiple other molecular targets thought to be important for the pathogenesis of AML. These
      targets include VEGFR-1, a VEGF receptor; c-kit; H- and K-ras; as well as the multidrug
      resistant gene, MDR.

      The addition of midostaurin to a decitabine regimen of previously established efficacy and
      tolerability will allow us to evaluate the hypothesis that two drugs that are believed to
      work through distinct mechanisms of action may act together to improve the responses of
      patients treated with decitabine alone, without significant additional toxicity.
