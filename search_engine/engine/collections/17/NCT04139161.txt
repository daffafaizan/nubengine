      osteoarthritis is primarily observed in the medial compartment. This is in part attributable
      to the increased load experienced by the medial compartment during level walking. Patients
      with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis exhibit altered gait mechanics; namely a reduced loading
      response knee extension moment and an increased internal knee abduction moment. As a
      surrogate measure for medial compartment joint loading, loading response knee abduction
      moment in level walking has been shown to increase with the severity of knee osteoarthritis.

      Recent gait modification research has shown that increased step-width decreases peak Knee
      abduction moment for persons with knee osteoarthritis. The inter-pedal width of a bicycle or
      cycle ergometer, known as Q-Factor, is analogous in cycling to step-width in gait. In
      contrast to gait, increased Q-Factor has been shown to increase the knee abduction moment
      during stationary cycling. Modulating sagittal and frontal plane loading of the knee in a
      graded manner during cycling may promote healthy adaptation to muscle weakness and pain. This
      adaptation may be manifest through restoration of altered knee joint biomechanics (knee
      extension moment, knee abduction moment), which, in turn, may also provide benefit to gait
      mechanics.
