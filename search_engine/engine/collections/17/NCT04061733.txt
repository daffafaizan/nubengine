    
      Prospective, multicenter study, unmasked, single-arm, to study the safety and efficacy of a
      new hydroxyethyl cellulose hydrogel for the treatment of the knee pain caused by
      osteoarthritis. The working hypothesis is that the effect of hydrogel use on the study
      population will result in a reduction in pain in the knees affected by symptomatic OA.

      The general objective of this study is to generate clinical evidence of the safety and
      efficacy of the new hydrogel used as a treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

      The patient's perception of the pain caused by osteoarthritis in the knee joint before and
      after the treatment under evaluation will be quantify. Subjects' quality of life before and
      after treatment will also be evaluated. Monitoring of the adverse events associated with the
      use of the device under evaluation will be determined. Subjects will be follow-up for 12
      months.
