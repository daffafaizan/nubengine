        -  Determine the metabolic status and regulation of primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia (T-ALL) relative to control resting peripheral T cells.

        -  Establish the effects of metabolic inhibition on metabolic stress pathways and
           apoptosis.

        -  Determine how metabolic inhibition interacts with chemotherapy or targeted therapy drugs
           to kill T-ALL cells.

      OUTLINE: T-ALL samples cultured alone or with gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) or PI3K
      inhibitors are analyzed for metabolic characteristics including glucose transporter 1 (Glut1)
      expression, mitochondrial mass, phospho-flow for 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by flow
      cytometry. T-ALL samples and normal CD4+ T cells (control) are also exposed to ±
      2-deoxyglucose or ± the glutaminolysis inhibitor media and analyzed for metabolic stress
      responses over time in particular, AMPK activation, autophagy (immunofluorescence for LC3-II
      processing), and BCL2-associated X protein (Bak) and Bax activation to indicate apoptosis.
      These cells (T-ALL and control) are then cultured with cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, or
      the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor, ABT-737, to determine cell death over time.
