    
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the impact of 8
      intravenous infusions of RSLV-132 in 28 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Each of the
      subjects will be randomized 3:1 (active:placebo) and will receive 8 infusions of 10 mg/kg of
      RSLV-132 or placebo as follows on days:

      â€¢ 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, and 85

      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 60
      days prior to study entry (i.e., prior to Baseline visit). Following Baseline evaluations on
      Day 1, subjects will receive their first infusion of RSLV-132 or placebo. Subjects will
      return to the research unit for follow-up visits as described in Appendix A.

      Dose selection rationale: The dose level was chosen based on safety and tolerability data
      from Protocol 132-02 (multiple ascending dose study in SLE patients). Additionally, in a
      6-month toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, 50 mg/kg of RSLV-132 was administered by IV
      infusion weekly. No dose-limiting toxicity was noted, therefore the No Observed Adverse
      Effect Level is at least 50 mg/kg, providing at least a 5-fold safety margin for this study.

      RSLV-132 shall be prepared for each subject from individual stock vials provided by Sponsor.
      Details of dilution, dose preparation, and administration instructions will be provided in
      the Study Drug Reference Guide. The dose for each individual shall be based on the subject's
      body weight.
