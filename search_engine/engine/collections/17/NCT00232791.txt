      study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting
      Coronary Stent as compared to the CYPHER™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent. A total of 100
      patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to the CYPHER
      SELECT™ stent or the CYPHER™ stent. 100 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions
      <23 mm in length and more than 2.5 to less than 3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate who
      meet all eligibility criteria will be either randomized.
