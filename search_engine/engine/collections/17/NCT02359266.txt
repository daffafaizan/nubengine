      depression. A recent meta-analysis reported an inverse correlation between depression and
      vitamin D levels. Indeed, vitamin D receptor is present and genomic and nongenomic vitamin D
      receptor-mediated signalling has been described in brain.

      This intervention study investigates whether vitamin D therapy ameliorates depressive
      symptoms in chronic liver disease patients.

      The investigators hypothesise that depressive symptoms will improve upon vitamin D
      replacement therapy.
