      Center of the Nanfang Hospital, China. Routine bowel preparation consisted of 4 L of
      polyethylene glycol, given in split doses. Colonoscopies were performed with high definition
      colonoscopes and high-definition monitors.

      All subjects shall sign informed consent before screening, and subjects shall be included
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      A total of four endoscopists were included in the study, two in each group of senior
      endoscopists (>1000 colonoscopies) and two in each group of junior endoscopists ( <1000
      colonoscopies).

      Patients were randomly enrolled into the senior endoscopy group and the junior endoscopy
      group, and received artificial intelligence assisted colonoscopy and conventional colonoscopy
      successively. The two colonoscopy methods were performed by different endoscopy physicians
      back to back with the same seniority.

      All patients were examined and treated according to routine medical procedures (outpatient
      patients and inpatients who did not sign the consent form for polypectomy were not resected
      for the lesions detected during the examination, while inpatients who signed the consent form
      for polypectomy were left in the original position after the first colonoscopy and removed at
      the end of the second examination).

      The routine colonoscopy group and the artificial-intelligence-assisted colonoscopy group made
      detailed records of the patients' withdrawal time, entry time, number of polyps detected,
      polyp Paris classification, polyp size, polyp shape, polyp location and intestinal
      preparation during the colonoscopy process.
