    
      70 datasets from hospitalized patients will be acquired in order to characterize the
      functional status of the autonomic nervous system as well as hemodynamics during baseline and
      during standard procedures including physical exercise testing and head-up tilt table
      testing.

      Autonomic reflex testing:

        -  Heart Rate Characteristics

        -  Heart Rate Variability

        -  Heart Rate Turbulence

        -  Blood Pressure Variability

        -  Baroreflex Sensitivity

        -  Hyperoxic Chemoreflex Sensitivity

      Hemodynamic Monitoring:

        -  Heart Rate Trends

        -  Blood Pressure Trends

        -  Pulse Wave Characteristics

        -  Cardiac Output

        -  Peripheral Vascular Resistance

        -  Context information
