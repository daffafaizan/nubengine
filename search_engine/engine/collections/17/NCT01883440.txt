    
      Persons that are convinced of that they have caught an episode of common cold can be included
      into the study within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.

      Before they start the treatment with the nasal spray they perform a viral sample from the
      nose and also fill in the WURSS-21 protocol. After this the persons spray with glucose
      oxidase+glucose/only saline+glucose 5 times the first day and thereafter 3 times daily for a
      total treatment of one week. Every day the included persons fill in the WURSS-21 protocol.
