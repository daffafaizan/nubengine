      Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the Consolidated
      Standards of reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement guidelines. The examiner will be blinded to
      group assignment. If eligible, patients will be allocated to the experimental group (EG) or
      the control group (CG) using an automated randomization system (Allocation ratio 1:1). The
      group allocation will be kept concealed by means of sealed numbered envelopes. The
      randomization list was locked in a desk drawer accessible only to the main investigator. All
      the treatments and assessment will be performed in the Neurorehabilitation Unit of Azienda
      Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona (Italy).

      Patients will be asked to complete a daily headache diary, which is routinely administered to
      all patients with CM admitted at our Unit for OnabotulinumtoxinA prophylaxis. In the context
      of this study, daily headache diaries during 1 month pre-treatment (T0), during the treatment
      (treatment phase) and 1 month post-treatment (T1) will be considered.

      Moreover, at T0 a questionnaire concerning clinical and demographic data as well as some
      habits like consumption of coffee and alcohol, and smoking will be administered. According to
      the nature of the study feasibility and efficacy outcomes will be defined. Feasibility
      outcomes were the patients' compliance during treatments, any adverse events (i.e. pain,
      discomfort) occurred during the treatment, and the number of training session performed.
      Primary and secondary outcome measures will be categorized as efficacy outcomes.
