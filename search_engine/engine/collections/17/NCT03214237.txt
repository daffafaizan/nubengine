      population, thereby allowing development of strategies and protocols for managing these
      problems. There have been a number of studies examining these variables in elderly residents
      in care homes and a few in long term hospital settings (over 1 year admission), but only one
      in the UK previously in acute hospitals. Therefore the published literature is sparse, and
      requires further data collection. The oral health of the elderly, but particularly the
      institutionalized, is increasingly recognised for its important relationships with general
      health, wellbeing and quality of life. This study will provide useful information to address
      these concerns.
