      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously untreated CLL. Responses in the
      range of 90-98% with 55% complete responses are reported. However, bone marrow toxicity has
      been a significant problem. This trial is designed to reduce the bone marrow toxicity by
      decreasing the doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, but doubling the dose of rituximab
      with a maintenance dose of rituximab for up to two years, to maintain or even enhance
      efficacy.
