      homocysteine concentrations can be lowered through betaine supplementation. However, effects
      of choline supplementation, the precursor for betaine, on plasma homocysteine concentrations
      in healthy humans are unknown. If supplementation with choline or phosphatidylcholine, the
      form in which choline occurs in foods, lowers homocysteine concentrations, then extra intake
      of these compounds may lower cardiovascular disease risk in humans.

      Comparison: We compared the effects of supplementation with phosphatidylcholine to the
      effects of a placebo on fasting and post-methionine concentrations of plasma homocysteine in
      healthy men.
