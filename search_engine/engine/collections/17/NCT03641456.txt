      burden, either in preparation for consolidation with high-dose melphalan therapy with
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or as a means in itself to provide long-term
      disease control. The degree of disease reduction is associated with improved outcome,
      including prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),both after
      preparation for or after consolidation with ASCT,and in patients not proceeding to ASCT.The
      introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the immunomodulatory drugs
      thalidomide and lenalidomide has been associated with improved survival. Combinations of
      bortezomib or lenalidomide with conventional anti-MM drugs have demonstrated very high
      overall response rates and quality of response in the front-line setting, as reviewed
      recently.The phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination
      with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
      patients who receive lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone(VRD) Combination as
      induction therapy.The investigators gave patients subcutaneous bortezomib on days 1, 8,15,
      and 22; oral lenalidomide on days 1 to 21; and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15 and 12 of
      a 28-day cycle.Patients are allowed to interrupt therapy for collection of stem cells at any
      time after three cycles of induction, and to proceed to stem-cell transplantation after four
      cycles of induction at the discretion of the treating physician.Two months after hematologic
      recovery, nonprogressive patients are to receive consolidation therapy comprising two 4-week
      cycles of VRD or the second autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (determined by
      the attending physician according to the patient's physical condition, willingness and the
      number of CD34 + cells collected).Patients who do not proceed to stem-cell transplantation
      receive a total of 12 courses of VRD induction therapy(dexamethasone dosage will be reduced
      to 20mg from the 9th course of treatment). Responding patients could receive maintenance
      therapy comprising 4-week cycles of bortezomib on days 1 and 15 at the dose level of 1.3mg/m2
      and lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 at the dose level of 10mg.Participants discontinued
      treatment if participants had progressive disease or unacceptable toxic eff ects not
      controlled with dose modifications.
