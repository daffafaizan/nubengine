    
      This is a pilot study, with the goals of

        1. developing data for a subsequent randomized trials

        2. describing the pain trajectory after total shoulder arthroplasty given comprehensive
           multimodal perioperative analgesia

        3. gathering preliminary data about which shoulder arthroplasty patients are at high risk
           for moderate or severe postoperative pain (NRS with movement, POD14, moderate >= 4- 6;
           Gerbershagen 2011; severe >= 7-10, Krebs 2007) Potential factors include fibromyalgia
           score, catastrophizing score, anxiety/depression score, gender, preoperative opioid use

        4. gathering preliminary data on the potential association between the predictors listed in
           (c) and NRS pain score with movement on POD 14.

        5. estimating incidence and severity of postoperative bruising on POD 14
