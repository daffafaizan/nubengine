      classification of LNT relies upon morphology. Recently, in the World Health Organization
      (WHO) classification, Ki-67 rate has been proposed for classi fication. It is, however, known
      that Ki-67 count has a poor interlaboratory reproducibly. For that reason, our team has
      looked for a new biomarker.

      GLUT1 protein a facilitative glucose transporter protein which has ubiquitous expression in
      mammalian. GLUT1 is overexpressed in many human cancers. But, no study has evaluated the
      GLUT1 staining as an aid diagnosis in LNT.
