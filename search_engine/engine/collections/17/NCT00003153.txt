        -  Assess the response rate of patients with recurrent multiple myeloma after an allogeneic
           marrow transplant from a genotypically HLA identical sibling donor treated with donor
           lymphocyte infusions as salvage therapy .

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this treatment when used as salvage therapy in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive initial cell dose of donor lymphocytes (CD3+ cells) IV over 15-30
      minutes. Patients with rapidly progressive disease may skip the initial cell dose and proceed
      directly to dose escalation to receive CD3+ cells at a higher cell dose. Patients who achieve
      complete response to the initial treatment may receive up to 2 additional courses of
      escalating doses of CD3+ cells 8-12 weeks apart in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks after each infusion. Patients with disease
      progression at 8 weeks are retreated at that time. Patients who achieve partial response or
      stable disease at 8 weeks are re-evaluated at 12 weeks and may then be retreated.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 3 months, once a month for 9 months, and then every 2
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
