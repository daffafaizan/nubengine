      unacceptable levels of morbidity and mortality. Many children are seen each day in the
      accident and emergency departement of an hospital. Therefore the A&E departement have an
      important role in the identification of child maltreatment. The lack of an effective teaching
      program together with the failures in the child protection process has encouraged the
      development of a clinical-practice-oriented e-learning program on detecting child
      maltreatment. We will investigate the effect of this e-learning program.
