      pterostilbene 125 mg twice daily; (3) pterostilbene 50 mg/grape extract 100 mg twice daily;
      (4) matching placebo twice daily taken either one hour before or two hours after a meal.
      Blood and urine will be collected at enrollment and final study visits. If the patient's low
      density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) or total cholesterol (TC) is not within the inclusion criteria
      based on enrollment blood drawn, the patient will not be allowed to initiate study
      medication. All study visits will consist of brief clinical examination (including vital
      signs), subjective adverse event reporting, and fasting donated blood and urine for clinical
      laboratory tests. Pill counts will be done to assess compliance.
