      stable COPD patients with mild-to-moderate were involved, 80 COPD patients with severe and
      very severe, and age, sex, all matching 40 cases without lung disease. The participants
      information was collected. Whole blood and pulmonary function were examined at three time
      points: admission, six months and one year, at the same time, targeted metabolomic analysis
      method are applied to detect serum metabolites, According to the access to assess the
      different severity of COPD in the stable period and the level of metabolites in different
      admission periods. After that, correlation analysis was conducted with pulmonary function
      indicators and other clinical indicators to observe the research value of
      inflammation-related metabolites in the development of COPD.
