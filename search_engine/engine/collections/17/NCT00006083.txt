    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if dalteparin will reduce the incidence of clinically significant
      catheter related complications (i.e., asymptomatic catheter related thrombosis) in cancer
      patients receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to treatment center and catheter placement (proximal to axilla vs
      distal to axilla). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) daily. Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC daily.
      Treatment continues for 16 weeks or until catheter removal in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 345 patients (230 in arm I and 115 in arm II) will be accrued
      for this study over 6 months.
