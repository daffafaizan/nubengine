      possible but not later than 12 hours after trauma. Patients in Group 1 will receive open
      label study drug (VAS203). Patients in Group 2 and 3 will be randomised to treatment with
      VAS203 or placebo.

      In addition to study treatment, each patient will receive the best "standard of care" for the
      study centre; no treatment will be withheld.
