      carrier vehicle (icodextrin 4%) begins 2 weeks later, and 2 days after that, treatment with
      dextrin sulphate (DS) commences. DS is given three times per week. A nurse delivers initial
      treatments and the patient and caregiver will be trained to give subsequent treatments until
      DS has been given a total of 8 weeks. Patient evaluations are done regularly during treatment
      and observation continues for 24 weeks.
