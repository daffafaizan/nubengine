      prevalence, seriousness, vulnerable populations, the utility of population health strategies,
      and the importance of prevention at both the population and individual levels. Its incidence
      and prevalence are increasing with an aging population and the rise in obesity. When
      considering the location of chronic pain and its aetiology, back pain was the most common
      location with arthritis/osteoarthritis being the most common cause. Chronic low back back
      pain is costly to nations-not just in terms of health care expenditures and disability
      compensation but also in terms of lost school days, lost productivity and employment, reduced
      incomes, and lost potential and quality of life.
