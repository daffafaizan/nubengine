      in order to deliver a smaller, yet effective dose for subclinical disease while giving a
      higher dose to gross disease for patients with more than one brain metastasis. In this study,
      a dose of 30 Gray (Gy) will be prescribed to subclinical sites and 60 or 45 Gy to visible
      brain metastases.

      There is evidence from previous studies (including Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
      0933) that hippocampal avoidance during whole brain radiotherapy using IMRT may decrease
      toxicity in the form of memory loss. Patients who had brain metastases within the region of
      hippocampal avoidance were not eligible for enrollment on RTOG 0933. In contrast, this study
      will include this group of patients since IMRT will be used to not only deliver higher doses
      to visible brain metastases even though they are located within the hippocampal avoidance
      region, but also to avoid the hippocampus itself. This approach may help to preserve memory
      function. Additionally, while temporary (and sometimes permanent) alopecia results from
      conventional whole brain radiation, IMRT spares the skin and possibly decreases the rate of
      hair loss. Dose to the scalp will be limited to as low as possible in order to decrease the
      risk of permanent alopecia in this study.
