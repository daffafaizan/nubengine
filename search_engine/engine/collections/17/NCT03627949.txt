      approach (repeated measure). For achieving small effect size of 0.15 (Lippke, Fleig,
      Wiedemann, & Schwarzer, 2015), with a power (1-Î²) of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05, the total sample
      size was 306. Assuming a drop-out rate of approximately 30%, a total of 399 participants were
      required for the study evaluation.

      The effects of the intervention were evaluated by performing several analyses of MANOVA and
      MANCOVA measured at three points in time (8-week apart pre-post measures, and four weeks
      follow-up; T1-T3).In addition, moderated multiple mediation analysis was performed
      (Independent variable: intervention; Moderators: stage; Dependent variable: behavioural and
      social-cognitive outcomes). Baseline characteristics of participants who dropped out were
      compared with participants who finished the intervention to examine whether drop out is at
      random or determined by specific characteristics.
