      screening evaluation session.

      Following the screening evaluation, participants who pass the medical screening and meet all
      other inclusion criteria will be scheduled for their first assessment and then randomized to
      receive standard varenicline (SV), extended varenicline (EV), or extended varenicline plus
      facilitated extinction (EV + FE). The randomization list will be generated by the study
      statistician. It will be stratified by gender and will employ a variable block randomization
      that will guarantee that the arms are balanced when a given block is filled.
