      the study is designed to test the hypothesis that the onset of the antiplatelet effect
      90mg-first-dose of ticagrelor will be more rapid and greater than 300mg-loading-dose of
      clopidogrel evaluated by P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) measured by Verify NowTM P2Y12 assay at 1
      hour in patients undergoing one-stop HCR. The first dose of study drug (ticagrelor 90mg or
      clopidogrel 300 mg) will be administered as powder via a nasogastric tube after conÔ¨Årmation
      of left internal mammal artery to left anterior descending coronary antery (LIMA-LAD) graft
      patency during the HCR procedure. Approximately 60 patients will enrol for the study.
      Patients will be randomized equally (ratio 1:1) to the two treatment arms of this study. The
      anticipated duration of the study is approximately 15 months, including an anticipated
      enrolment period of 12 months and follow-up period of 3months.
