    
      A. D/C clopidogrel 5 days prior to surgery

      B. Continue ASA (Increase dose to 325 mg until prohibitive bleeding risk)

      C. Check baseline IIb/IIIa and P2Y12 via the Verify Now device prior to initiating tirofiban

      D. Start Tirofiban 2 days prior to the procedure (Patient MUST be on a monitored bed)

        -  Load Tirofiban ONLY if P2Y12 (Verify Now Assay) platelet inhibition is < 20% OTHERWISE
           initiate only the continuous infusion dose

        -  Creatinine clearance > 30mL/min: Tirofiban 0.4 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by
           continuous infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min

        -  Creatinine clearance < 30mL/min: Tirofiban 0.2 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by
           continuous infusion of 0.05 mcg/kg/min

      E. Check steady state IIb/IIIa inhibitor verify now assay (>8 hour after initiation)

      F. Hold Tirofiban 12 hours prior to procedure

      G. Check IIb/IIIa inhibitor verify now assay (10-12 hours after Tirofiban is discontinued)

      H. CBC pre and post op

      I. Reload clopidogrel> 24 hours post op (300 mg X 1 then 75 mg daily) unless prohibitive
      bleeding risk

      J. Reduce ASA to pre-procedure dose. Restart ASA, 24 hours port-op if it was D/C prior to
      procedure

      K. Check P2Y12 via the Verify Now device post-loading dose of clopidogrel (test cannot be
      performed w/in 48 hours of the D/C of IIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban)
