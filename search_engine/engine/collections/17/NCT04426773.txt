      magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) biomarkers that would predict
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) response in obsessive-compulsive disorder with
      cathode electrode targeting orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). 30 OCD patients will be recruited to
      this study and performed once a day, five times a week direct current stimulation treatment
      for two weeks. The investigators will assess symptom severity before and after two weeks of
      tDCS. Through the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）, the Obsessive
      Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Pittsburgh
      sleep quality index (PSQI)and side-effect questionnaire will be obtained by a trained
      investigator. Resting state electroencephalography and TMS-EEG testing will be conducted
      before and after tDCS treatment.
