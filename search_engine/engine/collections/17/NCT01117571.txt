      implant designed for patients with damage isolated to either the medial or lateral
      tibiofemoral compartment of the knee. The study subjects will be followed for 10 years post
      implant. The study objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the ConforMIS iUniÂ®
      Unicompartmental Knee Resurfacing Device in patients with single compartment osteoarthritis.
      The iUni is a patient-specific unicompartmental resurfacing device designed from the
      patient's unique anatomy using proprietary software which interprets data from the patient's
      CT scan. The patient matched implant design is then coupled with unique patient-matched
      disposable instrumentation designed using the same CT data and software. The follow-up visit
      schedule will include visits at 6 weeks, 6 months (optional), 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10
      years post implant.The remaining follow-up data collected at years 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 may
      be collected via phone call/email and does not require a subject visit to the site.The study
      sites will be located in the United States.
