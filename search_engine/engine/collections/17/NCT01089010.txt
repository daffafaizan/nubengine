      study of CK-2017357 in patients with ALS. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized to one of six
      different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods; in
      each dosing periodÂ¸ patients receive a single oral dose of placebo, 250 mg of CK-2017357, or
      500 mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number
      of patients. A washout period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed
      between the doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effect of CK-2017357
      on maximal voluntary muscle strength, on the development of fatigue at maximal and
      sub-maximal voluntary muscle contraction, and on selected pulmonary function parameters. The
      plasma concentration of CK-2017357 will be measured at selected time points after each of two
      single doses of CK-2017357 in men and women. The plasma concentration versus time data
      obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model and estimate
      inter-subject variability of PK parameters in this target patient population, in particular
      between male and female study patients.
