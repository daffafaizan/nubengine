      barriers that altered design could bring to overcome these barriers in the design of a large,
      pragmatic, multi-center clinical trial. It is also designed to estimate the effect size and
      variance of the main outcome measures, trust and fear, in patients undergoing rehabilitation
      after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study team hypothesizes that intramuscular (IM)
      oxytocin, in a dose and time determined by a series of previous studies under this grant to
      target the brain, will enhance trust and reduce fear and that these will be associated with
      improved outcomes. Again, the study is not designed to test this hypothesis, but to gather
      the critical data necessary to test it in a large, multi-center clinical trial that would
      follow this grant.

      Participants that have decided to undergo unilateral TKA, will come to the Pain Clinical
      Research Unit at least 48 hours prior to surgery to confirm consent and complete a series of
      questionnaires. Participants surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative medication and therapy
      treatment will be routine. On the first outpatient study visit participants will complete a
      questionnaire of fear about pain and receive an intramuscular injection of oxytocin or
      placebo in a randomized, double blind manner. At the end of this session participants will
      complete a questionnaire assessing the degree of trust in the therapist. Physical therapy be
      will routine, and the fear and trust questionnaires will be completed at the 2nd, 4th, 8th,
      and last physical therapy session as well as routine measures of progress and function. The
      primary outcome measure is assessment of effect size and variability of the trust and fear
      questionnaires on the 1st and 2nd visit.
