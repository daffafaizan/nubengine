        -  Establish a central pancreatic cancer specimen (including serum and peripheral blood
           lymphocytes) repository to serve as a resource for current or future scientific studies.

        -  Utilize the clinical database to perform clinicopathologic correlation with the results
           of those studies.

        -  Test new hypotheses as they emerge.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Blood is collected from patients with pancreatic cancer at baseline and then every 3-6 months
      for up to 2 years. All other participants have blood collected at baseline and complete
      questionnaires at baseline and then every 3-6 months for up to 2 years. Serum and peripheral
      blood lymphocytes obtained from the blood samples are frozen and stored.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients and 200 other participants will be accrued for
      this study.
