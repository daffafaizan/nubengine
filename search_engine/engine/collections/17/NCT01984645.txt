      of the admission of their patients, and how they want to get involved in the care of that
      patient while he/she is in hospital. The investigators will also look at the data in the
      Electronic Health Record system to understand how providers are acting in response to the
      notifications.

      Lastly, the investigators will determine if the notifications have resulted in any change in
      the care of the patients, specifically in terms of the number of days from discharge until
      the next clinic visit.
