      The endpoints are response rate-RR, disease control rate-DCR, PFS-progression-free survival,
      CTCAEv5.0 toxicities, plasma lipid levels, collection of sebaceous secretion via Sebutape,
      and 11C-acetate PET tumor imaging.

      In the first stage, 13 patients will be enrolled. If fewer than 2 patients achieve response,
      the study will be stopped. If 2 or more patients have a radiographic response, an additional
      21 patients will be enrolled , for a total accrual of 34 patients.
