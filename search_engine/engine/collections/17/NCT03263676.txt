      States. Multiple studies have compared effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and comfort of a
      variety absorbent products but most of the current data compares daily disposable insert
      pads. Icon reusable underwear is a new product on the market for light incontinence (25-30mL
      daily). The primary objective of this randomized cross over trial is to compare quality of
      life and patient comfort and to determine patient preference using Icon reusable underwear
      versus standard incontinence pad in the management of urinary incontinence. The secondary
      objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness of ICON underwear to disposable pads. Women
      with small to moderate urinary incontinence to use either ICON underwear or pads for two days
      and then crossed over to use other product for two days. The primary outcome measures were
      Incontinence Quality of Life Instrument 3 (I-QOL) and Product Performance Questionnaire 4
      (PPQ) after use of each product. A sample size of 70 was calculated to detect a difference of
      10.0 in the I-QOL to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level of 0.05 and to account
      for a 20% attrition.
