      training (WBVT) and diet on arterial function, autonomic function, and body composition in
      obese women. Specific aims of the study are to:

      To evaluate the extent to which diet and (WBVT) will improve body composition assessed by
      changes in fat mass and lean mass using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and waist
      circumference.

      To investigate that combined diet and (WBVT) are more efficacious than either treatment alone
      in ameliorating cardiovascular disease risk factors by assessing arterial stiffness (aortic,
      systemic, and leg), aortic BP and wave reflection, and autonomic function (heart rate
      variability, vascular sympathetic activity [low-frequency power of systolic BP variability],
      and baroreflex sensitivity). Flow mediated dilation and circulating levels of adipocytokines
      (adiponectin and leptin) and endothelial-derived vasodilators (NO metabolites [NOx], 6-keto
      PGFIa, insulin, and ghrelin) and vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1 [ET-1],8-iso PGF2a,vascular
      endothelium growth factor [VGEF]) will be assessed as secondary outcome variables.
