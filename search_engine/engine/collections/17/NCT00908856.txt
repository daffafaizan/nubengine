      as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, have been approved to interrupt stroke in the
      early hours after symptom onset. Many patients are not able to benefit from these therapies,
      however, and so a need exists for development of new interventions to reduce disability after
      stroke. This study will be an early step towards this, and will examine the safety of two
      cell types, mononuclear cells and marrow stromal cells. In each case, the cells will be
      autologous, specifically being derived from the subject's own bone marrow.
