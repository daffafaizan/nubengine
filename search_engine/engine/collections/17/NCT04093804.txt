      patient's range of motion (ROM) following RSA. Some researchers have shown an association
      between increased glenosphere size and improved ROM, but no study has determined the absolute
      minimal motion differences that would be recognizable or beneficial by patients. This is
      mostly attributable to limitations such as small sample sizes as well as the fact that
      shoulder dynamics are multifactorial in nature. Most studies have shown an increased ROM with
      larger glenosphere sizes.1 Because smaller patients are often times female and receive
      smaller implants, female patients may be more susceptible to limited ROM. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if a larger glenosphere allows for greater ROM in female patients
      undergoing RSA.
