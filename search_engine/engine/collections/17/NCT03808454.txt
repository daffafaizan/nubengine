      therapy, autologous PRP injection therapy, autologous PRP injection combined with general
      rehabilitation therapy randomly. The investigators also use the new ankle proprioception
      evaluation system and evaluation of clinical function after treatment. It is expected to
      establish another feasible and rapid treatment method for ankle sprain. Combined with high
      accuracy ankle body defect evaluation method, it is helpful to design proper treatment and
      rehabilitation strategy in the future so as to improve the rehabilitation of limbs
      Coordination and control capabilities.
