        -  Determine the percentage of patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who
           achieve a major hematologic improvement after treatment with arsenic trioxide.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with high-risk MDS who achieve complete or partial
           remission or major hematological improvement after treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine the durability of responses in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk score (low
      risk vs high risk).

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with stable disease or better may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients
      who achieve a complete remission (CR) should receive 2 additional courses of treatment after
      documentation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 4 weeks
      after study completion.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months until completion of study treatment, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-110 patients (15-55 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
