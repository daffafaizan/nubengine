      removal (VV-ECCO2R) in severe acute exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation (IMV) to facilitate early extubation in terms of reducing mortality or severe
      disability. The study hypothesizes that avoiding IMV could reduce mortality and substantially
      improve quality of life, especially in regard to avoidance of tracheostomy and long-term home
      IMV. Improvement in mobility due to sooner recovery has a further major impact on patients'
      QoL.

      After randomization patients with acute exacerbation of severe COPD, requiring invasive
      mechanical ventilation will be treated either with conventional care or VV-ECCO2R to
      facilitate early extubation. VV-ECCO2R is used in a standard configuration with either double
      lumen cannula (22-24Fr) or two small single vessel cannulas (15-19 Fr), allowing a blood flow
      rate between 1-1.75 L/min.

      Conventional care in the control arm includes invasive mechanical ventilation and the attempt
      to extubate the patient as early as possible and to switch to non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
      If extubation fails, tracheostomy can be performed according to the discretion of the
      treating physician.
