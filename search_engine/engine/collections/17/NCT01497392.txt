    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of dovitinib
      (dovitinib lactate) when administered concurrently with gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of dovitinib, gemcitabine and capecitabine combination
      in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of dovitinib, capecitabine, gemcitabine and
      their metabolites when administered concurrently in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies.

      II. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract.

      III. To explore serum and tumor biomarkers predictive of efficacy to the study combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dovitinib lactate.

      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and capecitabine PO twice
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
