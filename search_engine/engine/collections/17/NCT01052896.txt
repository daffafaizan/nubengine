      the adequacy of dyspepsia symptom control at two months as well as improvement in dyspepsia
      symptom index scores which are a surrogate of quality of life measures, when compared to
      placebo.

      While functional dyspepsia is divided into four subtypes most studies have grouped all four
      as 'functional dyspepsia' and treated them as one. Proton pump inhibition may benefit those
      with epigastric pain or burning but typically not those with post-prandial fullness or early
      satiety. (Tack et al). Those patients with symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibition
      might benefit from a medication that modifies visceral hypersensitivity such as gabapentin.
      It is possible that by modifying their pain syndrome we can decrease the need for follow-up
      appointments and improve patient quality of life.
