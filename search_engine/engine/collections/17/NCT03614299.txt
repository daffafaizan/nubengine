      This could be due to a lack of sensitivity of the outcome measures used so far to define the
      response. In this study, investigator will evaluate the feasability, tolerability, and
      performance of new tools to assess disease evolution:

        -  investigator will develop a webapp to measure the intensity of the symptoms at home on a
           daily basis (ecological assessment)

        -  investigator will evaluate new ophthalmologic procedures, already used in other
           conditions but never in pSS, which assess the severity of eye involvement in the disease

        -  investigator will develop an automated method to score the severity of ocular surface
           lesions in the disease.

      Patients with a diagnosis of pSS will be included in the study, will undergo detailed
      ophtalmologic examination, and will then use a webapp, installed on their smartphone, to
      score their symptoms everyday during 3 months.
