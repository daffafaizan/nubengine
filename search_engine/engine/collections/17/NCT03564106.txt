      happen. It could be hurt when playing sports or if fall down.

      Sometimes start hurting when the ligaments that hold the SI joint together are damaged, which
      may make the joint move abnormally. The pain associated with sacroiliitis most commonly
      occurs in the buttocks and lower back. It can also affect the legs, groin and even the feet.
