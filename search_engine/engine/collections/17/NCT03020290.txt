    
      Patient will be recruiting during 1 year. Patient will be followed in the study during 2
      years. Pre-operative exams are collected. Patients are asked to give their oral authorization
      to participate in the study by their surgeon.

      Patient can be included up to the next day of the intervention.

      Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesion with SuperA stents during medical care:

      Intervention will be achieved in operative room, under local anesthesia and sedation or
      general anesthesia. An angio-CT or an arteriography is necessary to attest the presence for
      TASC C or D lesion involving the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries.

      The long femoropopliteal lesion must be pre-dilated during 3 minutes with a balloon of 1mm
      diameter more than the stent to be implanted.

      A control arteriography will be done before the implantation of the stent and at the end of
      the intervention to assess the success of the procedure.

      If needed, endovascular treatment could be realized on the inflow or outflow in the same
      time.

      Patient follow-up :

      Patient follow-up is performed at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Follow-up will systematically
      include a clinical evaluation and a duplex scan with the ankle brachial index (ABI).

      The x-rays and the quality of life questionnaire will be done at 1, 12 and 24 months.

      All clinical surveillance events, complications and re-hospitalizations will be collected.
