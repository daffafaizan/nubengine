      power is used together and taking into account the rising number of participants in
      non-professional leagues, it is especially popular among female athletes from various
      countries . Basketball players' muscular strength and endurance, power, speed, agility and
      physical properties such as reaction time are the main factors underlying the performance. In
      addition to this, respiratory functions are important as well as physical properties in
      basketball. Because during the maximal exercise, the blood flow to the inspiratory and
      expiratory muscles accounts for 15% of the total oxygen cost of the exercise. Assessment of
      the motor skills and physical characteristics of basketball players is very important for the
      positioning of the player, performance analysis and monitoring the effectiveness of the
      training. There are many studies examining the physical fitness characteristics of basketball
      players.However, no study evaluating respiratory muscle strength and endurance in female
      basketball players was found in the literature.therefore, this study was planned.
