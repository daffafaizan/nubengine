      investigators' goal is to determine if magnetic resonance imaging can provide an accurate
      diagnosis of ALS by looking at chemical concentrations in the spinal cord at the neck level
      which show up in MRI imaging and compare these chemical concentrations to corresponding
      measures in healthy control subjects.
