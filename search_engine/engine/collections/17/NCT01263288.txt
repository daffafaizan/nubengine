      countries in Norway. As a background for preventive strategies it is important to have best
      possible knowledge about health consequences of poor vitamin D status, and in this respect
      much is lacking.

      The investigators will aim to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscular
      strength , musculoskeletal pain and headache among non-western immigrants in Norway with
      background from Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In addition the intervention gives us the
      opportunity to study the effect of vitamin D on indicators of other important health issues
      including anemia, diabetes , lipids, inflammation, metabolism and bone health. The study will
      also contribute with insight on how to achieve a high compliance. This is of interest in a
      broader context as poor compliance has been experienced as a problem in primary health care
      among immigrants with poor vitamin D status.

      The study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial which compares two doses
      of vitamin D supplements, 400 IU and 1000 IU, with placebo and the tablets will be taken
      daily in a period of 4 months. Three muscle strength tests will be used, and they will be
      performed before and after the intervention: Counter movement jumps, Chair rising and
      Handgrip. Level and location of musculoskeletal pain and headache will be recorded at
      baseline and at end of the study.

      A blood sample will be collected from the study subjects at baseline and after 4 months. The
      level of vitamin D and markers of anemia, metabolism and bone turnover, inflammation,
      diabetes, lipids and kidney function will be measured.
