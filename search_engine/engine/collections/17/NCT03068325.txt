      research methods (evaluation interviews, assessment measures, videotaping procedures) are
      acceptable to participants. Specifically, the investigators will focus on issues such as
      session length, appropriateness of the "content" for treatment of PTSD, ordering of session
      content, adherence to the manual of the equine therapeutic team (based on observations made
      during supervision and feedback from the consultants), and will detail logistics of data
      collection and how best to record the sessions (camera angles, etc.).
