      5-year scoliosis in the control group in the past using steroids alone was 70% in patients
      with confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When applying the portable seat device
      (experimental group), the incidence of scoliosis is expected to decrease to 50% (ie, 35%
      because of 50% of 70%) compared with using steroid alone.

      In this study, investigators will enroll 70 control subjects who did not use the portable
      seat device through retrospective data. The number of subjects required to show the
      difference between the significance level of 5% and the power of 80% was 19, and 28
      participants with DMD are required considering 30% dropout rate.
