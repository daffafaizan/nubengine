      Furthermore, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are being
      increasingly applied in medical fields such as medical education and training, surgical
      simulation, neurological rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and telemedicine. Research results
      demonstrate the ability of VR, AR, and MR to ameliorate the inconveniences that are often
      associated with traditional medical care, reduce incidents of medical malpractice caused by
      unskilled operations, and reduce the cost of medical education and training. What is more,
      the application of these technologies has enhanced the effectiveness of medical education and
      training, raised the level of diagnosis and treatment, improved the doctor-patient
      relationship, and boosted the efficiency of medical execution. The present study wants to
      design a training program for chemotherapy with using VR. Then the investigators design a
      protocol to compare the training effects in VR program and ISO document.
