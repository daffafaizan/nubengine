      acid or placebo in additional to conventional therapy. All patients with gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage who are admitted to the ICU are managed in consultation with the GI physicians.
      The ICU team in consultation with the gastroenterology team will manage these patients.
      Tranexamic acid will be administered in a dose of 1 gm intravenously every 6 hours for four
      days.

      The majority of patients with GI bleeding will spontaneously stop bleeding. However, in those
      patients that do not and are hemodynamically unstable it poses a significant management
      challenge. Management of these individuals includes resuscitation followed by endoscopy as
      well as therapy guided by clinical diagnosis. With optimal therapy mortality in these
      individuals remains high and the amount of blood transfusion on occasions turns out to be
      massive and often the outcomes are futile. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that
      has been shown to be associated with reduced bleeding and transfusion requirement in surgical
      patients. We would like to randomize patients to receive either Tranexamic acid or placebo in
      addition to conventional therapy and monitor outcome.

      This study should provide us with information about the efficacy of this medicine in patients
      with upper GI bleeding. Data from this trial will provide us information about utility of
      pursuing this modality of therapy.
