        1. To determine whether a 20- herb formulation improves pain/ discomfort and disturbed
           bowel frequency in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome who have been disappointed
           with current conventional Western medicine.

        2. To identify an optimal dosage of the 20- herb formulation that is safe and well
           tolerated for up to 8 weeks of treatment, among 2 dosages. This is determined by relief
           of symptoms of IBS in a dose escalation, placebo-controlled double- blind randomized
           clinical trial, in conjunction with indices of safety and tolerability.
