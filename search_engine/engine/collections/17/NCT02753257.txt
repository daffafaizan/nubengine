      test that determines the expression of a multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate stroke
      from no-stroke in the emergency setting. Five hundred patients aged 18 years or older who
      present to the hospital with stroke-like symptoms will be recruited within 24 hours of
      symptom onset at participating clinical sites. Data will be obtained from the medical
      records. Blood for research purposes will be obtained. Research evaluations for stroke
      severity, symptoms and outcome will be performed by trained personnel. All clinical
      evaluation and management will be per standard of care.

      The primary outcome of this study is the criterion standard stroke diagnosis. This will be
      used to estimate the diagnostic test characteristics of a multi-omic biomarker profile in the
      peripheral whole blood for distinguishing stroke (IS, TIA, SAH, ICH) versus non-stroke in ED
      patients with acute neurologic symptoms. Secondly, the investigators will estimate the
      ability of the multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate between stroke subtypes. A
      diagnosis of stroke will be defined as clinical syndromes consistent with stroke (i.e.,
      sudden onset neurological deficit) plus imaging confirmation (or symptom resolution and lack
      of imaging findings in TIA). Finally, the investigators will explore the relationship between
      the multi-omic profile and time from symptom onset in ischemic stroke patients. Descriptive
      and inferential statistics will be used to address the aims of the study. Pattern recognition
      analysis and machine learning will be employed as a systems level approach to determine
      relevant pathophysiologic pathways associated with diagnosis and symptom onset time.
