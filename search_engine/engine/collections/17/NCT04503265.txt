    
      AMXI-5001 is an orally available dual PARP (poly adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose
      polymerase) and microtubule polymerization inhibitor. ATLAS-101 is a Phase I/II, open label,
      multi-center, non-randomized Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion study in participants with
      advanced malignancies. Study enrollment is approximately 82 participants. All participants
      receive oral AMXI-5001, twice daily, as monotherapy. Following Phase I (Dose Escalation) to
      identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Dose for use in Phase II, additional
      participants will be enrolled into the Dose Expansion Phase to further characterize the
      safety, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy of AMXI-5001.
