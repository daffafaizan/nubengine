      identity of the intervention), study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single 28
      milligram (mg) dose of esketamine in both participants with varying stages of hepatic
      impairment and healthy participants. The participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups (8
      participants per group) based on hepatic impairment which will be classified during
      Screening. Cohort 1 (participants with moderate hepatic impairment), Cohort 2 (participants
      with mild hepatic impairment), and Cohort 3 (participants with normal hepatic function and no
      evidence of liver damage). Participants will self-administer a single dose of intranasal
      Esketamine 28 mg. The total duration of the study from Screening through Follow-up, is
      approximately 34 to 38 days. Blood and urine samples for assessment of Esketamine
      pharmacokinetics will be collected for up to 60 hours after study drug administration.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
