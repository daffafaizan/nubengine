      interscalene brachial plexus nerve block produces hand and forearm anesthesia. The
      investigators will investigate this issue in patients having shoulder and not hand/forearm
      surgery. We will test hand grip strength and sensation to determine if the hand and forearm
      are responding to the anesthesia.
