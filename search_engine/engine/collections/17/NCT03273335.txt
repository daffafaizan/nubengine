      patients develop postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a syndrome of postoperative
      thinking and memory deficits. Although distinct from delirium, POCD (like delirium) is
      associated with decreased quality of life, long term cognitive decline, early retirement,
      increased mortality, and a possible increased risk for developing dementia such as
      Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the etiology of POCD will likely help promote strategies
      to treat and/or prevent it. A dominant theory holds that brain inflammation causes POCD, but
      little work has directly tested this theory in humans. The preliminary data of this team
      strongly suggest that there is significant postoperative neuro-inflammation in older adults
      who develop POCD. In this K76 award, the investigators will prospectively obtain pre- and
      post-operative cognitive testing, fMRI imaging and CSF samples in 200 surgical patients over
      age 65. This will allow the investigators to evaluate the role of specific neuro-inflammatory
      processes in POCD and its underlying brain connectivity changes.
