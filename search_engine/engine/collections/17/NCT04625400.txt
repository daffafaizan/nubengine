      intubation in 4 patients with upper airway obstruction.The most common causes of acquired
      tracheal stenosis are endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy. Tracheal stenosis is a
      surgical problem managed non operatively by bronchoscopic dilation, endoluminal treatment
      with lasers, and stenting. Bronchoscopic management have a good success rate. PI and post
      tracheostomy stenosis (PT) are recognized with an 4.9 cases per million per year in the
      general population. Prolonged intubation can result in tracheal stenosis at various levels
      within the trachea.Tracheal stenosis occurs at the endotracheal tube cuff site in one third
      of the reported PI cases [9] and appears as a web-like fibrous. The mainly postulated cause
      is loss of regional blood flow.This injury begins within the first hours of intubation, and
      healing of the damaged areas within 3 to 6 weeks. Large volume, low pressure cuffs has
      reduced the occurrence of cuff injury.Patients in the ICU are common to have respiratory
      involvement, with 30-50% of the admissions requiring the use of mechanical
      ventilation.Flexible bronchoscopy has become the procedure of choice in most examinations of
      the tracheobronchial tree.The incidence of PI tracheal stenosis ranges from 6-21% and
      following tracheostomy ranges from 0.6-21%.
