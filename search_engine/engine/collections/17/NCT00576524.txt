      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Generally, children do not tolerate having more than 3-4% of
      their body weight removed during each dialysis session thus necessitating multiple sessions
      each week to ensure effective renal replacement. Excessive fluid removal is often associated
      with nausea, vomiting, hypotension and cramps resulting in serious complications in patient
      care during and immediately after dialysis as well as reduced patient compliance. The
      development of novel therapies to increase the amount of fluid removed during each session
      without a corresponding increase in the incidence of complications is therefore very
      important to improve quality and compliance with hemodialysis; and eventually survival of
      children with ESRD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of the impedance
      threshold device during hemodialysis in children to optimize fluid removal, reduce the
      incidence of complications (such as cramps,vomiting and hypotension), and device tolerance.
