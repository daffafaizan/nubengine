      the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Dexamethason also had been
      commonly used for ajuvant drugs for preventing and reducing PONV. So investigator want to
      study about the effect of dexmedetomidine only or combined with dexamethasone for preventing
      PONV.
