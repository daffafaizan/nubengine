    
      This is an open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, phase I, dose-escalation study to define the
      toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of
      SGN-40 in patients with refractory or recurrent multiple myeloma.

      A minimum of three patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort. All patients will
      receive a dose-loading schedule during the first two weeks. The maximum weekly dose will be
      16mg/kg.
