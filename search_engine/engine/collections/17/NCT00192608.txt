      the quality of life and survival of many people with HIV. However the treatments do not
      always work over long periods, as medications are often difficult to take due to side effects
      and a large numbers of pills to be taken. This has lead researchers to look for new ways to
      treat HIV with medications that require fewer numbers of pills and have fewer side effects.

      Atazanavir and saquinavir are two drugs used to treat HIV and come from the same class of
      drugs known as the protease inhibitors. Atazanavir has the advantage of being taken only once
      a day. Saquinavir is available in a new formulation (type of pill), which will require fewer
      numbers of pills to be taken daily.

      AIM The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of these two drugs used together with
      ritonavir as a once daily HIV treatment, which will consist of 6 tablets.

      Furthermore this study will look at blood drug levels in individuals on atazanavir,
      saquinavir and ritonavir with and without the new saquinavir formulation to ensure blood
      levels of these drugs are adequate.

      For individuals currently on the old saquinavir formulation, this study will also look at
      blood drug levels before and after changing to the new formulation.
