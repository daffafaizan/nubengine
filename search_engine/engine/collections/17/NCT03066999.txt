      urethral strictures, severe phimosis and false passages. Intravaginal retraction of the
      urethral meatus can complicate Foley placement in postmenopausal females. In men, blind
      urethral procedures with mechanical or metal sounds without visual guidance or guidewire
      assistance are now discouraged due to the increased risk of urethral trauma and false
      passages.

      DirectVision is a new visually-guided catheterization device (VGCD) that uses a camera visual
      guide / microendoscope within a triple lumen flexible urinary catheter with an angled tip,
      essentially combining the functionality of a urinary catheter with a cystoscope. DirectVision
      uses fiber-optic bundle of 6,000 integrated fibers to provide illumination and transmit
      real-time video.

      Procedures done via flexible cystoscopy or DirectVision are covered by insurance (including
      Medicaid/Medicare).

      In this prospective study, the investigators plan on assessing the effectiveness and ease of
      use of DirectVision - A direct visualization system for urinary catheterization.
