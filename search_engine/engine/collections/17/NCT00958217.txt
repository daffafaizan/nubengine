      improves longer term (up to 18 months) treatment outcomes for male and female Veterans with
      co-occurring depression and alcohol/substance disorders and trauma history (with or without
      PTSD diagnosis). This 4 years randomized two-group design uses repeated assessments at
      baseline and every 3 months for a total of 12 months. The investigators are providing their
      recently developed integrated intervention for comorbid depression and substance disorders
      for the initial 12 weeks in group format (Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Phase I).
      After the 12 week group intervention, participants will be randomized to receive either a
      review of the initial intervention in individual sessions, or a trauma-specific intervention,
      Cognitive Processing Therapy, with integrated addiction treatment components. Length,
      duration, and setting of both interventions will be the same, and all participants will meet
      with the program psychiatrist for medication appointments. No medications are under study and
      no placebo is used; medications will be prescribed using standard VA protocol. Research
      assessments will document diagnosis, recent substance use, depression and PTSD symptoms,
      medication adherence, and life stress.
