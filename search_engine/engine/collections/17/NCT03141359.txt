      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) delivered to the primary tumor followed by
      concurrent mediastinal chemoradiation by evaluating the proportion of subjects with
      locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage II/III who are alive and
      progression free at 12 months, and to compare to relevant historical controls. Additionally,
      the treatment regimen will be evaluated based on progression free survival, overall survival,
      radiologic clinical complete response rate following completion of therapy, objective
      response rate as defined by RECIST v 1.1, local and locoregional control, patterns of
      failure, and quality of life. Safety objectives include the rate of grade 2+ radiation
      pneumonitis and grade 3+ pulmonary events. Exploratory objectives include differential
      expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with radiation therapy will be determined.
