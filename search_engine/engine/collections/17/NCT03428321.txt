    
      We performed 412 percutaneous thermoablations on 238 patients for HCC between January 2015
      and November 2019.

      All thermoablation procedures were performed percutaneously under ultrasound or CT guidance,
      with ou without artificial pneumothorax or ascites, with ou without lipiodol marked.

      Purposes:

        -  Tumor response upon mRECIST criteria

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Overall survival

        -  Local tumor progression

        -  Distent liver progression

        -  Prognostic factors
