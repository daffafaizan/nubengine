    
      Background:

      Schizophrenia exacts a high toll on the lives of patients and their families and constitutes
      a major health care cost. VISN 5 has placed special emphasis on improving care for veterans
      with severe mental disorders, an effort recently recognized by the VA as a Program of
      Excellence in the Care of Seriously Mentally Ill Veterans.

      Objectives:

      This study is implementing a set of promising QOC methods for assessing QOC for schizophrenia
      in routine settings, using the evidence-based treatment recommendations developed under the
      AHCPR/NIMH-sponsored Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT).

      Methods:

      A random sample of 350 persons with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is being drawn from the
      VISN 5 sites. Patients must have more than one outpatient contact during the preceding six
      months. Each subject will participate in two one-hour interviews, one at baseline and another
      six months later. An informant, psychiatrist, therapist, etc. will also be interviewed to
      help validate participant response.

      Status:

      Project work is ongoing.
