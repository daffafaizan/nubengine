      (Hyrax), tooth tissue-borne (KBME) and bone-borne (MIDME) rapid maxillary expansion (RME)
      appliances on nasal airway with acoustic rhinometry (AR).

      Methods: Fourty-six 12- to 14-years-old patients with narrow maxilla were randomly allocated
      into 3 study groups according to the type of RME appliance: tooth-borne, tooth tissue-borne
      and bone-borne. Participants were recruited from the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey. During the RME treatment, the same protocol
      was applied to all patients and the expansion screws were activated twice a day (0.4 mm/day).
      Computer-generated randomization was used with group allocation concealed using opaque,
      sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not feasible to blind
      either operator or patients. The primary outcome of this study was the correction of
      posterior crossbite. Secondary outcomes included AR assessment of nasal airway dimensions as
      nasal volume, the minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) 1 and 2. AR measurements were obtained
      before treatment (T0), after active expansion (T1), and at 3 months-follow-up (T2). One-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Bonferroni test was used for inter-group comparison and
      two-way ANOVA was used for intra-group evalaution.
