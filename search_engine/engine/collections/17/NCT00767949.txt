      potential strategy for treating choroidal neovascularization associated with AMD is to reduce
      the biologically available extracellular levels of S1P. iSONEP is highly selective for S1P
      and binds with picomolar affinity. Lpath proposes that iSONEP would deprive many cell types
      (fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular endothelial cells and inflammatory) of important growth and
      survival factors thus targeting the multiple maladaptive processes of exudative AMD that
      ultimately result in the loss of photoreceptors, their supporting cells, and visual acuity.
      Targeting simultaneously multiple components of the choroidal neovascular response is a novel
      approach and has the potential to be more potent than "single-targeted" therapeutics such as
      anti-VEGF therapies.
