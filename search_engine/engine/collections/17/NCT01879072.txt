    
      The goal of this protocol is to establish a cohort of biologic samples collected
      prospectively from patients treated in BMT CTN centers that will be a shared bio specimen
      resource for conducting future allogeneic HCT correlative studies. This resource is designed
      to allow genomic, proteomic and transcriptional data to be integrated with high quality
      clinical phenotype and outcomes data to identify risk factors for development and severity of
      acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, organ toxicity, relapse, mortality, infection and other clinically
      significant complications occurring after allogeneic HCT.

      To achieve this goal, patients and donors will be recruited and consent obtained at the time
      that they enroll on BMT CTN protocols where enrollment occurs at or before transplantation or
      prior to start of conditioning for patients enrolled on non-BMT CTN studies or treated as
      standard of care. Samples will be collected: (1) from patients and donors pre-transplant;
      and, (2) from patients post-transplant on a calendar schedule through the first 3 months
      post-HCT. For patients co-enrolled on BMT CTN studies, clinical data will be collected in the
      context of the primary transplant protocols. For patients not enrolled on BMT CTN protocols,
      clinical data on early post-transplant events will be collected using the same data
      collection forms and systems that are used on BMT CTN trials. Additional clinical data for
      both BMT CTN and non-BMT CTN patients will be available from data submitted to the Center for
      International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using the CIBMTR Comprehensive
      Report Forms. This protocol also leverages ongoing pre-transplant donor-recipient sample
      collection performed by the CIBMTR and National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). Success in
      establishing this shared resource will inspire future investigator initiated research
      proposals and will allow investigators to take advantage of National Institutes of Health
      (NIH) funding initiatives.
