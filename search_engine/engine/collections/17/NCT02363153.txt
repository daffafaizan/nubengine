      progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene for
      acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycogen. Common
      symptoms include skeletal and smooth muscle myopathy, resulting in respiratory insufficiency,
      peripheral muscle weakness and generalized fatigue.

      The progressive myopathy in Pompe disease seems to be influenced by increased muscle protein
      breakdown. The increased muscle protein breakdown leads to muscle wasting, weakness,
      increased resting energy expenditure and, consequently, increased fatigue. Our hypothesis is
      that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet associated with regular physical exercise will
      improve respiratory and peripheral muscle functions in Pompe disease.

      In this study, we will investigate the effects of 16 weeks of planned diet and exercise in
      adolescent and young adult (15-55 years old) individuals with Pompe disease using an activity
      tracker.

      The participant will be asked to come to the University of Florida 4 times throughout the
      study (screening, baseline, +/- 15 days of completing the diet and exercise plan and a follow
      up three months later) for exercise testing, quality of life questionnaires, respiratory
      function testing and blood draws.
