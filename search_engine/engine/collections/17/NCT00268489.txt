    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the 3 month progression-free survival rate of the combination of pemetrexed
           disodium with bevacizumab in a patient population with stage IIIB (due to pleural
           effusion) or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tumor response rate in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of pemetrexed disodium in combination with bevacizumab on overall
           survival and duration of response in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
