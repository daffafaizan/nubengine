      vaginal compartment prolapse addressing implementation of the intervention and preliminary
      effectiveness.

      Objectives

        -  demonstrate effectiveness of the device (comfort, ease of use, empty the rectum of stool
           more easily than their current approach and quality of life)

        -  identify which stage of prolapse the device would be most suitable

        -  identify any changes to the device or instructions for use (needs adjustment to its
           design in terms of length/width)

      The study will use a pre-post intervention design with the aim of evaluating the feasibility
      of the intervention (using the device); and identifying any implementation issues and
      preliminary effectiveness. The participants will be followed prospectively to compare the
      device against their own usual care. Usual care in this context will be using their fingers
      to help empty their rectum of stool.

      Participants will be invited to complete a semi-structured interview to understand their
      lived experience. A Patient and Public Involvement Group has contributed to improving the
      study methods.
