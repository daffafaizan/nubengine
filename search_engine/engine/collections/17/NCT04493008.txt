      essential for overcoming antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is considered an
      important global public health problem and is recognized as a major cause of the emerging
      problem of antimicrobial agent resistance. The inappropriate use of antibiotics by patients
      not only increases the growth of resistant bacterial strains but also, may lead to adverse
      side effects that range from gastrointestinal disturbances to fatal anaphylactic shock. To
      meet the challenges faced by the spread of antibiotics resistance, different approaches have
      been taken worldwide. One of the approaches which are commonly proposed is to engage
      instructional and educational campaigns among the health care personnel and the general
      population about antibiotic resistance and its dangerous consequences.

      Aim of the study: The present study aims at assessing the knowledge, practices of antibiotic
      uses and resistance before and after educational sessions among second year dental students
      and a group of patients attending MIU Dental Clinics.

      Materials and Methods: The study will be conducted on (315) second year dental students
      through a pre-and post-educational sessions questionnaire. Students will receive training
      sessions for four hours during their dental public health course given by senior staff
      members before conducting educational sessions targeting patients attending MIU Dental
      Clinics. Educational sessions will include verbal and visual tools.
