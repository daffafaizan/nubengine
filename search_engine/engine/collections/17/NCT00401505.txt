      rubella. All pregnant women are checked for rubella immunity, and if they are non-immune,
      there are standard orders in our hospital to administer the rubella vaccine on the
      post-partum floor prior to discharge home from the hospital. Despite this, some multiparous
      women are found to be susceptible (non-immune), and this study will explore the reasons for
      this.
