    
      Background: Critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy (CIPNM) is a severe complication
      of critical illness. Retrospective data suggest that early application of IgM-enriched
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may prevent or mitigate CIPNM. Therefore, the primary
      objective will be to assess the effect of early IgM-enriched IVIG versus placebo to mitigate
      CIPNM in a prospective setting.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial

      Setting: Eight-bed medical ICU of a university hospital.

      Participants: Critically ill patients will be screened for eligibility defined as multiple
      organ failure (MOF) and SIRS/sepsis. Patients fulfilling these criteria will be further
      assessed by a neurologist for clinical signs of CIPNM.

      Critically ill patients with multiple organ failure (MOF), SIRS/sepsis, and early clinical
      signs of CIPNM will be randomized.
