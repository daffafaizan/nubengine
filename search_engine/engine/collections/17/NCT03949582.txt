      Asian) with T2D and non insulin treated will be recruited. Participant will be randomly
      allocated to one of these two groups:

      Group 1: Test food in form of soup and Group 2: Test food in form of mince. Once allocated in
      one of the groups, participant will consume in a random order 6 different test foods (soy,
      chicken, mycoprotein with and without guar gum) in a determined format (either as in soup or
      mince).
