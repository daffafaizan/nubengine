      manageable disease. Although incidence of AIDS-related mortality has decreased, it has
      increased for other co-morbid conditions including decrease bone mass, osteoporosis,
      fragility fracture. There are multi-factorial that contribute to bone loss in HIV-infected
      individuals including HIV virus itself that shift bone remodeling pathway toward bone
      resorption, lifestyle and behavioral factors, co-morbid conditions and ART.

      Initiation of ART is associated with 2%-6% reduction in bone mineral density during the first
      2 years of treatment regardless of ART regimens and then stabilization thereafter in the
      majority of the study. This magnitude of bone loss is similar to postmenopausal women during
      the first year.

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor,
      has been associated with greater bone loss than other reverse transcriptase inhibitors, that
      is recommended as the first line treatment in Thailand. Nonetheless there is an evidence in
      western country that calcium and vitamin D supplement can attenuate bone loss in naive
      HIV-infected individual who start ART with TDF. Even though many experts recommend to avoid
      TDF and prefer abacavir, NRTIs which affect bone loss less than other NRTIs, in high fracture
      risk patients, more than less HIV-infected-patients can access to abacavir in resource
      limiting country. This research aims to study bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV
      infected-patient in Thai population who receive tenofovir with calcium and vitamin D
      supplement.
