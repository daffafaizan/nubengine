    
      Single-center, Prospective, Open Label, with Before-After Study Design. Up to 25 subjects
      will be enrolled to the study to provide at least 20 evaluable subjects. Subjects will be
      examined to determine the severity and extent of actinic keratoses.

      All subjects will undergo 1-3 treatments (determined by their clinical improvement), 3-4
      weeks apart.

      Follow-up visits after the last treatment visit: 4 weeks (±7 days), 12 weeks (±7 days), 52
      weeks (±14 days) - the last follow up visit is a voluntary one.

      The inclusion criteria would be mild to moderate thickness confluent actinic keratoses
      located to scalp and/or face.
