      Destination Therapy patients. Patients participating in the Medtronic Destination Therapy
      (DT) Post Approval Study (PAS) (NCT03681210) are eligible for participation in Apogee.
      Patients enrolled in Apogee will be followed under the Apogee study for one-year
      post-implant. After participation in Apogee ends, patients will remain enrolled in DT PAS and
      will continue to be followed as outlined in the DT PAS protocol. The total estimated study
      duration is 33 months.
