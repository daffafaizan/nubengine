      respiratory cycle via capnography. In this way, capnography allows healthcare professionals
      to follow a number of respiratory factors (i.e., depression, apnea, and hypercapnia) in
      real-time. Earlier detection of alterations to ventilation status will better enable
      providers to more accurately dose medications during procedures, especially in at-risk
      patient populations such as patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [1, 2].

      In a recent study of bariatric patients, approximately 15% experience postoperative pulmonary
      complications. These patients could benefit significantly from capnography monitoring as this
      measure can very accurately estimate the prevalence of respiratory complications.

      Through this study we seek to understand how end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) levels of patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea vary when patients are in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). By
      collecting information on patient outcomes, we hope to better understand the value of this
      monitoring technique in an at-risk patient population. Though capnography in the PACU has not
      previously been demonstrated to improve patient safety or satisfaction, capnography has never
      been studied in a population of patients who are at risk of obstructive sleep apnea.

      Study Design This is a prospective, blinded observational pilot study to monitor if changes
      in end-tidal CO2 levels provide incremental value over pulse oximetry when detecting
      respiratory difficulties (i.e., hypercapnia).
