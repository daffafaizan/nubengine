    
      Sulthiame (or sultiame), marketed in the 60's in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Israel,
      Australia and Japan under the brand name OspolotÂ®, has progressively become the therapeutic
      first choice in benign focal epilepsies of childhood in these countries.

      Its antiepileptic activity is thought to result from the inhibition of various subtypes of
      carbonic anhydrase (hCA), in particular cytosolic hCA II, thus inducing a degree of
      intracellular acidification sufficient to stabilize seizure-eliciting neurons. The
      pharmacokinetic profile of sulthiame was scarcely studied in humans.

      Sulthiame is a suitable candidate for paediatric formulation optimization, as the current
      formulation (coated tablets of 50 or 200 mg) allows neither precise and adapted dosing, nor
      convenient administration to young children.
