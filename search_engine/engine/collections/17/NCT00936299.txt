      nicotine dependence in individuals without SUD, and newer research provides empirical support
      for its unique pharmacotherapeutic properties and potential for treating other addictive
      disorders (e.g., methamphetamine dependence, pathological gambling). No controlled studies
      have yet evaluated bupropion's safety and efficacy for ADHD and SUD (including nicotine and
      cannabis) in adolescents. The lack of research on the safety and efficacy of medications in
      adolescents with SUD and psychiatric comorbidities contributes to a serious lack of
      integrated treatment for commonly co-occurring mental health and substance problems in
      community-based adolescent drug treatment programs. This then contributes to poorer treatment
      outcomes and prognosis for the large number of comorbid youths with substance abuse and
      mental health problems that significantly impact public health. The specific aims of the
      proposed study will address this research gap by conducting a 16-week randomized controlled
      trial of bupropion vs. placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this low abuse
      potential medication on ADHD, nicotine dependence, and cannabis use disorders (not excluding
      other SUD) in 130 adolescents (13-19) receiving concurrent outpatient substance treatment
      (CBT). The study design and analytic approach will enable assessment of the complex
      inter-relationship between change in ADHD, depression/dysphoria (and other psychiatric
      symptoms) and change in nicotine, cannabis and other substance use within and between
      treatment groups. Thus, the study addresses important research gaps in at least two priority
      areas of the National Institute on Drug Abuse/ National Institutes of Health(NIDA/NIH)
      research agenda: 1) research on effective treatments for adolescents with addiction and
      psychiatric comorbidity, and 2) medications development research for nicotine and cannabis
      use disorders in adolescents.
