      intervention for young adults ages 18-24years in urban community and university settings. The
      content development will include: (1) two brief (15 minutes) primary care counseling
      sessions, (2) one introductory web based module, (3) four web-based cognitive behavior
      teaching modules, (4) three web-based modules discussing relationship building skills (IPT),
      and (5) a final web module discussing self-recognition, evidence-based treatment, and stigma.
      Eight young adult volunteers will evaluate the program in three loops of evaluation and
      revision in a modified focus group approach. This protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins
      Joint Committee on Clinical Investigations.

      Primary Outcomes:

      The primary outcome variables relate to the functionality and acceptability of the
      intervention. These variables include readability, ease of understanding, acceptability, and
      helpfulness of each component of the intervention, and a global rating of each

      Secondary Outcomes:

      Process measures (time on site, exercise completion), outcomes (mood and intermediate
      outcomes-social adjustment, dysfunctional thinking), and knowledge and opinions of current
      treatments for depression. These data will be helpful in planning for a future Focus groups
      of 5-10 individuals have been used successfully to provide initial product evaluations or to
      develop general themes in attitude research. Summary statistics will be collected.
