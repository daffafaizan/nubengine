      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug AZD2014 can shrink
      growing or symptomatic meningiomas. Based on laboratory research, the cellular pathways which
      are blocked by AZD2014 are important for the growth and survival of meningiomas. Further
      treatment of meningioma cells in the laboratory setting has resulted in decreased survival of
      tumor cells. As such, the purpose of this research is to see whether treating your meningioma
      with AZD2014 will result in tumor shrinkage. The safety of AZD2014 will also be studied. Your
      physical state, your symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings
      obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if AZD2014 is safe and effective
      in patients with your condition.

      AZD2014 is being studied in patients with various cancers as a single agent (a drug that is
      used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of anticancer therapies.
      Previous studies have also allowed investigators to determine the best dose and frequency of
      AZD2014 to achieve anti-tumor effects while reducing the likelihood of side effects.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD2014 as a treatment for
      any disease.
