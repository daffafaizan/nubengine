      Both HPV and placebo vaccines will be in identical bottles, and all treatment codes will be
      kept under lock and key. All vaccines will be injected intramuscularly into the deltoid
      muscle by a member of the clinical staff. Each participant will be monitored for systemic and
      local reactions for 30 minutes postvaccination after each study vaccination for any adverse
      effects, including allergic reactions. Vaccine adverse events will continue to be monitored
      throughout the duration of the study period. Vaccine will be shipped to a central pharmacy at
      Stellenbosch University and stored in a refrigerator monitored and maintained at 2-8 C prior
      to distribution and local storage at participating clinical centers.
