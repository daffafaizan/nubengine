      biologically-relevant levels in plasma and has important effects on isolated or cultured
      blood, vascular and fat cells. The main enzyme responsible for generation of plasma LPA is
      the secreted lysophospholipase D, autotaxin (ATX). Adipocytes contribute substantially to
      plasma ATX levels. The investigators have demonstrated rapid production and metabolism of
      plasma LPA in animals. More recently, the investigators have observed that plasma LPA levels
      increase in mice fed a high fat ("Western") diet in comparison to levels found in mice fed
      normal chow. The investigators have also found that diet-induced obesity increased
      circulating ATX levels in mice. The investigators hypothesize that diet, and in particular
      dietary phosphatidylcholine (PC), may regulate the autotaxin substrate
      lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), from which LPA is derived. Obesity may amplify the response by
      increasing plasma ATX levels and/or activity. The current study will test whether dietary PC
      in normal weight and obese subjects acutely alters LPA levels and autotaxin activity.
