      adjuvant enhances immune responses. This trial compares NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX速 vaccine with
      ISCOMATRIX速 adjuvant alone to assess whether treatment with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX速 vaccine
      improves outcomes for participants with Malignant Melanoma which has been removed, but is at
      high risk of recurrence.

      Eligible participants are randomly allocated to a treatment arm. Treatment involves four
      intramuscular (into a muscle) injections (1 injection every 4 weeks x 3, plus 1 injection at
      6 months).

      Participants are assessed for recurrence of melanoma, safety and immune responses (by blood
      test) over the 18 month study period. Off study, their own doctor will follow them for
      melanoma recurrence and survival.
