      facilitated tucking, and their concerted application during heel-stick sampling on pain in
      term babies.

      Design: A randomised clinical trial in a single centre. Methods: The study sample size was
      determined by the free-software G* Power. Based on the power analysis performed prior to the
      study in order to determine the number of babies to be included in the sample group (with
      β=0.14087 and α=0.05 risk, Power=0.85913), according to the study by Karakoc and Turker
      (2014), it was found that 27 neonates should be included in each group. The study was
      conducted on 90 babies, between July 1, 2017 - August 9, 2017. Using stratification and
      blocking method, 30 babies were included in the white noise group (1st Group), 30 in
      facilitated tucking group (2nd Group), and 30 in white noise + facilitated tucking group (3rd
      Group). Pain scores of the babies in all groups before, during, and after the procedure were
      evaluated by two nurses independent from each other using Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS).
