      has revolutionized the management of various conditions including angiomas, vitiligo,
      wrinkles, and scars. (Omi, 2014 and Chapas, 2008) Scars result from sub-optimal collagen
      production during wound healing leading to topographical irregularities. To effectively
      modify these defects, any treatment must be capable of penetrating the epidermis and
      eliciting dermal remodeling at a depth of at least 1 mm. The 10,600 nm carbon dioxide (CO2)
      laser utilizes high energy at short durations to vaporize intra- and extra-cellular water,
      resulting in tissue ablation causing a substantial thermal injury to the dermis, reducing the
      likelihood of additional scarring. The CO2 laser can stimulate collagen production and
      theoretically improve scar thickness, pliability, and texture.

      This study is a prospective, randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to evaluate
      the efficacy of fractionated carbon dioxide laser in improving surgical scars on the head and
      neck over 3-5 study visits for a duration of 12.5 months. Scar assessments will be based on
      objective changes identified on pictures taken with the Canfield Vectra M3 3D Imaging System
      and subjective changes identified with the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale
      (POSAS), a validated scar scale. As a secondary objective, the study will evaluate the
      tolerability of the laser, by assessing the severity and duration of known side effects of
      laser therapy such as erythema, edema, burning sensation, post-inflammatory pigment changes,
      infection, scarring, xerosis, pruritus, bronzing, and any other adverse events that arise
      following treatment. Subjects will be given a diary after each treatment to document this
      information.
