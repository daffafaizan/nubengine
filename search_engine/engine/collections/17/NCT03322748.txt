      plantarflexor and Hamstring muscles, induces a significant reduction of overactive bladder
      symptoms in patients with Multiple sclerosis. It's known that the electric stimulation of the
      Posterior Tibial nerve induces an improvement of overactive bladder symptoms through a
      modulation of spinal circuitry, which occurs with unknown mechanisms. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that the voluntary muscular activation may induce a modulation of the sacral
      root as long as the electric stimulation. 30 patients will be recruited within 2 years, since
      October 2017 through October 2019. This is a monocentric, randomized controlled , in single
      blind, not pharmacological study.
