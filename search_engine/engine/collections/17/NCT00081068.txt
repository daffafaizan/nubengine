        -  Determine the objective response in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia
           treated with alemtuzumab.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 1-6 (course 1) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete
      response undergo observation. Patients with stable disease or a minor or partial response
      receive an additional course of alemtuzumab, administered as in course 1, on weeks 7-12.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
