      development of atherosclerosis in diabetes patients. The atherogenic potential of insulin has
      been shown to improve cholesterol and may have an effect on the thickness and structure of
      the arterial wall. Troglitazone is an oral diabetic agent that treats insulin resistance.
      Based on the initial data available, it would appear that troglitazone may be effective in
      both glycemic control and improved atherosclerosis risk in diabetes patients. This study will
      compare the effects of troglitazone to placebo in insulin-requiring diabetes patients on both
      glycemic control and progression of atherosclerosis.

      A total of 288 men and women 30 to 70 years of age with insulin-treated diabetes were
      recruited and entered an 8 week run-in phase to stabilize diet, exercise, insulin dose and
      glucose levels. Upon successful completion of the run-in phase, all patients were randomized
      into one of two groups to receive either troglitazone 400mg/day or a matching placebo while
      continuing with diet and exercise regimens and insulin dose to maintain pre-meal glucose
      levels between 100 to 150 mg/dL.

      Follow up visits occurred every 2 weeks for 2 months, every 4 weeks for 2 months, then every
      8 weeks for the remainder of the 2-year trial. The progression of atherosclerosis was
      measured by ultrasonography at baseline and every 6 months throughout the 2 years of
      randomized treatment.
