      injection of lower extremities in the last month were randomized to two groups in the study.
      Group 1 received conventional physiotherapy and Group 2 received robot-assisted gait
      training. The treatment period was 30 min/day, five sessions in a week, 15 sessions in total,
      for both groups. The study population was evaluated using range of joint motion evaluation
      chart, the Modified Ashworth Scale, The Gross Motor Function Classification System, The Berg
      Balance Scale, the functional independence measure for children, and the Edinburgh Visual
      Gait Score.
