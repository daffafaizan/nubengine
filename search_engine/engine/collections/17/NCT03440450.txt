      continue until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events,
      intercurrent illness, or changes in the patient's condition that prevents further study
      participation after discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. A number of
      cohorts will be enrolled sufficient to determine the MTD and to identify the RP2D.

      Expansion Phase Once 6 patients are treated at the MTD or RP2D in each regimen during the
      dose-escalation phase, it is anticipated that up to three additional cohorts, distributed
      among the regimens, may enroll up to 12 patients each.
