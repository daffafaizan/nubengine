    
      Background:

      A mammography facility in the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is
      present in order to facilitate breast cancer research programs. The American College of
      Radiology mammography accreditation program (1992 mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA)
      (1-3)) has established national standards for site accreditation for mammography. A key
      requirement is to perform a minimum number of mammography examinations in the facility per
      year. Minimum examination volumes are required to maintain expertise of the facility staff
      for maintaining facility accreditation and compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      requirements.

      Objectives:

      Our primary aim is a protocol to maintain accreditation of the NIH breast imaging facility in
      the Clinical Center of NIH.

      Eligibility:

      Women who are clinically indicated for screening mammography according to the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (3) and the American Cancer Society
      guidelines.

      Design:

      A standard of care protocol to perform standard clinically indicated mammography exams. We
      are expected to recruit 1000 patient /year.
