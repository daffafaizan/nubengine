      I. To determine the safety of carfilzomib in combination with rituximab-cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) (CR-CHOP) in patients with
      newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and identify a recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if CR-CHOP improves the rates of 1-year progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) in non-germinal center (non-GC) DLBCL patients relative to historical
      controls treated with R-CHOP(Phase II) II. To determine response rates (complete and partial
      remission) in non-GC DLBCL patients treated with CR-CHOP and compare to historical controls
      treated with R-CHOP.

      III. Because a proportion (~10%) of patients classified as non-GC by immunohistochemical
      (IHC) algorithms may not have the activated B-cells (ABC) subtyped of DLBCL, an exploratory
      secondary objective will compare the PFS, OS and response rates of the ABC subgroup of
      patients with DLBCL as determined by the Gene Expression Profiling with those of the overall
      group of non-GC DLBCL.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over at least 90 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV
      over 30-60 minutes, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes, vincristine sulfate IV
      over 1 minute on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients also receive
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 6, 12, and 24
      months.
