      assist device (LVAD) implantation, or a right heart biopsy, or atrial fibrillation surgery,
      or right atria cannulation, the following tissue samples will be collected:

      In the subjects undergoing orthotopic heart transplant (n=20), failed myocardial tissue
      samples will be collected from the diseased heart.

      For subjects undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation (n=60), small samples
      will be collected from the apex core (that would be routinely discarded at the time of the
      implantation procedure).

      For heart transplant subjects undergoing clinically indicated right heart biopsy (n=20), the
      collection of multiple samples including, excess myocardial biopsy samples that will not be
      utilized by pathology.

      For subjects undergoing any heart surgery (n=80), the collection of left atrial appendages
      that are routinely removed to prevent thrombosis during atrial fibrillation surgery and a
      piece of the right atria will be cut in order to implant the cannula.

      In addition, a collection of 20ml (about one tablespoon) of blood will be taken from all
      subjects to analyze progenitor/inflammatory cells and inflammation cytokines and pertinent
      medical history.
