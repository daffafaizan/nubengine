      four sites in SSA using convenience sampling strategies, with no replacement for participants
      lost to follow-up. Each participant will be followed for 12 months, during which five study
      visits involving structured HIV behavioral assessments, medical examinations, and collection
      of biological samples will be conducted (including enrollment and quarterly follow-up
      visits). Participants who do not complete 12 months of follow-up will be contacted to explore
      reasons for no longer participating.
