      of these tumours are of non-small cell histological type. Surgery is the treatment of choice,
      but only about 20% of tumours are suitable for potentially curative resection. Concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC. When Iressa was used
      in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations positive, the 12-month
      rates of progression-free survival were 24.9%. Therefore, we speculate that the EGFR
      mutations in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, Gefitinib combined with radiotherapy may
      be better than chemoradiotherapy. We design the study to access the effect and safety of
      radiotherapy combined whth Iressa for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer with harboring active EGFR mutations.
