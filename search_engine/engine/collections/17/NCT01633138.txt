      Abuse Treatment Unit (SATU) will be randomized to receive cognitive remediation therapy with
      or without additional compensation based on performance. Participants will use the
      computerized cognitive remediation program (PSSCogRehab 2012) three times per week for four
      weeks. The primary outcome measure will be an improved performance on the computerized tasks,
      with secondary outcomes of changes in cognitive functioning (e.g., attention, concentration,
      memory) as measured by neuropsychological tests between baseline and post-treatment.
