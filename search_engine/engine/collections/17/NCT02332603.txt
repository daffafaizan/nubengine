      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented.

      Glucocorticoid might change the glucose metabolism as it induces insulin-resistance.
      Glucocorticoids are known to reduce the insulin-mediated glucose uptake by reducing the
      muscle glycogen synthase activity.

      The effect of a single high dose of glucocorticoid is poorly described in the literature, and
      therefore calls for further investigation.

      This study is embedded in a primary study registrated as: NCT02319343
