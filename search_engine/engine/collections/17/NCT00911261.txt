      oxymorphone ER in the treatment of cancer or neuropathic pain. Opioid-naïve subjects are
      gradually titrated from oxymorphone ER 5 mg, every 12 hours (q12h). All other subjects are
      titrated to a stable dose (defined as pain scores ≥ 4 on BPI Question 5 on 3 of 5 consecutive
      days while receiving the same total daily dose of study medication including rescue) with
      tolerable side effects. Subjects could potentially receive therapy for up to 12 months after
      the first dose of study medication.
