      research questions about V-Motive's ability to perform its intended function. The goal is to
      evaluate the feasibility, usability, and the potential of V-Motive to deliver comprehensive,
      individualized video modeling that is integrated with a child's program. Investigators will
      also use descriptive statistics to provide preliminary insight into the potential impact of
      the system on a child's performance in their ABA therapy. However, these data are NOT
      intended to show cause or to show effectiveness. The study will answer the following
      questions: 1) 3) Can V-Motive be feasibly used during ABA therapy to positively impact a
      child's performance within 4 weeks? 2) How laborious is it to construct a fully-indexed video
      repository from therapy footage using V-Motive? 3) How accurate is the system in suggesting
      and cueing up appropriate video for playback on demand?
