      been observed to be promising in treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression.
      Nevertheless, knowledge related to the treatment of psychological stress and its main
      symptom, anxiety, is very scarce. The investigators examine the efficacy of two different
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation protocols in the treatment of
      acute anxiety in an open-label pilot study in patients who have faced severely stressful life
      events.
