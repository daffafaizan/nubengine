      nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a
      comprehensive exploratory characterization of the tumor immune milieu and circulating immune
      cells and soluble factors in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide
      valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other
      immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting.
      Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and
      toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive
      anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective
      treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.

      In addition, an amendment to this study allows evaluation of the combination of nivolumab and
      the anti-CTLA4 antibody, ipilimumab in the neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of
      resectable NSCLC. In a large, multicohort, phase 1 trial, the ORR to combination ipilimumab
      and nivolumab therapy in patients unselected by PD-L1 status ranged from 39-47%. Incidence of
      grade 3-4 toxicity ranged from 33-37% across the combination ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts
      which compares favorably with the rates of toxicity due to platinum doublet chemotherapy in
      this disease setting.
