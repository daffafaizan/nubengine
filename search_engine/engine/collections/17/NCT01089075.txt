      study. The benefit of replacement in partial corticotropic failure on brain function
      (cognition), especially in cases with borderline low cortisol levels after stimulation is
      unknown.

      Moreover, since glucocorticoids might affect hGH secretion, the effect of hydrocortisone on
      hGH secretion reflected by IGF-1 levels will be assessed. If IGF-1 is below 2 SD at the end
      of the study, hGH secretion will additionally be determined by a GHRH-arginine-test.

      An improved cognition in TBI and SAH patients with partial corticotropic insufficiency would
      give a new treatment option in this population which may lead to better quality of life and
      an enhanced rehabilitation process.
