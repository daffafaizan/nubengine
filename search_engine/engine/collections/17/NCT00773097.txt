      among subjects at increased risk for colorectal cancer by virtue of a history of advanced
      adenoma. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a combination of the
      100mer MUC1 peptide and adjuvant Poly-ICLC in boosting the immune response to MUC1. Among the
      secondary objectives is to determine if anti-MUC1 immunity, preexisting or vaccine induced,
      has an effect on the recurrence of polyps. Subjects with a history of advanced adenoma will
      be recruited for MUC1 vaccination. Vaccine will be administered at weeks 0, 2, and 10. Some
      subjects may have pre-existing immunity to MUC1, and this will be accounted for in the
      analytic phase. However, all subjects will be administered the vaccine, regardless of
      baseline antibody status. To insure accurate standardization in measurement and assessment of
      antibody levels, assays for baseline antibody status will be done at the same time as those
      for response to vaccine.
