      safety/tolerability, PD, and PK of TAK-994 in an acute sleep phase delay paradigm in healthy
      participants.

      The study will enroll up to approximately 18 healthy participants. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment sequences which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-994 Dose A + Placebo + TAK-994 Dose B

        -  TAK-994 Dose B + TAK-994 Dose A + Placebo

        -  Placebo + TAK-994 Dose B + TAK-994 Dose A

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 10 weeks. Participants will be followed up
      remotely on Day 7 after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
