      work of respiratory muscles and optimizing gas exchange. However, it can be the source of
      deleterious effects, grouped under the terms of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and
      ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction.

      The protective ventilatory strategy has led to a significant improvement in the prognosis of
      ARDS patients, by reducing the volume of the air and oxygen mixture (lower tidal volume)
      delivered to the lungs and thus reducing the pulmonary stress and strain. However, this
      protective ventilation usually requires deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade to avoid
      deleterious patient-ventilator asynchrony.

      Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) has been proposed to reduce patient-ventilator
      asynchrony and reduce the VILI. The operating principles of APRV are based on the presence of
      two pressure levels that are kept constant. Spontaneous breathing is possible at any time at
      both pressure levels if the patient is not deeply sedated or under neuromuscular blockade.

      The investigators hypothesize that APRV mode could be beneficial on oxygenation and
      respiratory work in patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-COV2 viral pneumonia.
