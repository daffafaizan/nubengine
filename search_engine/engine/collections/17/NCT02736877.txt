    
      Participants will be allocated in one of the following groups:

        1. Control Group The control group will undergo corneal transplant with conventional
           microscope without coupled OCT. The team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on
           the surgical difficulty regarding corneal transplantation (ANNEX 1).

        2. Group OCT RESCAN In the group microscope coupled to OCT, patients will undergo retinal
           surgery using the Lumera Microscope WITH RESCAN OCT - ZEISS. The team of surgeons will
           answer the questionnaire on the surgical difficulty regarding corneal transplantation
           (ANNEX 1).

      The investigators will evaluate intraoperative conditions, complications, operative time and
      postoperative results in both groups.

      All patients will be monitored and evaluated with full ophthalmological examination in all
      postoperative visits (day 1, 7,15,30, 60, 90, 180) and will be subjected to the following
      tests:

        -  Measurement of visual acuity with best correction

        -  Previous Biomicroscopy

        -  Corneal Topography

        -  tonometry

        -  Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Microscopy speculate
