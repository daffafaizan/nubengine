      most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial
      treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by
      radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide.
      However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard
      treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from
      recurrence. Once patients develop tumor progression, conventional chemotherapy is generally
      ineffective.
