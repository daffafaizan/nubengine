      cervical radicular pain. However, severe complication can occur by CTFESI such as epidural
      hematomas, infection, inadvertent intramedullary cord injections, and embolic infarct when
      inadvertent intra-arterial injection of particulate steroids has occurred.

      The incidence of intravascular injection during CTFESI was known as 20.6% ~ 32.8% and it is
      higher than other level of spinal transforaminal epidural injection.

      To avoid complication due to intravascular injection during CTFESI, risk factors was should
      be evaluated. However, there was no study about risk factors of intravascular injection
      during CTFESI. The investigators could assume the severity of cervical neural foraminal
      spinal stenosis could affect the incidence of intravascular injection, pain intensity and
      effectiveness during CTFESI.

      Thus, the investigators designed this study to investigate whether there is a correlation
      between intravascular injection rate and severity of cervical foraminal stenosis during
      CTFESI.
