      presents patients with a significant risk of complications including heart disease,
      retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Various classes of orally administered
      antihyperglycemic agents have been developed for the treatment of diabetes and although
      individual agents may be highly effective for some patients, it is still difficult to
      maintain optimal glycemic control in most patients, thereby resulting in high rates of
      morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      active comparator-controlled, 3-arm, parallel-group, multicenter study to demonstrate the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of canagliflozin compared with a sulfonylurea
      (glimepiride) in patients with T2DM, 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, who are not optimally
      controlled on metformin monotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that the study drug will
      be non-inferior to glimepiride as assessed by the change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from
      baseline. The patients will receive capsules taken by mouth of canagliflozin (either 100 or
      300 mg), or glimepiride with a starting dosage of 1 mg, which will be increased to a maximum
      dose of 6 or 8 mg once daily for a total duration of 104 weeks.
