      It has a similar pharmacological profile to warfarin but was designed to provide more uniform
      and stable anticoagulation. ATI-5923 is a selective, non-competitive inhibitor of vitamin K
      epoxide reductase. ATI-5923 is metabolized by esterase to a single inactive metabolite and
      thus is expected to have less variable metabolism, drug-drug interactions and reduced
      instances of under/over coagulation, making the response safer and more predictable. The
      primary purpose of this study is to develop a dosing regimen and INR monitoring schedule that
      can be applied in an outpatient setting to safely and conveniently anticoagulate patients
      with atrial fibrillation to a therapeutic INR. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were
      chosen for the study population of this trial because they require anticoagulation if they
      have risk factors for stroke.
