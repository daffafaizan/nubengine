      is impaired after spinal cord injury (SCI). Even after treadmill training, preliminary
      evidence indicates that eccentric deficits persist among individuals with SCI. This proposal
      aims to characterize eccentric motor control of the muscles about the knee or hip during
      locomotion and evaluate the efficacy of downhill gait training at moderate speeds as an
      intervention to improve eccentric function of the knee joint or hip joint during walking.
