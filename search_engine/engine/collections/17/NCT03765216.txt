      colon. Inadequate bowel preparation is the predominant threaten to the efficacy of
      colonoscopy.Unfortunately, about 30% of patients were reported to suffer inadequate bowel
      preparation. In order to improve adequate bowel preparation rate, it is desirable to
      prescribe personalized regimen according to patient characteristics. We intend to improve
      adequate bowel preparation rate by deploying tailored bowel preparation strategy. There are
      many predictive factors of inadequate bowel preparation such as obesity, constipation,
      abdominal surgery and so on. By recognizing these risk factors of the patients , we can
      prescribe the patients with higher dose of bowel cleansing regimen to improve bowel
      preparation quality.
