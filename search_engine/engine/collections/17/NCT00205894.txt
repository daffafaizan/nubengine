      illnesses, inflicting severe functional impairment. These headache subtypes are particularly
      resistant to current treatment modalities, with the majority of chronic migraine patients
      continuing to experience frequent or near-daily headaches despite aggressive,
      multidisciplinary, and multimodal therapy. The refractory nature of these illnesses and the
      level of devastation they inflict on the lives of their victims has motivated the pursuit of
      novel treatment approaches.

      Direct stimulation of the greater occipital nerve has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of
      chronic migraine and chronic cluster headaches in a small number of patients.
