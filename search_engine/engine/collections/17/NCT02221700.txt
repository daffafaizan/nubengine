    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To compare completion rates of two massage treatment protocols
      (twice-weekly for 6 weeks versus three times weekly for 4 weeks) for patients with chronic,
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the initial efficacy and effect size estimates of twice versus three times
      weekly site specific (lower extremity) massage versus alternate massage site
      (head/neck/shoulder) control groups at treating chronic, lower extremity chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy.

      II. To determine the initial efficacy and effect size estimates of massage on patient quality
      of life and functional performance tests.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo massage therapy over 30 minutes to the affected legs at the foot
      and toes, ending at the knee, thrice weekly for 4 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo massage therapy over 30 minutes to the affected legs at the foot
      and toes, ending at the knee, twice weekly for 6 weeks.

      GROUP III: Patients undergo massage therapy over 30 minutes to the head, neck, and shoulder
      thrice weekly for 4 weeks.

      GROUP IV: Patients undergo massage therapy over 30 minutes to the head, neck, and shoulder
      twice weekly for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed periodically.
