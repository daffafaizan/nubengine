      Primary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in patients with progressive
           metastatic androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with lutetium Lu
           177 monoclonal antibody J591.

        -  Determine the measurable disease response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of biochemical PSA and/or measurable disease response in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the incidence of human anti-J591 antibody (HAHA) response in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Correlate hematological toxicity of this drug with bone marrow involvement (bone scan
           index) in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the targeting of this drug to known tumor sites in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor-absorbed radiation dose in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive a single dose of lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal antibody J591 IV on day 1.
      Patients then undergo radionuclide scanning between days 6-8 to confirm tumor targeting by
      the study drug.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
