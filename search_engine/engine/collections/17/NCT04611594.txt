      failure. It is estimated that 25% of patients presenting with acute heart failure are
      readmitted within 30 days. The maintenance of signs and symptoms of congestion at hospital
      discharge are common causes of hospital readmission. Thus, the reduction of these signs is a
      goal to be reached during hospitalization so that the chances of readmission are reduced.
      However, there is evidence that approximately Â¼ of the patients are released despite
      persisting signs of congestive symptoms. It seems plausible to speculate that patients with
      HF at higher risk of rehospitalization would be those with the greatest chance of benefiting
      from therapeutic strategies that seek to reduce the congestive state, such as fluid
      restriction. In this scenario of initial vulnerability after hospitalization for acutely
      decompensated HF, recent studies have demonstrated a correlation in the number of B lines in
      the pulmonary ultrasound of patients at the time of hospital discharge and the prediction of
      frequent clinical outcomes. It was observed that the presence of pattern B, defined as the
      presence of more than 3 B lines in at least 2 pulmonary fields bilaterally, was associated
      with a worse prognosis (mortality from all causes and hospitalization due to decompensation).
      The present study, therefore, will evaluate the effect of outpatient fluid restriction on
      levels of NT-proBNP in patients who remain with signs of congestion based on pulmonary
      ultrasound at the bedside during hospital discharge.
