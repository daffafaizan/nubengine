      program, beyond other components of interdisciplinary care, could reduce hospital associated
      disability (HAD) in medical patients aged 75 years and older admitted to an acute care for
      elders (ACE) unit.

      Population: The reference population will be patients aged 75 years and older admitted to the
      ACE unit from the emergency department. This study will include only patients discharged
      alive. Exclusion criteria include patients fully dependent at baseline, unable to sign
      informed consent, unstable medical condition, short stay (<3 days), end stage illness.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomly assigned to a control or an intervention group.
      Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual care in the ACE unit with
      actions directed to prevent delirium and functional decline. The intervention group, in
      addition to the usual care, will receive an exercise program. Briefly, this program consisted
      of strengthening of lower limbs muscles, and walking, daily from Monday to Friday.
