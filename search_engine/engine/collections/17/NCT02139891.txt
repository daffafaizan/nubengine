      Pacing activation from multiple separated left ventricular (LV) sites might improve the
      depolarization pattern, thereby promoting more physiological activation. To explore the
      effect of MPP on cardiac neuro-hormonal activity, the investigators will enroll approximately
      30 patients who already underwent CRT-D implantation with a quadripolar LV lead connected to
      a device capable of MPP.

      This pilot study will have a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either standard biventricular pacing (MPP-OFF) or MPP (MPP-ON) within
      4-6 months following the implantation procedure. Each subject will crossover to the other
      study group after three months. The baseline evaluation should be acquired prior to the
      device being programmed to the randomized setting. Repeat evaluations will be performed at
      the end of each 3 month crossover period.

      Participation in this study will last approximately 6 months. Patients, as well as
      investigators other than the EP physicians, will be blinded to the pacing mode.
