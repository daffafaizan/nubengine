      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of temozolomide in combination with
      niraparib and atezolizumab. (Phase Ib) II. Evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus
      temozolomide plus atezolizumab at RP2D (Arm A) compared with atezolizumab (Arm B) as measured
      by progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with
      atezolizumab alone, as measured by overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with
      atezolizumab alone, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) as measured by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      III. To evaluate the safety of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with
      atezolizumab alone as measured by adverse events (AEs).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess participant-reported outcomes on health-related quality of life and adverse
      events.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and niraparib PO
      QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard of care atezolizumab intravenously (IV)
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive standard of care atezolizumab IV every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for
      24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.
