    
      The specific aims of this proposal are to:

        1. Collect clinical data (e.g., weight, blood pressure, body composition, blood sample), as
           well as monitor physical activity and eating patterns, before and after bariatric
           surgery (Adults Only).

        2. Analyze clinical data, physical activity and eating patterns to determine how the health
           of patients and their families change after one family member completes bariatric
           surgery (Adults Only).

        3. Determine the feasibility of recruiting patients, spouses/partners and their children.
