      determine cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The evaluation, either in person or remote,
      will include cognitive testing, clinical and neurological evaluation, a review medical
      records and medical history and an examination as deemed necessary by a dementia physician.
      Eligible participants will undergo baseline testing including linguistic analyses and will be
      randomly assigned to one of 3 intervention groups. Participants and their study partners will
      be contacted at least once every three months for cognitive testing and medical review.

      per month, for the first six months study enrollment.
