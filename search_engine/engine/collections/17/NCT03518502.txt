      metastasis (EHM). However, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) which is a standard therapy
      for intermediate stage may be beneficial for controlling intrahepatic tumour, thereby
      providing chance of improving survival in HCC patients with EHM.

      The investigators aimed to compare the efficacy between the sorafenib monotherapy and
      TACE-sorafenib sequential therapy in HCC patients with EHM.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled study being conducted at 6 tertiary
      hospitals in South Korea. HCC patients with EHM are being enrolled and randomized into
      sorafenib monotherapy or TACE-sorafenib sequential therapy group. Patients with main portal
      vein invasion, Child-Pugh class B or C, and history of TACE or previous systemic therapy are
      being excluded. The sorafenib monotherapy group receives sorafenib immediately after
      randomization while the TACE-sorafenib group receives 2~4 times of TACE before starting
      sorafenib. Response evaluation are performed every 2 months, and time to progression (TTP),
      progression free survival (PFS), median survival time (MST), and overall survival (OS) which
      is the primary outcome measure will be compared.
