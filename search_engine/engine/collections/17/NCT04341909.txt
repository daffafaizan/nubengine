      adverse events (including tecnical failure) of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      procedures (ERCP) conducted in a teaching setting, with trainee involvement.

      It has previously shown that ERCP procedures with trainee involvement have no additional risk
      for the patient, but we aim to evaluate whether a subgroup of high-risk procedures can be
      identified to allow an improvement of the teaching of ERCP, including identifying some high
      risk features that might indicate that trainee involvement should not be warranted.

      Briefly, the study is observational in nature and aims to gather clinical data about the
      patient and technical data about the procedure (including the degree of trainee involvement(
      to assess which (if any) procedures carry a higher risk for the patient in a training
      setting.

      data will be gathered using a standard report form completed by the attending endoscopist at
      the end of each procedure; the form will then be updated at 30days interval with data about
      potential adverse events.

      Patient identity will be protected throughout the study as per regulations in each
      institution and country; also all patients will sign an informed consent prior to the
      endoscopic procedure and study enrollment.
