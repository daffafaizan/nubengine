      Primary

        -  Determine the quality of life of older patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the mood status and autonomy of activity of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV twice in week 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed during study therapy in weeks 3-4, 7-8, and 11-12, and then at 6
      and 12 months after completion of study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study.
