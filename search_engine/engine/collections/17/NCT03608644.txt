      developing world. In Egypt, the total lifetime prevalence of ischemic stroke was 7.2/1,000 in
      the population aged 20 years and more . Although the intravenous thrombolysis is a treatment
      option within â‰¤ 4.5 hours after stroke onset, the mechanical thrombectomy can be performed
      within a more extended time window. A positive results of 5 recent randomized clinical trials
      are driven mainly from patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours from onset
      and they demonstrated a clear benefit for mechanical thrombectomy in combination with
      intravenous thrombolysis. More recent two randomized clinical trials DAWN and DEFUSE 3
      demonstrated an overall benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in patients treated with
      mechanical thrombectomy within 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 16 hours form onset respectively with
      special criteria. A major issue remains as to identifying patients which likely to benefit
      from mechanical thrombectomy to improve selection and subsequently clinical prognosis .

      These factors include:-

        1. Time of presentation.

        2. Age.

        3. Clinical presentation.

        4. Risk factors include Hyperglycemia, peripheral vessel disease, atrial fibrillation,
           coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and history of pervious stroke,

        5. Socioeconomic status.

        6. Collateral and stroke core. In this study the investigators will evaluate prognostic
           factors influencing angiographic and clinical outcomes at discharge and at three months
           after mechanical thrombectomy of acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours.
