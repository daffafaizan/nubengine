      risk of stroke from 25-year-age onward. Minor ischemic events, including minor stroke and
      TIA, were major parts of stroke manifestations. Events (CHANCE) has shown that 21-day dual
      antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) compared to aspirin alone which initiated
      within 24 hours after symptoms onset would reduce 32% risk of stroke recurrence within 90
      day, but not in carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles. The primary purpose of
      this study is to compare ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin on reducing
      the 3-month risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when
      initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in CYP2Y19 LOF alleles carriers with TIA or minor
      stroke.

      Both intent analysis (ITT) and compliance program set (PPS) were used for analysis.

      We will use Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
      event during maximum 90-day follow-up, with hazards ratios and 95% CI calculated using Cox
      proportional hazards methods and the log-rank test to evaluate the treatment effect. All
      statistics will be 2-sided with P<0.05 considered significant, accounting for interim
      analyses.

      All patients who received study drugs and with at least one safety follow-up record will be
      included in the safety population. The data for safety evaluation included adverse reactions
      observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment.
