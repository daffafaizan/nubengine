      underling this metabolic disorder are unknown.

      Sorafenib is probably the drug in which this metabolic disturbance is most frequent. The aim
      of the study is identify variation of blood serum analites involved in hypophosphatemia in
      patients with advanced renal cells carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma in treatment with sorafenib.
