    
      The UK DM Patient Registry (https://www.dm-registry.org/uk/) aims to recruit any individual,
      from anywhere within the United Kingdom, with a diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy who may be
      interested in becoming involved in future planned clinical trials. Participants may be
      referred to the registry by health care professionals, genetic testing/laboratory centres who
      are aware of the registry. Alternatively, a participant may have discovered the registry via
      promotional activities or by their own online searches. After completing the consent process,
      participants are able to enter information on to the registry platform (note all forms are
      also available offline as well). This is an ongoing database and all participants will
      invited to update their information on an annual basis.

      The registry is sponsored by Muscular Dystrophy UK and the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group.

      The database is divided into two main sections:

        1. Mandatory items (demographic information, clinical diagnosis, genetic test result,
           current best motor function and wheelchair use) and

        2. Highly encouraged items (severity of muscle symptoms, cardiac status, respiratory
           function, digestion, cataracts, and fatigue, ethnic origin and data on involvement with
           other registries)

      The database is designed to be self reporting, however where specialised clinical or genetic
      information is required, the neuromuscular specialist in charge of the participants care can
      be invited to provide some additional information. The participant is able to select a health
      care provider from a pre-populated list at registration stage, if they wish to (optional
      feature). This information is included in the patient information and consent. Relevant R&D
      approval has been sought.
