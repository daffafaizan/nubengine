      taking these drugs is atrial fibrillation and, in everyday practice, most patients with
      atrial fibrillation are older people. However, only a few, limited, studies have provided
      data about the pharmacology of new oral direct anticoagulants in older persons. Furthermore,
      this limited data strongly suggests that, in older patients, mean concentrations, overall
      exposition and half-live of these drugs are increased, as compared with younger people. This
      study try to better define wether the pharmacology of each of these 3 drugs (dabigatran,
      rivaroxaban and apixaban) is actually significantly different in very older patients (over
      80) and to which extend. The investigators also try to characterize the main determinants
      (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) of the variability observed between
      individuals in their response to he drugs studied. The method employed is a population
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study. This is, many people (projected 225 patients) will
      have a few blood samples each and all data will be pooled using statistical methods specific
      to this kind of studies. Each patient will have one to five blood samples, taken at te same
      time that routine blood analysis, to determine plasma concentrations of the studied drug. In
      addition, patients will be followed for thrombotic and haemorrhagic events at 6 and 12
      months.
