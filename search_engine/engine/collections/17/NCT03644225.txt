      deposition of collagen and temporary edema in the dermis. The clinical palpation method is
      currently the only diagnosis method. For an objective detection a non-invasive skin
      elasticity measurement can be performed. The widely used approach is based on local tissue
      suction. This study aims at an identification and quantification of mechanical and structural
      properties of human skin. The results will then be compared in age- and gender matched
      control groups. For evaluation of the skin elasticity measurement the results will be
      compared to the clinical parametar validated, modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS).

      The mechanical properties of healthy and diseased skin will be assessed by suction based
      measurements. The negative pressure is needed to gain a certain tissue elevation. Tissue
      elevation in response to a certain negative pressure as well as the time of retraction of
      tissue will be recorded and analyzed. (The different parameters depend on
