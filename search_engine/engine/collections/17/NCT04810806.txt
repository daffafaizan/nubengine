      2 hours after randomization) and delayed CAG after stabilization of acute decompensated heart
      failure (ADHF) in patients with acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)
      complicated by ADHF. This study is a prospective, non-blinded, randomized trial.

      Study background An ADHF is frequently encountered in patients with NSTE-ACS. Although its
      incidence has been decreased during the decades, it is still high up to 8-12% at initial
      presentation of NSTE-ACS. Patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF is also known to be
      associated with worse in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes than those without heart
      failure (HF). Because revascularization could reduce mortality in these patients, it should
      be done in all patients with NSTE-ACS with ADHF. Current guidelines recommend immediate CAG
      within 2 hours after admission in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF. However, it is
      difficult to decide the timing of coronary angiography in these high risk patients.

      Notably, the most of randomized trials about the timing of coronary angiography in NSTE-ACS
      excluded these high risk patients, therefore there is lack of evidence for immediate coronary
      angiography within 2 hours after admission in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF.

      Investigators will compare immediate CAG within 2 hours after admission and delayed CAG after
      stabilization of ADHF in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF by randomized controlled
      trial.

      Study hypothesis Immediate CAG within 2 hours after admission can reduce mortality compared
      to delayed CAG after stabilization of ADHF in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF.
