      detect and often lack external signs of injury on physical exam. The current gold standard
      imaging study is Computed Tomography (CT) with IV contrast, which is associated with
      radiation exposure. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a radiation-free alternative to detect
      abdominal injuries and has been studied primarily in adults and some older children, but
      evidence to support its use in young children is needed.

      This is a prospective study of children less than 8 years of age who are clinically stable
      and undergoing an abdominal CT with IV contrast as part of their clinical care due to
      concerns for abdominal trauma. Investigators will compare CEUS results with those obtained by
      CT. Investigators will additionally include retrospective data of children who underwent both
      abdominal CT and CEUS as part of clinical care.
