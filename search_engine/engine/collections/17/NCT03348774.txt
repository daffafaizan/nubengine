        1. To test the clinical impression of the disease courses by modeling the course of the
           disease in each of three sub-populations of patients where it is anticipated that one
           sub-population will experience relapsing and remitting disease activity, one will
           experience persistently active disease and another will exhibit a monophasic pattern.

        2. To develop predictive models for group membership to enhance the accuracy of prognosis.

        3. To test these models in the inception cohort of SLE patients within the Toronto Lupus
           Cohort.

      Study Design: Retrospective longitudinal observational cohort

      Patients will be categorised into three disease courses:

      I. Relapsing-remitting II. Persistently active III. Monophasic Relapsing/remitting is defined
      as periods of disease activity SLEDAI-2K of 4 or more, (but if only 4 cannot be from serology
      alone) less than 50% of the time alternating with periods of inactivity (SLEDAI-2K <4) over
      the course of follow-up.

      Persistently active disease is defined as SLEDAI-2K of 4 or more, (but if only 4 cannot be
      from serology alone), in greater than 80% of the visits, or no 2 consecutive visits with
      SLEDAI-2K < 4.

      Monophasic course is defined as disease activity SLEDAI-2K of 4 or more, (but if only 4
      cannot be from serology alone) for an initial period of less than 3 years followed by
      resolution and inactive disease (SLEDAI-2K of 0 excluding serology) for at least 5 years.

      Clinical and laboratory characteristics, therapies and outcomes for each subgroup will be
      described. Identification of all clinical and laboratory features of lupus contained in the
      CRF will be compared for each group, as well as the medications prescribed.
