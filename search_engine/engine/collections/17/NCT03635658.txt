      for future implant placement. The full thickness flap will be elevated including one extra
      tooth on each side of the edentulous area or if completely edentulous 5 mm on each side.. the
      bone bed will be prepared by cleaning any debris and Multiple decortication holes will be
      performed with a 2.0 mm round bur. the harvested bone from the chin is then mixed with the
      xenograft with ratio 1:1 and then put on the recipient site and will be covered with a
      collagen membrane with the Sausage technique (intervention group) and the other group the
      graft will be covered with titanium mesh (control group).

      flap is repositioned and sutured. followup for 6 months and then CBCT is done. Reopening
      after 6 months, core biopsy is taken by a 2 mm thickness trephine from the healed augmented
      bone at the site of implant placement and will be sent for histomorphometric analysis and the
      bone thickness (buccolingual ) dimension is measured using a caliper and from the CBCT (cone
      beam CT) the bone width gain will be calculates and recorded.

      postoperative complications( infection, wound dehiscence or membrane exposure) will be
      monitored and recorded.
