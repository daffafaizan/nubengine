    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously every day for 8 weeks; nonresponders receive an increased dose for an
      additional 8 weeks. Patients who respond at week 8 or 16 are then tapered to a lower
      maintenance dose of G-CSF administered every other day through week 40. The dose is adjusted
      to maintain an absolute neutrophil count above 1500.

      Patients are removed from study for failure to achieve a complete response by week 16,
      unacceptable nonhematologic toxicity, the identification of a clonal karyotype in marrow, or
      the onset of leukemia.
