        -  Determine the role of positron emission tomography using carbon-11 acetate (AC-PET) in
           the initial and subsequent management of patients with prostate cancer at intermediate
           or high risk for recurrence after initial curative therapy.

        -  Compare the value of AC-PET in predicting recurrence of prostate cancer with that of
           conventional approaches (e.g., pre-operative clinical staging, prostate-specific
           antigen, Gleason score, prostate and lymph node histology) in these patients.
