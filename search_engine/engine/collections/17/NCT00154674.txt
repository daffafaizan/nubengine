      emergency department to evaluate the safety and feasibility of application those invasive
      internal temperature regulator devices. Internal cooling catheter, "ICY" , and thermal
      regulator device, "Coolguard 2000" are applied to the patients from femoral vein. WE definite
      4 stages according to the temperature during the clinical trial: "The Cooling Phase",
      "Hypothermia phase", "Rewarming phase", and "Postrewarming phase". The temperature is lowed
      or elevated by the rate 0.5C/hr during the Cooling and Rewarming Phase, and it is maintained
      33 +/- 1 C during hypothermia phase for 12 hours according to the comment of ACLS. To
      understand the safety and feasibility, regular blood sampling, bedside EEG and vital
      monitors, and special sheets are designed to document the every reasons, time points or every
      clinical events during hypothermia therapy. The patients is observed until rewarming finish
      for 48 hours or till death if expired during post-resuscitation hypothermia therapy.
