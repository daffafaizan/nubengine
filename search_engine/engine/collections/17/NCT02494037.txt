      supplement their conventional oncology treatment regimen with some form of complementary or
      alternative medicine therapy or practice. A smaller percentage of these patients receive care
      from naturopathic doctors (NDs) who are board certified in naturopathic oncology (Fellows of
      the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology, FABNO) or have equivalent experience in caring
      for cancer patients and from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) providers with advanced
      training in oncology (DAOM or physicians with training in TCM). This level of care is being
      defined here as advanced integrative oncology (AIO). AIO clinics provide comprehensive
      science- and experience-based naturopathic and Chinese medical oncology integrated with each
      patient's conventional medical treatment.

      Although there have been some studies of complementary and alternative medicine use by cancer
      patients, little is known about the effectiveness of the naturopathic medicine and TCM
      provided to people with cancer in an integrative setting. While there is scientific evidence
      supporting specific treatments that are commonly used, systematic study of their
      effectiveness (especially when used in combination as commonly recommended) is virtually
      non-existent. An early step in the evaluation of clinical outcomes associated with AIO is to
      take a health service approach and seek to answer the question: "Does exposure to AIO
      services improve the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced stage cancer?"

      The survival outcome of advanced stage breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer
      patients treated at multiple naturopathic oncology clinics in North America will be tracked
      and compared to outcomes from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database
      in order to address the fundamentally important question of whether or not AIO has a
      beneficial impact on survival. Involvement of a total of twelve clinics from Canada and the
      US will allow the recruitment of a sufficient sample size to address this question as well as
      provide outcomes that enhance the generalizability for AIO across North America.
