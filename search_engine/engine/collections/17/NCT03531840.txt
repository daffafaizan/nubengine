        -  Malignant mesothelioma is an invasive and often fatal neoplasm that arises from
           mesothelium that lines several organs.

        -  Recent studies have identified germline mutations in the gene encoding breast cancer
           type 1 (BRCA1) associated protein-1 (BAP1) which can predispose to mesothelioma

        -  In addition to mesothelioma, germline BAP1 mutations confer increased susceptibility for
           the development of several other tumors including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma,
           renal cell cancers and possibly other cancers

        -  In addition to BAP1, we found several novel germline variants that have previously not
           been associated with risk of developing mesothelioma.

        -  As evidenced by recent data derived from ovarian and prostate cancer patients, mutations
           in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes can define subgroups of cancer patients with
           distinct vulnerabilities to DNA damage response inhibitors.

        -  Olaparib is a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in
           patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated

        -  Both established and patient derived mesothelioma cell lines with mutated DNA repair
           genes are sensitive to olaparib.

      Objective:

      -Determine the efficacy with respect to objective response rate of olaparib in patients with
      malignant mesothelioma based on somatic or germline mutation status of DNA repair genes

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have progressive, histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant
           mesothelioma.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Patients must have received prior platinum and pemetrexed based therapies

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, single center study of olaparib in subjects with malignant
           mesothelioma

        -  All subjects will take olaparib by mouth twice daily until disease progression or
           intolerable side effects

        -  Subjects will be assessed for safety (continuously) and efficacy (every 6 weeks)

        -  Subjects will be analyzed in 3 separate comparison groups according to their mutation
           status

             -  Comparison Group 1: Patients with a germline mutation in DNA repair genes

             -  Comparison Group 2: Patients with BAP1 somatic mutations

             -  Comparison Group 3: Patients with neither germline mutations nor BAP 1 somatic
                mutations

        -  Up to 30 evaluable subjects will be enrolled
