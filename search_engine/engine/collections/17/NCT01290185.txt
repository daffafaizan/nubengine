      continuous peripheral nerve block after total knee arthroplasty based on secondary block
      failures compared to the secondary block failures of the conventional, currently used
      stimulating catheters.

      Study design The trial is a prospective single-centre randomized double-blinded controlled
      trial. Patients will be randomized to (1) use of conventional stimulating catheters or (2) to
      use of a coiled catheter.

      Patient population Adult patients of at least 18 years of age undergoing unilateral knee
      arthroplasty, under spinal anaesthesia will be recruited in this randomized double blind
      controlled trial.

      Inclusion criteria: Ability to provide informed consent, understanding of the possible local
      anaesthetic-related complications, and understanding of the study protocol.

      Exclusion criteria: Any contraindication to peripheral nerve block, allergy to local
      anaesthetics, infection near the insertion site, ASA classification IV or V, pregnancy,
      chronic opioid analgesic therapy (>30mg morphine equivalent per day), coagulopathy, known
      hepatic or renal insufficiency, peripheral neuropathy and patient refusal.
