      subjects will undergo excisional biopsy of a lymphoma-containing lymph node for diagnosis and
      for generation of the Oncoquest-L vaccine. Patients will receive subcutaneous injections
      consisting of their autologous tumor-derived Oncoquest-L vaccine starting at approximately 4
      to 8 weeks after the biopsy. The first two doses will be given at a 2-week interval and the
      remaining 3 doses at monthly intervals. Patients will be monitored for response by performing
      imaging studies at baseline and 1 month after the fifth vaccination (Week 19). Additional
      imaging studies will be performed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months during
      the second year until relapse or disease progression whichever occurs sooner.
