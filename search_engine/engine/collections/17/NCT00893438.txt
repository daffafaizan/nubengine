        1. Intervention with web-based cognitive behavioral treatment

        2. Usual care

      The duration of the cognitive behavioural program is limited to 6 months. The adolescents who
      have been assigned to the usual care will get the opportunity to attend the program after
      these 6 months. The total follow-up time is 12 months after the start of the web-based
      program.

      The web-based program is developed for both the adolescents and the parents. The program
      consists of two parts, a psycho-educational part and a cognitive behavioural part consisting
      of 21 treatment modules. The therapist activates one or more treatment modules per week,
      dependent on the progress of the participant. Within a treatment module the participant will
      keep several journals, answer questions and do several assignments. All answers are sent to
      the therapist, with whom a weekly email contact will be realized.

      Efficacy of the web-based program will be determined after 6 months. There will be a
      follow-up measurement at 12 months.
