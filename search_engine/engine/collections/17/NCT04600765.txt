      therefore, have failed to provide clinicians and the general public with consistent and
      useful information on which to base reliable food-related health decisions. This is
      particularly relevant regarding plastic-derived chemicals (PDCs), such as Bisphenol A, now
      that the federal CLARITY-BPA program has failed to achieve scientific consensus.
      Investigators propose a novel human dietary protocol that is both replicable and causal,
      based upon BPA's demonstrated inflammatory effects in humans. This first-of-a-kind dietary
      intervention study explores a potential causal relationship between human serum levels of BPA
      and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), a proven clinical indicator of inflammation.
      Investigators used the equivalent of a USDA-defined "typical diet" followed by a PDC-reduced
      diet to compare blood levels of hsCRP. This proof-of-concept investigation is the first to
      use an easily accessible, medically-accepted clinical laboratory test to directly measure
      human health effects of PDC reduction. Unexpected new complications discovered during the
      investigation indicate that these results may yet be inconclusive for direct causal
      relationship. However, the novel lessons and techniques developed as a result of those
      discoveries offer further specific and improved methods and best practices that can enable
      future dietary interventions to produce replicable, causal results.
