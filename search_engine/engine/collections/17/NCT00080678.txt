      Primary

        -  Compare time to progression in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer and
           bone metastases treated with docetaxel with vs without imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response rates in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to hemoglobin (< 11g/dL vs â‰¥ 11 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase (normal vs
      elevated), number of prior regimens (0 vs 1 or 2), and ECOG performance score (0 or 1 vs 2).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral imatinib mesylate
           once daily on days 1-43.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and oral placebo once daily on days 1-43.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 43 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who progress on arm II may cross over to arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 152 patients (76 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
