      I. Assess the feasibility of administering bevacizumab, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and chest
      radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Characterize the toxicity of this treatment regimen. III. Assess the clinical response to
      this treatment regimen. IV. Correlate circulating levels of angiopoietin-2 and vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2 with clinical response to this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.Induction therapy.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1,
      8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.
      Patients also undergo chest radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1.

      Consolidation therapy: Beginning 4-5 weeks after completion chemoradiotherapy, patients
      receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour followed by
      bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After study completion, patients are followed periodically for 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
