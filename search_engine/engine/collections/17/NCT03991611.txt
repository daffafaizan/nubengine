      tailored multicomponent program based on assessment of self-perceived discomfort, feedback to
      the healthcare teams, and tailored site-targeted measures was effective to decrease
      self-perceived overall discomfort, we performed the 1-year follow-up of ICUs survivors
      included in the IPREA3 study to assess psychiatric morbidity at 1 year. Our tailored
      multicomponent program was also associated with less PTSD at 1 year. Based on this positive
      long-term result, this study confirms the need to implement a new strategy for reducing
      discomfort in the ICU based on such programs.

      PTSD-REA is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial involving 18 ICUs. The exposure will be
      the implementation of a tailored multicomponent program consisting of assessment of
      ICU-related self-perceived discomforts, immediate and monthly feedback to the healthcare
      team, and site-specific tailored interventions. The eligible patients will be exposed vs.
      unexposed general adult ICU survivors. The prevalence of substantial posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms at 1 year will be assessed by using diagnostic criteria adapted to
      the new definition of PTSD according to DSM-5.
