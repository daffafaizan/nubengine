      Injury. Moreover, it includes a wider investigation; in fact, it involves the assessment, not
      only of linguistic and pragmatic abilities but also of neuropsychological abilities and the
      theory of mind.

      Approximately 30 children with Acquired Brain Injury will be involved in the study.

      The data will be collected through the administration of the adapted version of ABaCo test,
      individually, to each subject involved in the study. The assessment will be conducted in the
      IRCCS Eugenio Medea. The assessor will administer ABaCo test through a computer device and
      she will marked the responses on a paper sheet. Video recordings are needed only to allow an
      impartial scoring. In fact, an external trained judge will do the scoring. The researchers
      will complete the scoring process within two weeks from the acquisition of the recordings,
      after that they will destroy the videos.

      Furthermore the linguistic abilities will be assessed through the administration of some
      subtests of the Italian battery "BVL 4-12". In particular, the researcher will administer the
      following subtests: "naming", "lexical comprehension" and "grammatical comprehension".

      Moreover, some neuropsychological abilities will be analysed using the test "BVN 5-11". In
      addition, the theory of mind and the non-verbal IQ will be assessed.

      The Socio-Economic-Status of the family involved in the research will also be investigated,
      considering its importance on the rehabilitation outcomes , using a questionnaire realized,
      based on the "Four Factor Index of Social Status".
