      hypertension in NHPIs. The multilevel 6-month intervention - "Engaging NHPIs and Activating
      Communities to Take Steps" (ENACTS) - will use peer-facilitated, self-care BP education
      delivered weekly for 8 weeks emphasizing healthy diet, traditional NHPI foods, adherence to
      medication, and encouragement to increase physical activity and stop smoking; with text
      messaging to boost adherence. ENACTS will be implemented as a randomized controlled trial at
      3 community sites serving NHPIs in the Puget Sound area of Washington. 270 NHPI adults (90
      per site) with a self-reported physician diagnosis of hypertension and elevated BP measured
      at enrollment will be randomized to either ENACTS or usual care.

      The primary outcome is change in systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are food purchasing
      behaviors (online ordering, grocery receipts); medication adherence; social support; smoking
      cessation; and GIS data on daily energy expenditure. The study will use a Geographic
      Information Systems (GIS) mobile phone app to track participants. Outcomes will be measured
      at baseline, weekly, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months. The study will also examine change in
      household food purchasing patterns, enhanced family support for BP control, and BP
      improvement among family members. A subset of intervention participants and family members
      will be invited to participate in a program that uses personal photographs for narrative art
      projects to promote labeling of healthy foods by local retail outlets.
