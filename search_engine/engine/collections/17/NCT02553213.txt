      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) leed to a significant improvement of glucose metabolism
      and in many cases to a complete remission of diabetes type II in obese patients. It is still
      unclear which mechanisms underlie these changes. Since the positive effects of bariatric
      surgery have been investigated within few days after surgical intervention, before
      significant weight loss has been achieved, the caloric restriction has been discussed as a
      possible mechanism.

      The aim of the study is to investigate, if bariatric surgery or the related caloric
      restriction causes the significant improvement of glucose metabolism, which has been found in
      bariatric patients. Therefore, the investigator will examine obese patients with diabetes
      type II or impaired glucose metabolism regarding possible metabolic changes within few days
      after bariatric surgery (LSG or LRYGB) or caloric restriction only.

      Group I: Patients undergoing LSG; Group II: Patients undergoing LRYGB; Group III (Control
      group): Patients undergoing caloric restriction;

      Dietetic, anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal parameters will be measured. Primary outcome
      marker is the insulin sensitivity according to Matsuda (MISI).

      The project is a prospective, controlled study. Study examinations will be performed before
      intervention, and one, two, three, four and five days after (start of) intervention, as well
      after one month.
