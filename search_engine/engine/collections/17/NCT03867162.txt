      The study population will consist of USAMRIID and qualified extramural participants who are
      at risk of exposure to tularemia bacteria. This study will be performed at the USAMRIID SIP
      Clinic. This open-label study represents a continuation of previous research conducted at
      USAMRIID.

      After the enrollment and approval for participation, each subject will be vaccinated with a
      bifurcated needle; approximately 0.06 mL of the reconstituted vaccine will be placed on the
      volar surface of the forearm and applied by multiple puncture. The subject will return for
      follow-up examination on Days 1 and 2; between Days 5-9, 12-16, and 28-35; and at 6 months (±
      14 days) after vaccination for clinical evaluation of AEs and to document responses to the
      vaccine. Additionally, the subject may be asked to return between Days 56-84 for a repeat
      titer if indicated and ordered by an investigator on the study. The subject's participation
      in this study will be considered complete at 6 months ± 14 days after vaccination or
      revaccination. Following documentation of a positive "take" reaction and a titer showing a ≥
      4-fold increase, routine repeat vaccinations or serosurveillance upon continued exposure to
      the organism are not included in this protocol.
