      I. Determine the response rate in patients with refractory, metastatic pancreatic cancer
      treated with weekly, sequential docetaxel and flavopiridol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, prospective study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes followed 4-6 hours later by flavopiridol IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
