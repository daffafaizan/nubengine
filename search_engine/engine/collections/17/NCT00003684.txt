      with cancer who are short of breath and have evidence of respiratory muscle weakness. II.
      Determine whether this drug will improve the ability to perform daily activities in this
      group of patients. III. Determine whether this drug will improve objective measures of lung
      function (e.g., FEV-1, FVC) and maximum inspiratory pressure in these patients. IV. Determine
      whether the serum theophylline level is related to the magnitude of the effect that is
      observed in this patient population. V. Determine whether this drug will improve a global
      rating of quality of life in this patient group.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to those who can complete a 6 minute walking test versus those who cannot. Patients
      receive either oral theophylline or placebo once daily for 3 days. In the absence of dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT), patients receive an increased dose for an additional 4 days. In the
      presence of DLT, patients receive a decreased dose or treatment is stopped. Following
      completion of the 7 day study period, patients may be given the option to continue on active
      drug or placebo for 1 additional month unless toxic side effects develop. Quality of life is
      assessed on days 1 and 8 and at the end of the additional 1 month period.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 in each arm) will be accrued for this study.
