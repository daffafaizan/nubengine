      patients may get a wound infection. Infection is a risk factor for incisional hernia, which
      12 months after the operation can be seen in 10-20% of the patients. Wound dehiscence is seen
      in approximately 1% of the patients. Surgery because of incisional hernias are common and in
      Sweden approximately 2000 patients per year needs an operation creating big costs. We know
      that a midline incision should be closed using a continuous technique, with a suture length
      to wound length ratio over 4. An earlier interventional study at the Surgical Department in
      Sundsvall showed that using that technique reduced the risk for hernia with 50%. Subsequent
      experimental studies indicates that the suture length to wound length ratio should be
      obtained by small stitches, placed close to each other only incorporating the aponeurosis,
      and not by large stitches incorporating the complete abdominal wall (mass closure). The
      hypothesis that midline incisions should be closed with small stitches only incorporating the
      aponeurosis has to be tested in a clinical trial.
