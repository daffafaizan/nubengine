      impaired glucosylceramide hydrolysis. Gaucher disease type 1, which is the most common form,
      accounts for greater than (>) 90% of cases and does not involve the central nervous system
      (CNS). Typical manifestations of Gaucher disease type 1 include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
      thrombocytopenia, anemia, bone disease, and decreased quality of life. The disease
      manifestations are caused by the accumulation of glucosylceramide (storage material) in
      macrophages (called Gaucher cells) which have infiltrated the spleen and liver as well as
      other tissues.

      Eliglustat tartrate is a small molecule drug developed as an oral therapy which acts to
      specifically inhibit production of this storage material in Gaucher cells.

      This study was designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and PK of eliglustat tartrate in
      adult participants with Gaucher disease type 1 who had been stabilized on ERT.
