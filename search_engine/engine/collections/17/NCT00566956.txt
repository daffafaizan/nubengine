      have suggested that the treatment of hydrosalpinx pre-IVF would improve the pregnancy rate to
      a level similar to tubal disease patients without hydrosalpinx. The treatment modalities
      explored were salpingectomy, salpingostomy, tubal occlusion and ultrasound-guided aspiration
      either one month before or at the time of egg collection. All studies reported to date have
      been retrospective and with poor control design. A prospective randomised controlled trial is
      needed. All modalities have been associated with a similar improvement in pregnancy rate, but
      the least invasive modality is ultrasound-guided aspiration at the time of oocyte collection.
      We propose to conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      ultrasound-guided aspiration (versus no aspiration) of hydrosalpinx at the time of egg
      collection on the pregnancy rate in IVF.
