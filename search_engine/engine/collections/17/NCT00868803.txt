      throughout prostatic neoplastic progression. The approaches proposed exploit the known
      familial arm of prostatic cancer, using established molecular genetic approaches, and extend
      these studies to sporadic prostatic cancer using a novel technique of differential display.
      Application of the latter technique to colon cancer in the American population establishes
      this tumor type as a high priority for scientific investigation and this study is part of an
      initiative to address this problem. Presently the studies in the field of prostate are
      under-represented. The collection of tissue samples from patients diagnosed with prostate
      cancer. Patients will also provide a blood sample at the time of their surgery and
      potentially post-op from 6 mos to 5 years. Samples will also be obtained from patients who's
      biopsy turns out to be non-prostate cancer. These samples will be obtained shortly following
      the biopsy out to 6 months after the biopsy.
