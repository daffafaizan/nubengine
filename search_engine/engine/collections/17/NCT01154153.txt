    
      The study consisted of a run-in single-blind screening phase (prerandomization) followed by
      an approximately 6-week double-blind treatment phase (postrandomization).

      Total study duration per participant lasted from 7.5 to 13 weeks and consisted of:

        -  Screening and single-blind phases (these 2 phases ran concurrently, prerandomization)
           for 8 to 24 days. During the screening phase participants were given a single-blind
           placebo nasal spray to enable them to practice their intranasal application technique
           once daily in the morning (1 actuation/nostril).

        -  Randomization to the double-blind treatment phase. Treatment assignment was randomized
           with stratification by sex and age group (>=2 to <6, >=6 to <12 years old).

        -  Double-blind treatment phase which lasted at least 42 days and ran up to 47 days.
           Participants were administered either TAA-AQ nasal spray or placebo nasal spray.

        -  An evaluation at the end of treatment 1-3 days after completion of the double-blind
           phase.
