      (HDRS-17) scores from the beginning to end of treatment. We expect that this decrease will be
      significantly greater in subjects receiving active transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      compared to those receiving placebo TMS. Treatment response will be defined as greater than
      50% reduction in HDRS-17 score.

      We also hypothesize that levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein
      thought to regulate mood and cognitive functioning, will increase in subjects who respond to
      TMS treatment. We expect BDNF levels to increase by greater than or equal to 20% in those who
      respond to TMS. As previously stated, TMS response will be defined as a significant decrease
      (50% or greater) in the HDRS-17 from baseline to end of treatment.
