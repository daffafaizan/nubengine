      Primary

        -  Compare the tolerability (in terms of drug delivery and toxicity) of neoadjuvant vs
           adjuvant chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium in patients with
           resectable stage IB or II non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the overall clinical response rate, pathologic complete response, and
           resectability rate in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the surgical morbidity and mortality of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the fraction of patients in the adjuvant arm that receives chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to institution, histological subtype (squamous vs nonsquamous) and clinical stage
      (IB vs II). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3-6 hours and
           pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Four to six weeks after
           completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery.

        -  Arm II (adjuvant chemotherapy): Patients undergo surgery. Beginning 4-8 weeks after
           surgery, patients receive cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium as in arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 132 patients will be accrued for this study.
