      They completed two, 7-day conditions in random order with a minimum of a 7-day washout period
      between study days. They consumed either a high protein (PRO) or high carbohydrate (CHO)
      breakfast for 6 days of acclimatization, and on the seventh day, they reported to the lab at
      0700 hours following a ~12 hour overnight fast and underwent forearm catheterization before a
      baseline blood draw. The participants consumed the respective breakfast at ~0730 hours. Four
      hours post-breakfast, subjects consumed a standard lunch meal. Blood samples were taken
      continuously throughout the 8-hour test day.
