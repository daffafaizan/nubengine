      ischemic stroke patients. Many patients receive tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) with
      considerable delay. The investigators developed an ambulance equipped with a CT-scanner,
      point-of-care laboratory, teleradiological support and an emergency trained neurologist on
      board. In the Pre-Hospital Acute Neurological Therapy and Optimization of Medical care in
      Stroke patients (PHANTOM-S)-study the investigators aim at a reduction of the current
      alarm-to-needle time by pre-hospital use of tissue Plasminogen Activator in an ambulance.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care we will reduce alarm-to-needle
      time by a minimum of 20 minutes by implementation of the stroke emergency mobile unit
      (STEMO).

      This is a prospective study comparing randomly allocated periods with and without STEMO
      availability.
