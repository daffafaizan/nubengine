      was drawn and ex- vivo spiked with rFVIIa/FEIBA and combinations, assayed by thrombin
      generation tests.

      The combination yielding sufficient hemostasis was depicted for patients' therapy of future
      bleeding episodes.

      Following actual therapy hemostasis and safety parameters were monitored.
