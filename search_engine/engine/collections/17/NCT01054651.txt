      the absence of a vaccine, the major control strategy is the reduction of morbidity by
      chemotherapy using Praziquantel. Evidence from laboratory studies and field trials continue
      to show that schistosome worms have developed reduced susceptibility to Praziquantel. These
      observations indicate the need for research to monitor the trends in efficacy of praziquantel
      and the need for research to develop novel antischistosomal drugs. Randomized controlled
      trials have also shown that Artemisinin derivatives (artesunate, artemether) have
      antischistosomal activity against S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum. We propose to
      conduct an open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the comparative efficacy of artesunate
      plus sulfamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine versus Praziquantel in the treatment of 212 school
      children infected with S.mansoni in Rarieda district in western Kenya. To do this we will
      screen about 1000 school children by examination of stool for schistosome eggs. Eligible
      children will be randomized to receive either artesunate plus
      sulfamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine over 3 days or a single dose of Praziquantel. Four weeks
      after treatment, the participants will be assessed for cure and egg reduction.Our study may
      provide vital information regarding an alternative treatment for S. mansoni infection in
      children.
