      These antigens consist of a small peptide, derived from endogenous proteins, that is
      presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides,
      including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2, have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to
      elicit CTL responses in cancer patients, mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now, only
      rare tumor responses have been observed.

      Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of
      cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and
      selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses.
      Recently, we have identified a novel mechanism causing anergy of tumor-associated T
      lymphocytes, and established new approaches to correct this anergy in vitro. Galectin-3,
      secreted by tumor cells, appears to inhibit CTL function the co-localization of the T cell
      receptor and the cluster of differentiation 8 coreceptor. Importantly, this functional defect
      is restored when anergic T cells are incubated with galectin-3 inhibitors such as the
      disaccharides lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, and the polysaccharide GM-CT-01. GM-CT-01 is a
      vegetal galactomannan oligomer, currently under clinical investigation in several types of
      solid malignancies for its capacity to inhibit galectins and to synergize with chemotherapy
      drugs.

      Our observations suggest that treatment of cancer patients with GM-CT-01 could correct TIL
      anergy and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response following
      peptide vaccination.
