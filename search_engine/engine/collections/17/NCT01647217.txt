      investigators preliminary clinical study showed that lid scrub with TTO was effective in
      resolving chronic blepharoconjunctivitis; however, it was not convenient for
      self-administration and caused irritation in some patients. Preclinical safety studies have
      verified that T4O is less irritant. In this study, the investigators will determine the
      optimal regimen of T4O Pads.
