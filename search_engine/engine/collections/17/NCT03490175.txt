      Surgery and anesthesia are related to unwanted adverse events, side effects and postoperative
      discomfort. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are frequent and the question arises which
      patient is at specific risk for these sequelae. Some predisposing factors for PONV are well
      described, e.g. female sex, non-smoking status and postoperative opioids. Some drugs used for
      anesthesia as well as surgery related variables might induce PONV.

      In this prospective association study patient related variables, surgical and anesthesia
      related variables as well as genetic variants of several candidate genes will be investigated
      in a well-described patient cohort presenting for scheduled surgery.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to investigate a possible association of non-genetic variables and
      genetic variants with PONV.

      Methods

      Prospective association study performed in patients recovering form elective surgery and
      anesthesia.
