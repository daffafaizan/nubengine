      newly-diagnosed, pathologically-proven, untreated locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (LANPC) at high-risk of distant metastasis (T4N1 and T1-4N2-3, according to
      American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]/Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] 8th
      edition clinical staging system). Patients will receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy
      (IC; gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen) followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
      alone. Nivolumab injection OPDIVOÂ® will start on day 1 of the first cycle IC and continue
      every 3 weeks for 6 cycles till the end of IMRT, involving the whole-course of IC + IMRT
      alone. The first and last 3 cycles of nivolumab are administrated concurrently with IC and
      IMRT, respectively. After 4 weeks of the completion of IMRT, adjuvant nivolumab will begin
      every 4 weeks for 6 cycles.
