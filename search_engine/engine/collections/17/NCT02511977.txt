      rehabilitation of edentulous jaw with overdentures, and it is the dentist's duty to inform
      and guide patients, and keep their maintenance in order to prevent pathological processes
      that can lead to the implanted component loss.The aim of the present retrospective
      longitudinal study was to evaluate through clinical periodontal parameters and radiographic
      images in dental implants rehabilitated with overdentures installed seven years ago.
      individuals who underwent the installation of dental implants for making full
      implant-supported upper and lower mucus dentures in the Department of Implant Dentistry,
      Faculty of Dentistry, University of Santo Amaro, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. The periodontal
      parameters such as probing depth, plaque index, bleeding index and mobility as well as
      radiographic examination, are key to determine the correct diagnosis in dental implants. The
      control of biofilm around the implants seems to be a decisive factor for maintaining tissue
      health.
