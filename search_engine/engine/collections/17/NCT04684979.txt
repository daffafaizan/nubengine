    
      This is a phase 2 study of a treatment regimen consisting of a non-myeloablative (NMA)
      conditioning regimen incorporating low dose chemotherapy and low dose radiation as well as
      peri-transplant Rituximab and the transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from
      an HLA compatible related or unrelated donor in patients with B cell lymphoid malignancies
      including diffuse large cell (DLBCLC) and mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCL), indolent
      B cell NHL, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study design will be based on a total
      of 90 patients, 30 recipients of related matched and 60 recipients of mismatched related or
      unrelated PBSCT.

      It is anticipated that the accrual will last 5-6 years. At the conclusion of the study, the
      safety and a preliminary assessment of efficacy of NMA PBSCT will be determined. The
      treatment will be declared efficacious if the disease-free survival at 1 year in this patient
      population is at least 50%.
