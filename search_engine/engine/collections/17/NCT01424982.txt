    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy (event-free survival) of an intensive short-term
      chemotherapy regimen (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide-vincristine sulfate-Adriamycin
      [doxorubicin hydrochloride]-dexamethasone [hyper-CVAD] program) given in combination with the
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib hydrochloride (ponatinib) for Philadelphia (Ph)-positive
      and/or BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To evaluate other clinical efficacy endpoints (overall response rate and survival) and
      safety of the regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      ODD CYCLES (1, 3, 5, and 7): Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 3
      hours every 12 hours on days 1-3, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on
      day 4, vincristine sulfate IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 11, dexamethasone IV over 30
      minutes or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4 and 11-14, and ponatinib hydrochloride PO
      QD on days 1-14 of cycle 1 and continuously in cycles 3, 5, and 7. Patients with CD20
      expression may also receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 11 of cycle 1 and 3. Treatment repeats
      every 3-4 weeks for up to 8 cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      EVEN CYCLES (2, 4, 6, and 8): Patients receive methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1,
      ponatinib hydrochloride PO QD continuously, and cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on
      days 2 and 3. Patients with CD20 expression may also receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8 of
      cycle 2 and 4. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for up to 8 cycle in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, prednisone PO daily on
      days 1-5, and ponatinib hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Cycle repeat every 28 days for 24
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 24 months.
