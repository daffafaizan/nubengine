      been taking an AI for at least 2 months and are currently experiencing at least mild
      arthralgia associated with AI use, the effect of a randomized controlled exercise
      intervention vs. attention control (health education) on severity of arthralgia,
      endocrine-related Quality of Life(QOL), Bone Mineral Density(BMD), and mediators/mechanisms
      influencing the effect of exercise on arthralgia severity. Women will be randomized to a year
      long exercise program or attention control group. Women randomized to exercise will
      participate in 150 min/wk of aerobic exercise and a twice-weekly strength training program.
      The investigators will conduct baseline, six-, and 12-month clinic visits, as well as a 3-
      and 9-month mailing to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes.
