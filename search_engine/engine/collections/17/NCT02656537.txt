      not immediately apparent, but the abnormal atrial substrates are the likely predominant
      mechanisms. Additional catheter ablation strategies targeting for atrial substrate
      modification have been introduced. The common strategies involve either application of
      empirical linear lesion sets in the atrial areas or ablation of atrial areas with complex
      fractionated atrial electrograms in addition to pulmonary vein isolation. Nevertheless, the
      corresponding success rates in long-term sinus rhythm maintenance are modest.

      Non-paroxysmal AF and left AT are characterized by fast and regular atrial activities,
      complex fractionated atrial electrograms, consistent direction of wave front propagation, and
      low peak-to-peak voltage. Advanced high-density three-dimensional catheter mapping strategies
      to target the evaluation of these characteristics and mechanisms responsible for the AF and
      left AT, identification of atrial areas with low peak-to-peak voltages and determination of
      the "critical" atrial targets for catheter ablation during the procedures would be essential.

      In this clinical investigation, the safety, feasibility and performance of the novel EnSiteâ„¢
      HD Grid Catheter mapping system for advanced high-density three-dimensional mapping will be
      studied in patients undergoing catheter ablation procedures for the treatment of
      non-paroxysmal AF or left AT.
