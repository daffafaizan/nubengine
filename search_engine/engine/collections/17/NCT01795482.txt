      preoperative skin-surface warming (prewarming) to prevent perioperative hypothermia in
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery under combined general/epidural anaesthesia. The
      investigators plan to enroll 99 patients in 3 groups. Body temperature will be measured at
      the tympanic membrane. The investigators hypothesize that active warming before starting the
      epidural anaesthesia will decrease the incidence of perioperative hypothermia.
