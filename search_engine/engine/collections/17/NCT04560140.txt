      young stroke survivors' community reintegration and psychosocial outcomes. A randomised
      controlled trial will be conducted. Participants will be facilitated to narrate their
      survival experiences and rebuild core life skills. Outcomes including community
      reintegration, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, outcome
      expectation and satisfaction with performance of self-management behaviours will be measured.
      This is a novel trial to test the short and long-term effects of a theory-based intervention
      on young stroke survivors' community reintegration.
