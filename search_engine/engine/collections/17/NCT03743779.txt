      their participation in the survey. The email will contain a hot link to a REDCap survey which
      will begin with a description of the study followed by a consent form. Once the consent is
      agreed, the survey will ask for participants' demographics and information about the
      variables described below

      No personal identifiable information is being collected.

      The data from this study will help develop a prospective study to better evaluate the
      effectiveness of Mastering Diabetes in controlling diabetes.

      Future comparative studies between programs are anticipated, which will help identify the
      strengths and weaknesses of different programs, as well as identify subpopulations that might
      benefit from one program as opposed to another.

      Data will be shared via posters and papers among the lifestyle medicine community to help
      contribute to better lifestyle interventions.
