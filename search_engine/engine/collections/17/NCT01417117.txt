      patients with acute brain injury. By comparing the outcomes of patients with and without DWI
      abnormalities, we would able to assess the impact these lesions have on functional recovery
      in patients with ICH. Since no direct therapies exist for this disease, DWI abnormalities may
      be a novel target for intervention to improve outcomes. If traditionally assessed functional
      outcomes are not affected by DWI, the mechanism behind these lesions would still warrant
      further evaluation and potential treatment. Detection of subclinical infarcts has emerged as
      a potential surrogate marker for subsequent risk of stroke, vascular dementia, and cognitive
      impairment. Furthermore, the cause behind DWI lesions in acute ICH may lead to better
      understanding the pathophysiologic interplay between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.
