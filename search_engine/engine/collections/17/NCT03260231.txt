      metabolism. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma have impaired fatty acid profiles, low level
      of PUFAs, and high n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio. Moreover, these changes are related to clinical
      outcome.

      Flax seeds, sesame and pumpkin seeds are rich sources of PUFAs. Dietary intake of milled mix
      of these seeds has been shown to decrease inflammation and improve PUFAs status in patients
      on hemodialysis and to decrease breast cancer risk.

      The study design is single-blind, controlled, randomized nutritional intervention. The
      participants are randomly assigned into intervention and control group before starting
      chemotherapy. All patients receive nutritional counseling to achieve a daily energy and
      protein intake according to recommended dietary allowances, with (intervention) or without
      (control) of milled seed mix.
