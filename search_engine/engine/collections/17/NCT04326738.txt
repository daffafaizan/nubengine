      18~30kg·m-2 were selected in this study.The patients were equally randomized into two groups:
      midazolam (M) group and normal saline (N) group, 45 cases in each group. Before anesthesia
      induction, M group received intravenous injection of 0.03mg·kg-1 (1mg·ml-1) midazolam, while
      N group received corresponding intravenous normal saline of the same volume. After 1 min,
      both groups received intravenous injection of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection of
      10mg (injection was completed in 2s). The anesthesiologist assessed perineal irritation in
      both groups and recorded the number of cases,visual analogue scores (VAS) ,duration of
      itching or pain,Ramsay scores and observed the occurrence of adverse reactions such as
      dizziness and respiratory depression in the two groups.
