      myotomy and myectomy (LVMM) or mitral valve replacement. As alternative therapies to cardiac
      surgery, we propose to compare the abilities of dual chamber (DDD) pacing and percutaneous
      transluminal septal ablation (PTSA) to reduce left ventricular (LV) outflow pressure
      gradients and to improve exercise performance in patients with obstructive HCM and severe
      symptoms who have failed to benefit from pharmacotherapy.
