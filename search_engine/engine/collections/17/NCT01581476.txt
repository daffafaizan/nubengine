    
      Subjects will be recruited from a pre-screened population of 3,000 young people with T1D aged
      10 to 16 years based on assessment of risk for future CVD and DN.

      They will be randomised to a 2 x 2 factorial design contrasting the effects of ACEI, statins,
      or combination therapy to placebo over a maximum four year treatment period. Minimisation of
      variation in albumin excretion rate, gender, age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, total cholesterol
      and centre site will be undertaken at randomisation.

      Analysis of the primary endpoint, change in albumin excretion will be undertaken on an
      intention to treat basis. Secondary analyses will be undertaken on the basis of 'as treated'
      allowing for variance in compliance and allowing for subjects who show substantial change in
      HbA1c levels. Additional analyses will be undertaken to assess changes in the secondary
      objectives and to assess the overall effect of the intervention on quality of life and health
      economics.
