      with GNRH Agonist combined with high daily FSH doses followed with ovulation induction with
      HCG 10000 IU, ovum pick-up 34-36 hours after HCG injection and embryo transfer on day 2, 3 or
      5.

      In routine ART procedure for IVF, embryology is done in very high tech lab, contamination
      free environment, which also exclude VOC, high quality CO2 Incubators, laminar flow with
      heated table top, high magnification stereo microscope along with equipments for maintaining
      quality control, with a highly trained embryologist. The primary reason is we need to create
      a womb like environment in the embryology lab as eggs, and mainly fertilised embryos are
      going to spend minimum 2 or 3 and in case blastocyst 5 days in this lab.

      In recent years, various studies have been published identifying various minimal stimulation
      protocols for IVF, and also another variation of IVF where rather than using CO2 Incubator
      for culturing, vaginal cavity of the female partner is used for incubation using a specially
      designed capsule which have walls permeable to vaginal pCO2 and O2. Oocytes are retrieved by
      the physician and handed over to basic embryologist to identify and grade oocytes and washed
      sperms are placed in a embryo toxic tested, sterile, individual single use capsule (INVOCell)
      and placed in vaginal cavity using diaphragm, patient goes back to home with some
      instructions for care, on day 2 patient comes back to the IVF Clinic and physician gets the
      capsule out and hands over to the basic embryologist trained on INVOCell to identify embryos
      and grade them, further loading of embryos on ET Catheter.
