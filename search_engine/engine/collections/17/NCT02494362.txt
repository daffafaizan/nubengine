      after Stroke affecting the hand. The design allows a broad range of common objects of daily
      life to be seamlessly transformed into 'therapeutic' input devices by instrumenting with a
      small motion sense mouse. Based on individual abilities and treatment needs, objects are
      selected to train specific fine/ gross dexterous functions. The object manipulations
      (therapeutic exercises) are then used to control and play any commercially available computer
      game, making practice challenging and engaging.

      The study is of twelve weeks duration comparing the computer gaming and conventional hand
      exercises in ten people with hemiplegia after Stroke affecting the hand. The investigators
      hypothesize that the game based exercises will improve hand function and will be feasible. A
      mixed-effect repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to test pre to post
      treatment outcomes.
