      confounder-corrected R2* mapping method as a quantitative imaging biomarker of liver iron
      concentration (LIC). Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver,
      which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at
      reducing body iron stores. Measurement of LIC is critical for detection and staging of iron
      overload, and for monitoring iron-reducing chelator therapies that are expensive and have
      side effects. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely available, accessible, and safe
      technology, and it is very sensitive to the presence of iron in tissue. Translation of an MRI
      biomarker of liver iron concentration into broad clinical use requires that it is clinically
      feasible, precise, robust to changes in scan parameters, calibrated to a validated reference
      standard of LIC, and is reproducible across sites and manufacturers. There are currently no
      available MRI methods that meet these requirements. R2*-MRI holds the greatest promise to
      meet these requirements. R2* mapping can be performed very rapidly with whole-liver 3D
      coverage in a single 20s breath-hold.

      Protocol Modification approved to include additional liver susceptibility measurements for
      approximately 10 participants (already enrolled at the UW) via recently acquired
      Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). The completion of this additional
      imaging will depend upon the successful set up and installation of this device.
