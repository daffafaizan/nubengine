      measure to reduce portal hypertension and prevent portal hypertension-related complications.
      It can be used as a symptomatic treatment in patients with chronic portal hypertension as
      well as for the treatment of active variceal bleedings or large gastrointestinal varices that
      go along with threatening bleeding danger.

      However, this invasive procedure carries a high risk for complications. 30-days mortality
      after TIPS implantation amounts between 4% and 45%.

      A common complication is the (initial) manifestation or deterioration of hepatic
      encephalopathy, which occurs in 33-46 % after TIPS implantation.

      Other complications that are directly related to the intervention are bleeding, infections
      and stent migration.

      Aim of this retrospective single centre study is to investigate the long-term outcome after
      TIPS implantation with regard to transplantation free survival and time to (re-) occurrence
      of portal hypertension-related complications, especially ascites and hepatic encephalopathy.

      Intervention-related complications as well as long-term effects should be evaluated to
      facilitate the decision for or against TIPS.
