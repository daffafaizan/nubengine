      hypothesis that immunotherapy is an effective treatment of antibody-associated psychosis,
      either first episode of psychosis or relapse following previous remission. Immunotherapy for
      the trial consists of one cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG: 2g/kg over days 1-4)
      followed by two infusions of 1g rituximab (at day 28-35, and then 14 days after the first
      infusion). The rationale for this regime is that it combines a rapid-action treatment (IVIG)
      to induce remission with a longer-action therapy (rituximab) to maintain remission. It is
      based on a protocol where elimination of circulating antibodies is the treatment goal, namely
      "desensitisation" of potential transplant patients who have multiple anti-HLA antibodies
      capable of inducing hyperacute rejection and also being tested in various trials on
      clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00642655, NCT01178216, and NCT01502267). Blinding is required to
      minimise placebo responses in a trial based on symptomatology.
