      equal groups with 33 teeth per each, according to regeneration and MTA apexification. At the
      first visit, all teeth were accessed and irrigated with NaOCl then a TAP was applied as
      intra-appointment intracanal medication. At the second visit, after removal of the medication
      with the irrigation, bleeding was initiated into the canal and isolated by the MTA in the
      orifice in the regeneration group. While in the Apexification group, the MTA was packed
      apically and all teeth were finally restored with resin composite restorations. The patients
      were recalled after 1, 3, 6, and 9 months for clinical and radiographic follow up.
