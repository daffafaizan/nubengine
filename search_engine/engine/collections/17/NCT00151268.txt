    
      This proposed clinical protocol is designed to assess genotype - phenotype correlations of
      LINCL, including a preliminary assessment regarding the genotype - phenotype correlations of
      progressive CNS deterioration inherent to this disorder. The trial will include the primary
      endpoint of neurological assessment including the LINCL clinical rating scale and parental
      evaluations; and the secondary endpoint of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic (MRS) assessments of the CNS.

      The study will be carried out in children diagnosed with LINCL in all stages. The staging is
      based on a modification of the scale of Steinfeld et al (Steinfeld, 2002). The study
      anticipates a total n=30 children assessed over a period of 18 months. Of these, we
      anticipate that approximately two-thirds will not be entered into the proposed gene therapy
      protocol and thus approximately n=20 will be available for this study to be reassessed at 1
      year. Thus, we anticipate that we will be able to capture a one-time genotype - phenotype
      snapshot for all n=30, and a 1 year genotype - phenotype progression assessment for n=20.
