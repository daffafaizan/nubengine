      seriously impairs quality of life of millions of people worldwide. 10-50% of surgical
      patients report chronic pain after surgery; up to 10% report severe pain. Thus, chronic pain
      is a significant medical and financial burden to society.

      Despite considerable involvement of genetic factors in pain sensation and sensitivity,
      individual genes involved remain largely unidentified. Knowledge of genetic factors, their
      phenotypic expression in pain processing, and their link to neuronal correlates can improve
      understanding of pain aetiology and processes involved in pain perception and chronification.
      Also, they can serve as biomarkers to predict chronic pain development and progression in
      patients and help early individual treatment adaptation.

      In this study the investigators will establish a prospective database and biobank of patients
      undergoing elective major surgery. Using data from the database and biobank, the
      investigators will identify genetic factors contributing to development of acute and chronic
      pain after surgery.

      Over a period of 10 years the investigators will prospectively include up to 10,000 patients
      visiting the hospital for elective major surgery. Data defining participants demographics,
      medical history and questionnaire data will be collected and stored in dedicated databases.
      Additional details (surgery and perioperative management, pain processing phenotypes and
      surgical and pain outcomes) will be stored.
