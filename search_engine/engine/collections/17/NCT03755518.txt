    
      This is Single-Arm, Open-Label Efficacy and Safety Trial of Fedratinib in Subjects with DIPSS
      (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System)-Intermediate or High- Risk Primary
      Myelofibrosis (PMF), Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or Post-Essential
      Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) and Previously Treated with Ruxolitinib including
      a Sub-study with concomitant Luspatercept for subjects with anemia.

      The spleen volume reduction at the end of Cycle 6 as the primary objective. The secondary
      objectives of the study are to further evaluate the safety and to assess and implement
      mitigation strategies for WE and for gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events.

      The study will be at multiple centers to provide access to a broad population and have
      assurance the results are likely to have general applicability.

      This is also conducted as an open-label study to collect efficacy and safety data with
      fedratinib use, no randomization or stratification will occur.

      The primary objective of the sub-study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      Luspatercept when administered concomitantly with Fedratinib for the treatment of anemia in
      subjects with MF who are red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent (Group A) or
      non-transfusion dependent (Group B).
