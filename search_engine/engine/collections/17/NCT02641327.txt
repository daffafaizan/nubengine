      contactless monitoring for blood pressure monitoring vs. gold reference methods such as ABPM
      (Ambulatory blood pressure measurement) for patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine
      department and vs. Arterial Line measurements for patients hospitalized in ICU. In addition
      the collected data will be used to further enhance and improve the existing algorithms.
