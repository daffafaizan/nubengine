      effective therapies are desperately desired. Ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment
      facilitates delivery of intralesional steroid more deeply and uniformly into the skin by
      creating vertical channels. Recent studies have showed that fractional laser assisted steroid
      therapy can be effective in the treatment of keloids. However the studies are lacking in
      comparing this treatment modality to the gold standard of intralesional steroids.
