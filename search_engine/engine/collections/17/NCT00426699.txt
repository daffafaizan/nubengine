      (especially coxsackievirus B4). In some cases, large amounts of IgA are deposited in the
      mesangium, resembling human IgA-nephropathy. In humans, case reports indicate the propensity
      of certain enteroviruses to cause kidney infections.

      Our project aims to analyze urine of children with suspected enteroviral infections (e.g.
      meningitis, myocarditis, sepsis of the newborn etc.) to identify cases suspicious of
      concomitant enteroviral kidney affection. To achieve this aim, enterovirus-PCRs will be
      performed and microhematuria searched for.
