      patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder in order to ascertain (1) that they fit the
      criteria for the diagnosis; and (2) that they are interested in participating in one of our
      research projects. Patients will undergo diagnostic interviews, complete self-rating forms,
      and have a physical examination, routine blood tests, and an electrocardiogram.
