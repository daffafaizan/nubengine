      to reduce loneliness in different populations have shown mixed results. The Groups for Health
      (G4H) programme has been developed according to the social identity approach within social
      psychology and has demonstrated preliminary efficacy for reducing loneliness in a
      proof-of-concept study conducted with Australian student sample. The present study will
      examine whether G4H can be adapted to suit the needs of a clinical population in the context
      of UK secondary care services.

      Objective: Phase 1 - To adapt the G4H intervention for delivery to adults seeking treatment
      for depression in the UK. Phase 2: To estimate trial parameters (recruitment, retention,
      missing data and acceptability) of the adapted intervention, prior to a definitive trial; to
      optimise the adapted intervention for delivery to adults accessing treatment for depression
      in the UK; to optimise evaluation procedures (candidate outcome measures)

      Trial configuration: sequential exploratory mixed methods design. Phase 1: one-to-one
      interviews. Phase 2: Activity 1 (intervention), single group, pre-post study. Activity 2
      (interviews): one-to-one interviews.

      Condition: Depression

      Interventions: group-based behavioural programme
