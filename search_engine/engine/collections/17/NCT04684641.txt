      Yale Phage Therapy (YPT) 01 in cystic fibrosis subjects with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      airway infections. The study has 2 parallel arms of phage therapy and placebo, with all study
      materials GMP-manufactured. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy and safety
      of inhaled (nebulized) phage therapy YPT-01. Clinically stable subjects who have confirmed
      diagnosis of CF with PsA in sputum cultures on at least two occasions within past year, and
      in sputum at screening visit, will be recruited into this study.

      An open-label extension is available for subjects in the placebo group to receive YPT-01
      following completion of blinded portion of the study.
