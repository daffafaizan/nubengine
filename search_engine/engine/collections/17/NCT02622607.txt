      consequences. which can lead to pain, decreased mobility and skeletal complications
      .Preventing or delaying bone metastases may improve outcomes. Bisphosphonates are inhibitors
      of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The current indications for bisphosphonates include
      the treatment of metabolic disorders of bone metabolism (e.g., osteoporosis and Paget's
      disease), the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM), and the prevention of SREs
      from malignant bone disease. Clinical trials also confirm that bisphosphonates, and
      zoledronic acid in particular, can prevent bone loss from cancer treatment.There is also
      emerging evidence that the benefits of bisphosphonate therapy in the oncology setting are
      more extensive. This study will evaluate whether the addition of ZOL 4 mg every 3 months for
      up to 1 years in patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancer could reduce the rate of bone
      metastases ,improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), and delay time
      to bone metastases .
