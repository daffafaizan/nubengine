      multicenter, prospective, open-label (though with blinded outcome assessments), randomized
      study of doripenem versus a comparator antibiotic in patients with hospital-acquired
      pneumonia. The study consists of screening phase, open-label treatment phase, and follow-up.
      Both patients on ventilator and not on ventilator are enrolled. The primary endpoint is the
      clinical response rate at early follow-up visit. The patients may receive either doripenem or
      comparator; total duration of the treatment is 7 to 14 days.
