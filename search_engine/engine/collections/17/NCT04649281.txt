      the Pain Centre will be consecutively recruited. After signed informed consent, the
      participants will wear two accelerometers during one week, one for recording sleep and one
      for recording physical activity. The participants will be asked to fill out a sleep and pain
      diary during the same week. Furthermore, the participants will fill out questionnaires
      regarding sleep, life style, mental fatigue and self-efficacy. All study participant are
      included in the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP). Data from the SQRP
      will be used regarding patient health characteristics, pain and pain associated symptoms,
      health related quality of life, sleep and self-reported physical activity level. Data
      regarding co-morbidity, drug use, pharmacological treatment and other interventions at the
      Pain Center will be collected from the patient charts. In addition, the participants blood
      pressure and neck circumference will be measured. Blood samples will be analysed for
      biomarkers associated with pain and sleep disturbance.
