      chemoprophylaxis and all children will be followed for 2 years to describe IFN-y responses
      over time, identify symptoms of active TB and if these symptoms are associated with IFN-y and
      other cytokine responses.

      Children with suspicion of TB attending health centres will also be investigated using
      routine diagnostic tests and IFN-y and other cytokines responses to evaluate if the latter
      could be used in improved diagnostic approaches.
