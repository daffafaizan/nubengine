      patient decision aid about safe firearm storage during crisis. The investigators will enroll
      60 adult emergency department patients being evaluated for suicidal risk and have at least
      one firearm at home. If available, the investigators will also enroll a family member or
      friend. Participants will randomly receive one of two things: the decision aid or general
      suicide prevention information. A week later, the investigators will call participants to see
      how both groups choose to store their firearms. This trial tests the acceptability of the
      decision aid, effects on decision making, effect on home storage, effect on suicide outcomes,
      and feasibility of a larger trial. The investigators hypothesize that participants with
      higher quality decisions after the decision aid will be more likely to change their firearm
      storage to reduce access during the time of crisis; should the pilot demonstrate feasibility,
      in a subsequent larger trial this hypothesis would be tested directly.
