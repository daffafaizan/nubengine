      intervention to improve physical function in persons aging with HIV. Both HIV-infected and
      HIV-uninfected older adults will be assigned to a moderate intensity cardiovascular and
      resistance training intervention for 12 weeks, and then randomized to either continue
      moderate intensity exercise, or increase to high intensity exercise for an additional 12
      weeks. The primary outcome is the impact of exercise on physical function, as measured by the
      overall score of a modified Short Physical Performance Battery (mSPPB) and the chair rise
      time from the mSPPB. The secondary outcomes include changes in insulin-like growth factor-1
      (systemic and local) and inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor
      receptors 1 and 2 (sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2)).
