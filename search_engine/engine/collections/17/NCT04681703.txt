      BP measurement from healthcare professionals than in patients who did not receive training.
      Although self-estimation of BP may be prone to error, this risk can be minimized through
      adequate patient education and training that includes simple but nonetheless important
      recommendations. However, unclear is whether specific training offered by nurses, who
      frequently have a close relationship with their hypertensive patients, could result higher
      patient adherence to HBPM recommendations. Therefore, we assume that a specifically tailored
      training program conducted by a family nurse (FN), when provided in addition to usual care,
      could improve patient adherence to HBPM recommendations.

      Study design: single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
