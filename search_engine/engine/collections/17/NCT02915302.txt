    
      All participants received 1 intramuscular dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit
      1. For participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine were recommended per Advisory
      Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, a second dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent
      vaccine (of the same volume as the first dose) was administered during Visit 2 (28 days after
      Visit 1).

      Solicited adverse event (AE) information was collected for 7 days after each vaccination,
      unsolicited AE information was collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or to Visit 3 for
      participants receiving 2 doses of study vaccine. Serious adverse event (SAE) information was
      collected for 28 days after each vaccination.

      Immunogenicity was evaluated in a planned subset of 1600 randomly selected participants prior
      to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and at Day 28 after the final vaccination.
