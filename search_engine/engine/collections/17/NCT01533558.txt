      non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers due to underlying disease(s). Therefore,
      extrapolation of data from healthy volunteers and non-ICU patients is not possible.

      To be able to include 20 patients within the study duration, a multi-centre approach is
      necessary.

      Patients will receive standard care, as stated in the SPC or according to local protocols.
      Blood sampling for PK analysis will be retrieved through a central venous catheter.
      Approximately 60mL will be drawn in total for this study. Patients will be monitored daily
      during the treatment period for adverse events of the study drug.

      Although steady state of caspofungin will be achieved after approximately 14 days of
      treatment, full PK curves will be taken on day 3. As probably not all patients included will
      be treated with caspofungin for 14 days, taking full PK curves on day 14 is considered not
      feasible. These two moments of PK analysis will enable the determination steady state and
      enable the determination of intra-individual variability.
