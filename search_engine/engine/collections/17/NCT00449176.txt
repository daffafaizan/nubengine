      double-blind (neither patient nor investigator knows the study medication), phase III,
      placebo and active controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally
      administered tapentadol (CG5503) Extended Release (ER) (base) at doses 100-250 mg twice daily
      in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain of the lower back. The study is being
      conducted for registration and approval of tapentadol (CG5503) in the US and outside US. The
      trial will consist of five periods: screening (to assess eligibility), washout (3-7 days with
      determination of baseline pain intensity), titration (of dose over 3 weeks to the optimal
      individual level), maintenance (investigational drug intake for 12 weeks with adjustments
      allowed), and follow-up (2 weeks post treatment discontinuation). The study hypothesis is
      that the study drug will be more effective than placebo in reducing patients' pain intensity.
      The Secondary objectives include the collection of pharmacokinetic (related to how the body
      uses the drug) information for dose verification. The trial objectives will be assessed by
      comparing the baseline pain level to the level of week 12 of the maintenance phase. This will
      be done by looking at the patient's pain diary information. Titrate tapentadol (CG5503) ER
      (extended release) in 50 mg steps to patient's optimal dose ranging between 100mg and 250mg
      twice a day; Oxycodone CR (controlled release) 20mg to 50mg twice a day; Placebo (no active
      ingredients). All doses of trial treatment will be taken orally with or without food, for a
      maximum timeframe of 15 weeks.
