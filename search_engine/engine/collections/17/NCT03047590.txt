      prescription is more effective for behavior change than a traditional, "moderate-intensity"
      exercise prescription. Prior research suggests that "choice-based" or "self-selected"
      exercise intensity is more pleasant and adhered to than "moderate-intensity exercise"
      (Williams et al., 2014). Similarly, affect-based exercise prescriptions (i.e., an exercise
      prescription where intensity is regulated based on the pleasure-displeasure one feels while
      exercising) appear to have merit (Baldwin, Kangas, Denman, Smits, Yamada, & Otto, 2016).

      However, choice-based and affect-based exercise prescriptions have not been compared to each
      other. Further, it is unknown if it is the intensity regulation that matters (e.g., "choose
      an intensity that feels good" or the focus on affect (e.g., "focus on feeling good). Third,
      prior research has not objectively measured physical activity behavior.
