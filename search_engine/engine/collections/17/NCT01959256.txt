    
      Study design: A PROBE (Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Blinded-endpoint) design

      Methods:

        1. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) group

             1. Visual perceptual learning (24 times for 2 months, 3 times per week) in visual
                field defect areas

             2. At baseline and post-VPL evaluations (2 months after): Structural & Functional
                MRIs, Visual field tests, Visual evoked potential, Visual cognitive tests,
                Subjective visual function questionnaires

        2. Control group

             1. At baseline and 2-months later: No VPL, Structural & Functional MRIs, Visual field
                tests, Visual evoked potential, Visual cognitive tests, Subjective visual function
                questionnaires

             2. Visual perceptual learning after 2-month follow-up evaluation (24 times for 2
                months, 3 times per week)

           (The patients who were stratified by age (over 65 years old or not) and degree of visual
           field defect (quadrantanopia or complete hemianopia) will be randomly assigned into the
           learning and control group.)

        3. Investigations

             1. Improvement of visual field test scores between VPL group and control group

             2. Analysis of brain network changes in MRI data

             3. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and MRI data

             4. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and visual evoked
                potential (VEP) data

             5. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and neuropsychological
                data
