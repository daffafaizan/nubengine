    
      Merging Yoga, Occupational Therapy and Nutrition Education (MY-OT-Ed) is an interdisciplinary
      program designed to help low income adults with Type 2 Diabetes engage fully in life while
      learning to manage their diabetes. The aim is to empower individuals to embed diabetes
      self-management into everyday activities and routines while upholding quality of life.
      Currently Extension Services bring nutrition education to the under-served population in the
      local communities through the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). Colorado
      EFNEP uses the evidence-based, healthy eating and active living curriculum, Eating Smart â€¢
      Being Active (ESBA), with adult participants. While EFNEP may be helpful in the management of
      some aspects of diabetes care, it is not designed to address the established self-care
      behaviors and routines essential for effective diabetes self management. Therefore, it is
      critical to merge nutrition education programs such as EFNEP with other established
      interventions to best meet the needs of the individual with diabetes. Likewise, yoga is an
      effective form of physical activity to manage some aspects of diabetes care and outcomes.
      However, yoga is also not enough to address all of the needs of the individual. Furthermore,
      evidence for the success of occupational therapy's role in diabetes self-management is
      growing as a way to manage some aspects of the complexity of diabetes care or routines in
      everyday life. Our aim in this study is to follow best practice and create and evaluate an
      interdisciplinary approach to type 2 diabetes self-management by merging together yoga,
      occupational therapy and nutritional education to improve diabetes related outcomes in our
      population.
