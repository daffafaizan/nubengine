      diagnostic. Indeed, this tracer had been recently used to highlight inter-cerebral
      beta-amyloid plaques on patients with Alzheimer Disease.

      Because this labelling is performed on amyloid deposits, this tracer would lead to view and
      to quantify amyloid deposits within cardiac amyloid injuries.

      Results of this PET will be combined with scan examinations for a better anatomic tracking.
