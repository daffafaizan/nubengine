      specimens, and physical assessments. This study will elucidate the need for a further
      in-depth study to understand the pathophysiological effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-based
      and non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapies in young
      men.
