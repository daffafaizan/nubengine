    
      A structured questionnaire is used to conduct a cross-sectional descriptive study of 250
      early school-age children aged 4-7 years (<7 years old) in Taiwan. Data collection would
      include: demographics, food preferences, eating behavior, body weight and height, body mass
      index (BMI), physical activity, records of medical illness, peripheral cell blood count,
      serum values of ferritin and micronutrients (iron, zinc, copper). Data from children define
      as picky or non-picky eaters base on parental' questionnaire responses, are analyzed and
      compared using standard statistical tests. The correlations among eating behavior, dietary
      habits, development, physical activity, nutritional status, and health status, and
      micronutrient deficiency are evaluated.
