      alternative/replacement to autograft in the treatment of tibial delayed healing. A subject
      will be considered to have tibial delayed healing when he/she is at least six months from the
      date of the most recent surgical intervention and has shown no signs of radiographic healing
      for at least three months. Radiographic signs of healing for this study are defined as either
      the progressive disappearance of fracture lines or the development of cortical continuity
      [bridging bone] at the site. All prospective patients must require surgical treatment with
      rigid internal fixation [reamed IM nail or plate/screws] and bone grafting.
