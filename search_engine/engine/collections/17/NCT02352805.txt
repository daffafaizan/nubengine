      coagulopathy and inflammation in intensive care settings is only poorly understood so far.
      Furthermore, it is unclear, how coagulopathy and inflammation shall be monitored and which
      anticoagulants may be employed to decrease complications associated with specific ECC
      systems. Therefore, the use of laboratory analyses, anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapy
      varies between different ECC systems and intensive care units.

      A better understanding of the mechanisms of the activation and interaction of platelets and
      leukocytes, plasmatic coagulation, complement, cytokines and endothelium will highlight
      starting-points to increase the safety and efficacy of ECC in intensive care medicine. The
      investigation of these phenomena in different ECC systems under clinical conditions is
      therefore the goal of this study.

      In order to achieve the study goal, we will investigate cellular and plasmatic activation
      markers as well as proteins involved in coagulation and inflammation in patients being
      connected to different ECC systems under intensive care conditions.
