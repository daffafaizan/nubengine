    
      This is a single-site, partial double-blind study in healthy volunteers designed to assess
      the safety of infusing ascending doses of reconstituted autologous freeze dried plasma (FDP)
      in 3 fixed-dose cohorts. Beginning with Cohort 1, subjects will receive a single infusion of
      1 unit (approximately 270 mL) of either FDP manufactured from fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
      derived from autologous whole blood (WB) collection(s) that use citrate phosphate dextrose
      (CPD) as the anticoagulant (FDP-CPD) or FDP manufactured from FFP units from autologous
      plasmapheresis where acid citrate dextrose (ACD) is used as the anticoagulant (FDP-ACD).
      Recruitment of subjects for Cohort 2 follows the completion of infusions in Cohort 1.
      Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive a single infusion of 2 units (approximately 540 mL) of
      either FDP-CPD or FDP-ACD before recruitment for Cohort 3 is initiated. Subjects enrolled in
      Cohort 3 will receive the highest study dose, a plasma infusion dose of 3 units
      (approximately 810 mL) of FDP-ACD at one infusion visit and the same dose of autologous FFP
      at another infusion visit. Cohort 3 subjects will only be infused with FDP and FFP products
      sourced from autologous plasmapheresis. Randomization of Cohort 3 subjects to a treatment
      sequence determines whether they will be infused with 3 units of FDP or 3 units of FFP at
      their first infusion visit followed by infusion with the alternate product at the second
      infusion visit. A 2-week interval will be maintained between infusion visits in Cohort 3.
      Crossover of FDP and FFP enables comparison of infusion safety and select coagulation factor
      recoveries within the same subjects between FDP and FFP at this higher dose.
