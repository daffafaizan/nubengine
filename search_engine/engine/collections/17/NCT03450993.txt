      prevent and treat disease. The Stress Management and Resiliency Training - Relaxation
      Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) is an 8-week manualized psycho-educational program
      that incorporates RR methods such as meditation or seated yoga along with cognitive skills
      building and lifestyle approaches to increase resiliency to stress. This study will use a
      randomized, wait-list controlled trial design to test the effects of the SMART-3RP on quality
      of life (QoL), mental health, arrhythmia burden, and HRV in patients with PAF. The program
      will be delivered virtually (via computer video conferencing), questionnaires will be
      completed, and physiological data as well as blood will be collected.
