      is caused by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is
      for more than 99% predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and
      bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons: 1)
      independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone
      secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension; 2) PA requires
      specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
      (MRA) in case of BAH.

      Although previously presumed a rare condition (prevalence <1%), PA is now estimated to affect
      6 to 20% of the hypertensive population. Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the
      amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question has been
      raised whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this
      important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated:

        1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence
           in the Dutch population is still unknown;

        2. Up to now, the laboratory test for screening for PA, the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR),
           is primarily used in secondary care. The relation between the ARR and outcomes in
           primary care is unknown;

        3. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of
           hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are
           lacking. Indications of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of
           screening for PA and needs to be studied.
