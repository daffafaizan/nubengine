      I. Determine whether ILN biochip can be used to detect molecular marker(s) to monitor
      treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      II. Determine whether ILN biochip can promote early detection of disease relapse in patients
      with DLBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants' blood samples undergo ILN biochip testing at diagnosis, before and after every
      course of chemotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, and at relapse.
