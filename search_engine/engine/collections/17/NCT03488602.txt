    
      This is a RCT of a patient- and family-centered suicide prevention intervention added to
      usual care (F-SPS + UC) for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who present to the Emergency
      Department (ED) with suicidal ideation or suicide risk behaviours. The investigators will
      determine whether the F-SPS + UC intervention is more effective than enhanced usual care
      (EUC) in reducing suicide-related behaviors in 128 youth at high-risk of suicide.

      F-SPS is a 6-week, standardized, manualized outpatient program that teaches participants to
      the skills to manage suicidal thoughts and impulses effectively. The family component
      addresses conflictual relationships that may be present in the family as well as improving
      family communication.

      Enhanced usual care consists of 6 weekly telephone calls to ensure that the participant has
      connected with community resources suggested by the ED team and provide additional resources
      as needed.
