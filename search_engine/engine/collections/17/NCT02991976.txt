      carotid endarterectomy with total intravenous anaesthesia. However, there are some studies
      suggesting that high inspired oxygen concentration may induce cerebral vasoconstriction. This
      study was performed to measure the influence of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) on the
      regional tissue oxygenation in the patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with total
      intravenous anaesthesia. The INVOS 5100B monitor was used for regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rSO2) measurement from operative and nonoperative side, and INVOS Analytics Tool
      (Covidien) for area under curve (AUC) calculations. A bispectral index and invasive blood
      pressure monitoring were used in all patients.
