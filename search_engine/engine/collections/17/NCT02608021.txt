      detecting cognitive deficits. Patients and research subjects could be screened for medial
      temporal lobe (MTL) impairment using inexpensive, widely available, safe, and non-invasive
      technology.

      Subjects will be elderly individuals who are participating in ongoing research at the NYU
      Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) and who have received the standard ADC clinical evaluation
      within the past year, including a medical-neurological evaluation, neuro-psychological
      assessment and structural neuroimaging (MRI). As part of the current study, all subjects will
      receive both the Neurotrack Visual Paired-Comparison (VPC) Task and MRI scans. The current
      protocol strictly for a research study and there will be no "standard care" provided.
      Participants will be asked to come in for two separate sessions. The first session will
      involve screening to confirm eligibility and administration of the cognitive testing
      procedures, while the second session will involve the MRI protocol.
