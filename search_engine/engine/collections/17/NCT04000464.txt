        -  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been demonstrated to improve disease free and
           over-all survival in men with prostate cancer (PCa).

        -  ADT for PCa is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic effects such as reduced libido,
           hot flashes, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke. This
           reduces quality of life (QoL) and potentially affects mortality.

        -  There is paucity of data regarding comprehensive lifestyle interventions in men on ADT
           for Pca. Existing studies used non-standardized interventions or lack data on metabolic
           risk factors.

        -  CLIPP is designed to address these gaps by using an intervention modelled after the
           Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a standardized multi-component intervention with
           demonstrated effectiveness in reducing diabetes risk factors that has been successfully
           adapted for multiple disease types including breast cancer.
