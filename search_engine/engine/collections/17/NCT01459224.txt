      lymphoma undergoing disease staging at diagnosis and initial treatment response assessment.
      At each time point (initial staging and treatment response assessment) in addition to
      standard imaging investigations (PET CT, Chest CT, anatomical MRI of the abdomen and pelvis
      and abdominal USS), patients will undergo advanced anatomical and functional MRI sequences.
