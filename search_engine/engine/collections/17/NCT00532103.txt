    
      This is a pilot study to begin to develop a measurement procedure to help guide the clinical
      management of suicide risk in people beginning a type of antidepressant medication called a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The goals of the study are: 1) to identify the
      best method and assessment measures to evaluate the severity of suicidal ideation, 2) to
      determine the appropriate frequency and duration of assessment required to adequately
      evaluate this suicidal ideation, 3) to evaluate the presence of symptoms that are associated
      with suicidal ideation (such as anxiety, panic attacks, difficulty in sleeping) and 4) to
      identify the most critical time periods during which suicidal ideation appears or worsens
      (such as how long after initiation of treatment or dosage increase).

      In all, 300 adult participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), between the ages of 18
      and 75, may be enrolled at primary and psychiatric care sites across the US. All patients
      will be treated with an SSRI for eight weeks. The choice of SSRI used in treatment will be
      chosen by the study physician at each site. For this study, physicians will choose from the
      following six SSRIs: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, paroxetine-CR, and
      fluoxetine.

      Patients beginning an SSRI for MDD in "real world" psychiatric and primary care settings,
      will have clinic visits and receive evaluations of their symptoms of depression, side
      effects, suicidal thinking and symptoms that are thought to be associated with suicidal risk,
      every other week for eight weeks. They will be evaluated by phone for symptoms and side
      effects each week they do not come to the clinic. They will also receive phone calls three
      times a week for the first two weeks of the study, after beginning the antidepressant, and
      after a dose increase to evaluate suicide risk.
