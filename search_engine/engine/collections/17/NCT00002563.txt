      Stage I/IIA Hodgkin's disease randomized on protocol SWOG-9133 (CLB-9391) to treatment with
      subtotal nodal irradiation with vs. without 3 courses of doxorubicin/vinblastine. II.
      Describe the short-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their
      impact on quality of life (i.e., patient symptom status, health status, fatigue). III.
      Evaluate the intermediate and long-term effects of these treatments on these patients and
      compare their impact on quality-of-life outcomes over 5 years.
