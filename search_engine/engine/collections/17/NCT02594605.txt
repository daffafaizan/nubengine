      adhesive, and was used to accelerate the soft and hard tissue healing. Many studies have
      shown beneficial effects of PRF on osteoconductive filler material in sinus lift operations,
      treatment of periodontal sulcus defect and treatment of furcation defects. Also PRF contains
      many growth factors. PRF accelerates periodontal regeneration through the gradually excreted
      growth factors and contributes to the bone regeneration. In this study, the investigators
      evaluated the effect of PRF on growth factors and its contribution to periodontal
      regeneration in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
