    
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational surgery that transfers tissue from
      a non-living donor to a living individual will help restore greater function, appearance, and
      sensation to the face and upper extremity areas of individuals who have suffered injury to
      those areas. Upper extremity constitutes the part of the body including arm, forearm and
      hand. This procedure is called combined craniomaxillofacial and upper extremity
      allotransplantation or "combined face and upper extremity transplant".

      This study will also collect data on how patients do during and after having a combined face
      and upper extremity transplant from a nonliving donor. Recovery and outcomes will be observed
      through clinical exams, x-rays, blood and tissue tests, and other associated evaluations at
      all follow up visits.

      Participants are invited to take part in this research study who have suffered severe injury
      to the face and upper extremity and previous surgeries to repair the injury have not restored
      function, appearance, and sensation. Participants must have attempted a trial of prosthetics
      (artificial upper extremity), if at all possible.
