      Unfortunately, all materials developed for the program are in Danish. In this pilot, the
      investigators will translate the Danish materials into English, then use them to conduct an
      English training session for community clinicians in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Interested
      clinicians will then implement the program in their communities and provide feedback to
      contextualize the program for use in English. Specifically, surveys, interviews and focus
      groups will be used to help fine-tune the printed content of the course (e.g. manuals), it's
      training materials (e.g. lectures) and processes related to REDCap data collection (e.g.
      surveys).
