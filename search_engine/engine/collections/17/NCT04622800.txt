    
      In order to standardize the measurements while evaluating individuals, the evaluation order
      will be as follows; The evaluation of minor pectoralis shortness, scapular dyskinesia by
      video analysis, scapular side shift test and then muscle strength evaluation will be done.
      The evaluation will be repeated before and 6 weeks after treatment and 12 weeks after
      treatment.

      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Application:

      Anterior elevation / posterior depression will be performed in the form of repetitive
      contractions using anterior depression / posterior elevation patterns. There will be 10
      repetitions, with a 2-minute rest break between each technique. The treatment will be
      continued twice a week for a total of 6 weeks. Perceived Effort Scale, which is graded
      between 0-10, will be used to determine the level of perceived resistance to individuals
      before each treatment. In order to ensure standardization, the perceived effort level will be
      set to 5-6 (moderate).
