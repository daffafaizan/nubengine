      weakness. Despite spontaneous improvement on the weeks following stroke, the importance of
      final disability is unpredictable. If the core of the infarct is represented by dead neurons,
      the neurons from adjacent areas seem to be staggered and their lack of excitability has been
      correlated to a bad prognosis. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) seems to
      be a promising technique since high frequency rTMS can increase excitability of the targeted
      neurons.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate after 2 weeks of 20 min of rTMS each day: 1) the
      improvement of arm function and neurological and disability scales, immediately after the
      2-week session, at one month, 3 months and evaluate the remnant effect at 12 months, 2) to
      correlate these scales to physiological parameters in order to assess the clinical
      modifications to the electrophysiological modifications, 3) to assert the safety of high
      frequency rTMS at the subacute phase of ischaemic stroke.
