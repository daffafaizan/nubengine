      that they find it very difficult to control their worry. Deficits in attention control may
      help to explain why people who worry pathologically find it difficult to shift their
      attention away from their worry, and back to the task at hand. The Attention Training
      Technique (ATT; Wells, 1990) was developed to train attentional control, so that individuals
      could learn to shift the focus of their attention away from maladaptive cognitive processes
      such as worry. Despite being recommended for use in populations that suffer from excessive
      worry, there is a dearth of research examining the effects of ATT in such a population. The
      study aims to examine the immediate (during the intervention) and short-term (right after
      finishing the intervention) effects of listening to the ATT, compared to the control
      recording, on attention, worry, and other cognitive processes. This will be the first study
      to our knowledge to examine the effects of 1 week of daily ATT practice in a sample of people
      who suffer from chronic worry, and will provide important information for optimizing the
      treatment of worry in this population.
