    
      Two groups of boys 7-10 years old who are very short and below average in weight but
      otherwise healthy will be studied. One group will be observed initially for 6 months and then
      receive GH injections every day for the subsequent 12 months. Another group of boys will get
      a high-calorie drink every day for 6 months, and then receive GH injections plus the
      supplement every day for the next 12 months. We will compare how well boys grow in height,
      weight and the changes in body composition. We will compare diet and energy usage using the
      doubly labeled water technique. A battery of hormonal and nutritional tests will be
      performed, as well as body composition assessment.
