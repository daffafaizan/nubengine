      PET scan which takes about 90 minutes. C11 methionine is a radioactively labeled amino acid
      that is given to the patient intravenously.

      Eighteen to twenty days after the patients first dose of docetaxel chemotherapy, they will
      have another C11 methionine PET scan which is identical to the first scan.

      At the end of three cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy (about 2 and 1/2 months on study)
      another C11 methionine PET scan will be done.

      The PET scans will show how well the tumor is taking up methionine.
