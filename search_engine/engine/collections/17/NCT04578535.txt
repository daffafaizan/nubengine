    
      This study is comprised of Part 1 and Part 2. Each study part consists of three treatment
      arms (Part 1 [N=24]: Treatment Arms 1-3 and Part 2 [N=24]: Treatment Arms 4-6). Treatment
      arms will be initiated in parallel within each study part. Each participant will participate
      in only one treatment arm. After participants in Treatment Arms 1-3 (Study Part 1) have
      completed Week 9, the tolerability and, safety data through Week 9 will be reviewed by a
      safety review team. (Participants in arms 1-3 will continue in the study as the safety review
      is being completed.) Once the safety review for Arms 1-3 (Study part 1) has been completed
      and approved, Treatment Arms 4-6 (Study Part 2) will begin.
