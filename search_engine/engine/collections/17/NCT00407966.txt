      I. To determine the efficacy and toxicities of flavopiridol (alvocidib) followed by ara-C and
      mitoxantrone in adults with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with poor-risk
      features.

      II. To determine the disease free and overall survival of patients exhibiting a response to
      treatment with flavopiridol followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive alvocidib IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, cytarabine IV continuously over 72
      hours on days 6-8, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 1-2 hours on day 9. Beginning 35-63
      days after completion of course 1, patients achieving complete or partial remission may
      receive a second course of treatment as above.

      Patients age 50 and over with "core binding factor" acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (e.g.,
      t[8;21], inv[16], or t[16;16]) achieving a complete remission after course 1 of treatment may
      receive 3-4 courses of consolidation therapy comprising high-dose cytarabine at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
