      determine HIV status in HIV-negative participants will be every 6 months for a total follow
      up time of 24 months. Once HIV-positive status is confirmed, participants will be offered ART
      immediately regardless of CD4 count. Those who accept ART will be seen more frequently
      following ART initiation, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, 3 months and every 3 months
      thereafter until completion of 24 months of follow-up. Those who deny immediate ART will have
      clinic visits every 6 months to monitor HIV disease. HIV-negative participants will be asked
      to come for HIV re-testing every 6 months or sooner if they feel exposed to risk
