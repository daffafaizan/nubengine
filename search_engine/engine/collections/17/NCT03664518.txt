    
      This is a single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eltrombopag to
      treat thrombocytopenia associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.

      This study includes two stages. In Stage 1 (Week 1 to Week 6), the short-term efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of Eltrombopag is evaluated. At the end of Stage 1, the subjects who
      can benefit from Eltrombopag treatment (platelet count ≥ 50×109/L) can enter a 16-week
      prolonged stage (Stage 2) to evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety.

      The starting dose of Eltrombopag is 25 mg once daily, and the dose may be increased by 25 mg
      once daily every two weeks if the desired platelet response (>50×109/L) is not achieved. The
      daily dose should not exceed 75 mg.

      In Stage 1, weekly visits are required during the first 6 weeks of the study. In Stage 2,
      platelet counts will be obtained weekly during dose adjustment and every 4 weeks following
      establishment of a stable dose of Eltrombopag (stable dose is defined as the dose which
      remains unchanged for at least 2 weeks).
