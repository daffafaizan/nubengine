      activities such as standing and transfers. The ability to voluntarily control the ankle
      muscles is an important component of walking that is impacted by changes in the corticospinal
      tract and the spinal reflex circuits. These changes have been associated with the inability
      to dorsiflex the ankle during swing phase (foot drop) and uncontrollable muscle spasms and
      stiffness in the ankle during terminal stance (spasticity), as well as during transfers. In
      order to improve functional outcomes and further develop rehabilitation techniques, the
      underlying contributions of the corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuit to ankle
      control needs to be better understood. Non-invasive tools that target the corticospinal and
      spinal reflex circuit are being used in clinical settings in order to improve functional
      outcomes in persons with spinal cord injury. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a non-invasive
      tool that has been shown to increase voluntary motor output and decrease spasticity in
      persons with spinal cord injury. These improvements in function may be due to changes in the
      corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuits. In order to determine the relative
      contributions of the corticospinal tract and spinal reflex circuits to increased voluntary
      ankle control and decreased spasticity, we will measure changes in the corticospinal tract
      and spinal reflex excitability before and after a single session of vibration. We will then
      determine which change (corticospinal or spinal) contributes more to increased voluntary
      ankle control and decreased spasticity. This information will help guide future research to
      further improve walking ability in persons with spinal cord injury.
