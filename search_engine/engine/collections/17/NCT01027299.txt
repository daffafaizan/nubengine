      cardiac surgery, compared to patients with preserved LV function. The higher complication
      rates also lead to prolonged Cardiac Intensive Care (CITU) admissions for monitoring and
      multi-organ support.

      The investigators hypothesise that BiV pacing will reverse cardiac dyssynchrony and improve
      target organ perfusion. This will be significantly reduced the post operative requirement for
      Level 3 CITU care.

      This study will compare 48 hours of temporary biventricular (BiV) pacing to enhance cardiac
      function against standard post-operative pacing, in patients with poor LV function undergoing
      cardiac surgery. Temporary biventricular (BiV) pacing will be achieved with the addition of a
      third pacing electrode attached to the left ventricle. Using a pulmonary arterial catheter
      the interventricular (VV) delay will be adjusted to yield the maximum cardiac output at
      constant heart rate- sequential BiV pacing. A pilot study conducted at the University
      Hospital of Wales (UHW) showed that this approach is likely to be successful.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be the mean duration of Level 3 CITU care required by
      patients after cardiac surgery. Secondary endpoints will include: haemodynamic improvement
      with BiV pacing; post-operative renal function; atrial fibrillation (AF)/ ventricular
      arrhythmias; post operative inotropic requirements and changes in biomarkers- NT Pro BNP and
      Troponin T.
