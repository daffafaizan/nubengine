      pulmonary embolism will be identified and approached for participation, when they are seen in
      the Thrombophilia Clinic or Mayo Hospital for management of the acute VTE. If they match the
      preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, they would then be consented during this visit and
      scheduled for baseline studies at a later date. Baseline tests include Venous
      plethysmorgraphy, Lower Extremity Ultrasound, and Medical history, will be conducted and if
      eligible, participant will then be randomized to vascular boot plus standard anti coagulation
      program or standard anti coagulation using a randomization program. Participants will be
      randomized into two groups and followed for 3 months. Standard of Care (SOC) Group (no
      vascular boot utilized): Patients will receive standard anticoagulation (determined at
      discretion of the treating provider), baseline studies, and follow up at the end of treatment
      (3months). Vascular Boot (VB) Group (includes vascular boot in addition to SOC): Patients
      will receive standard anticoagulation (determined at discretion of the treating provider),
      baseline studies and standardized vascular boot warming. All patients randomized to this
      group will wear the vascular boot for a minimum of 30 minutes per day for the first 10 days
      of participation. Patients in this group may initially be enrolled at either the
      thrombophilia clinic or the hospital.
