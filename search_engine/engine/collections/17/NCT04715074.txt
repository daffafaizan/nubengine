      fewer Americans aged 50 and older are now being diagnosed with CRC or dying from it. Over the
      past 20 years, however, the number of Americans under age 50 who are diagnosed with CRC has
      doubled. Health experts estimate that the numbers of younger Americans with CRC will continue
      to increase rapidly over the next 10 years. The reasons for this increase are poorly
      understood. In addition, younger people are less likely to be diagnosed with CRC when the
      disease is still at an early stage. Also, of concern is that among men and women of all ages
      and all races, African-American men are the most likely to die of CRC.

      Central hypotheses are: (1) Patients residing in hotspots-counties with high EOCRC
      incidence/mortality rates-will have significantly worse EOCRC survival juxtaposed to those in
      other Utah areas. (2) Rurality and county-level access to health care will contribute to an
      explanation of EOCRC incidence and survival.
