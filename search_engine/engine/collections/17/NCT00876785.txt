      cause passive over-consumption by failure to provide a feeling of fullness corresponding to
      the energy content. A diet that is predominantly based on such foods may lead to overweight.
      It is therefore important to identify properties of foods that facilitate energy balance by
      creating a high satiety per calorie. A number of studies have confirmed that foods naturally
      rich in dietary fiber promote the feeling of fullness and reduce hunger in the short term.
