      with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis have not previously been adequately
      studied. It is possible that the PK of these drugs are affected by renal failure which may
      then compromise effectiveness and safety. This trial will rigorously assess the plasma PK and
      protein-binding of these two drugs in 10 HIV-negative patients requiring hemodialysis with 10
      matched persons with normal renal function. All participants will receive JULUCA for up to 14
      days and then undergo a 24 hour intensive PK evaluation.
