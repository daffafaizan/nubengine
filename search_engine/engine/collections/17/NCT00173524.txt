      cough, breathlessness, hemoptysis) and general symptoms (eg. fatigue, weight loss) that can
      cause extreme distress to the patient. Therefore, improvements in disease-related symptoms
      and quality of life (QoL) are the key desired outcomes of medical management.7 Effective,
      palliative, low-toxicity with reasonable treatment cost for patients with advanced NSCLC are
      needed. Recently, more and more countries consider evidence of economic value along with
      clinical efficacy.

      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy
      because it is expressed or highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC. 8,9
      Furthermore, high levels of EGFR expression have been associated with a poor prognosis in
      lung cancer patients in several studies. 10-12 EGFR-targeted cancer therapies are currently
      being developed; strategies include inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of
      the receptor by small molecules such as gefitinib (Iressa [ZD1839]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington,
      DE).13 Iressa is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks
      signal transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells.
