      patients with CVD. The study will consist of three arms, according to a randomized,
      single-blind, crossover, sham procedure-controlled design. Sixty-five total participants will
      each have three visits on three different occasions for the following interventions:

        1. a 30-minute period of guided singing from an in-person music therapist

        2. a 30-minute period of singing along to an instructional video including a professor of
           voice and "inexperienced, older singing student"

        3. a 30-minute sham intervention (subjects will undergo a hearing test)

      The goal will be to determine which singing intervention, if any, is superior to the other -
      as this would be important to guide longer and larger clinical trials in the field. Knowledge
      gained from this proposal will improve understanding of biologic mechanisms of singing
      behaviors, as it relates to CVD.
