      lower 5 cm of esophagus for research purposes. If the endoscopy demonstrates non-erosive
      reflux disease, biopsies of Esophageal Squamous Epithelium (ESE) are obtained and placed in
      mRNA-Later to assess claudin-4 mRNA by qRT-PCR and protein expression by Western blot (53,
      64) while other biopsies of ESE are obtained and handled as in SpAim#2 to assess barrier
      function of ESE. After consent, subjects complete a questionnaire assessing demographics,
      disease-specific parameters such as duration of symptoms and past treatment, and the
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS), a validated measure
      of GERD severity. Following this, patients in open label fashion are given orally 500 mg
      Quercetin (Q) twice daily (bid) [Pure, House of Nutrition, Yonkers, NY] for 6-weeks. Symptoms
      are monitored 1 week before and for the 6 week treatment period. At 6 weeks, a blood sample
      is obtained for determination of Q and its metabolites by HPLC and endoscopy and biopsies of
      ESE are repeated and processed as initially done for claudin-4 levels in ESE.
