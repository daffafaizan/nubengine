      trial. Participants were community-living adult smokers of â‰¥10 cigarettes per day during the
      pre-enrollment week who were interested in quitting and recruited from the local area by
      means of print, media, and online advertisements. To be eligible, they needed to be smoking
      10 or more cigarettes per day, aged 18 or older, motivated to quit smoking, prepared to set a
      quit date, willing to use nicotine patches, and able to come to therapy sessions and be
      followed by telephone. Participants in the pager treatment were provided with alpha-numeric
      pagers free of charge for three months. Using specially-designed communication software, text
      messages were sent to participants aimed at facilitating motivation to quit, cessation
      strategies, and coping skills to maintain abstinence. Participants in both treatment groups
      were seen for two 60-minute sessions of standard smoking cessation counseling, and received
      three follow-up phone calls and two months of nicotine patches.
