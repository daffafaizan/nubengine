      established therapy for advanced heart failure. The investigators will test 6 left
      ventricular (LV) pacing sites and 16 timing sequences in the operating room just before
      cardiac transplant. Pacing will be implemented after patients have been anticoagulated and
      connected to the heart-lung machine. Pacing by previously implanted pacemakers will be
      suppressed. The investigators will measure cardiac output (CO) by aortic flow probe (AFP),
      left ventricular (LV) contractility by a combination of trans-septal pressure gradients, and
      simultaneous left ventricular pressure (LVP)and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during
      transient reduction of inflow of blood to the heart by vena caval occlusion. The goal is to
      prove that this optimization will increase the amount of blood pumped by the failing heart by
      15% as compared with standard atrial (AAI) pacing. The testing protocol is 12.5 minutes in
      duration, and the entire protocol should be executable in 20 minutes. Care will not be
      altered otherwise. Results will improve management of the general population of patients with
      advanced heart failure while minimally increasing the risk to patients undergoing cardiac
      transplantation. Benefits of this study should include: improved patient selection for BiVP
      and a decrease in the presently recognized 30-40% incidence of BiVP nonresponders.
