      course of their active duty service. This can lead to difficulty in maintaining fitness
      standards and limit their ability to fully function in performing their mission. In addition,
      this may lead to increased risk for chronic disease development. Few published studies exist
      that evaluate interventions aimed at weight loss and chronic disease prevention in the active
      duty population. The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program has been shown to be effective in
      facilitating weight loss and reducing chronic disease risk in civilian populations. However,
      the effectiveness of this class in preventing chronic illnesses, facilitating weight loss,
      increasing physical activity and promoting perceptions of improved functioning and well-being
      has not been studied in active duty populations. The purpose of this study will be to examine
      the effectiveness of the GLB program compared with the currently available Fitness
      Improvement Program (FIP) and Better Body Better Life (BBBL) on the following health
      indicators: individual physical fitness as measured by change in weight, abdominal
      circumference and minutes engaged in physical activity; changes in risk associated with
      chronic disease as measured by changes in lipid and HbA1c levels; and changes in
      self-perception of function and well-being as measured by the RAND SF-36 questionnaire.

      This will be a quantitative randomized control intervention study to determine the effects of
      a GLB class on physical indicators of fitness, disease risk and overall perception of
      functional health and well-being in an active duty population, and to compare outcomes with
      the FIP intervention (care as usual) and newly implemented BBBL intervention currently
      offered to Airmen. This study will be conducted at David Grant Medical Center (DGMC), Travis
      AFB, California.
