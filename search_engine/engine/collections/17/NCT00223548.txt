    
      Contrast-induced nephropathy remains a common complication of radiographic precedures.
      Pretreatment with Mesna (Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) in combination with sodium
      chloride is more protective than sodium chloride alone in animal models of acute renal
      failure.

      The aim of this study is therefore to determine laboratory and clinical benefit of MESNA, as
      an adjunct to saline hydration, in patients with known renal impairment receiving contrast
      media.
