      general public. For patients with obesity-associated illnesses, there are few effective
      treatment options available after failed attempts at diet and exercise, even though weight
      loss has been shown to alleviate these conditions. The purpose of this study is to compare
      the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (Atkins) with a
      combination of a low-fat diet and Orlistat. The outcomes examined over a 48 week duration
      will include body weight, risk factors for heart disease (e.g., lipid profiles), and blood
      sugar. This is a randomized, parallel-intervention trial. Subjects (n=150) will be recruited
      from the Durham VAMC Ambulatory Care Clinics. All patients receive one of the two intensive
      weight loss interventions.
