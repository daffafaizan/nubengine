      pressure management can help prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The National Committee
      for Quality Assurance (NCQA) defines blood pressure control as less than 140/90 mmHg. Per
      this definition, less than half of Americans with hypertension are considered controlled.
      Literature has been published describing several ways of improving blood pressure management,
      but results have been variable.
