      the adolescent and young adults 16-21 years of age) are disproportionately affected.
      Furthermore, HIV risk behaviors, including substance use and sexual risk behaviors are
      prominent. Despite the disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and risk behaviors in
      youth, few youth report having ever been tested for HIV and many are not routinely screened
      for asymptomatic STIs as recommended by the Center for Disease Control. To address these
      significant public health concerns, a mobile-health (mHealth) intervention, Storytelling 4
      Empowerment (S4E) was developed for health clinic settings. S4E has demonstrated high
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among youth in clinic settings. The
      proposed research will determine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering S4E via near
      peers, as well as determine the preliminary efficacy of S4E to improve HIV self-testing
      immediately post-intervention in a community sample (n=20) of at-risk youth ages 16-21 living
      in Flint, Michigan by conducting a phase I, one-arm pilot study to examine the feasibility
      and preliminary efficacy of S4E in improving the uptake of HIV self-testing immediately
      post-intervention. A University-Community approach was taken to employ principles of
      Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to determine the accessibility and
      acceptability of S4E when delivered by Near Peers.
