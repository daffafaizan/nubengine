      perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2-8% of
      pregnancies globally.

      Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy associated with new-onset hypertension, which occurs
      most often after 20 weeks of gestation and frequently near term. Although often accompanied
      by new-onset proteinuria, hypertension and other signs or symptoms of preeclampsia may
      present in some women in the absence of proteinuria. Recently preeclampsia is divided into
      preeclampsia with severe features, preeclampsia without severe, features. One of serious
      complication of preeclampsia is occurrence of eclampsia. Eclampsia refers to the occurrence
      of new-onset, generalized, tonic-clonic seizures or coma in a woman with preeclampsia.
      Eclampsia can be prevented with magnesium sulphate, which decreases the risk of seizures by
      50%, paralleled by a reduction in maternal mortality. It is considered as the gold standard
      of management of eclampsia Although magnesium sulphate administration is recommended for all
      women with severe preeclampsia, consensus has not yet to be reached on the ideal duration of
      prophylactic postpartum anticonvulsant therapy. The use of magnesium sulphate has been
      recommended for 24 hours following delivery, the period of greatest risk for the occurrence
      of eclampsia. There are other regimen 12-hour, 6-hour Use of magnesium sulphate therapy is
      not without complications, consequently longer duration therapy possesses the risk of
      magnesium toxicity such as respiratory depression, renal and neuromuscular dysfunction. Risks
      of these complications require regular supervision; hence it is particularly important to
      assess the minimum effective duration of treatment
