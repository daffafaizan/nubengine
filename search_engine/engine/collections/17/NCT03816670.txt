        1. CF-alfa late start (day 4) will show comparable efficacy in terms of number of retrieved
           oocytes versus standard CF-alfa (day 2) protocol. In certain groups of patients, CF-alfa
           late start might show differences in terms of efficacy such as in poor-responder
           patients.

        2. CF-alfa late start (day 4) will obtain similar results in terms of vital pregnancy rates
           with a similar safety profile with respect to COS performed using CF-alfa standard
           administration (day 2) in expected normal, poor, or high responders.

        3. Oocytes and embryos obtained using CF-alfa late start will have comparable morphological
           features and development potential than those obtained with CF-alfa standard.

        4. The patients' satisfaction will possibly be higher using CF-alfa late start than with
           CF-alfa standard expecially in those patients who will not have the need to add further
           daily recFSH injections
