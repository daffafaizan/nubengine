        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and Ad5CMV-p53 gene in
           patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive p53 gene by intralesional injection on days 1 and 2. Patients also
      receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes followed 1 hour later by docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses. After completion of chemotherapy,
      patients with a reasonable response undergo surgical resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
