      changes associated with obesity have clinical significance for the anesthesiologist in the
      perioperative period. The upper and lower esophageal sphincters (UES and LES) play a central
      role in preventing regurgitation and aspiration. The barrier pressure, defined as the
      difference between the LES pressure and the Intragastric pressure is known to be lower in
      obese patients compared to lean patients. This might result in a higher risk of regurgitation
      and aspiration of stomach contents in during induction of anesthesia.

      Some studies are made on patients before and after bariatric surgery but results are sparse.
      In this study the investigators will examine 30 patients before and after bariatric surgery.
      Our group have performed the measurements on patients before surgery and presented the
      results in another article. Those patients will be asked to take part of another measurement
      now 12-18 months after surgery.

      30 patients will be consecutively asked and enrolled in this study. Measurements will be
      performed using high-resolution-solid state manometry.
