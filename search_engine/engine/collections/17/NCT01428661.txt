    
      This is a randomized, parallel, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter outpatient
      study comparing tasimelteon with placebo in the treatment of subjects with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD).

      The study has three phases: the pre-randomization phase, the randomization phase, and an
      open-label extension phase. The pre-randomization phase comprises a screening visit where
      subject's initial eligibility will be evaluated. The randomization phase is comprised of an
      8-week double-masked segment. Subjects meeting all entry criteria for the study will enter
      the randomization phase. During this phase, subjects will be asked to take either 20 mg
      tasimelteon or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-masked fashion. At the end of the 8-week
      double-masked phase, those subjects who completed the 8-week treatment phase will be offered
      to enroll into a 52-week open-label extension where each subject will receive daily doses of
      20 mg tasimelteon.
