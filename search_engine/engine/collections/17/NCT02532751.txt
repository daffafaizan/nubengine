      committee review. The preliminary version is pilot tested with 20 participants undergoing
      body contouring surgery.

      The study is of longitudinal design gathering data from participants undergoing body
      contouring surgery due to obesity. Data collection takes place in the Department of Plastic
      Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. The participants fill in
      three patient-reported outcome measures.

      The outcomes of the three patient-reported outcome measures are compared with each other and
      internal validity assessed. Test-retest reliability is assessed after two weeks from the
      first completion of the questionnaires. With validated questionnaires the effects of body
      contouring surgery is assessed.
