        -  to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.

        -  to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and absolute
           neutrophil count (ANC).

        -  to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and CD34+ cell
           counts in the blood.

        -  to assess the immunogenicity (HM10460A, native G-CSF antibody,neutralizing antibodies)
           of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.
