      and range-of-motion with the goal of avoiding dislocation of the operative hip. These
      restrictions are commonly referred to as "hip precautions". Several recent studies have
      demonstrated these precautions may be safely abandoned with no increased risk of dislocation
      when the surgery is carried through an anterior/lateral approach. Previous work has failed to
      address the issue of patient satisfaction and functional performance when patients are
      managed with an unrestricted rehabilitation protocol post-operatively. We propose a
      prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine whether an unrestricted postoperative
      rehabilitation protocol has an impact on patient satisfaction and functional performance
      following primary total hip arthroplasty.
