      infection who are at risk for recurrent and fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis.
      The treatment duration will be at least 24 months in order to evaluate the long-term effects
      of the treatment strategies on the development of fluconazole-refractory thrush. In addition
      to investigating antifungal treatment as it relates to fluconazole-refractory infections, the
      study will evaluate host factors and organism-related factors in order to increase our
      understanding of the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal candidiasis and fluconazole-refractory
      infections.

      Prior to randomization to a long-term management strategy using fluconazole, patients are
      stratified into one of three groups according to their baseline CD4+ count (cells/mm3): 0-49,
      50-100, and 101-150. Patients without oropharyngeal candidiasis (no thrush present) at
      enrollment and those patients who respond (no thrush present) to the initial acute therapy
      for an active infection are randomized 1:1 to one of two management strategies for
      fluconazole: Arm A (episodic therapy) or Arm B (chronic suppressive therapy with continuous
      fluconazole). Patients are then followed for a duration of 24 months after enrollment of the
      last subject. Patients with active oropharyngeal candidiasis at time of enrollment will be
      treated with fluconazole for up to 2 weeks and patients who respond (no thrush present) are
      then randomized to a long-term management strategy. Those who do not respond (refractory
      disease) to the acute treatment are permanently discontinued from the study. Women in both
      groups will have the option of being treated for vulvovaginal candidiasis either through or
      outside the study.
