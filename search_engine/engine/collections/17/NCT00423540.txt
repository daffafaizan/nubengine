      without 20 mmol magnesium sulfate added. Twenty four hour urinary excretion of magnesium will
      be determined on the first day of infusions to assess whether magnesium deficiency is
      present. Ten normal controls will also undergo a single infusion and collection of urine to
      serve as a comparison group for the urinary excretion data.
