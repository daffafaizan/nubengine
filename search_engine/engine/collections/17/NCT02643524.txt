      walker boot have a change in weight compared to patients who wear a CAM boot and are provided
      nutritional and upper body exercises (gender appropriate) information at the time the CAM
      boot is dispensed; and (2) Determine, if weight is gained or lost, the average amount
      gained/lost over the treatment period.
