    
      GABY is designed as an international, multi center, open, prospective, randomized study to
      compare two methods of bariatric surgery: Banded versus conventional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass.

      At least 16 international high volume centres of excellence in bariatric surgery and at least
      384 patients (24 patients at each center) in total will be included into this study. At least
      320 patients must have completed the study after 5 years.

      Surgery will be performed according to standardized operating protocol. The group A (control
      group) will follow the worldwide golden standard of bariatric surgery (gastric bypass).
      Patients randomised to group B will receive in addition a restrictive silastic ring. The ring
      is a launched medical product and is registered in the European Community.
