      The study will be performed in 75 subjects (25 PD patients with RBD, 25 PD patients without
      RBD and 25 healthy volunteers, age-and sex-matched without any contraindications to perform
      an MRI)

      Study Performance :

      During the first visit (J0, inclusion visit, 3 hours), each subject will perform a clinical
      and neurological examination (MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating scale (MDS-UPDRS)) and
      neuropsychological assessment (depression by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); apathy by
      the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), impulsivity by the Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack

      task during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The name of this task is
      the"monetary incentive delay task".
