      developing contractures in children with cerebral palsy. Pronation deformity which is a very
      common problem in children with cerebral palsy is primarily due to spasticity of the pronator
      muscles. Reduced strength and loss of control of the supinator muscles and soft tissue and
      joint contractures usually coexist with spasticity of pronator muscles. There is very limited
      information about how to treat this deformity in the current literature.

      In this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial the aim is to show the
      effectiveness of twister, and home exercise program in an integrated approach with BoNT-A
      injections on spasticity, and passive range of motion (pROM) of children with CP having
      pronation deformity.
