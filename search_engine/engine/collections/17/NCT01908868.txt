      aspiration (TBNA) and endobronchial biopsy (EBB) are routinely used to obtain pathological
      confirmation of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Real-time convex probe endobronchial ultrasound-guided
      TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) has shown immense potential, however it is costly, labor intensive and still
      has limited availability, especially in low and middle income countries. In the past, TBLB
      has been the bronchoscopic procedure of choice for diagnosis of sarcoidosis however currently
      its role is being debated with the advent of EBUS. We have observed that EBUS even though has
      high yield yet the optimal diagnosis is obtained only when combined with EBB and TBLB. The
      investigators hypothesize that conventional or EBUS-TBNA will have equal efficiency in
      diagnosing sarcoidosis when performed in conjunction with endobronchial and transbronchial
      lung biopsy.

      The study compares the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) vs. conventional
      TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
