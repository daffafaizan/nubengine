      at the National Defense University Hospital. The investigators will then study the molecular
      signaling effect of specific phytocompounds already identified to confer in vivo (mouse),
      anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities, in primary/organoid cultures of human breast
      tumor cells under ex vivo conditions. Finally, the investigators intend to identify the key
      molecular regulators, immune-modulatory effectors of test stromal immune cells that are
      affected by the candidate phytomedicines, using molecular and cell biology assays to
      investigate the interplay between immune cells and tumor cells in the stromal tissues.

      Our study is expected to reveal one or more highly specific, anti-inflammatory phytocompounds
      that mechanistically confer specific effects on stromal fibroblast or immune cell types,
      resulting in potent anti-tumor effects on test mammary carcinoma systems. Five Specific Aims
      are thus designed to investigate the immuno-modulating effects of specific medicinal
      constituents from TCM materials. The experimental findings obtained from this study would
      provide insights in the molecular, cellular and signaling mechanisms/effects of several
      medicinal phytocompounds that may have potential applications in chemoprevention or herbal
      medicine adjuvant treatment of human breast cancers.
