      is important to use the best possible methods to determine whether increased surveillance of
      individuals at highest risk for lung cancer will result in reduced lung cancer mortality. The
      Lung Cancer Risk Test (LCRT) proposed for evaluation promises to accurately identify the
      10-15% of the population that is most susceptible to lung cancer based on genetic
      predisposition. More than 90 million individuals in the United States alone are
      demographically at high risk for lung cancer and potential candidates for increased
      surveillance.
