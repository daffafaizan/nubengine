      the optic fissure to close during the 5th week of human gestation. Although coloboma is
      thought to have a significant genetic component, the yield of systematic screening of known
      causative genes remains low. Environmental causes for coloboma have been suggested, yet few
      to none have been proven and most studies have not been undertaken in the United States6-8.
      Potential environmental causes include maternal nutritional deficiencies, drug exposure
      (including alcohol), and endocrine abnormalities8. Some reports are conflicting (e.g.,
      maternal diabetes) and some associations have been suggested by animal models, but not
      explored in humans . Most human studies are level III and IV evidence by the Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality grading scale.

      Uveal coloboma is often grouped together with anophthalmia ( no eyes ) and microphthalmia (
      small eyes ), designated by the acronym MAC . Detailed, population-based studies of the
      epidemiology of microphthalmia and anophthalmia have been conducted as part of birth defect
      surveillance programs.

      The proposed pilot evaluation of potential environmental causes of coloboma is being
      undertaken to explore the experiences in a large cohort of probands and their families. It
      will utilize portions of the validated National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) Mother
      Questionnaire. The NBDPS was a large population-based multicenter case-control study of many
      major birth defects that collected data from October 1997 through December 2011. Interview
      pregnancy information was obtained in 32,187 cases and 11,814 controls. The findings are
      intended to produce descriptive statistics and serve as a basis for further epidemiologic
      (and possibly laboratory) study.
