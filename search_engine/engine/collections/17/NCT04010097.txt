      years old with headache, inflammatory belt pain, claudication of the jaws, scalp
      hyperesthesia, ophthalmological manifestations and an inflammatory syndrome. However, the
      clinical pictures could be less suggestive, hence diagnostic difficulties. Some patients have
      only isolated inflammatory syndrome. To confirm the diagnosis, sometimes PET CT or temporal
      artery biopsy is used, but access to a PET CT is sometimes complex, biopsy of temporal
      arteries is only positive in about 70% cases. Early diagnosis is important, however, to avoid
      irreversible complications, especially ophthalmological complications. One in six patients
      has definitive amaurosis, because of diagnosis delay. The current diagnostic delay is
      estimated on average at 9 weeks.

      Jaw intermittent claudication probably has a very good positive predictive value and this
      clinical sign often carries conviction. Patients with claudication of the jaws also have a
      greater visual risk. Kuo reports two observations of patients with claudication of the jaws
      revealed by the "chewing gum test" after 2 minutes of chewing. It is therefore proposed to
      perform a chewing gum test to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this test, compared
      to the interview.

      Once the test is done, the study is completed for the patient.
