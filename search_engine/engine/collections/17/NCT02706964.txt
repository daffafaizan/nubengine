      (PET) and diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) PET/CT scan and a CT scan with contrast
      acquired in the same imaging session; and a single brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scan with contrast to be completed in separate imaging session but within 2 weeks of the
      PET/CT scan. Imaging will take place within 7 months after enrollment. In addition, the
      medical records related to the breast cancer and care, obtained and maintained as per
      standard-of-care, will be monitored for up to 5 years.

      In this research study the investigators will acquire a PET/CT image of the body (neck to
      mid-thigh) using best-practice diagnostic imaging protocols, typically involving 64-slice CT
      systems, 1x1x3 mm voxel dimensions, use of non-ionic contrast agents, and breath-holding for
      motion correction. Subjects will also receive a single MRI with injected contrast of the
      brain using best-practice diagnostic imaging protocols, typically involving a 3-Tesla
      clinical MRI system.
