      secondary hemostasis is controversial. In this study we intend to assess both, primary and
      secondary hemostasis prior to and after the usage of modified ultrafiltration. Primary
      hemostasis is assessed using Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (Multiplate) and secondary
      hemostasis is assessed performing thrombelastometry using the ROTEM device. Patients are
      preoperatively randomized to receive either modified ultrafiltration or no filtration.
