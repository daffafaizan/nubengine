      overlapping foci to deliver acoustic energy to a known focal depth within tissue. The focused
      ultrasound applicators are each comprised of an ultra-sound-emitting piezoelectric element
      coupled to a focusing lens. The array of the DECIMA device is coupled with an ultra-sound
      imaging system to locate the cervical vagus nerve, and a control system to deliver short
      bursts of ultrasound energy that are controlled by the operator in time and intensity.

      The imaging system and the array of applicators are calibrated together, so the power is
      focused at a known location relative to the imaging system screen. Each focused applicator's
      lens is joined to an ultrasound coupling cylinder filled with water. Each coupling cylinder
      is lined with thin plastic film at the skin. The ultrasound output power of the applicators
      is monitored by each applicator's control unit which includes a display of the ultrasound
      intensity.

      To perform ultrasound stimulation, ultrasound gel is placed on the skin over the nerve area
      in the neck. Then the coupling cylinders and imaging transducer are placed against the gel,
      then the DECIMA position is fixed in place by a support arm.
