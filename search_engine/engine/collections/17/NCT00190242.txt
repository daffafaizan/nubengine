      general population. However, immunogenicity induced with 2 doses of anti-HAV vaccine is lower
      in HIV-infected patients. The primary objective of the study is to compare the immunogenicity
      (percentage of patients with anti-HAV antibodies > 20 mUI/ml at month 7) of 2 strategies (2
      doses at months 1 and 6, versus 3 doses at months 1, 2 and 6)of anti-HAV vaccine in HIV-1
      infected patients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV with CD4 cell count between 200 and
      500/mm3. The second objectives are to compare mean anti-HAV antibodies titers obtained with
      the 2 strategies, the durability of the seroprotection 12 months after the end of
      vaccination, and the safety. The PARAMATERS than may have an effect on the immune response
      will be evaluated.

      This open, prospective, study have included 99 patients, aged from 18 to 55 years old.
      Patients were randomized to receive 2 or 3 doses of HAVRIX 1440 UI intramuscularly at week O,
      4, and 24 or week 0, and 24. Clinical and biological safety is evaluated after each
      immunisation and blood samples for serological evaluation taken at week -4, 4, 8, 24 and 28
      for immunogenicity and week 72 for long term analysis
