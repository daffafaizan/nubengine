      athletes who develop SPRCS. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of
      multiple (5 consecutive daily) sessions of 2 milliampere (mA) right cerebellar tDCS on
      cognitive deficits, balance, and overall attenuation of symptoms on people with SRPCS.
      Cognitive deficits will be assessed with the N-back Working Memory test, list sorting test,
      and dimensional change card test. Balance deficits will be assessed with the Berg Balance
      Scale and Standing Balance Test (SBT), and symptoms will be assessed via the Rivermead
      Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ). The cognitive and balance tasks are taken from
      the NIH motor toolbox and have been shown to be the most important for health and success in
      school and work, and the RPQ is one of the most widely used SRPCS evaluation tools. The
      central hypothesis is that tDCS will provide improvements in cognitive deficits, balance, and
      overall symptom attenuation in people with SRPCS both acutely and at 2 and 4 week follow ups.
      The researchers further hypothesize that cerebellar tDCS will ameliorate the symptoms of
      people with SRPCS. The rationale is that the results will improve the quality of life of
      these patients and may prevent impairment of cognitive function later in life.
