      among man. Assumably there will be an increase in prostate cancer in the next few years
      because of demographic factors. The progressive metastatic prostate cancer often develops an
      androgen resistance. This so-called Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) is not
      responsive to androgen deprivation therapy. Depending on symptoms and progression first-line
      chemotherapy - docetaxel and abiraterone are available.

      Intermittent fasting as a form of caloric restriction has been studied most extensively
      experimentally in recent years. It showed consistent beneficial effects on relevant
      inflammatory and oncological pathways. In the field of preclinical oncology research groups
      have recently focused on intermittent fasting with chemotherapeutic treatment and promising
      experimental data have been published. In summary, the combination of fasting and
      chemotherapy was more effective in various cancer animal models than chemotherapy alone.
