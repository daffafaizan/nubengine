      to those required by your weight loss program. These sessions will work to facilitate an
      increase in self-monitoring, positive communication, problem solving, and social support to
      increase healthy physical activity and eating behaviors to increase the effectiveness of the
      weight loss programs. Joint goal setting and tracking will be enabled by commercially
      available devices and apps. Each caregiver and child will receive an activity monitor,
      activity app, and a food app (digital food diary) that allows self-monitoring of consumption
      and "social accountability," which will allow caregivers and the Brenner FIT team to monitor
      and encourage. Furthermore, two home visits will be conducted to evaluation the home food and
      activity environments to inform tailored feedback to families.

      Brenner FIT is a family-based pediatric weight management clinic for youth 2-18 years old
      referred by a physician for overweight or obesity.11-14 By Design is an adult (>18yrs) weight
      loss clinic that includes tailored dietary and physical activity behavioral counseling. The
      preliminary data suggest that most adolescent youth who enroll in Brenner FIT have at least
      one adult caregiver who is eligible and would benefit from enrollment in By Design
      Essentials.
