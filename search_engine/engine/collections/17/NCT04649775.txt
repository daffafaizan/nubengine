    
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the use of the AirFLO2 device can improve
      hypoxia as measured by change between partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of
      inspired oxygen- P:F ratio (PaO2:FiO2) and repeat P:F ratio between 1 to 6 hours after using
      the device.

      This is an unblinded, randomized, controlled trial for use of the AirFLO2 device for patients
      admitted to Duke Hospital with COVID-19 and tachypnea (RR >20 breaths/min) and/or hypoxia
      (Oxygen saturation <94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline).

      Groups will be analyzed by intention to treat. Per-protocol analyses will also be performed.
      Descriptive statistics will be reported for the overall subject population, and for the two
      groups.
