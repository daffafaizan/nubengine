    
      Background:

      - Inhibition of angiogenesis has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC). TRC105 is a human/murine chimeric immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma
      1 (IgG1) kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to human CD105 (endoglin), thus inhibiting
      angiogenesis and tumor growth. Data from an ongoing phase I clinical trial suggest that
      TRC105 is well tolerated with evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic CRPC.

      Primary Objectives:

      - Define the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of TRC105 given every one to two weeks.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile of TRC105 given every one to
           two weeks

        -  Evaluate time to disease progression, overall response rate and overall survival.

        -  Describe the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate to therapy with TRC105

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of TRC105

        -  Demonstrate a biologic effect of TRC105 in the patient and, when possible, on the tumor
           via laboratory evaluation of the molecular markers of angiogenesis before and after drug
           administration respectively

      Eligibility:

        -  Progressive, castrate-resistant, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2

      Design:

      - An initial single-arm, phase I dose escalation study open to all patients with progressive
      metastatic CRPC. The study will evaluate patients in five cohorts of escalating dose levels.
      A maximum of 30 patients will be needed to complete the phase I evaluation.
