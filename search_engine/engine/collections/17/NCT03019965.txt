      Betalactams are time-dependent antibiotics, and so, the duration of time for which the free
      drug plasma concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT > MIC) is
      the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index associated with bacterial killing and clinical
      improvement. Numerous studies have demonstrated that continuous infusion (infusion in 24
      hours) and extended infusion (through prolonging the infusion time to greater than 3 hours)
      allows the maintenance of concentrations above the MIC for a longer period of time within the
      dosing interval (30 minute or 1 hour), and so, capitalises on the pharmacodynamic properties
      of betalactams and maximises bacterial killing, therefore potentially improving clinical
      outcomes. In adult patients, the several studies suggest that prolonged infusion may offer
      clinical benefits and significant reduction in mortality without increasing the risk of
      toxicity, however, there is limited information about these dosing strategies in pediatric
      patients.
