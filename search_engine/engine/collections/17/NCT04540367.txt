      performed 8wks of shoulder LIX [2/wk, 4 sets (30/15/15/fatigue), 20%max] using common rotator
      cuff exercises [cable external rotation (ER), cable internal rotation (IR), dumbbell scaption
      (SCAP), and side-lying dumbbell ER (SLER)]. The BFR group also trained with an automated
      tourniquet placed at the proximal arm (50%-occlusion). Regional lean mass
      (dual-energy-xray-absorptiometry), isometric strength, and muscular endurance
      (repetitions-to-fatigue, RTF, 20%max, with and without 50%-occlusion) was measured before and
      after training. Electromyographic amplitude (EMGa) was also recorded from target shoulder
      muscles during endurance testing. A mixed-model ANCOVA (covaried on baseline measures) was
      used to detect within and between-group differences in primary outcome measures (Î±=0.05).
