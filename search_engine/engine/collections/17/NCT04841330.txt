    
      This study is designed to collect prospective observational data related to the safety and
      performance of the Securis™ Stabilization Device in healthy volunteers utilizing a simulated
      use method. Participants will have an intravenous catheter applied (not inserted) onto their
      forearm with a Securis™ Stabilization Device applied over it. The site/device will be
      assessed over a period of 9 days (ideally Days 0-7 in-clinic and Day 8 virtually). The
      assessments will include the appearance of the site, the appearance of the dressing, and the
      movement of the catheter tip under the dressing.
