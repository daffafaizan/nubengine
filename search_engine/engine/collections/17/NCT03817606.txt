      Posterior Lumbar Cage and the UniLIF PEEK implant with respect to how long it takes to
      achieve fusion of the spine. Study participants will undergo a transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF) surgery and return for CT and x-ray follow-up to measure the degree
      to which fusion has been achieved. Survey methodology to assess perceived pain, level of
      disability, and quality of life will also be used to measure the differences between groups
      on these components.
