      Estimating the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against influenza related hospitalisation
      is important to guide these strategies. The objective is to measure the population
      effectiveness of influenza vaccine in patients hospitalized with virologically confirmed
      influenza laboratory during the influenza season 2012/2013 in a French hospitals network.
      This is a study "case-control" involving a nasopharyngeal sample for all hospitalised
      patients presenting an influenza-like illness within seven days. Cases will be patients
      RT-PCR positive for influenza. Controls will be patients negative for any influenza virus.
