      surgery in each eye of patients undergoing routine cataract surgery. After the collection of
      the first conjunctival swab a three-days treatment with eyedrops containing 0.6%
      povidone-iodine in the eye undergoing routine cataract surgery will be performed. Bacterial
      isolates will be identified by using standard microbiological protocols and total bacterial
      load will be determined at the two different time points. In vitro susceptibility testing to
      determine methicillin resistance in isolated Staphylococcus species will be performed.
      Controlateral eye of each patient will be used as control. Descriptive statistics will be
      calculated.
