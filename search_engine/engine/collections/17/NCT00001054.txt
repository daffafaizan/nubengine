      chronic oral therapy with acyclovir may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of acyclovir,
      resulting in resistance to that drug. Valacyclovir hydrochloride, which converts to acyclovir
      in the body, increases acyclovir bioavailability by 3-5 fold.

      In the first cohort, patients with stable herpes simplex virus receive valacyclovir
      hydrochloride at 1 of 2 doses, depending on body surface area (BSA), for 10 days. If
      acceptable safety is seen at this dose level, a second cohort of patients with stable herpes
      simplex virus receive a higher dose, depending on BSA, for 10 days. A third cohort of
      patients with varicella or zoster receive a selected dose based on results from the previous
      cohorts.
