      care management for people with diabetes through automated SMS messages. The program is a
      theory-driven behavioral intervention designed to improve self-care through multiple
      mediators, including cuing, education, self-efficacy, social support, and health beliefs.
      Participants in the program receive educational and motivational text messages about diabetes
      self-care, some prompts to engage in a particular action (for example, "Time to check your
      blood sugar"), and some self-assessment questions (such as, "Do you need refills of any of
      your medications?") to which the patient responds by texting. Participants' responses to
      self-assessment questions are used to facilitate remote monitoring and care management by the
      health care team. A response that is outside established parameters triggers an alert. Using
      protocols, nurses respond to each alert by the next business day.
