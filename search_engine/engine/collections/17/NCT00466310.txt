      worldwide with an incidence of about 1%. Most individuals with this illness benefit from
      long-term pharmacotherapy, however, the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic treatment are
      inconsistent, incomplete, and often countered by significant side-effects associated with
      long-term physical morbidity (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, obesity, hyperglycemia,
      hyperlipidemia. Metabolomics is a powerful new technology that provides a snap shot of
      biochemical pathways at a particular point in time. It has been earmarked as an important
      area to develop under the NIH roadmap initiative. We plan to use this platform to map
      biochemical signatures in unmedicated schizophrenic patients prior to and 4 weeks post
      treatment with the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole and compare that to lipid perturbations
      induced by risperidone. These drugs have inherently different risk for metabolic adverse
      effects and patients respond to them differently. Metabolic signatures for the drugs capture
      significant biochemical information that could explain part of the basis for varied drug
      response within individuals and will highlight pathways implicated in drug action and in
      disease pathogenesis possibly enabling new drug design strategies.In addition, we will
      compare patients to healthy controls at baseline in regard lipid profiles, to assess whether
      lipid profiles differ between unmedicated schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.
