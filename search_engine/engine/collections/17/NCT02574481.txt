      expanding elderly population as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
      Atherosclerosis in the vessels of the lower extremities can cause a variety of symptoms
      ranging from intermittent claudication to ischemic rest pain and critical ischemia with major
      tissue loss. Typically, femoropopliteal lesions have been difficult to successfully treat
      with endovascular therapy because the disease is often diffuse and located in an area of the
      body subject to significant mobility stresses such as extension, contraction, compression,
      elongation, flexion and torsion.

      The IMPERIAL trial is a global, prospective, multi-center trial. Approximately 525-535
      subjects will be enrolled at up to 75 study centers worldwide. Regions participating include
      the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan and New Zealand.

      The trial consists of a prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs Zilver PTX),
      controlled, single-blind, non-inferiority trial (RCT), a concurrent, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, single-arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy and a concurrent, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, Long Lesion substudy.
