      will continue to rise. Given that about 40% of cases of DLBCL occur in patients aged over 70
      and the number of co-mobilities increases with age, research to investigate the optimal
      treatment of DLBCL in this group of patients is needed. R-CHOP remains the standard of care
      for the majority of patients with DLBCL, anthracycline use is precluded in a proportion of
      these patients by a high risk of developing cardiotoxicity, especially congestive cardiac
      failure. Currently there is no standard of care for patients who are unfit for anthracycline
      treatment. It has been routine to omit the doxorubicin from R-CHOP, giving R-CVP instead.
      However the outcome for patients treated with R-CVP is poor and attempts have been made to
      replace the doxorubicin with alternative agents. The trial will compare an experimental arm
      consisting of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin added to the standard immunochemotherapy regimen of
      rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CVP) with the control arm of
      gemcitabine added to the same combination (Gem-R-CVP).
