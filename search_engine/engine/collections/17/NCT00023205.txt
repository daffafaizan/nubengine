      than patients with better literacy. This study will compare the disease outcomes of arthritis
      patients at three different reading levels who receive either standard arthritis materials
      written at an 11th grade reading level or an in-person, interactive, text-free session along
      with lower reading level materials. The study will determine the most effective methods of
      educating patients with poor literacy about their disease.

      Patients with systemic inflammatory rheumatic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
      arthritis, and seronegative polyarthritis) will be assessed and placed into one of three
      reading levels: 8th grade or lower; 9th to 11th grade; or 12th grade or higher. Patients from
      each reading level will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. Group 1 will
      receive disease-specific material from the Arthritis Foundation written at an 11th grade
      reading level. Group 2 will receive plain language materials, an arthritis glossary, and a
      one-hour, in-person session with a study educator using interactive, text-free methods. The
      study educator will help the patient with reading-related problems either by study visit or
      by telephone for 6 months postsession.

      All patients will receive a medication calendar. Patients will be followed for one year after
      the intervention and will be assessed for changes in health status, disease activity,
      communication with the physician, self-management of their arthritis, understanding of and
      adherence to prescribed treatment, and satisfaction with their intervention.
