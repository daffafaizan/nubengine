      different anthropometric parameters, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist
      to height ratio (WHtR) and neck circumference (NC) and the cardiovascular (CV) risk factors
      most commonly evaluated in the clinical practice such as systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure, and fasting glucose, lipid (triglycerides, total, High-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      and Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol), insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for
      Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), uric acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), c-reactive protein
      (CRP), white blood cells and platelet number in a population of 1214 apparently healthy
      subjects with overweight and obesity subjects
