      histocompatible sibling donor, X-linked CD40 ligand deficiency and under 5 years of age using
      donors other than histocompatible siblings, other primary immunodeficiencies without
      manifestations of hemophagocytosis using a histocompatible sibling donor, or other primary
      immunodeficiencies without manifestations of hemophagocytosis and under 5 years of age using
      donors other than histocompatible siblings receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on
      days -9 to -6, cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -2, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) twice
      daily on days -4 to -1. Allogeneic bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation takes

      lymphoproliferative syndrome, severe progressive Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or other
      primary immunodeficiencies with complications of hemophagocytosis receive busulfan IV over 2
      hours every 6 hours on days -9 to -6, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 to -2,
      etoposide IV over 22 hours on days -5 to -3, and ATG IV twice daily on days -2, -1, 1, and 2.
      Allogeneic bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation takes place on day 0. Patients
      receive graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
      and 11 and cyclosporine IV on days -3 to 50.

      Patients with Wiskott Aldrich syndrome or other primary immunodeficiencies without
      manifestations of hemophagocytosis, who are over 5 years of age and using donors other than
      histocompatible siblings, receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -6 and -5,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, total body irradiation on day -2, and ATG
      IV over 2 hours twice daily on days -2, -1, 2, and 3. Allogeneic bone marrow or umbilical
      cord blood transplantation takes place on days 0 and 1. Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis
      with methylprednisolone IV every 12 hours on days 2-21, oral prednisone every 12 hours on
      days 22-100 and then tapered off over days 101 to 128, and cyclosporine IV over 2 hours every
