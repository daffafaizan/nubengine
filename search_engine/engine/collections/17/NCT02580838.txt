      limb due to the development of spasticity. Botulinum toxin type A injection is a powerful
      treatment option for control of spasticity. In this study, the patients will be randomly
      assigned into three groups: early OnabotulinumtoxinA group will receive OnabotulinumtoxinA
      injection when their spasticity develop, late OnabotulinumtoxinA group will have injection at
      6 months after emergence of spasticity, the third group will not have OnabotulinumtoxinA
      intervention. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effects of early
      and late injection of botulinum toxin type A on upper limb function in patients with stroke.
