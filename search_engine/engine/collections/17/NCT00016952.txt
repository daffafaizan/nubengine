        -  Determine the tumor response rate in patients receiving irinotecan or fluorouracil and
           leucovorin calcium for metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with oxaliplatin
           with or without irinotecan.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
           of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (oxaliplatin-based therapy vs irinotecan and oxaliplatin combination therapy). Patients are
      assigned to one of two treatment groups.

        -  Group I (prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90
           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks.

        -  Group II (prior irinotecan and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy): Patients receive
           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1 and 2.
           Treatment repeats every 2 weeks.

        -  Both groups: Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients with a confirmed complete response for 2 consecutive courses may
           discontinue treatment at investigator's discretion.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, approximately every 6 weeks during treatment, and
      then after the last course of treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.
