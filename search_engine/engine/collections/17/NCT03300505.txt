    
      This is a single dose-finding one-arm phase Ib/II trial to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) from among three dose levels of ARRx in combination with a fixed dose of
      enzalutamide and to obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy at this MTD, as measured by PSA
      response rate. Success for the trial is defined as finding a dose level that is likely to be
      both tolerable and effective.
