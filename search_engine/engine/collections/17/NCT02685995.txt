      catheter which in pre-clinical testing and retrospective review has improved flow and patency
      compared to other dialysis catheter designs. This study will compare 90 day patency rates of
      newly inserted VF catheters to the Palindrome catheter both of which are FDA approved devices
      and will inserted as standard of care. The Palindrome catheter has been selected as the
      comparison device because it is also a symmetrical tip catheter design and prior studies by
      the manufacturer of this device suggests it has a lower occlusion rate and better flow
      compared to other catheter designs.
