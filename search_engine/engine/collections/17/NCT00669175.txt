      hypothesize that critically ill patients in the NICU may benefit from a low dose naloxone
      infusion resulting in decreased tolerance, less severe withdrawal symptoms, lower cumulative
      doses of opiates, and fewer total days of opiates, all while maintaining adequate or enhanced
      pain control and sedation. Establishing safety and efficacy data for this potentially
      beneficial therapy is an important first step towards using this therapy to decrease the risk
      of opioid tolerance and withdrawal in this population of infants.
