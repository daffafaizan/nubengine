      potential to measure early cellular and vascular changes that occur in response to
      chemotherapy and could therefore be early predictors of therapeutic response.

      Aim of our study is to assess the accuracy of dynamic contrast enhanced and
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging in evaluating response to chemotherapy during the preoperative
      treatment of osteosarcoma. Patients will undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced and
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before, during and after chemotherapy.

      Our long-term goal is to use these imaging techniques to develop non-invasive methodologies
      that would be better predictors of tumor response than the current clinical standard and
      earlier predictors than histological evaluation of the whole tumor.
