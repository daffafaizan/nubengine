      neurodegenerative disorders, development of both wet and dry biomarkers of disease, and
      delineation of the full course of the natural history of disease from the early
      pre-symptomatic stages through established and even late-stage disease. These goals are
      accomplished through the recruitment and evaluation of patients with ALS and related
      diseases, family members (including people at genetic risk for ALS, but who are not yet
      affected), and healthy controls.
