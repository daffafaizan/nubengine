      randomized to either LMA Proseal group or LMA Supreme group by computer generated allocation.

      The patients were scheduled for elective lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery, such as
      laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, laparoscopic renal cyst decortication (LRCD) or
      laparoscopic adrenalectomy.Inclusion criteria for the patients were: Aged>18 years, ASA
      physical status grade I - Ⅲ and body mass index ≤30 kg.m-2. Exclusion criteria were:
      anticipated difficult airway (e.g., Modified Mallampati Class IV, oropharyngeal pathology),
      severe cardiopulmonary disease, increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration (e.g.,
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and pregnant patients), and retroperitoneal laparoscopic
      procedures.
