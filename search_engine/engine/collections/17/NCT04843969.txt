      conditions: 1) a non-stressful task followed by neutral cues, 2) the non-stressful task
      followed by smoking cues, 3) a stressful task followed by neutral cues, or 4) the stressful
      task followed by smoking cues. Ten minutes after the intervention, participants will undergo
      a 60-minute extinction procedure consisting of smoking-related videos, images and smoking
      paraphernalia. Cue reactivity test sessions will take place 24 hours, 2 weeks and 6 weeks
      following the intervention.

      COVID-associated changes in substance use will be quantified over three telephone interviews:
      one at the end of March / beginning of April 2020 (at the start of the pandemic), one at the
      end of April / beginning of May, and a final one which will be instituted if feasible once
      the infection rates and social distancing policies have decreased.
