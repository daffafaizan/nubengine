      past years especially among women and still no definite treatment protocol and that's due to
      the inter lapping of anatomy and neurology of this joint with other structures all over the
      body. The cervical spine dysfunction has a high incidence as well, and they are common to
      coexist as they are highly interrelated. Objective: The objective of this study is to
      emphasize the interrelation between cervical dysfunction and TMJ dysfunction by examining the
      relationship between cervical spine ROM and TMJ vertical opening ROM to provide better
      recognition of the etiology of TMJ dysfunction thus a holistic intervention. Materials and
      methods: It is a bivariate correlational research design. Forty subjects between the age of
      20 -40 years (15male/ 25females) were recruited. Cervical ROM was measured by CROM device for
      all 6 cervical movements. The TMJ vertical mouth opening was measured by a 10 cm ruler. The
      CROM will be used consistent with standard clinical procedures, with 3 takes for each
      measurement to decrease human error. The measurements were taken one shot.
