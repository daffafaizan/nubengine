    
      Aim 1: Identify the needs, desires, concerns, and expectations of AYA patients with SCD and
      their parents/caregivers that will guide implementation of a mHealth tool, HU-Go, designed to
      improve adherence to HU. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with patients and their
      parents/caregivers. Transcripts will be independently coded and thematic analysis will be
      conducted.

      Hypothesis 1: AYA patients with SCD and their parents/caregivers will identify specific
      features, content, and usability requirements of HU-Go.

      Aim 2: Assess the longitudinal relationship of HU adherence to HRQoL domains, including
      fatigue and depression. HU adherence will be measured using electronic pill bottles,
      self-report measures, laboratory markers, and medication possession ratio (MPR). HRQOL will
      be assessed using PROMISÂ® measures.

      Hypothesis 2: Low HU adherence is associated with impairment of HRQoL domains.

      Aim 3: Conduct a single-arm, pilot study to determine the effect size associated with
      improvement in HU adherence after using HU-Go for 12 weeks. Adherence will be measured using
      self-report measures, laboratory markers and MPR.

      Hypothesis 3: HU-Go will improve HU adherence by at least 20%.
