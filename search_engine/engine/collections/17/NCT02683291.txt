      This will be a single-center, prospective, 12-month randomized controlled trial aiming to
      compare sirolimus associated with tacrolimus in elderly renal transplant patients as to
      safety and incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

      Treatments

      In the control group (Tacrolimus + Mycophenolate) the investigators will use tacrolimus
      (starting with 0.1 mg/kg twice daily adjusted to target serum levels by 4-8ng/ml at the third
      month and then 3-7ng/ml from the third month to the 12th month) and mycophenolate sodium 720
      mg twice daily. A dose reduction of mycophenolate sodium to 720 mg/day will be accepted due
      to possible side effects of the drug.

      In the treatment group (Tacrolimus + sirolimus) the investigators will use tacrolimus
      (starting with 0.1 mg/kg twice daily adjusted to target serum levels by 4-8 ng/ml at the
      third month and then 3-7 ng/ml from the third month to the 12th month) and sirolimus 2 mg/day
      (adjusted serum levels at 4-8 ng/ml throughout the study period).

      In all groups, patients will receive prednisone 30 mg/day (in the first month with weekly
      reductions up to 5 mg/day at the end of the second month). Induction therapy consisted of
      basiliximab or antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin, GenzymeÂ®). Thymoglobulin will be used
      in patients with panel reactivity class I greater than 50 % (at a dose of 1mg/kg for 5 days).
