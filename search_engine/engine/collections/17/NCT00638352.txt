      of a lung mass between 5/1/01 and 10/30/04. If the pathology report indicates that the biopsy
      showed no evidence of malignancy, we will examine the medical record for a "gold standard"
      diagnosis of the lesion in question, including the pathology result from a surgical resection
      or a repeat biopsy, imaging follow-up demonstrating regression of the lesion or size
      stability for at least 2 years, or clinical follow-up for at least 2 years with no clinical
      evidence of malignant disease. If this information is not available in the University
      Hospital medical record, we will contact the patient to obtain consent for follow-up using
      external sources (physician records, imaging studies, pathology reports).

      We will derive descriptive statistics (prevalence of malignancy, sensitivity, specificity,
      and false negative rates). The overall sample size will be ~500 patients who had PTNB of a
      lung mass within the study period. Approximately 80 are expected to have a biopsy result
      showing no evidence of malignancy, based on a retrospective review performed under an IRB
      exemption (87-04, letter dated 9/28/04). The expected proportion of cases with no evidence of
      malignancy is approximately 0.15. For a 95% confidence interval of 0.15+/-0.075 we will need
      follow-up information from 61 patients, considering that this is a descriptive study with a
      dichotomous variable. This gives us a margin for patients who will be lost to follow-up
