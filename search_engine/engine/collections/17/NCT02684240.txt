      treatment-naive, drug-susceptible patients with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
      The study will be conducted at the GHESKIO Centers in Port au Prince Haiti. Twenty patients
      will be randomized to receive NTZ 1 gram orally twice daily for 14 days. Ten patients will be
      randomized as positive controls to receive standard 4 drug tuberculosis therapy with
      isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), ethambutol (E), and pyrazinamide (PZA). Patients' sputum will be
      collected before and then every two days during 14 days of treatment, and the primary
      endpoint will be the change in the number of M. tuberculosis in patients' sputum. Our primary
      hypothesis is that NTZ will result in a significant decrease in the number of M. tuberculosis
      in sputum during14 days of treatment. The number of M. tuberculosis will be quantified by the
      time to positive (TTP) signal in hours in an automated liquid media culture system (BACTEC
      MGIT 960, Becton Dickinson).
