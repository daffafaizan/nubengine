      mesylate) and Taxotere (also known as docetaxel) in patients with incurable stomach cancer.
      Gleevec is a pill form of chemotherapy and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients
      with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). It is
      considered experimental for the treatment of stomach cancer. Taxotere (docetaxel) is a
      chemotherapy which is injected into the vein. It is approved for breast and lung cancer but
      has been shown to shrink many different types of tumors. Taxotere has been shown to shrink
      stomach cancer in about 20% - 30% of patients treated with Taxotere only. This study is being
      performed to see if the combination of Gleevec and Taxotere is an effective treatment for
      incurable stomach cancer with minimal side effects.

      Treatment on this study consists of two drugs, Gleevec速 and Taxotere. Patients will be take
      four tablets of Gleevec速 daily throughout the study. After one week of Gleevec速, patients
      will then begin receiving doses of Taxotere intravenously once a week for two weeks in a row
      followed by one week without Taxotere.
