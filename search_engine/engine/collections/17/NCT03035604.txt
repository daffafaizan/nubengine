      I. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of 4 screening tools (Mini
      Nutritional Assessment [MNA], weight loss, body mass index [BMI], and lean muscle mass),
      correlates with 6-month and 12-month mortality in older cancer patients after geriatric
      assessment, after adjusting for covariates.

      II. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of by 4 screening tools
      (MNA, weight loss, BMI, and lean muscle mass) correlates with 6-month and 12-month unplanned
      hospitalization in older cancer patients who undergo geriatric assessment, after adjusting
      for covariates.

      III. To evaluate whether nutritional status, as determined by each of 4 screening tools (MNA,
      weight loss, BMI, and lean muscle mass) correlates with 6-month and 12-month hospital
      readmissions in older cancer patients who undergo geriatric assessment, after adjusting for
      covariates.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo nutritional geriatric assessment over 15 minutes in person or on the
      phone every 3 months for 12 months.
