      the original well-establish MCE system.Conventional protective measures could be adopted to
      endoscopist. Although the endoscopist and the patient are in different rooms, the endoscopist
      was able to see the patient and communicate with him or her through the audio-visual exchange
      system all the time. In order to simplify the examination procedure, the data recorder was
      putted on the examination bed. The patient lay down after swallowing the capsule under the
      remote guidance of the endoscopist.And the endoscopist of MCE and nc-MCE was the same one
      with experience of more than 1000 cases of MCCG operation.

      The investigators recruited 40 patients who have related symptom and healthy people mainly
      from outpatient clinic or hospital health examination center. After fully understanding the
      procedure of nc-MCE, patients with informed consent were randomly divided into MCE group and
      nc-MCE group(1:1) by using a stratified block randomization(block size four).

      The basic characteristics of the enrolled patients were prospectively collected. The primary
      endpoint was the maneuverability score evaluated by endoscopist. And the investigators choose
      the gastric examination time,the comfort and acceptability of patients, diagnostic yield and
      completeness of gastric examination as the secondary endpoint. The safety endpoint of nc-MCE
      was evaluated by the occurrence of adverse events.
