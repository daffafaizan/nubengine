      intravitreal injections of ALG-1001 in human subjects with wet age-related macular
      degeneration (Wet AMD). This study builds upon the safety and efficacy results of numerous
      animal studies and an earlier Phase I Human Study in end-stage diabetic macular edema
      patients.

      The specific objective of this six-month study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      three monthly ophthalmic intravitreal injections of ALG-1001 in human subjects with Wet AMD,
      and to follow these subjects for an additional four months off-treatment. Three cohorts have
      been established as part of the study design, utilizing three different doses.
