      with a number of targets, metabolic pathways and functions.

      A suitable biofluid to study nutrient intake is urine, which is the most commonly used
      biological sample for metabolomic analysis and can be collected with simple and non-invasive
      methods.

      Up to now, no studies have investigated healthy term infants metabolome and its modulation
      according to different dietary regimens such as formula-feeding or breastfeeding.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate, with untargeted modalities, the urine metabolomic
      profile of a group of infants fed with a standard formula, a group of infants fed with a
      formula supplemented with functional ingredients and a group of breast-fed infants.

      Formula-fed infants participate to PLA-LENI-09 study (NCT01197365). We have included also a
      control group of breast-fed infants, as, from a scientific point of view, they represent the
      "gold standard" and no data are available on their metabolomic profile.
