      human body. If the tendon has to be fixed at the bone during surgery, the weak point in
      obtaining a successful surgery is the fixation of the tendon at the bone insertion site.
      Tendon belongs to the bradytrophic tissue conditional on the reduced blood flow, deep mitosis
      rate and lowered healing potential. We can boost the healing process with a selective use of
      PRP (platelet rich plasma). In this process, the healing site is delivered with an elevated
      concentration of thrombocytes and also growth factors which are constituent parts of them.

      In this study, we will test the ArthrexÂ® Double Syringe System. With this system it is
      possible to obtain ACP (Autologous conditioned plasma) in one centrifugation step. The
      supernatant contains a concentration of thrombocytes which is twice as high as in the native
      blood. The concentration of the growth factors is 5-25x higher according to this.

      We also want to test if one application of ACP is enough to get a short- and long-term
      benefit in healing following a rotator cuff tear.
