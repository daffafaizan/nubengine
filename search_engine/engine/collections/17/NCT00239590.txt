      of weeks can beneficially affect myocardial perfusion, vascular reactivity, metabolic risk
      factors and quality of life in men with documented coronary heart disease. Men with
      documented significant coronary artery disease and a positive exercise test for myocardial
      ischaemia will be enrolled into the study. They will be randomised to active testosterone
      therapy (5 mg/day) or placebo for 2 months. After 2 months they will undergo MRI perfusion
      scanning, radial artery applanation tonometry to assess endothelial function, blood sampling
      for analysis of metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease, complete quality of life
      questionnaires and will cross-over to the opposite treatment. After a further 2 month period
      these tests will be repeated. Angina diaries will be kept for the duration of the study.
