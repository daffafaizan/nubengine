      mortality and increased morbidity. At the time of diagnosis half of the patients have
      cardiovascular, renal, ophthalmic or neurological disease. A recent Danish intervention study
      found a marked reduction in cardiovascular events and microvascular complications in a group
      of patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria using an intensive multifactorial
      pharmacologic intervention and lifestyle intervention (3). The achieved changes in lifestyle
      seems however to vanish after a short period. Lack of information, unawareness of the
      seriousness of the disease and lack of supervised training and insufficient follow-up may be
      of importance of the long-term outcome in these patients.

      A total number of 180 patients with type 2 diabetes, will be randomized to the intervention
      group or to standard care.

      This study tests an intensive intervention of lifestyle by a newly developed program of
      rehabilitation compared with routine standards in a randomized controlled design. Provided
      that a significant positive outcome is found, the non-pharmacologic treatment of type 2
      diabetes could be optimized and inpatient hospitalization due to complications could be
      avoided.
