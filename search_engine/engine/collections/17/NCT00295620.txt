      treatment with anastrozole after initial 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. S.A.L.S.A. is
      a randomized open multicentered phase III study comparing the efficacy of secondary adjuvant
      endokrine treatment of ArimidexÂ® (Anastrozol) for 2 or 5 years after primary adjuvant
      endokrine therapy in patients with hormonreceptor positive mammakarzinom. Patients are
      examined at screening, after 6 months, then every year until 5 years. The subsequent yearly
      follow up with mammographie and clinical examination ends 10 years after the screening.
      S.A.L.S.A. started in February 2004 and has recruited 3484 patients until June 2010 at 78
      sites all over Austria.

      Primary Endpoint:

      1. Proof of the effect of 2 years versus 5 years of Anastrozol after 5 years of adjuvant
      endocrine therapy on the disease free survival

      Secondary endpoint:

        1. Proof of the effect of 2 years versus 5 years of Anastrozol after 5 years of adjuvant
           endocrine therapy on the overall survival

        2. Comparison of fracture rate in both therapy groups

        3. Comparison of incidence of

             1. a secondary carcinoma except the contralateral mammacarcinoma

             2. contralateral mammacarcinoma in both therapie groups
