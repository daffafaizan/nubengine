      (WBV) training on physical function and quadriceps muscle strength in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis and further will be researched which frequencies are effective for knee OA
      patients and how much WBV training is useful modality for knee osteoarthritic patients. This
      research will have significant effects in improving muscle strength and functional level of
      knee OA patients.
