    
      The purpose of this observational study is to prospectively evaluate the impact of multi
      detector CT angiography (MDCT) in patients with equivocal/intermediate post exercise stress
      test probability of coronary artery disease.

      The primary objective are to:

        1. Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of MDCT in patients with equivocal/
           intermediate post test probability of CAD and

        2. Evaluate the accuracy of MDCT in prediction of 30 day major adverse events.
