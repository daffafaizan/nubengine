      expected duration of the enrollment period is approximately 9 months. The duration of each
      subject's participation in the study will be approximately one year. However, at sites where
      the routine follow-up period is greater than one year, subjects may be followed for up to 36
      months at their surgeon's discretion if they agree to it.
