      exercise training for three months and then subjects will repeat the testing.

        1. Initial exam. A history and physical exam will be performed. Blood will be drawn for
           measurements of overall health. Resting electrocardiogram will be obtained. The Low
           Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR) questionnaire will be administered.

        2. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) will be carried out during visit two. A
           familiarization bicycle ergometer test will also be performed on this day.

        3. During visit three, a euglycemic clamp will be performed.

        4. During visit four, echocardiographic measurements will be made and a diet interview will
           be performed.

        5. On visit five, measures of blood vessel-dependent vasodilation will be performed.
           Repeated brachial artery diameter and forearm blood flow responses to cuff occlusion
           will be measured separately on this occasion.

        6. On visit six, arterial stiffness will be measured. Subjects will also perform a graded
           bicycle exercise test.

        7. On visit seven, subjects will perform constant level bicycle tests.
