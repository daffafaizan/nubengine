    
      An evaluation of efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by
      independent review and overall survival (OS), of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared with
      trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer who have received
      at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting, or in case of
      having received (neo)adjuvant pertuzumab, at least 1 prior line of anti-HER2 directed therapy
      in the metastatic setting, and who have received at least one, and no more than three, lines
      of therapy overall in the metastatic setting. A non-randomized sub-study cohort of
      approximately 88 patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of a reduced margetuximab
      infusion rate in patients receiving margetuximab either as monotherapy or in combination with
      chemotherapy.
