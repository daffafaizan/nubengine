      were recruited for IM21 CAR-T cell single transfusion therapy. The safety and tolerability of
      the treatment were evaluated, and the curative effect was initially observed. The research
      plan includes five stages: screening stage, cell collection stage, chemotherapy pretreatment
      stage, infusion stage and follow-up stage.
