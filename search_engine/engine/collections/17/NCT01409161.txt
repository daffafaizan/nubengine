      I. Assess whether a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA [tretinoin]), and arsenic
      trioxide (ATO) can produce long-term event-free survival in patients with low-risk untreated
      acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

      II. Assess whether administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) at the diagnosis in patients
      with high-risk APL (white blood cell [WBC] > 10,000) and if the WBC rises to > 10,000 after
      start of treatment (in patients with low-risk disease) will improve complete response (CR)
      rate without increasing toxicity in high-risk untreated APL.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive tretinoin orally (PO) twice daily (BID), arsenic trioxide
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours daily, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours once at
      weeks 1-4.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR receive arsenic trioxide IV 5 days per week during weeks
      1-4, 9-12, 17-20, and 25-28 and tretinoin PO BID for 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
