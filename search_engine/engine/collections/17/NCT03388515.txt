    
      Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To assess the safety, tolerability of single dose SSS11 in healthy subjects

      Secondary:

      • To assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of SSS-11 in healthy
      subjects

      Enrollment and Number of Arms (planned):

      40 subjects will be assigned into 5 dosing cohorts (1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24mg) with 5-10
      subjects each.

      Original primary outcome Measures:

      Safety: Physical exam，ECG，Clinical laboratory tests，AE，SAE Tolerance assessment：MDT，DLT

      Original secondary outcome Measures:

      pharmacokinetics: Cmax, Tmax, AUC, CL, Vd, t1/2 pharmacodynamics: level of serum uric acid
      Immunogenicity ：anti-SSS11, anti-uricase and anti-PEG antibodies
