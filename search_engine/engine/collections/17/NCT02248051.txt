      CKI. At total of 12 subjects will be enrolled into two equal groups according to their
      baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: 15 - 39 or 40 - 59 mL/min/1.73m2). All
      subjects will receive a single dose infusion of CXA-10 emulsion. Since this is the first
      administration of CXA-10 to a non-healthy volunteer population, a conservative approach is
      being taken to ensure safety. Thus, the first 2 subjects from each group will be dosed at one
      dose level below the highest safe dose level administered in the FIH study. If this dose is
      found to be safe in this specific subject population, the remainder of the 4 subjects in each
      group will receive the highest safe dose from the FIH study; otherwise, the remainder will
      receive the initial dose. The doses administered in this study will not exceed the highest
      exposures achieved in the FIH study, and doses may need to be adjusted to lower levels, based
      on further evaluation of current pharmacokinetic data, to ensure the appropriate the exposure
      level. Safety, PK and PD assessments will be conducted over approximately 18 days following
      each dosing session. There will be a follow-up visit approximately 1 week after dosing.
