      this life-altering disease becomes far ranging. Cinnamon is purported to be a natural insulin
      sensitizer without any known adverse events. Both in vitro and in vivo animal studies have
      shown that cinnamon is an insulin sensitizer1. Several compounds within cinnamon have been
      identified as possible sources of this sensitization process.

      To-date, three small randomized trials studying cinnamon in human diabetics have been
      published. Khan et al. reported that fasting serum glucose could be reduced by 18-29% after
      40 days of supplementation with 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) in type 2
      diabetics. 2 This study had several limitations that included failure to measure hemoglobin
      A1C, all patients were Pakistani, and no power analysis was documented. Vanschoonbeek, et
      al.3 report a small RCT of postmenopausal women with well-controlled type 2 diabetes which
      showed no change in HbA1C or fasting glucose. Once again no power analysis is reported. Mang
      et al. 4 conducted a RCT of type 2 diabetics treated with aqueous extract of cinnamon for 4
      months. They report a 15% decrease in fasting glucose and no change in HbA1C over the
      duration of this trial. Subjects had HbA1C less than 7% and again no power analysis was
      included in this study.

      This study will address whether cinnamon at the dose of 1g daily in addition to usual care
      lowers hemoglobin A1c compared to usual care. Power analysis indicates that 63 per group are
      needed and we will recruit 70 patients.
