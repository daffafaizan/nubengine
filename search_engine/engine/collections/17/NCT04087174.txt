      allows an exploration of different doses with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients.

      include any optional dose expansion cohorts based on Safety Review Committee (SRC) review of
      data from Part A of this study.

      The study will include up to approximately 87 evaluable patients, divided among the 4 study
      parts as follows:

      Part A1: Up to approximately 36 patients (up to four dose levels with up to approximately 9
      patients per dose level).

      Part B1: Up to approximately 12 patients. Part A2: Up to approximately 27 patients (up to
      three dose levels with up to approximately 9 patients per dose level). Part B2: Up to
