      bone loss, decreased libido and effects on mood. Androgen replacement in this context is
      clearly beneficial, and numerous studies have demonstrated improvements in bone and muscle
      mass, reductions in body fat and improvement in insulin sensitivity, libido and mood
      following treatment. Testosterone replacement leads to a dose-dependent decrease in adipose
      tissue and increase in muscle mass and strength. The principal focus of the proposed research
      is to evaluate the effect of androgel on lean body mass and regional adipose tissue mass
      (including hepatic and visceral fat) in type 2 diabetic patients with hypogonadism, a
      population that is likely to benefit from a reduction in adipose tissue and an increase in
      muscle mass.
