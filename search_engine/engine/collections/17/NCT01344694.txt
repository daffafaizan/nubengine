      liver, a condition carrying a high risk of cardiovascular disease. The independent role of
      epicardial fat deposition in cardiovascular risk remains unclear. Aim: Evaluate the link
      between epicardial fat, visceral fat, liver fat accumulation and cardiovascular diseases and
      carotis atherosclerosis in patients with the major cardiovascular risk factors and with or
      without metabolic syndrome.
