      exercise capacities (VO2 peak, peak workload, ventilatory threshold), after an acute coronary
      event, was significantly reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover ,we showed, in
      multivariate analysis, that the worse improvement of the capacities to the effort after
      cardiac rehabilitation, was mainly related to hyperglycemia.

      Because the improvement of exercise capacities after cardiac rehabilitation (in particular
      VO2 peak) has been shown to be an essential factor to reduce short- term and long-term
      morbidity and mortality, we may think that such benefit on reduction of morbidity and
      mortality may be significantly less in patients with diabetes.

      Thus, we propose to carry out a multicentric intervention study, entitled DARE which goal is
      to see whether a strict glycemic control, during cardiac rehabilitation following an acute
      Myocardial Infarction (MI), is likely to improve, the results of cardiac rehabilitation on
      exercise capacities in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      After arrival in cardiac rehabilitation, patients with diabetes, will be randomized into 2
      groups: an "intensive treatment" group, in which the patients will treated by insulin under a
      basal-bolus regimen with strict glycemic control and a "conventional treatment" group, in
      which the previous anti-diabetic treatment will be continued.
