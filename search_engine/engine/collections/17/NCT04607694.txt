    
      DAHANCA 35 is two parallel conducted, but separate randomized studies, within the same trial
      (DAHANCA 35D and DAHANCA 35X) by the Danish Head-Neck Cancer Study Group (DAHANCA). In
      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx or larynx planned for primary
      radiotherapy a proton and a photon doseplan is prepared. If proton radiotherapy reduces the
      anticipated absolute risk of dysphagia >= grade 2 (DAHANCA scale, DAHANCA 35D) or severe
      xerostomia >= grade 4 (EORTC Head-Neck 35, DAHANCA 35X) more than 5%, the patient is
      randomised to either proton therapy or photon therapy, 2:1. The anticipated risk of
      xerostomia and dysphagia is estimated using Normal-Tissue Complication Models (NTCP). Patient
      are analysed according to the primary endpoint (dysphagia and/or xerostomia) after which they
      were enrolled. DAHANCA 35D is expected to enroll 360 patients and DAHANCA 35X 240 patients
      (in total 600 patients).
