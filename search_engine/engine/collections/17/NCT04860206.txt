      have very serious consequences for a person's general health even after COVID -19 symptoms
      have subsided. To date, the effects of COVID -19 on individual muscle status have not been
      extensively studied. Therefore, the main objective of this study will be to evaluate the
      muscle status of patients after COVID -19. In addition, we will be interested in longitudinal
      monitoring of individuals' rehabilitation, where they will receive instructions based on
      measured outcomes at hospital discharge. We will also be interested in considering additional
      preventive measures for future patients based on previous experience of infected and
      hospitalized COVID -19 patients.
