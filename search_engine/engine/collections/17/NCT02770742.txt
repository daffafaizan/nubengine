    
      This is a prospective, observational study of consecutive patients presenting for outpatient
      colonoscopy in a tertiary care hospital with a large ambulatory care section (DKD Helios
      Klinik Wiesbaden). The primary endpoint of the study is the comparison of a validated patient
      satisfaction score in patients undergoing colonoscopy with or without sedation. The aim is to
      assess whether patients, who are deemed appropriate for an unsedated procedure by predefined
      risk factors and who wish to avoid sedation, will have similar satisfaction scores, as those
      who undergo sedation. As secondary aims, pain scores (validated NAPCOMS score) and markers of
      procedural quality (such as completion rates or withdrawal times) will be assessed.

      Considering a 2-point difference in the 15-point satisfaction score as clinically relevant
      and suspecting a 7:3 distribution of procedures with and without sedation, respectively, 1070
      patients must be included (at least 749 sedated and 321 unsedated) in order to reach a
      significance level of 0.05.
