      development of asthma. This study utilizes the neurotransmitter, substance P, a small
      molecule which is present in nerve endings, the brain, skin, lungs and the gastrointestinal
      tract. Subjects will receive substance P and a low dosage of an allergen, such as ragweed in
      an attempt to reduce allergic reactivity.
