      per 100,000 population each year. For survivors of the initial hemorrhage, delayed narrowing
      of the blood vessels (vasospasm) and related delayed strokes are the most common serious
      complication. Narrowing of blood vessels affect 30% of patients with such bleeding. Despite
      maximum therapy, nearly 50% of patients with symptomatic vasospasm with develop stroke.
      Because cerebral vasospasm remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after aSAH,
      this critically important issue needs further studies.

      One hundred and fifty patients will be randomized, 50 to each arm of the study. Patients
      enrolled in the study will be receive the drug (either Simvastatin 40 mg or Simvastatin 80 mg
      per mouth daily), while the control group will receive a sugar tablet. The treatment will be
      continued for a total of 21 days. The neurological abilities (Stroke Outcome measures, these
      are included with the application for your review) at day 21 post aSAH will be reviewed at
      time of discharge as well at 6 months of follow up.
