    
      - 2 groups of 5 HV will receive tDCS or tsDCS (2mA, anodal, 20min) and the thermonociceptive
      threshold will be measured before and after the stimulation over the abdomen (hypogastric).
      The HAD scale and SF-36 will also be tested.

      The treatment(s) that produces the greatest increase in pain thresholds will be chosen to
      treat 10 patients.

      - 10 patients suffering from endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain will be treated by the
      most efficient treatment (tDCS or tsDCS) for 4 weeks (5 daily 20-min sessions per week), or,
      if no treatment modality was superior in HV, 5 patients will be treated by tDCS and 5 by
      tsDCS. Patients will fill in daily a dedicated diary 2 weeks before treatment, during
      the4-week treatment period and after this period as long as their pain level remains below
      80% of their baseline pain intensity (VAS). Analgesic intake will also be monitored as well
      as HAD and SF-36 scores.
