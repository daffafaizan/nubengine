      brain injury (mTBI) with persistent cognitive, emotional, and neurological postconcussive
      symptoms. There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments to reduce both the
      intensity of these Veterans' current symptoms as well as their potential long-term risks for
      developing neurodegenerative dementing disorders related to repetitive mTBI: chronic
      traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence suggests
      that statins may possess neuroprotective effects against pathologic processes related to tau
      protein metabolism that appear to be a common feature of CTE, AD, and other neurodegenerative
      sequelae of repetitive mTBI.

      The investigators propose a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, active-drug-controlled trial
      to establish proof-of-concept for use of simvastatin (40 mg/d) for decreasing CSF biomarkers
      of neurodegeneration and increasing CSF neurotrophins in 120 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
      with repetitive blast trauma mTBI.
