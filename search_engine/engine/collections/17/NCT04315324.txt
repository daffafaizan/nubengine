      I. To assess the response rate (complete remission [CR] or CR with incomplete count recovery
      [CRi]) of AKR1C3-activated prodrug OBI-3424 (OBI-3424) in patients with relapsed/refractory
      T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of OBI-3424 in this patient
      population.

      II. To estimate event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival
      (OS) in this patient population.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity (among patients who
      achieve CR or CRi).

      II. To bank specimens for future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive AKR1C3-activated prodrug OBI-3424 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 1 year, every 2
      months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from
      registration.
