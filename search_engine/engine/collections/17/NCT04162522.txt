    
      This is a multi-site study to replicate a previous multi-site, multi-platform study completed
      by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). This study aims to
      validate the integrated array of markers of response and non-response to first line
      antidepressant treatments that were previously identified in the original aforementioned
      study. This will be accomplished through collection of clinical, neurophysiological, and
      molecular measures. This is not a study to evaluate efficacy of medications; medications in
      this study have been approved by Health Canada and are widely used for the treatment of MDD.

      In this study, individuals diagnosed with MDD in a current major depressive episode (MDE)
      will be treated with open-label escitalopram for 8 weeks. At week 8, participants will be
      assessed for treatment response (defined as a â‰¥50% reduction in Montgomery Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale score). Responders will continue on escitalopram for 8 more weeks.
      Non-responders will be given add-on brexpiprazole treatment, in addition to escitalopram, for
      8 weeks.

      Over the 16 weeks, pariticipants will attend 7 clinical visits where they will complete
      clinical assessments (clinician administered and self-report) and cognitive tests; provide
      blood, urine, and stool samples; undergo neuroimaging procedures (MRI and EEG); and provide
      speech samples. At the end of the study, modeling methods will be used to integrate data from
      these measures to determine the features that best predict treatment outcome.
