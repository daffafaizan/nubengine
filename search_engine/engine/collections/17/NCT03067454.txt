      divided into two groups (operative and conservative treatment with early mobilisation). The
      operative group is treated with internal fixation and 2 weeks in a cast. The conservative
      group is instructed to do a fist to correct any malrotation and to rehabilitate quickly. By
      this procedure shortening oft he metacarpalfractures is limited by the function of the deep
      transverse metacarpal ligament connecting the distal parts of the metacarpalbones II-V.
      Furthermore the participants in the conservative group are allowed to use their hands without
      any restrictions. A physiotherapist controls that early mobilisation is carried out.

      The participant will be seen for a follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 weeks and 1 year. Radiographs
      will be performed at 1v, 6v and 1 year. The finger ranges of motion and pain will be
      evaluated with every follow-up, DASH score, range of motion, pain and grip-strength will be
      measured after 12v and 1 year. The investigators will measure return to driving, work and
      sport.

      Complications will be registered continuously for all patients. The overall satisfaction of
      the patients and the costs for both treatments will be documented as well.

      The study population is planned to be 21 patients in each group.
