      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine when administered with
      busulfan and clofarabine.

      II. To estimate the day 100 treatment-related mortality (TRM) for the preparative regimen
      busulfan, clofarabine, and gemcitabine followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of progression-free survival (PFS), graft versus host disease
      (GVHD), engraftment, and overall survival (OS) for this treatment regimen at one year post
      treatment completion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine.

      Participants receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 10-25 minutes on days -6 and -4,
      clofarabine IV over 1 hour and busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -3. Participants with
      matched unrelated donors also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on days -3 to
      -1. Starting day -2, participants receive tacrolimus orally (PO) daily for up to 6 months.
      Participants undergo hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplant on day 0, then receive
      methotrexate IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 3, 6 and 11, and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC)
      once daily (QD) beginning 1 week after transplant until blood cell levels return to normal.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months, then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
