      Based on estimations using a published RCT, effect sizes measured by Cohen's d ranged from
      0.64 to 1.45 across outcome variables (i.e., 0.64 for physical function; 0.73-0.99 for
      physical activity; and 1.19 and1.45 for systolic and diastolic BP with 80% power, α=0.05).
      With a final sample of 80 subjects (40 per group) we will have 80% power to detect an effect
      size as small as 0.64 (α=0.05, two-tailed) from independent sample t-test for measures of
      physical function, physical activity and hypertension onset/control. Recruiting and
      randomizing 112 individuals (56 in LTGO & 56 in EUC) will allow for up to 30% attrition.
      Participants will be randomized to LTGO or EUC (1:1). The biostatistician will randomize
      participants using a blocked randomization scheme, stratified by sex (male vs. female) and
      length of hospital stay (≤2 wks vs.>2 wks). The block size (2 or 4) will be randomly selected
      to prevent prediction of group assignment. An "intention-to-treat" (ITT) approach will be
      used. All subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomly assigned,
      regardless of adherence to the protocol, treatment received, and/or withdrawal from the
      protocol. Endorsed by international regulatory guidelines, the ITT approach is widely used in
      RCT because it minimizes the potential for the introduction of biases into data analysis and
      maintains prognostic balance generated from original random treatment allocation. Although
      the ITT approach is recommended for efficacy analysis in RCTs, the sensitivity of the results
      assumes that ITT will be explored using information collected regarding fidelity and dosage
      (e.g., number of sessions completed).
