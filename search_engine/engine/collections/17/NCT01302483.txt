      parallel-group study was to determine if Kovacaine Mist provided anesthesia of the maxillary
      teeth sufficient for the performance of dental procedures. Secondary objectives included a
      determination of whether Kovacaine Mist provided anesthesia of the soft tissue and to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Kovacaine Mist and sham injection as compared to sham
      nasal spray and 2% lidocaine hydrochloride with 1:100,000 epinephrine submucosal injection
      and as determined by changes in vital signs and reports of side effects and adverse events.
