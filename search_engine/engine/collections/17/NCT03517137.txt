      BV-based therapy for advanced HL. All patients will receive one cycle of BrAVD followed by an
      FDG-PET/CT. Patients with a negative early FDG-PET(Deauville score 1-3) will continue with
      five more BrAVD cycles (total six cycles) while patients with a positive FDG-PET should shift
      to six cycles of BrECADD.

      The hypothesis is that the efficacy will be comparable to the efficacy of BEACOPPesc and
      BrECADD, while using the intensive chemotherapy regimen only for those patients who do not
      achieve a negative FDG-PET after one cycle.

      The choice to assess the treatment sensitivity by PET after a single cycle of BrAVD is based
      on results from a recent international multicenter study comparing FDG-PET/CT after one and
      two cycles of ABVD chemotherapy in HL. There is no reason to suspect that FDG-PET1 should be
      less prognostic after BrAVD than after ABVD.

      With this trial, the investigators believe they can add important information about the
      optimal treatment of BV-containing first-line treatment for advanced HL, and thus answer
      important therapeutic questions that are likely to otherwise remain unanswered even after the
      Echelon-1 and HD21 trials reach mature results. This relatively large single-arm phase II
      trial of 150 patients will allow a meaningful comparison with the BrAVD and BrECADD regimens
      based on modified progression-free survival (primary endpoint) and progression-free survival
      (secondary endpoint) respectively.
