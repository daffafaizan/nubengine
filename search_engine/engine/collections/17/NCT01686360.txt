      information about the risks and benefits of mammography screening. The purpose of this study
      is to understand how objective risk information influences outcomes including behavioral
      intentions, attitudes about mammography, and emotional responses.

      After participants view objective risk information, a post-test survey will measure outcome
      variables including behavioral intentions, knowledge, and emotional responses.

      After reading information based on their condition, study participants will be asked to
      complete a series of questions to measure their reactions based on their condition.
      Specifically, the investigators will be measuring the following dependent variables (primary
      outcomes): behavioral intentions to receive mammograms, attitudes about mammography,
      subjective norms about mammography and breast cancer screening, knowledge about mammography
      outcomes and screening recommendations, and emotional responses to the material including
      psychological reactance. These outcomes will be measured using self-reported questionnaire
      items.

      In this project, the investigators will compare alternative communication strategies to
      determine which strategy or strategies result in the greatest level of understanding. The
      investigators also will examine if the various strategies differentially affect the primary
      outcomes listed above.
