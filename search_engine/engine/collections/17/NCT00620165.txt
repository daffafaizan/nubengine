      relatively low efficacy and intolerable side effects. Recent evidence indicates that
      levetiracetam (LEV) may modulate the dopaminergic system. In this regard LEV has been shown
      to reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, tardive dyskinesia and myoclonus, and is relatively
      well-tolerated in the elderly. Previous studies examined the efficacy of LEV for the
      treatment of essential tremor. However, these were either open label or relatively short
      duration studies. A longer term study of LEV for the treatment of essential tremor is
      therefore warranted. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study,
      ten subjects with essential tremor will be randomly assigned to receive either LEV up to a
      maximum dose of 3000 milligrams (mg) per day or placebo. Study drug will be titrated up over
      6 weeks and continued at 1500 mg twice daily for an additional 6 weeks. Following a 4 week
      washout period subjects will cross over to the other arm and continued for an additional 12
      weeks. Subjects will be evaluated monthly by a blinded examining neurologist and research
      coordinator. At each study visit subjects will receive a neurological examination and will be
      evaluated using a 16-item scale for tremor and medication side effects. The data derived from
      study drug vs. placebo groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon W tests.
