      uterine fibroid. The investigators used in the past for the treatment of other benign
      gynecological diseases such as endometriosis and adenomyosis a combined therapy with
      Aromatase inhibitor plus GnRH analog. The investigators also used this combined treatment in
      selected cases of symptomatic uterine fibroids. With this study the investigators want

      disappearance other than a fast and long lasting reduction of uterine and fibroid volume. For
      these reasons the investigators set this controlled trial between Ulipristal acetate

      Goserelin plus 1.0mg day of Anastrazole for 3 months) and after the treatment patients will
