    
      The study is designed as a 2-part study:

      Part 1 is designed as single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study investigating 5 dose
      levels. Each cohort will consist of participants (N=8) to be randomly assigned to receive a
      blinded oral dose of CB-0406 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Dose levels of CB-0406 in the sequential
      cohorts will be 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg or 1000 mg to be administered once on each
      cohorts study Day 1.

      Part 2 is designed as multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study investigating up to 5
      dose levels as determined by the SAD cohort. Doses will be determined following completion
      and review of the safety and PK findings for Cohorts 1 to Cohort 5 in Part 1.
