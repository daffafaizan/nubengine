      blind, placebo controlled study of daily PROSCARÂ® or placebo for 6 months in men with an
      initial negative prostate biopsy.

      5.1.1. Biopsy The TRUS guided biopsy, to be carried out at Visit 4, will be performed by one
      physician. The biopsy will be performed as per the standard protocol at UHN, including 13-15
      cores. The physician performing the biopsy will be blinded to the initial biopsy results and
      the PSA change over time. Before biopsy, a DRE will be performed. Aside from the standard
      biopsy scheme, suspicious areas on TRUS can be further biopsied. (e.g. a hypoechoic nodule).

      5.2. Methods for Accrual and Randomization: Patients with an initial negative prostate biopsy
      that was performed at UHN and seen at the Prostate Center of the Princess Margaret Hospital
      will be considered for enrolment. Randomization by a random numbers table will be performed
      in blocks of 4 patients. After patients are deemed eligible for the study, the central office
      at Merck will be contacted and patient assignment given. The code will match the study drug
      label and the drug shipment will contain a blinded allocation envelope. The investigators,
      study participants and research coordinators will be blinded to the intervention.
