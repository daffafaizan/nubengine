      exam performed on blunt and penetrating trauma patients who are too critically injured to be
      transported to a CT scanner. In performing this exam, time to acquisition of adequate images
      is crucial to clinical decision-making as patients undergoing this exam have a high
      probability of deteriorating if not intervened on appropriately.

      Low-frequency ultrasound is used to image the abdominal cavity and pericardium in these
      patients, using either a curvilinear transducer or a phased-array transducer. Both of these
      transducers are capable of acquiring the images necessary to interpret a FAST exam, but it
      has not been well studied whether using one transducer instead of the other improves time to
      image acquisition or image quality.

      In this study, physician ultrasound operators are asked to perform FAST exams on healthy
      non-injured volunteers for the purpose of determining if there is a difference in the time to
      acquisition or quality of images between phased-array and curvilinear transducers.
