      etc., patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the
      toilet. For lack of a better solution for urinary management, indwelling catheter and diaper
      use is common in hospitalized patients. There is no externally applied urine collection
      device on the market today for women. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often
      placed to relieve patients while they are incapacitated, despite lack of urinary retention.
      Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with discomfort, pain, and urinary
      tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may be used. These may be
      associated with skin irritation and infection.

      The study will evaluate the UriCap-F, non-invasive urine collection devices for women, in
      hospitalized patients who are able to void or who are incontinent of urine
