      their derivatives have the function of slowing the neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress and
      apoptotic cell death anti-inflammatory properties. Also, they have antithrombotic effects,
      being related to prevent disease. Studies show that supplementation with omega-3 has a
      positive impact on several outcomes like cardiovascular disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis
      and Alzehimer. Objective: Evaluate the relationship between supplementation of omega-3 in the
      dynamics of the fetal ductus arteriosus in the third trimester. Methodology: randomized
      double blind clinical trial. Women with gestational age between 28 to 32 weeks, literate,
      over 18 years will be invited. Pregnant women with anti-inflammatory drugs, they have a
      higher intake of dietary polyphenols to 127mg / day or using drugs that may interfere with
      the absorption of omega-3 are excluded. The selected women will be randomized to receive
      capsules of omega-3 or placebo, to be consumed daily for 3 weeks. In the first interview, and
      after 3 weeks, they will respond the Questionnaire Food Frequency (QFF) to quantify
      polyphenols and omega 3 in their diet, weight and height will be measured and the examination
      of fetal echocardiography is performed.
