      applied to Mersin University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Chest Diseases Clinic between
      01.10.2019-01.04.2020 will be taken. 35 healthy volunteers who were admitted to our clinic
      within the same date range will be taken as control group. Impulse oscillometric pulmonary
      function tests will be performed to all participants. Thorax computed tomography will be
      performed to evaluate small airway dysfunction. To evaluate the degree of disease
      inflammation and phenotype in asthma patients, nitric oxide measurements will be made in the
      breath air with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) device. The blood eosinophil level
      will be studied to determine the asthma phenotype.Asthma control test (ACT) will be applied
      to measure symptom control in patients with asthma. Asthma quality of life scale (AQLQ) will
      be applied to determine the quality of life in asthmatic patients. All patients will be
      followed for 1 year to record the number of exacerbations requiring emergency and hospital
      admissions for asthma. The effect of small airway dysfunction on asthma group, on the disease
      severity and control degree, disease phenotypes and quality of life, and the effect on the
      risk of exacerbation will be analyzed.
