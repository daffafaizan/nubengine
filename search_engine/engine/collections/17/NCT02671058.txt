      in healthy adult subjects at a single study center. Screening evaluations will occur from Day
      28 to Day 2 and subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day 1 to
      Day 2 for each treatment period. The treatment periods will be separated by at least a 7 day
      washout period. Subjects meeting the study enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to 1
      of 2 sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 and will receive either the
      reference product (A) or the treatment product (B) once during the study
