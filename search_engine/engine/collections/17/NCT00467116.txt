        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride when administered with
           cetuximab and radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic or
           periampullary region cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly in weeks 1-7 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 15-40 minutes once weekly in weeks 2-7. Patients also undergo
      radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 2-7. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
