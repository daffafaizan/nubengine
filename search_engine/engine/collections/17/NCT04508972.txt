      All individuals entering the Heart Failure (HF) Clinic of the McGill University Health Center
      will be asked to participate. A poster with instructions to ask the participants (employees
      or patients) to speak with the Amazon Alexa device. The participant will remain 6 feet away
      from the device. The Amazon Alexa will ask the survey questions. A study coordinator will
      then ask the same questions along with some additional questions about Amazon Alexa
      usability. We will study the correlation between the Alexa response and the response to the
      study coordinator using K-squared statistic tests.
