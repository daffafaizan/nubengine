    
      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, single-dose, adaptive design with a single interim analysis for unblinded sample size
      re-estimation. Because AIS (acute ischemic stroke) is a medical emergency, the trial is
      designed to enable the administration of standard-of-care treatments without delay in order
      to save the life of the person concerned, restore good health or alleviate suffering.

      Participants harboring an acute ischemic stroke who are selected for endovascular
      revascularization without intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy will be given a
      single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of nerinetide or placebo.
      Outcomes of the main trial will be evaluated throughout a 90 day observation period.

      Participants will be followed at 1-Year for the analytic sub-trial for further outcome
      assessment by telemedicine or telephone interview conducted by individuals blinded to the
      outcome of the main trial. This sub-trial will be conducted to explore the independent
      functioning and quality of life at 1-Year.
