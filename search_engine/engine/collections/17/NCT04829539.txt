      I. Determine the efficacy of BBT-CI compared to HEAL as measured by the patient report
      outcome (PRO) of insomnia (i.e., the Insomnia Severity Index) at post-intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the efficacy of BBT-CI compared to HEAL on sleep efficiency as measured via
      actigraphy at post intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (BBT-CI): Patients complete face to face/video sessions with a trained staff member
      over 60 minutes each on day 0 and day 14 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are separated by 1
      or 2 weeks) or day 21 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are separated by 3 weeks). Patients
      also complete phone sessions over 15 minutes each on day 7, day 14 (if patient's chemotherapy
      cycles are separated by 1 or 2 weeks) or day 21 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are
      separated by 3 weeks), and days 28 and 35.

      GROUP II (HEAL): Patients complete face to face/video sessions with a trained staff member
      over 60 minutes each on day 0 and day 14 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are separated by 1
      or 2 weeks) or day 21 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are separated by 3 weeks). Patients
      also complete phone sessions over 15 minutes each on day 7, day 14 (if patient's chemotherapy
      cycles are separated by 1 or 2 weeks) or day 21 (if patient's chemotherapy cycles are
      separated by 3 weeks), and days 28 and 35.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 6 months.
