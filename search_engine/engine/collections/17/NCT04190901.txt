      physicians based on their race or gender. The investigators estimated the effects of
      physician race and gender using an online clinical vignette. Participants played the role of
      analog patients reporting to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms consistent with
      gastroenteritis. Participants were provided with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis by a
      simulated ED physician. The race (black or white) and gender (male or female) of the
      simulated physician was randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial experiment. Simulated physicians
      provided a diagnosis of gastroenteritis and contradicted by an Online Symptom Checker.
      Following the physician's diagnosis and contradiction by the Online Symptom Checker,
      participants rated the simulated physician on survey measures of satisfaction and confidence
      in both the treatment plan and diagnosis. The main (null) hypothesis tested was that there
      were no differences across the four treatment arms (Black Female, Black Male, White Female,
      White Male). Participants for the first experiment (Study 1) were recruited from Amazon
      Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and participants for the second experiment (Study 2) were recruited
      from Lucid.

      Primary Aim: To determine whether the race and gender of a simulated physician had a causal
      effect on participants' confidence and satisfaction in the physician's diagnosis and
      treatment plan in an ED setting.

      Exploratory Aims: To determine whether the race and gender of a simulated physician had a
      casual effect on participants' perceptions of the warmth and competence of the physician,
      their willingness to sue or complain about the physician for an incorrect diagnosis, and
      their perceived fairness of the charge for the visit.
