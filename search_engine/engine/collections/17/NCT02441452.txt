      surgical recovery can be accelerated and convalescence decreased. These multimodal approaches
      focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing morbidity by reduction of surgical stress,minimal
      invasive surgery, optimized pain relief, early nutrition and ambulation.

      In postoperative, the bed rest leads to the increase in muscle loss and weakness, impairs
      pulmonary function, predisposes to venous stasis and thromboembolism, increases infection
      complications and reduces functional capacity even in patients who are not restricted to bed.

      However, few studies have focused on when start the mobilization and which effects on
      functional capacity of exercise and lung function during hospital stay.

      In this trial the investigators will consider early rehabilitation to be safe and feasible in
      Nuss procedure.
