      (Group V), a 0+1 schedule of PCV13 at 12 months of age (Group W), a 1+1 schedule of PCV10 at
      2 and 12 months of age (Group X), and a 1+1 schedule of PCV13 at 2 and 12 months of age
      (Group Y); along with a control group that receives a dose of PCV10 at 24 months of age
      (Group Z). Additionally, all participants will receive four doses of Infanrix-hexa at 2, 3, 4
      and 18 months of age.
