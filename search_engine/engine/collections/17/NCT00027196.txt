      that demonstrate both allelic and non-allelic genetic heterogeneity. We propose to perform
      genetic studies to determine novel molecular causes of FC and to describe their clinical
      correlates. This will permit: (1) pre-symptomatic diagnosis; (2) definition of cardiac
      phenotype, disease penetrance; (3) natural history; (4) study of abnormal physiology that is
      a consequence of the molecular defect; (5) elucidation of specific mechanisms of arrythmias
      and sudden death; and (6) demonstration and characterization of skeletal muscle involvement.
