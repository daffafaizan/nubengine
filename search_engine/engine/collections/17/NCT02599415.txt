      were referred by their dermatologist to receive narrow-band UVB (TL01) light treatment. Two 6
      mm lesional skin punch biopsies were taken at baseline and 2 weeks after commencing the light
      treatment to study the effect of light on innate immune cells involved in psoriasis
      pathogenesis.
