    
      Participation in this genetics study requires participants to answer some questions online,
      about eating behaviors (about 15-30 minutes) and to provide a single blood sample that should
      take only a few minutes.

      To obtain the blood sample, investigators will mail you a kit which participants would take
      to their primary care provider or your local laboratory to have them draw a small sample of
      blood (about 40 mL, which is less than three tablespoons). The study is also working with a
      mobile phlebotomy company that can come to your home or location of your choice to draw your
      blood and ship it at no cost to you. Once the sample is drawn, participants or the mobile
      phlebotomist will place it in a box and contact FedEx for pick up. There is no cost for the
      FedEx shipment. Participants will also fill out the reimbursement form and send it and the
      receipt to our office. Investigators will reimburse participants for the cost of the blood
      draw. The samples will be studied directly or reprogrammed prior to further study.
