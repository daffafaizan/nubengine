    
      Demonstrate equivalent efficacy of GP2015 and EU-authorized Enbrel in patients with moderate
      to severe, active (RA) who had an inadequate response to disease modifying anti-rheumatic
      drugs (DMARD) including methotrexate (MTX). In addition, data on the safety profiles of both
      products, including immunogenicity and local tolerability at the injection sites, will be
      collected and compared.

      An additional study objective is to identify any potential risk of the transition from Enbrel
      to GP2015 in terms of general safety and immunogenicity in RA patients
