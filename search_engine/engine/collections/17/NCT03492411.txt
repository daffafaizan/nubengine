      and their co-parents. Couples will be randomized to study groups and the intervention group
      will receive information about this resource with an online demonstration and weekly emails
      for 6 weeks reminding them about the resource. The control group will receive usual care and
      6 weekly emails reminding them that they are in the study. The primary outcomes will be
      exclusive breastfeeding at 4 and 24 weeks postpartum. Additional outcomes will include:
      breastfeeding initiation, duration, challenges, attitude, knowledge, confidence, anxiety,
      partners support and co-parenting.
