      included in the patient's group and 37 healthy volunteers in the control group. All
      participants were selected from the geriatric population. Demographic and cardiopulmonary
      physiotherapy assessment of all participants were performed. Lung function test, maximal
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure and pectoralis muscle strength were measured in
      participants of both groups. All measurements were performed once.
