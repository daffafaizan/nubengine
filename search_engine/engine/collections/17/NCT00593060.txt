           given with temsirolimus, groups of 3 participants will be treated at gradually
           increasing doses of cetuximab. Each group of 3 participants must complete 4 weeks (1
           cycle) of treatment before the following group of 3 participants can start treatment at
           the higher dose.

        -  Cetuximab is administered intravenously 7 days before the treatment cycle begins.
           Participants will receive a cetuximab infusion every week of the treatment cycle (days
           1, 8, 15, 22) along with temsirolimus. Temsirolimus is also given intravenously.

        -  As a precaution, participants will be pre-medicated with Benadryl/diphenhydramine to
           help prevent an allergic reaction.

        -  During the study participants will have weekly clinical visits. Each clinic visit will
           last approximately 2-3 hours. During the clinic visit, the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: Physical exam; vital signs; and blood tests. A CT scan
           will be performed after every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be taken at various points during the study. For
           each PK sample, we will take about 1 teaspoon of blood. There will be a total of 22
           tubes of blood taken for the PK study.
