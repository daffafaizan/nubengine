      the data gather in its life cycle.(1) As per the definition of International society of
      harmonization and World Health Organization, adverse reaction is Adverse drug reaction (ADR)
      is defined as "A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses
      normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of
      physiological function." (2) Adverse reaction and adverse event are interchangeable use in
      pharmacovigilance sector by knowing the difference is that ADR term used when drug is causing
      the effect (1). The frequency of ADR is getting higher due to the increasing prevalence of
      chronic disease with the growing trend of combination drugs (3). The non-profitable
      organization of pharmacovigilance is playing tremendous role in disseminating the awareness
      of proper usage of drug globally.(3) According to Uppsala database statistics, approximately
      3 million reports were listed as suspected ADRs. (4) Nearly 6.7% of hospitalizations were due
      to serious ADRs (5)
