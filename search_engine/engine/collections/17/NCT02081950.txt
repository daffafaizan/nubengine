      administrations of 80 mg Clexane, on 2 different occasions, in 14 healthy adult subjects.

      The study comprised a Screening Visit and 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). Screening (Day -14
      to Day -1): Screening assessments were carried out within 14 days before administration of
      the first dose of Clexane. Eligible subjects were asked to return for Treatment Period 1.

      Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (Day 0 to Day 26): Eligible subjects received two doses of s.c.
      Clexane over 2 Treatment Periods (1 dose/period). Final confirmation of eligibility was made
      prior to dosing during Treatment Period 1. Confirmation of ongoing eligibility was made prior
      to dosing during Treatment Period 2.

      Each Treatment Period was of 2 days duration, from the afternoon before dosing (Day 0) until
      36 hours (h) post-dose (evening of Day 2). During each Treatment Period, subjects resided at
      the Clinical Unit. Study drug was administered on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight
      fast. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected pre-dose and up to 36 h post-dose (x14
      samples) for the measurement of enoxaparin. Safety was also evaluated at specified times
      throughout the study. There were at least 7 days between each dose administration. The
      Post-Study Follow-Up was conducted on Day 2 of Treatment Period 2 after completion of the 36
      h PK blood sampling and vital sign check.
