      antitumor activity; they have different mechanisms; no cross-resistance are documented
      between them, and there have been some preclinical evidences indicating synergistic effects
      between the two agents. This phase II study will be undertaken to evaluate combination of
      cisplatin and weekly abraxane in terms of efficacy and safety in MBC patients.
