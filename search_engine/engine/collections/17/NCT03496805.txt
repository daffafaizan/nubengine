    
      Primary Objective: To compare levels of fatigue in the MGE group compared to the placebo
      group at 6 months.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare levels of fatigue in the MGE group compared to the placebo group at 3, 9, and
           12 months.

        -  To compare quality of life in men in the MGE group compared to the placebo group.

        -  To compare physical function, physical fitness, and body composition in men in the MGE
           group compared to the placebo group.

        -  To compare time to PSA progression (from study entry) in men in the MGE group compared
           to the placebo group.

        -  To compare progression-free survival (from study entry) in men in the MGE group compared
           to the placebo group.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (Muscadine grape extract): Participants begin Androgen deprivation therapy prior to
      receiving muscadine grape extract and then receive muscadine grape extract orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (PLACEBO): Participants begin Androgen deprivation therapy prior to receiving
      placebo and then receive placebo PO BID for 12 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 72 hours and then for up
      to 12 months.
