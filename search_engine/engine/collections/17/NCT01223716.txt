      vision loss, resulting in reduced visual acuity and reduced sensitivity to contrast. Our
      previous findings (see CITATIONS) show that the adult amblyopic brain is still plastic and
      malleable, suggesting that active approach is potential useful in treating amblyopia. The
      goal of this project is to assess the limits and mechanisms of neural plasticity in amblyopic
      spatial vision. This study uses psychophysical measures to study neural plasticity in adults
      with amblyopia. Research participants will be asked to play video games with the amblyopic
      eye for a period of time. A range of visual functions will be monitored during the course of
      treatment.
