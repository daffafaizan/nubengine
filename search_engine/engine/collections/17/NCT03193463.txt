    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan in
           enhancing or nonenhancing bulk tumor administered by convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
           in patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma (HGG) who
           have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant
           chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of the rate and topotecan concentration, on
           the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with
           with recurrent/progressive HGG

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate the extent to which backflow may be observed on MRI during CEDmediated
           delivery of topotecan

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED
           using different doses and infusion rates.

        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
