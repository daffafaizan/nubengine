      effect of increased dietary sodium intake on changes in blood pressure, vascular function,
      microbiome, whole blood epigenome, whole blood and urine transcriptome as outcome measures.
      The study design will include a double-blind, cross-over treatment/placebo trial among 40
      former African Americans GENE-FORECAST participants with normal blood pressure and will last
      7weeks. It is hypothesized that exposure to increased dietary sodium will affect blood
      pressure, whole blood epigenome, whole blood and urine transcriptome, vascular function,
      microbiome and blood pressure.
