      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival, as well the overall survival and duration of
           remission in patients with previously untreated, advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia
           treated with fludarabine with versus without cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the incidence of side effects and quality of life of patients treated with these
           drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-3. In both
           arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study.
