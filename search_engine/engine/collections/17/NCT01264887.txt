    
      The prevalence of tumor-related pain is high and the treatment of chronic tumor-related pain
      remains a challenging therapeutic problem.

      Participants directly entering the KF5503/52 trial from the KF5503/15 trial (i.e., within 7
      days of Visit 8 of the KF5503/15 trial) is scheduled: a Transfer Visit, an Open-label
      Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period.

      For participants with a gap of more than 7 days and less than 24 weeks, between their full
      completion of the KF5503/15 trial and entry into the KF5503/52 trial the following is
      scheduled: an Enrollment Visit, an Entry Visit for assessment of eligibility, an Open-label
      Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period.

      This trial was designed to offer patients with chronic malignant tumor-related pain the
      option of continuing treatment by receiving tapentadol prolonged release (PR).

      The protocol scheduled visits every 28 days during the open-label treatment period.
      Unscheduled visits (or at least unscheduled telephone calls) were planned when dose
      adjustment is required. If a visit is not possible at the time of dose change, it could be
      done up to 7 days later. Unscheduled visits could also be performed whenever considered
      necessary (i.e., for evaluation of adverse events).
