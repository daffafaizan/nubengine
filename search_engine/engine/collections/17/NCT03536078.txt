      bilirubin. If levels are high phototherapy is needed to reduce the levels of bilirubin.
      Presently most children with neonatal jaundice in Sweden receives phototherapy admitted to
      hospital. There is fiberoptic equipment available that can be used at home to treat the
      newborns.

      Aim: Primary aim is to investigate if parent-child bonding is improved with home phototherapy
      compared to phototherapy performed at the hospital.

      Method:The study is designed as a randomised controlled multicenter study. Eligible parents
      and newborns are randomised to either treatment at home or at the hospital. Demographic data
      about the newborn such as for example apgar score, gender, time of birth etc are registered.
      At time of discharge parents answers questionnaires such as for example the Postpartum
      Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS), the Swedish
      Parenthood Stress Questionnaire etc. Parents experiences from home phototherapy will also be
      investigated through semistructured interviews.

      Parents will asked to answer questionnaires at the time of discharge as well as at 4-months
      after discharge.

      Analysis of data will be performed by using conventional parametric and non-parametric
      statistical methods.

      The results of the study will be reported as scientific articles and as part of a thesis.
