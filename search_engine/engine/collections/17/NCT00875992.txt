      Locking System (ASLS) in patients with distal tibial fractures treated with Expert Tibial
      Nails (ETN). In many cases, the existing locking bolts and screws in intramedullary nails do
      not provide sufficient stability. The play between screw and nail can result in loss of
      reduction and the instability due to the interfragmentary movement can result in malunions or
      nonunions. Therefore, an Angular Stable Locking System for Intramedullary Nails (ASLS) was
      developed to enhance axial and angular fracture stability. ASLS provides angular-stable
      fixation between nails and screws with resorbable sleeves used as dowels in the nail locking
      holes. Preliminary results of a pre-study show a trend towards reduced time to pain-free full
      weight bearing in patients being treated with ASLS. This hypothesis will be tested in the
      present randomized controlled study.
