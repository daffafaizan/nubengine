      A. Demonstrate the non-inferiority of image quality (as assessed by a Likert scale) obtained
      by ASIR-reconstruction-SPECT versus FBP-reconstruction (the lower-limit of non-inferiority is
      set at -0.5); B. Verify the non-inferiority of image quality (as measured by the signal /
      noise ratio)of CT images obtained by ASIR-reconstruction versus FBP-reconstruction (the
      lower-limit of non-inferiority is set at -0.2); C. Verify the non-inferiority of image
      quality (as assessed by the Likert scale) of CT images obtained by ASIR-reconstruction versus
      FBP-reconstruction (the lower limit of non-inferiority is set at -0.5); D. Check that the
      irradiation dose received by the patient is lower for the acquisition of images reconstructed
      with ASIR than for the acquisition of images reconstructed with FBP.

      E. Check the concordance of two evaluations of image quality (Likert scale) made by nuclear
      medicine physicians (blinded to each other).
