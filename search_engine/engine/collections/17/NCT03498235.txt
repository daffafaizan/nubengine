    
      Due to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of optic nerve sheath ,ONSD increases
      when ICP rises.

      Sevoflurane and propofol have different effects on ICP.When sevoflurane concentration >1.1
      minimum alveolar concentration（MAC),ICP increases because of cerebral vasodilatation；on the
      other hand ,propofol constricts the blood vessels and ICP decreases.

      ICP increases during laparoscopic gynecologic surgery because of steep Trendelenburg position
      and pneumoperitoneum .

      Meanwhile,sevoflurane affects self regulation of cerebral blood flow on the way of dose
      dependent,but propofol has no effects on self regulation of cerebral blood flow.
