    
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. Participants will be asked to wear a
      Medtronic iPro2 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) 1-2 weeks prior to starting on insulin pump
      therapy. Depending on randomization groups, participants will either have CGM data used
      inform starting insulin pump doses (treatment group), or to standard of care for starting on
      insulin pump (control group). Participants will wear the CGM again during the first 5 days of
      pump start and at approximately 6 weeks after pump start, in order to collect blood glucose
      data. Each time the CGM is worn, blood glucoses must be checked 6-8 times daily, and a
      written log must be completed. Baseline medical information also will be collected at the
      start of participation. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at
      approximately 6 weeks after pump start. Participation in the study will be complete after a
      standard of care follow up visit approximately 3 months after pump start.
