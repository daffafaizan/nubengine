      randomized clinical trial planned to investigate whether oral supplementation with macular
      xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (LCPUFAs) will decrease the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) when
      compared to placebo. The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether
      additional oral supplementation of omega-3 LCPUFAs (1 g/day) to daily supplementation of
      lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day) will change the plasma levels of lutein and
      zeaxanthin in participants over age 60. The secondary objective is to study whether changes
      in serum levels of xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin following oral supplementation will
      result in changes in the macular pigment density. In this study, forty participants (20
      participants per arm) will take the study medications of lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2
      mg/day) with or without the omega-3 LCPUFAs (1 g/day) for 6 months and will be followed for a
      total of 9 months (the initial 6 months with supplementation and the last 3 months without
      supplementation). Participants will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in
      either eye through advanced AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial detachment,
      or other signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one eye. AMD severity will be classified
      using Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) criteria for the definition of advanced AMD. This
      is a preliminary study to be conducted prior to a large-scale phase III randomized clinical
      trial of omega -3 LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin for patients with moderate to high risk of
      AMD. The estimates of increases in serum lutein and zeaxanthin levels and the corresponding
      changes of macular pigment densities will provide essential information in conducting a large
      phase III randomized trial.
