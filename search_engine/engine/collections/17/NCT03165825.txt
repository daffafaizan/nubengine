    
      This study will compare one route of epidural steroid injection (interlaminar) using a
      particulate steroid to another route of epidural steroid injection (transforaminal) using a
      different non-particulate steroid dexamethasone. Repeat injections may be allowed.

      All injections will be done with image guidance. Patients will be evaluated for improvements
      in pain and function.
