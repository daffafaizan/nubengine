      I. To assess the ability of imaging with gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) positron
      emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

      II. To assess a metabolic response to radiation therapy in meningiomas as measured by a
      reduction in the tumor to background ratio of the maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of
      the tumor compared to background brain parenchyma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) over a few minutes and, after 60
      minutes, undergo a PET/CT scan over 5-10 minutes 14 days before starting scheduled radiation
      therapy and 6 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.
