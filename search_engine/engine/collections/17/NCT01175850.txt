      patency rate of the treated arteries in the thighs of all patients included in the Study.
      Primary patency is a measure of the durability up to 1 year of the free lumen in the artery
      as restored during the procedure and is based on:

        -  the need for re-dilatation of the previously treated vessel segment

        -  an ultrasound examination The safety of the IN.PACT Admiral will be assessed by
           evaluating the incidence of deaths, amputations and re-dilatation of the pre-treated
           arteries in all patients included in the Study.

      The IN.PACT SFA Trial enrolled in 2 phases: IN.PACT SFA I and IN.PACT SFA II. The 150-patient
      IN.PACT SFA I phase is intended to support the second phase IN.PACT SFA II IDE trial with
      congruent design and protocol. Aggregate data from the two phases is intended to provide
      statistical power for the 12-month primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.
