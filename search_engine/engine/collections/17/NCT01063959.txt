      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies compared to consecutive laparoscopic gastric bypasses
      performed by two surgeons in a Louisiana private practice. This retrospective chart review
      will evaluate the safety of the two procedures during the operative and 6-week post-operative
      periods, compare the insurance patients to the private pay patients having the gastric
      bypass, and comparative weight loss in subjects with a follow-up of at least 18 months. This
      offers the unique opportunity to compare any differences in surgical complications in
      subjects paying by insurance versus those paying personally for the gastric bypass operation.
