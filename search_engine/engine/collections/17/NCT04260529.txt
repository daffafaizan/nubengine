      patients with cancer. However, only a subset of patients obtains durable remission. Treatment
      strategies that aim at recruiting tumor antagonizing cellular components of the immune system
      holds great promise. CyPep-1 is a chemically synthesized peptide with oncolytic properties.
      It selectively targets cancer cells based on their altered molecular composition, and removes
      the surrounding cell membrane. This releases tumor neoantigens to the microenvironment and
      potentially induces an anti-tumour immune response.

      This is a phase I/IIa dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      CyPep-1 and identify the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives are preliminary
      anti-tumor efficacy and to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CyPep-1
