      hospital's surgical boarding list and contacted by phone to obtain informed consent. Once
      informed consent is obtained, chart review will be conducted here at William Beaumont
      Hospital and at the physician's office to collect patient information related to their
      prolapse condition. Prior to surgery, questionnaires will be mailed and completed by the
      participant and then again at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and then yearly. Questionnaires
      will assess urinary, bowel, and sexual function, and patient treatment goals, treatment
      satisfaction, and general health and wellbeing. Completion of the questionnaires will be
      voluntary, and participants will be followed in this manner until voluntary withdrawal,
      exclusionary criteria emerge, or death.
