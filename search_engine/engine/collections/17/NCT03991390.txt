    
      Study designed as a randomized clinical trial. The total sample (N=16) will randomized into
      two groups: treatment vs. control. All of them suffering from subacute stroke and pusher
      syndrome.

      The study intervention will last 4 weeks. The control group will receive usual rehabilitation
      treatment for patients with stroke and pusher syndrome (60 minutes per day/5 days per week).
      The intervention group will receive usual rehabilitation treatment for patients with stroke
      and pusher syndrome (30 minutes per day/5 days per week) plus 30 minutes of therapy based on
      the specific protocol designed for the study. This protocol will consist of Core Stability
      exercises and visual feedback with lasers, both procedures will be alternated one day each.

      The evaluation of the intervention program will be based on the established objectives,
      assessing: 1) Pushing Intensity (controversial push scale (SCP)), 2) Laterality (Burke Scale
      (BLS)), 3) Balance (Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (S-PASS)), 4) patient
      functional capacity (Barthel Index), and 5) Quality of Life (Newcastle Stroke-Specific
      Quality of Life Measure (NEWSQOL)). These variables will be evaluated baseline and
      post-intervention. Additionally, SCP, BLS and S-PASS will be assessed 15 days after starting
      treatment.
