      will undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein harvesting using best
      harvesting practices, defined as: systemic heparinization prior to vein manipulation,
      standardization of vein graft harvesting techniques, pressure limiting syringe and 3 month
      use of dual anti-platelet therapy. Patients will undergo a CT angiography at 30 days and 12
      months to assess vein graft patency.
