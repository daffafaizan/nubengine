      (AZT) for stavudine (d4T) from the original formulation of GPO-VIR S. This new combination
      should decrease rates of lipoatrophy and neuropathy which are side-effects strongly linked to
      the use of d4T. However, there is some risk that initiating therapy with an AZT- containing
      regimen may cause unacceptable rates of anemia. Many Thai physicians have adopted a practice
      of using 6 months of the stavudine-containing GPO-VIR S as a lead in before introducing
      AZT-containing GPO-VIR Z in an effort to balance the risks and benefits of these two
      medications. There are no definitive data, however, that can attest to the benefit of such an
      approach.
