      Insufficient adherence causes an increase in morbidity, mortality, and costs, and decreases
      quality of life of patients. Multidrug blister packs are recommended to improve adherence and
      are widely used in Switzerland. However, evidence is poor and patient-relevant endpoints are
      seldom measured. This study was designed to compare patient-relevant outcomes in patients
      with medication repackaged in multidrug blister packs versus patients with medication
      dispensed in commercially available packages. Adherence of the intervention group will be
      monitored electronically and feedback will be given to the patients. The intervention will
      take place in a study pharmacy. Follow-up visits will take place at the study pharmacy at 3,
      6, and 12 months for all patients. Study duration will be 12 months.
