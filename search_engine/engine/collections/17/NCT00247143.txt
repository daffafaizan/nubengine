    
      This study is a safety, efficacy, and tolerability study of high dose kaletra in patients who
      have failed multiple antiretroviral regimens, including prior treatment with 3 classes of
      antiretroviral drugs (nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, non-nucleoside analogues, and at least
      one protease inhibitor based ARV regimen), in conjunction with optimized background therapy.
      Patients will initially be treated with high dose kaletra capsules and optimized background
      therapy for 4 weeks and then switched to equivalent doses of high dose kaletra liquid
      formulation for a total duration of therapy of 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study
      will be the average HIV RNA change from baseline through 24 weeks (HIV RNA AACUMB). Secondary
      endpoints will include the proportion achieving HIV RNA < 50 and HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL at
      24 weeks. Changes in CD4 from baseline, change in LPV fold change in phenotypic resistance
      testing, changes in fasting metabolic parameters, assessment of safety at week 24 based upon
      hematology, chemistry, liver function, lipid levels, proportion of patients reporting adverse
      events and proportion of patients with SAEs, and demonstration of bioequivalence by 12 hour
      pharmacokinetic measurements.
