    
      In this 2:1 double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial, subjects will be given an
      active drug of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or a placebo soybean oil for about two
      weeks prior to an endovascular abdominal aortic repair (EVAR) and subsequently six months
      after the procedure.

      An EVAR is known to produce a systemic inflammatory response with an increased risk of
      prolonged hospitalization and complicated post-operative recovery with cardiac events, renal
      and pulmonary dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. The study proposed here has the
      potential to provide valuable insight on the role of nutritional intervention to improve
      outcomes related to surgical revascularization.
