      The purpose of the PK substudy is to prospectively evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) concentrations derived from dosing with Rifamate when
      given in native format compared to over encapsulated, ingestion sensor-enabled format.

      The UCSD substudy aims to co-enroll 12 patients with Phase 1- the two-week investigation
      period of the characteristics of use of DHFS and patient acceptability. These subjects will
      be randomized to start on either Phase 1 or on two weeks of native Rifamate followed by
      24-hour PK sampling.
