        1. To determine whether the increased risk of asthma in children born from a pre-pregnant
           obese mother can be observed at 3 years of life and whether this increased risk
           associated with altered plasma levels of immune mediators at birth.

        2. To explore in children born from pre-pregnant obese mother whether monocyte physiology
           and M1-M2 polarization present an altered response and expression of asthma-related
           immune-modulations at birth.

        3. To study in neonates born from pre-pregnant obese mother whether the in vitro expression
           of TNFα, IL12, IL-10 and IL-4Rα in monocytes associates with changes in the DNA
           methylation status in the promoter regions of those genes.

      The study is performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and the study protocol
      was accepted by Institutional Review Boards at School of Medicine of the Pontificia
      Universidad Católica de Chile.
