      frequent when required. IOP, BCVA and slit lamp biomicroscopy were observed at every visit.
      History of all medication details and postoperative complications were recorded. One-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to analyze the other differences
      over time in IOP and BCVA. Nonparametric K-related samples test was used to analyze the
      difference of medications number at different time points. Success rates were evaluated using
      Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis curves.
