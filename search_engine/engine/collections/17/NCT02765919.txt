      form of gynecolgic malignancy in Bangladesh.Radiotherapy in the form of external beam
      radiotherapy combined with intracavitary Brachytherapy is the accepted definitive mode of
      treatment.Limiting the number of high dose rate(HDR) Brachytherapy has the potential benefit
      of improving patient compliance and reducing treatment cost and duration.The aim of this
      study is to compare the treatment outcome and acute complications following treatment with 9
      Gray (Gy) in two fractions of brachytherapy with standard EBRT in locally advanced carcinoma
      of cervix.

      EBRT will be delivered by a cobalt 60 teletherapy unit to a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in 25
      fractions of 2 Gy per fraction and 5 days a week over a period of 5 weeks concurrent with
      inj. Cisplatin 40 mg/meter square weekly for 5 weeks.The patients will be then randomised
      into two arms of HDR brachytherapy,either 9Gy in 2 fractions or 7 Gy in 3 fractions.All
      patients will be followed up as per guideline for 6 months.The treatment related toxicity
      will be measured by Common Toxicity Criteria(Common terminology criteria for adverse events
      v.3.0).

      All the relevant collected data will be compiled on a master chart and then statistical
      analysis of the results will be obtained by using SPSS 17.The data will be analysed using Chi
      square test and T test.Significant value will be decided at a level of 0.05 in two tailed
      tests.
