      gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer (median overall survival 6.24 vs 5.91 months
      respectively). However, combined therapy has not become standard of care due to the modest
      absolute benefit. In NSCLC, the optimal efficacy of erlotinib is not in combination with
      first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced disease, but as a single agent after cytoxic
      chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that erlotinib will have activity as a
      single agent in advanced pancreatic cancer. The presence of an erlotinib-induced rash is
      associated with improved survival in phase II and III trials of diverse tumor types (reviewed
      by Perez-Soler et al.), and is associated with higher steady state concentrations of
      erlotinib.

      This phase II trial aims to determine the safety and efficacy of erlotinib in patients with
      advanced pancreatic cancer who have previously been treated with up to one prior line of
      gemcitabine based chemotherapy for advanced disease. In addition, we will evaluate the
      feasibility and activity of dose escalation of erlotinib in patients who do not develop a
      rash. Clinical outcome will be correlated to EGFR status based on immunohistochemistry and
      gene amplification status as well as Kras mutations from archival tumor tissue.
