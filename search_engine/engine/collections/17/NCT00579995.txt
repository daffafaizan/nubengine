      to damage cells by scavenging them. N-acetylcysteine may also increase the biologic effects
      of nitric oxide by combining with nitric oxide to form S-nitrosothiol, a more stable form and
      potent vasodilator. It also increases the expression of nitric oxide synthesis and may
      improve blood flow. Oxidants activate a signal-transduction cascade and molecular response
      that may initiate the cell-death pathway. These pathways seem to be sensitive to the redox
      state of the cell and are inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, which promotes pathways that lead to
      repair and survival whenever cells are under oxidant stress.
