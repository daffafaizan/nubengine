        -  To evaluate the safety of antimicrobial catheter lock solution comprising
           trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, edetate calcium disodium (EDTA), and ethanol versus
           saline solution in patients with malignancies.

        -  To compare the efficacy of this lock solution versus saline solution in maintaining
           catheter patency in these patients.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of this lock solution in preventing or reducing the
           incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections in patients with long-term
           indwelling catheters.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical site and
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive antimicrobial solution into the central or peripheral venous
           catheter (CVC or PVC) once daily for 90 days. Catheter dwell time is 1-24 hours. The
           catheter is then flushed through before any drug infusion or blood aspiration.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive saline solution into the CVC or PVC once daily for 90 days.
           Catheter dwell time is 1-24 hours. The catheter is then flushed through before any drug
           infusion or blood aspiration.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 10 days.
