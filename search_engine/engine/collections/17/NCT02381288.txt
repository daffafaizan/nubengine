      frequency which results in a clinically relevant improvement in ST in middle-aged and older
      men with low ST levels. This study looked at ST levels in men who took TAK-448.

      The study enrolled 17 participants. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the following treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      participants and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-448 0.1 µg

        -  TAK-448 0.3 µg

        -  TAK-448 1.0 µg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive injection) - this was a injection that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient All participants received subcutaneous injection either
           once daily on Days 1 through 42, or twice weekly on Days 1 through 39 or once weekly on
           Days 1 through 36.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is up to 56 days. Participants made daily visits to the clinic for 8 weeks, and
      were contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
