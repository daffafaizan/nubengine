      I. To determine the antitumor activity of GW572016 in recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid
      cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands using objective response rates (partial and complete
      responses).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of objective response, rate and duration of stable disease,
      progression-free, median and overall survival rates of GW572016 in recurrent and/or
      metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands.

      II. To estimate the antitumor activity of GW572016 in other epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)- and/or erbB2-overexpressing malignant tumors of the salivary glands using objective
      response rates (partial and complete responses).

      III. To document the safety and tolerability of GW572016 in these patient populations

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate if differences in baseline levels of EGFR and/or erbB2 expression, and
      receptor phosphorylation status in tumor specimens predict outcome to therapy.

      II. To investigate if the inhibitory effects of GW572016 on EGFR and/or erbB2 pathway
      activation in tumor specimens correlate with clinical outcome.

      III. To determine the steady state levels of GW572016 achieved, and their correlation with
      clinical and laboratory correlative endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival
