      connective tissue occupying. we are trying to demonstrate a simple technique for inserting a
      catheter within that fashial plane and making sure of the catheter position, to ensure post
      operative analgesia for cases performing simple mastectomy.

      Now the Pectoralis type 2 block (PECS type 2) is an established technique as regional block
      technique for chest wall procedures.

      We are trying to maximizing the benefit of the block with a catheter insertion to use it for
      continuous infusion of bupivacaine for controlling post operative pain in cases performing
      simple mastectomy procedure
