    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate 2-year pulmonary metastatic progression rates in patients with primary
           high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma who have received preoperative I-MAP, plus
           aerosol GM-CSF, plus irradiation with concomitant MAP followed by post-operative aerosol
           GM-CSF.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate time to progression in these patients.

        -  To evaluate toxicity in these patients.

        -  To evaluate tumor response in these patients.

      Translational

        -  To observe and describe sequentially before treatment, after treatment, and after
           recovery from treatment the frequency of skin test anergy and cellular immunity in
           extremity soft tissue sarcoma receiving systemic GM-CSF preoperatively and aerosol
           GM-CSF as part of both preoperative and postoperative treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant treatment: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 1 and
           cisplatin IV over 4 hours, mitomycin IV and doxorubicin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours
           on days -6 to -3, 2-14, and 22-25. Beginning on day 84 patients also undergo
           radiotherapy once daily, five days a week, continuing for five weeks. Patients also
           receive GM-CSF SC twice daily on days -3 and 2 -15 and aerosol GM-CSF twice daily on
           days 85 - 91, 99 -105, and 113 - 119.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
           patients undergo radiotherapy (RT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Patients also
           receive aerosolized GM-CSF twice daily on days 2-8, 16-22, and 30-38 and mitomycin C IV,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 29.

        -  Surgery: Four weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery. Patients
           may also undergo intraoperative RT electron boost or intraoperative high-dose
           brachytherapy.

        -  Adjuvant treatment: Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive aerosol GM-CSF
           twice daily on days -7, 15-21, 35-42, 56-63, and 77-84. Some patients may undergo
           external beam RT 2-4 weeks after surgery.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and at 4 and 14 weeks after surgery. Samples are
      tested for NY-ESO-1 by staining, for T-cell subset by flow cytometry, and for autologous
      lymphocyte proliferation. Patients may also be tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity and
      skin test anergy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and at 5 years.
