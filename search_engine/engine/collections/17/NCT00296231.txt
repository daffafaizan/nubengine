      apnea in very low birthweight (VLBW, <1500 g) preterm infants. Endotracheal intubation and
      mechanical ventilation carry many risks including potentially fatal air leaks and
      ventilator-associated pneumonias. Less-invasive methods of respiratory support are needed to
      minimize these risks while supporting the convalescing preterm infant. We propose to test the
      effectiveness of nasal high-frequency ventilation (NHFV) in stable neonates with mild
      respiratory acidosis who are dependent on nasal continuous positive airway pressure for
      respiratory support (CPAP). Nasal high frequency ventilation may be effective in decreasing
      rates of reintubation for apnea or respiratory insufficiency in VLBW infants. We will enroll
      60 stable VLBW infants who are currently being treated with nasal CPAP and who have mild
      respiratory acidosis. Twenty patients will be assigned to each ventilator under
      investigation. Nasal high frequency ventilation will be applied at the same mean airway
      pressure as the patients' previous CPAP support. The amplitude on nasal high frequency
      ventilation will be adjusted to achieve adequate shaking of the chest wall. Blood gas
      measurements, transcutaneous continuous pCO2 monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry, and chest
      x-rays will be used to assess safety and efficacy. Study power has been calculated to detect
      a difference (drop or rise) in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) equal to two-thirds of the
      standard deviation of pCO2 change reported in another study (van der Hoeven et al., 1998),
      which is a clinically relevant difference.
