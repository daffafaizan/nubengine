      and will soon replace stroke as the third leading cause.

      Translation of promising biological hypotheses of COPD pathogenesis to human populations that
      may lead to new therapies is urgently needed. The vascular hypothesis of COPD was articulated
      almost 50 years ago. Bench research on endothelial dysfunction in COPD is evolving rapidly
      and has shown that acrolein in cigarette smoke causes endothelial apoptosis and endothelial
      apoptosis is directly implicated in COPD pathogenesis. Clinical studies on endothelial
      dysfunction and vascular changes in COPD are limited.

      The proposed study is a longitudinal study of smokers nested among the MESA-Lung (AAAA7791)
      and EMphysema and Cancer Action Project (EMCAP) Studies (AAAA6484), which together provide a
      well-defined cohort of 4,617 participants with prior spirometry and CT measures.

      The Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (MESA COPD
      Study) has two main scientific purposes:

        1. characterize the pulmonary vascular changes in COPD and their biology, and

        2. propose novel pathways for new therapies in COPD.

      MESA COPD is a longitudinal study of smokers nested within the MESA-Lung and EMCAP cohorts of
      360 participants (160 cases with mild, 60 cases with moderate and 40 cases with severe COPD
      and 100 controls) who will be phenotyped with magnetic resonance (MR) pulmonary angiography,
      pulmonary function testing, full-lung CT scans, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF), cell assays and gene expression profiling. MESA COPD Study will contribute improving
      the knowledge of early changes in COPD that may lead to novel disease-modifying medical
      therapies and preventative strategies.
