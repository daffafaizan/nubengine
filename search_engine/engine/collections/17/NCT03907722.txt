      care academic cardiovascular center. The rs2305619 polymorphism was evaluated by real time
      PCR and plasma PTX3 concentration was assessed by human PTX3 ELISA kit. The primary outcome
      of the study was the incidence of coronary microvascular obstruction defined as thrombolysis
      in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade <3 flow after primary PCI or TIMI grade 3 flow with
      myocardial blush grade 0 or 1. Patients were grouped based on the genotypic variants (AA, AG
      and GG). The primary outcome was compared among the three variants, as well as the PTX3
      concentration and 30-day mortality.
