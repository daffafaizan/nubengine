      practice. Spinal anesthesia commonly used technique for surgery of the lower limbs, provides
      a triple neurological lock (sensory, motor and autonomic) of roots of the spinal cord by
      intrathecal injection of a local anesthetic agent, following the rules of and strict aseptic
      conditions.

      Levobupivacaine and ropivacaine local anesthetic agents are considered less toxic and tend to
      replace the use of bupivacaine, reference molecule, but the plasma transition is extremely
      toxic to patients. However, there is currently no study comparing the benefits of
      levobupivacaine and ropivacaine in isobaric form injected intrathecally for trauma surgery of
      the lower limbs. We propose to conduct a prospective, randomized double-blind comparison of
      the use of these two molecules in spinal isobaric form by evaluating the time and duration of
      action (sensory and motor block), hemodynamic and ventilatory changes (sympathetic block),
      and the occurrence of any adverse events.
