      symptoms and signs of patients with heart failure systolic and diastolic function of left
      ventricle.

      Heart failure patients (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF â‰¤ 40%) are randomized to
      receive tablets of 300mg or placebo for 1 months in a double-blind fashion. All subjects will
      be on stable optimal medical therapy according to the present guidelines for at least 3
      months before enrolment. At randomization and at study end, echocardiography by a single
      observer will be performed and assessment of symptoms and signs and quality of life based on
      self scoring system (from 1 to 7) and objective physical examinations will be done.
