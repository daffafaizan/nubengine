      electromyography will be attached to an appropriate gauge electromyography-guided botulinum
      toxin needle, which in turn will be used to hear/see motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Subjects
      will be asked to activate the muscle while needle is inserted to ensure proper placement of
      the needle in the desired muscle prior to injection of study solution.
