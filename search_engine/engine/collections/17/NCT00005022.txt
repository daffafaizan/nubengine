      accelerated boost with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer. II.
      Evaluate the response rate and overall survival in these patients. III. Reduce the toxic
      effects of treatment to esophagus and lungs.

      OUTLINE: This is a radiation dose escalation study. Patients are sequentially accrued to one
      of four radiation dose levels. Dose level 1: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for
      4 weeks followed by radiation boost given daily for 2 days, then twice daily for 3 days
      during week 5. (Closed to accrual 6/98) Dose level 2: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a
      week for 4 weeks followed by radiation boost given twice daily for 5 days during week 5.
      (Closed to accrual 9/24/99) Dose level 3: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 18
      days followed by radiation boost given in the evenings on days 19 and 20, then twice daily
      for 5 days during week 5. (Closed to accrual 5/5/00) Dose level 4: Patients receive
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 16 days followed by radiation boost given in the evenings on
      days 17-20, then twice daily for 5 days during week 5. The fifth dose level is the same as
      the first dose level. (Closed to accrual 3/19/99) Cohorts of 5 patients are entered at each
      radiation dose level. If one patient experiences nonhematologic dose limiting toxicity (DLT),
      5 additional patients are treated at that level. If no further DLT occurs, escalation to the
      next arm proceeds. Patients receive cisplatin IV plus etoposide IV on day 1 of radiotherapy
      and oral etoposide on days 2 and 3 every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-10
      months.
