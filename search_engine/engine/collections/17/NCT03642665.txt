      artificially prepared cycle (AC-FET). Both cycle regimens have their advantages and
      disadvantages. So far, most comparative studies have failed to identify the optimal protocol
      for FET. In this study patients undergoing FET will be randomized between an endometrial
      preparation by a natural cycle or by an artificial cycle (by oestradiol validate and
      micronized progesterone).
