      relapse remains a problem for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Natural killer (NK)
      cells exert antitumor effects via their cytotoxic and cytokine-secreting capacity without
      present of clinical symptoms.

      In recent years, with the continuous advancement of in vitro expansion methods, the
      application of good quality management technology (GMP technology), NK cells could be
      clinical grade expanded without the need for pre-purification, feeder-free, and serum-free
      culture. Preclinical studies have confirmed that adoptive infusion expanded and activated NK
      cells can specifically recognize and kill tumor cells in mice without causing GVHD, which is
      a safe and effective treatment.

      Therefore, in this clinical trial the investigators want to enroll patients with acute AML
      (excluding APL) who are continued to be unresolved, or relapsed after remission, or continued
      to be MRD-positive after induction and consolidation according to NCCN standard chemotherapy
      regimen. Chemotherapy was combined with donor-derived in vitro activated NK cells infusion to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness effect of NK cells and to explore the dynamics of NK in
      vivo after adoptive infusion.
