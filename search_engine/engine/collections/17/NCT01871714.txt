      characterize the phenotype of individuals affected with XLHED. Facial 3-dimensional (3D)
      imaging will be created from white-field morphometric scanning (Hammond, 2004. The 3D facial
      photographs collected from males (ages 4 years and up) will be used to develop a non-invasive
      screening tool, which could enable detection of craniofacial signs of XLHED in the newborn
      period. 3D facial profiling has been reported to be effective in identifying HED (Dellavia et
      al., 2008), but the technology does not yet meet the ease-of-use criteria for a universal
      screening tool.

      Standard 2-dimensional (2D) frontal and lateral facial photographs will be taken of the same
      XLHED-affected male subjects as well as of adult females (ages 18-45 yrs) at risk for being
      XLHED carriers and unaffected adult female controls. The 2D facial photographs will serve a
      dual purpose; the first being to beta-test a previously developed algorithm to identify males
      affected with XLHED (Automatic Phenotype Identification of XLHED Patients Final Report,
      December 25, 2012, unpublished), and the second to adapt the facial recognition algorithm to
      identify female carriers of XLHED.
