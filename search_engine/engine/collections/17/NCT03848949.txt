      controlled ankle movement (CAM) boot at some point during their recovery and rehabilitation
      period. While WBAT in a CAM boot, patients often experience an asymmetric gait associated
      with the effective leg length discrepancy between the booted extremity (longer) and the
      contralateral extremity with a regular shoe (shorter). This asymmetry may cause balance
      problems or place strain on the patient's joints resulting in back, knee, and hip pain.

      An orthotic has been designed that is added to the outside of a regular shoe in order to
      eliminate the effective leg length discrepancy between the booted extremity and the
      contralateral limb. Although this specific orthotic has not been studied, some proof of
      concept lies in studies that show that back pain can be managed with foot orthotics. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if using the leg-length-evening orthotic can improve
      balance and/or decrease the development of pain in the lower extremities and spine for
      patients who are WBAT in a CAM boot.
