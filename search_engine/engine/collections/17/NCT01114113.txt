      occurring,willing participants will be asked to duplicate the "triggering meal" 2 more times.
      Once taking a pancreatic enzyme (active drug) with the meal and a second time taking an
      identical placebo. Neither the participant nor the study investigator will know which capsule
      is the active drug in this phase of the study. Willing participants will receive a small
      stipend each time they swallow the radio frequency capsule. This capsule is large,
      approximately twice the size of a vitamin pill so individuals must have no difficulties with
      swallow to participate nor any history of bowel obstruction or major surgery to the abdominal
      which might have caused adhesions.
