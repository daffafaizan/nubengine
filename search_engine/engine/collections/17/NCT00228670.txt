      Doctors do not know what causes IPF. We think that IPF is caused by a viral infection,
      particularly herpes virus. The goal of this experiment is to build the case for a causal link
      between IPF and herpes virus. This information is important to help us develop new therapies
      to treat patients with IPF.

      We will collect lung tissue at the time of lung transplant surgery from IPF patients and from
      organ donors as controls. Control lung tissue was collected if it was removed as a part of
      regular care or would otherwise be discarded. No extra tissue was taken solely for this
      research project.

      We will also perform a prospective longitudinal study on IPF patients and their household
      partners. IPF subjects are included if they have no other pulmonary disease and the diagnosis
      of IPF is confirmed by lung biopsy or by clinical and chest CT findings. The control group
      will consist of subjects without respiratory symptoms or pulmonary diseases who are the
      household partner or spouse of an enrolled IPF subject and who accompanies the IPF patient to
      outpatient clinic visits. If there is no household partner, or if the partner is unwilling to
      participate, we will still enroll the IPF subject who qualifies for the study and is willing
      to participate. Saliva, induced sputum, and venous blood will be collected from IPF and
      control subjects after informed consent at each clinic visit. Visits usually are at
      approximately 3-4 month intervals over a one year period.
