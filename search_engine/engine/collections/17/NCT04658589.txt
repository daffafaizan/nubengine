      a prospective clinical trial. Oncologic safety and excellence of the laparoscopic gastrectomy
      surgery was recently established for locally advanced gastric cancer.

      However, neither technical nor oncologic stability was established for laparoscopic
      gastrectomy surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Anticipated benefits from laparoscopic
      gastrectomy surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are as follows: 1) Reduced postoperative
      complications; 2) Reduced intra- or postoperative transfusion and patient's pain after
      surgery; 3) Enhance postoperative recovery (shortened hospitalization duration); 4)
      Facilitate completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The study was designed as single-country, multi-center, open-labelled, randomized (1:1),
      phase II trial.

      238 patients with medically and technically operable advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in
      middle or distal 1/3 of stomach are enrolled and randomly assigned to laparoscopic
      gastrectomy group and open gastrectomy group. 4 cycles of mFLOT chemotherapy will be
      conducted before and after gastrectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is comparison of D2 lymph node dissection compliance rate
      between open surgery group and laparoscopic surgery group after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
