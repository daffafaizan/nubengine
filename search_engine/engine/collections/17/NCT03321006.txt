      individuals will be recruited who are aged â‰¥60 years, diagnosed with a clinically significant
      depressive disorder, and have moderate ARHL with impaired speech discrimination.
      Comprehensive baseline psychiatric, audiometric, neuropsychological, and functional
      assessment will be performed. Participants then will be randomized to receive antidepressant
      medication (AD) treatment plus full amplification hearing aids or antidepressant medication
      plus low amplification hearing aids over a 12-week prospective trial. Data from this study
      could suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for LLD and thereby mitigate its public health
      burden, while also contributing to the increased recognition and treatment of ARHL more
      generally.
