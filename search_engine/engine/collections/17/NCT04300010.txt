      visits will be conducted at the main UW Hospital, UW Health at the American Center, or UW
      Health at 1 S. Park. All visits will be conducted in reserved conference rooms at each
      location.

      Once a subject is determined to be eligible and has consented to the study, they will be
      randomized into one of three treatment groups. Study team has blank envelopes that contain
      one of the three treatment groups enclosed. After a subject consents to the study, the study
      team will randomly draw an envelope to assign a treatment arm.

      Arm 1. One group will receive 5% topical benzoyl peroxide gel plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate
      with 70% isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 2. One group will receive blue light therapy plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70%
      isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 3. One group will receive both of the above treatments

      All participants will have their contralateral shoulder serve as the control (2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% isopropyl alcohol only). All treatment will be provided by
      the study team. Participants will also be asked to complete a research intake form.

      If C. acnes does grow for a tissue culture, Investigators plan to bank a colony of the
      bacterium for potential use in a future study. There will be no added risk to research
      subjects as no additional cultures will be taken and samples will be completely anonymized.
      The banked samples will simply be a colony of growth from the culture media for storage for
      possible future use. Samples will be banked for 5 years from the date of study completion
      after which time the samples will be destroyed.
