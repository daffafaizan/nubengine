      outflow vascular clamping and were assigned as study group. These individuals were
      retrospectively matched to 112 counterparts, who underwent liver surgery applying inflow and
      outflow vascular clamping only of the segment harboring the tumor, sparing the liver remnant
      from any I/R injury (control group). The two cohorts were compared regarding recurrence-free
      survival and overall survival.
