      cannabis in a laboratory setting has been the primary method used to understand the effects
      of the drug. The objective of this program is to use a naturalistic design to advance a more
      nuanced understanding of the potential outcomes associated with using different strains of
      marijuana. Researchers need to understand the effects of commonly used cannabis strains, as
      they are used in every day life. Commonly available strains of cannabis sold in dispensaries
      in Colorado have 3-5 times greater potency of cannabinoids, such as the psychoactive compound
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than what has been used in laboratory settings. It is possible
      that laboratory based studies underestimate the effects of more potent strains that are
      widely available. Also, scientists have focused on the effects of THC while mostly ignoring
      other major cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol or CBD) and their synergistic relationship.

      The objective of this study is to observe how different strains of marijuana, based off their
      unique cannabinoid content, can influence your mental and physical state in real time. This
      program will allow researchers to observe these effects immediately before and after cannabis
      use. A participant will use cannabis in the comfort of their home, and will walk out their
      front door and into a mobile lab that will be parked outside of their house. In this study,
      there is no need to smoke and drive.

      Participation is this study involves one appointment at the laboratory facility in Boulder
      and one appointment in the mobile laboratory.
