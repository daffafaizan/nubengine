      currently the treatment of choice when it is possible.

      Colorectal polyps are classified into diminutive polyps (<5mm in diameter), small polyps
      (6-9mm in diameter), and large polyps (>1cm in diameter). There are several endoscopical
      treatment methods: cold biopsy forceps polypectomy, cold snare polypectomy, hot biopsy
      forceps polypectomy, hot snare polypectomy, and endoscopic mucosal resection. Cold
      polypectomy means mechanical removal of the polyp with snare or biopsy forceps without the
      use of electrocautery, and hot polypectomy means removal of the polyp with the use of
      electocautery.
