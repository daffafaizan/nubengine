      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) with advanced solid tumors (including
      central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that
      harbor activating genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with BVD-523FB
      (ulixertinib) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or
      histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) in children and
      adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) in
      children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) and
      specifically, whether tumors that harbor different mutations or fusions will demonstrate
      differential response to BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ulixertinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Cycles repeat every 28 days for
      up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
