      pain and function in persons with knee osteoarthritis. A secondary objective is to ascertain
      if the blend lowers serum uric acid.

      This is a prospective double blind, placebo controlled cross-over study.

      The study will be performed in the Philadelphia VA Medical Center 1 South Rheumatology Clinic
      with patients meeting ACR criteria for Kellgren grade 2-3 knee osteoarthritis and 4-9 pain
      severity on a VAS. Fifty patients will be studied with each having 5 visits. Subjects will
      take either the proprietary cherry blend or placebo for 6 weeks and then switch. WOMAC pain
      and function will be the primary outcome with acetaminophen use, walking time and serum uric
      acid as secondary outcomes.
