      Seizures can be associated with any high-risk factors during perinatal stage and diagnosed by
      abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

      In this study researchers will use electroencephalography (EEG) to determine and monitor
      newborn with uncontrolled or suspected seizures. EEG works by measuring electrical activity
      in different areas of the brain. The EEG allows researchers to examine changes in the EEG
      along with the clinical features of seizures as they occur.

      In addition to monitoring electrical activity of the brain, researchers will collect
      demographic, medical history, family, perinatal stage, birth, growth, feeding condition by
      medical records and questionnaire. These information will allow researchers to learn more
      about what high-risk factors influence the incidence of neonatal seizure in China.
