    
      PRAN is an open-label trial of 1000 Treatment-Naive PLHIV aged 16 years or more.

        1. To evaluate whether a package of care including rapid ART initiation [diagnosis and
           management of opportunistic infection (OI), rapid ART initiation and enhanced adherence
           support] is more effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, as compared to standard
           ART initiation, among ART naïve PLHIV in Nepal.

        2. To evaluate whether a package of care including rapid ART initiation is more effective
           in improving retention in HIV treatment, as compared to standard ART initiation, among
           ART naïve PLHIV in Nepal.

        3. To evaluate whether a package of care including rapid ART initiation improves viral
           suppression among ART naïve PLHIV in Nepal to a higher extent than standard ART
           initiation,

        4. To evaluate whether the different components of care act synergistically to improve
           mortality, retention in care and viral suppression among treatment Naive PLHIV, as
           compared to standard ART initiation,

        5. To assess the cost-effectiveness of this package of care intervention.
