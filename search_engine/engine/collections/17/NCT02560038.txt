      and mechanisms of action of the agents paclitaxel plus gemcitabine and cisplatin, which are
      all known active agents in urothelial tumors. Gemcitabine may be synergistic with
      DNA-damaging drugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin because it can antagonize DNA repair.
      Investigators will investigate the combination in this Phase II study.
