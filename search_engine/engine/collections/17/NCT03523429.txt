    
      In the pre-phase, patients receive treatment according to routine clinical practice at
      Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with high-risk ALL
      (ALL-AR-11), with: Prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/m2, PO or IV until complete characterisation of the
      ALL, for a maximum of 7 days, Triple intrathecal therapy, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30
      mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg.

      Standard induction chemotherapy that these patients receive according to routine clinical
      practice at Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with
      high-risk ALL (ALL-AR-11), consists of: Vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum dose 2 mg) IV
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22,Daunorubicin (DNR) 45 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15 and 22, prednisone 60 mg/m2
      per day, IV or PO, days 1 to 14,30 mg/m2 per day, IV or PO, days 15 to 21, 15 mg/m2 per day,
      IV or PO, days 21 to 28,E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®) 10,000 IU/m2, IV, days
      16-20, 23-27,Intrathecal TIT chemotherapy day 1* (if not administered in the pre-phase) and
      22, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30 mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg, G-CSF (SC or IV) from day
      15 until neutrophils > 1000/µl.

      Following the administration of induction therapy, a bone marrow analysis will be performed
      with morphological, genetic and molecular study if necessary, with a centralised MRD
      determination by MFC. In the case of a complete morphological response and MRD < 0.1% (<
      1×10-3), the patient will be enrolled in the trial and receive consolidation and maintenance
      treatment according to protocol.

      Consolidation - CYCLE 1 Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patients will receive in
      the first cycle (21 days) consists of: dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5, 10
      mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6, 5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7, 2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV
      day 8, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 per day, IV (maximum 2 mg) days 1 and 8, Methotrexare 3g/m2, IV
      in 24 hours, E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3,Triple
      intrathecal therapy day 1.

      Consolidation - CYCLE 2

      Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patient will receive in the second cycle (21 days)
      consists of:

        -  Dexamethasone:

             -  20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5.

             -  10 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6.

             -  5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7.

             -  2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 8.

        -  ARA-C:

           - 2 g/m2 every 12 hours, over 3 hours, days 1 and 2. Halve the ARA-C for patients over
           50 years of age.

        -  E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3. Halve the dose for
           patients over 50 years of age as the toxicity of any type of ASP increases with age.

        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 4 (administered that day to keep the intrathecal therapy
           separate from the high-dose ARA-C).

      Consolidation - CYCLE 3 In the third early consolidation cycle, the investigational drug
      blinatumomab will be administered.

        -  Blinatumomab 28 μg/day as a continuous infusion, IV over 4 weeks.

        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 1.

      Late consolidation Two weeks after completing the blinatumomab treatment, in the case of MRD
      < 0.01% (< 1×10-4), patients will receive 2 blocks of intensive chemotherapy (identical to
      those in early consolidation), separated by 3 weeks, followed by a treatment cycle with
      blinatumomab, the investigational medicinal product, for 4 weeks.

      After administering late consolidation therapy, a bone marrow study will be conducted. In the
      case of MRD < 0.01% (< 1×10-4), the patient will receive maintenance treatment. If this MRD
      level is not achieved, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and undergo a
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to routine clinical practice at Spanish
      sites.

      The maintenance therapy that patients will receive in this phase of the trial will consist of
      continuous chemotherapy administration (mercaptopurine and methotrexate) with reinductions
      for up to one year from CR
