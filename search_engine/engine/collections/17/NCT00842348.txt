      hormone related symptoms and is indicated for the treatment of hormone related symptoms in
      many international countries, there is no reference standard medical therapy for asymptomatic
      patients. A 96-week study (Study 2-55-52030-726 (726), NCT00353496) was conducted to
      investigate the effect of lanreotide Autogel on progression free survival (PFS) in patients
      with well or moderately differentiated nonfunctioning enteropancreatic NET. While Study 726
      was ongoing, the sponsor considered that therapy with lanreotide Autogel should continue to
      be an option to patients with stable disease at the end of the 96-week treatment period. This
      extension study was therefore initiated (Study 2-55-52030-729 (729)) which investigated the
      long term safety of treatment with lanreotide Autogel and enabled investigators to continue
      to treat their patients who had stable disease, as well as to treat placebo patients who
      experienced disease progression during the initial 96-week study (Study 726).
