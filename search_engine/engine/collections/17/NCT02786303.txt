      lymph nodes. According to the French recommendations (" Thesaurus national de canc√©rologie
      digestive "), the initial assessment includes a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan and a
      scintigraphic method (Octreoscan and TEP-scan if Octreoscan negative). The aim is to detect
      metastases and tumoral progression to offer the appropriate treatment, such as surgery. Due
      to its high contrast resolution, its absence of irradiation, and diffusion sequences, the MRI
      is more and more used to detect tumor progression. The recent literature shows better results
      with the diffusion sequences than the T2-weighted sequences and, potentially, than the
      contrast-enhanced sequences to detect liver metastasis. The whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI
      seems promising for the staging and the following of some cancers. Only two publications have
      evaluated the diagnostic value of diffusion sequences to detect pancreatic neuroendocrine
      tumors and liver metastasis. Yet, no publication has assessed the diagnostic value of
      whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in the patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
