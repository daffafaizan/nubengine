      second leading cause of mortality from cancer. Bone metastases are a frequent complication of
      breast cancer, and the mechanism of breast cancer metastases to bone is an ongoing area of
      research.. Receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) have been identified and
      characterized for its role in bone remodeling. RANKL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) family of cytokines that binds to its receptor RANK to control osteoclast
      differentiation, activation, and survival. RANK protein expression is not only found on
      osteoclasts and dendritic cells but also on T cells and mammary epithelial cells. RANK and
      RANKL is important for lymph node and thymus formation as well as lactating mammary gland
      development during pregnancy. Furthermore, the RANK/RANKL axis has been linked to progestin
      driven breast carcinomas and bone metastases.

      RANK is expressed in 6-57% of invasive human breast cancers (depending upon the parameters
      for defining positivity and antibodies utilized for immunohistochemistry (IHC)), and RANKL
      driven hormone (progesterone -dependent proliferation, survival, and nonproliferative
      expansion of mammary stem cells may contribute to breast cancer initiation, progression, and
      recurrence.

      We hypothesize that denosumab can inhibit RANKL signaling in early breast tumors which
      express RANK, inhibiting pro-metastatic mechanisms and reducing immunosuppression in the
      tumor microenvironment. This will be tested in a pre-surgical clinical trial (Phase 0) to
      evaluate and select the pharmacodynamics markers of RANKL inhibition in breast cancer.
