    
      It is a single-center prospective observational descriptive study.

      The studied children will be premature infants hospitalized in the neonatology department of
      the University Hospital of Grenoble and for whom the RetCam examination is planned for
      screening for retinopathy of prematurity if they are at risk (prematurity <32 weeks). These
      exams fit into a routine care.

      To measure their pain during the examination, it will be a matter of filming the face of the
      child for 15 seconds before the examination, then 2 times 30 seconds at two distinct times.

      The PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) score includes a percentage of time on these 30
      seconds where 3 items are found modified and a monitoring of heart rate and oxygen
      saturation. (Please note that the recording of the constants of the child is already
      integrated into the current care in the neonatology department of the University Hospital of
      Grenoble and will not be added for the purpose of the study.) Expected scores should be about
      12/21, despite the use of analgesic agent.

      This time calculation can not be done live and requires video recording of the child's face
      during the exam. After parental information and non-opposition consent of the parents, the
      child can be filmed and his constants annotated during the current care. Parents can attend
      this observational procedure.

      The statistical analyzes will be adjusted for sex, gestational age at birth, weight, and pain
      from birth (determined by the number of doses of level 1 analgesics received by the baby and
      the number of days (from birth to to the RetCam examination) when the baby received > level 1
      analgesics).
