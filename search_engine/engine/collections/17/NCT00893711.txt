      consists of a behavioural syndrome characterised by paroxysmal, excessive and inconsolable
      crying without identifiable cause. Although infantile colic is commonly reported and causes
      appreciable distress for both parents and paediatricians, despite forty years of research,
      its aetiology still remains unclear. Recently the role of intestinal microflora has growing
      importance, and a lower count of intestinal lactobacilli has been observed in colicky infants
      compared to healthy ones. In a recent study we have observed that Lactobacillus reuteri
      improved colicky symptoms in breast-fed infants within one week of treatment compared to
      Simethicone, suggesting that probiotics may play a role in infantile colic (Savino F, Pelle
      E, Palumeri E, Oggero R, Miniero R.Lactobacillus reuteri (American Type Culture Collection
      Strain 55730) versus simethicone in the treatment of infantile colic: a prospective
      randomized study. Pediatrics 2007; 119:e124-30). The mechanism involved in such finding is
      only partially understood and, for this reason, we have planned this new study to evaluate
      not only the clinical improvement but also the microbiological data.
