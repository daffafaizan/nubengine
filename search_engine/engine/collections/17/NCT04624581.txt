    
      This is an exploratory case control pathophysiology study of psychophysical (central
      sensitization assessment) and genetic (candidate gene panel) characteristics.

      The main objectives of this study are :

      Primary: Evaluate the central nociception sensitization characteristics and genetic
      determinants in fibromyalgic syndrome, comparing a group of patients to matched healthy
      controls.

      Secondary :

        -  1) Characterize genetic predispositions of central sensitization in patients with FS
           compared to matched healthy controls, including confirmation of known genetic markers
           and potential identification of new genetic variants involved,

        -  2) Compare in the area of central sensitization the population of patients with FS and
           matched healthy controls,

        -  3) Compare in the domain of temporal summation the population of patients with FS and
           matched healthy controls,

        -  4) Describe in the clinical field the characteristics of the FS patient population,

        -  5) Compare in the areas of quality of life, anxiety/depression and comorbidities,
           characteristics of the FS patient population and matched healthy controls,

        -  6) Compare epigenetic biomarkers of the FS patient population with healthy matched
           controls,

        -  7) Study of the role of the gut microbiota in patients with FS (bio banking)

        -  8) Compare in the areas of pain, sound and light sensitivity the population of patients
           with FS and matched healthy controls.
