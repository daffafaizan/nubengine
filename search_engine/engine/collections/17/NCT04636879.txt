    
      The aim of this study will be to research the effects of induced expectations combined with a
      dry needling technique on the activation of the ANS and on the results of the treatment.

      Hypothesis: The induction of a positive expectation shall cause a greater analgesic response
      associated with a response in the ANS compared to the induction of neutral or negative
      expectations.

      Methods: Patients with neck pain will participated in this randomized clinical trial, which
      will be randomly assigned into 3 groups in order to receive positive, neutral or negative
      expectations concerning the treatment, by means of an individual informative talk. All
      subjects will received treatment using dry needling in the upper trapezius fibers. The main
      variables measured will be the following: Analogic Visual Scale, Pressure Pain Threshold
      using a mechanical Force Gage (before and after) and the activation of the ANS measuring the
      skin conductance, skin temperature, heart rate and breathing rate (monitored for 5 minutes
      before the intervention, during and 20 minutes afterwards).
