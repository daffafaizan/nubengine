      arthroplasty with the same surgeon. The all patients were performed surgery with minimally
      invasive surgery technique. The gender, site, range of motion, alignment of prosthesis,
      operative time, blood loss, and posterior slope of tibial component also were recorded and
      compared between two groups. The incidence of postoperative genu recurvatum, gender, and site
      were computed using Fisher's exact test. The hyperextension angle, knee score, pain score,
      functional score,range of motion, alignment of prosthesis, posterior slope of tibial
      component, operative time, and blood loss were compared with student t-test.
