    
      This is a phase 2 study in patients with probable Early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early AD
      includes Stage 3 AD patients (MCI due to AD) and Stage 4 AD patients (mild AD). The study is
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, in which participants
      (up to 6 per arm; 12 total) will receive oral placebo or MMFS twice daily for 24 weeks.
      Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 3 assessments total: at
      baseline (prior to taking any study tablets), week 12, and week 24 visits. At each of the
      three visits, participants will complete cognitive and behavioral measures and clinical
      interviews, a blood sample will be collected for safety and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's
      disease, and the informant will complete an interview concerning the patient's cognition,
      mood, and function. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed
      (including vital signs, laboratory tests, and ECGs). Participants will be contacted by phone
      between clinical assessments for monitoring.
