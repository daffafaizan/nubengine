      OBJECTIVE: To define the best analgesic method between the peri-prostatic block, the
      analgesic suppository, the oral analgesic, the final anesthetic gel, during the trans rectal
      prostate biopsy determined at the end of the procedure with a visual analogue scale for pain
      (VAS pain) in a Interview 15 to 30 minutes at the end of the procedure.

      METHODS: experimental, retrospective, longitudinal, comparative, during May to July 2017, 350
      trans rectal prostate biopsies were performed, all cases were randomly assigned to one of the
      four study groups. The data analysis will be performed by calculating measures of central
      tendency and dispersion for quantitative variables and ANOVA test, for qualitative variables
      Chi square to determine statistical differences between the three moments of pain in the
      parameters of introduction of the ultrasound transducer, sampling of Prostate of the minimum
      12 biopsies and discomfort in general of the procedure
