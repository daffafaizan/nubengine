      narcotic or to receive no long acting spinal narcotic. The subjects may or may not also
      receive acetaminophen orally postoperatively. Pain scores are done on postoperative day one
      as well as evaluation of potential narcotic side effects such as nausea/vomiting, itching,
      and sedation.
