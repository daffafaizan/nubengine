      immobilizes shoulder and upper arm motion for a month after total mastectmoy and immediate
      reconstruction with tissue expander insertion. To improve shoulder mobility and QOL of
      patients, the investigators introduced a new and early rehabilitation protocol with
      short-term immobilization in Jan 2017.

      The investigators retrospectively reviewed total 115 breast cancer patients who underwent
      reconstructive surgery from May 2016 to Aug 2017. Patients who did their reconstruction
      before Jan 2017 followed conventional protocol and immobilized their shoulder for more than 4
      weeks. Patients who did their reconstruction after Jan 2017 were educated to undergo a
      self-exercise program after short-term immobilization of 2 weeks. The investigators reviewed
      shoulder mobility, pain, QOL and complications at postoperative 1 month and 2 month in both
      group of patients.
