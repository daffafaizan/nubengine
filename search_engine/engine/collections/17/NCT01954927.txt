      treatment arms: a single dose of gabapentin or a single dose of placebo. Morphine or other
      opioid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be available to both groups as needed
      for pain and will be administered according to the current standard of care for pain in VOC
      from the Department of Hematology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).
      Randomization will be performed in the SJCRH pharmacy by a pharmacist. The randomization will
      be stratified by three age categories (1-3 years of age, 4-6 years, and 7 years or older) for
      which distinct pain assessment tools are applied and for 2 pain score categories at
      assessment at presentation (4-6 and 7-10, respectively). A block randomization with block
      sizes varying randomly between 4 and 6 will be used in each stratum.

      Pain scores will be obtained at presentation to the acute care setting and 3 hours (Â± 15
      minutes) post administration of study drug. Participants who were discharged will be
      contacted by study staff between 24 and 72 hours following administration of study drug to
      see if there have been any side effects. Patients who were admitted after administration of
      the study drug will be monitored through hospital record to determine if any unexpected
      events occurred. After this follow up, participation in the study is complete.
