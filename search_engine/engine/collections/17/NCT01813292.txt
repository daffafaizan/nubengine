    
      Fluoride metabolism will be studied by measurement of fluoride in blood and in daily urine,
      bone remodelling by measurement of P1NP. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to
      determine the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal
      radius. Volumetric BMD (v-BMD) and micro-architecture of distal radius and tibia will be
      studied using a HR-pQCT scan (Xtreme, Scanco).
