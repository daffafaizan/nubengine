    
      This study has been designed as a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, feasibility
      clinical investigation to evaluate the safety and device technical performance of the WOLF
      Thrombectomy Device in removing thrombus from an occluded large intracranial vessel(s) in
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. The device may be used alone or as an adjunct to
      intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or to other traditional, thrombectomy
      modalities.
