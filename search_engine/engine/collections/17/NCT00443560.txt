    
      The obstetrical anesthesia database will be queried for all forceps deliveries between the
      dates of January 2004-October 2005. To minimize the influence of different anesthetic and
      obstetric care providers, the control group consisted of parturients who has spontaneous
      vaginal deliveries (SVD) in the same 24 hour period who were case-matched for gravidity and
      parity. Parturients with twin deliveries and fetal demise were not selected for either group.

      The database will be queried for the following: maternal age, parity, gestational age, type
      of analgesia, changes in epidural infusion rate and/or concentration, and supplemental bolus
      doses of local anesthesia. The data will be stripped of identification by the database
      manager and entered into a secured computer which is password protected and maintained in the
      Department of Anesthesiology. The primary endpoint is to evaluate if decreasing the epidural
      infusion rate was associated with a forceps delivery.
