      spinal fusions. Many of these patients have been treated with analgesics or other modalities
      for prolonged periods before choosing the surgical alternative. In addition, the
      narcotic-based anesthetic required for the procedure may induce postoperative
      hyper-analgesia. Inadequate treatment of this pain can result in prolonged hospitalization,
      cardiopulmonary complications, and poor surgical outcome. However, the narcotic treatment of
      pain is often associated with multiple adverse effects. Multimodal postoperative analgesia
      has been instituted to reduce pain while limiting the adverse side effects of opioids.
      Pregabalin has been shown to be efficacious in the management of chronic pain syndromes with
      limited adverse side effects. Hence, multiple studies have attempted to demonstrate the
      benefits of including pregabalin in multimodal postoperative pain management. These studies
      have yielded conflicting results with regard to reduced pain, opioid consumption, and
      improved outcome. We propose that the addition of pregabalin to acute pain regimen after
      posterior spinal fusions should reduce narcotic requirements and hence improve outcome by
      reducing narcoticinduced side effects. Although recent studies have also examined the
      administration of pregabalin after spinal fusions, this study was conducted with a uniform
      anesthetic regimen and similar procedure performed by two spine surgeons at one institution.
      Pain scores were controlled as well as physical therapy milestones to assess whether changes
      in the pain regimen would affect narcotic consumption, narcotic induced side effects, and
      length of hospitalization.
