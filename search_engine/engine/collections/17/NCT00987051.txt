      to reflect the status of lymph node. Only 10 to 20% of women with endometrial cancer exhibit
      lymph node metastasis hence systematic lymphadenectomy is questionable. In breast cancer,
      melanoma and vulvar cancer, sentinel node has emerged as an alternative to complete
      lymphadenectomy. The objective of our trial is to validate the concept of sentinel node in
      endometrial cancer.
