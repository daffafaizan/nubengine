    
      Single arm, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy of administering CD3/CD28 stimulated
      T cells to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients following treatment with fludarabine
      or alemtuzumab based chemo- immunotherapy. All patients will undergo an apheresis to collect
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for generation of expanded T cells post-
      chemo-immunotherapy. Those subjects who achieve a complete or partial response to the
      chemoimmunotherapy based regimen will receive an infusion of 1.0 x 1010 (+/- 20%) activated
      autologous T cells expanded from the collected apheresis unit. Prior to T-cell infusion, at
      Day +30, +60, and +365 after T cell infusion, blood draws will be performed to assess immune
      reconstitution and immune function as compared to baseline.
