    
      This is a double blinded Randomized controoled trial of 30 days duration. The trial device is
      the Uroshield, SAW device which is an externally applied device attached to the external
      portion of the urinary catheter.

      Subjects will be randomized to a control group and the treatment group. The control group
      will receive standard of care for the care of indwelling urinary catheters, while being
      attached to a sham UroShield device. The treatment group will receive the same standard of
      care treatment but will be attached to an active UroShield SAW device.

      At baseline and again at 30 days, both the catheter and retained urine from the bladder will
      be evaluated for the number of live colonies. These numbers will be evaluated to see if there
      is a difference between the active and sham devices.
