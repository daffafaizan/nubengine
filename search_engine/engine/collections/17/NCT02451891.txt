      outbreak setting, and to give an indication as to whether booster vaccinations may need to be
      considered to maintain immunity.

      In light of this, the extension study has invited volunteers to attend some further optional
      follow up visits. It would involve obtaining some further blood tests to look for the same
      markers of vaccine induced immune response that were looked for in the first part of the
      trial.
