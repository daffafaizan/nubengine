           of cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil will be administered through continuous IV infusion through
           a portable pump for four days at home. A cycle is twenty-one days long ( 4 days of
           chemotherapy and 17 days of recovery).

        -  During each cycle blood tests will be performed weekly. A physical exam will be
           performed and the impact of the chemotherapy will be assessed at the end of each cycle.

        -  If after 2 cycles the patients cancer has not responded sufficiently they will be
           removed from the study.

        -  If significant reduction in the size of the tumor is observed after cycle 2, a third and
           final cycle will be performed. Followed by radiation therapy twice daily for
           approximately 6-7 weeks.
