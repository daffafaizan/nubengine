      inherited single gene autosomal recessive defect. MLD is caused by a mutation in the ARSA
      gene encoding arylsulfatase A which leads to a deficiency in sulfatide degradation, resulting
      in its accumulation in oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells and some neurons. A critical level of
      sulfatide storage can trigger demyelination, the hallmark of MLD, which results in multiple
      neurological symptoms. MLD has different onset ages including late infancy (1-2 years),
      adolescence (4 years-before sexual maturity) and adulthood (after sexual maturity). MLD
      patients are normally rescued by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a
      matched healthy donor. However, HSCT must be performed at a very early stage of the disease
      thus restricting its therapeutic opportunies in MLD patients. This trial aims to treat MLD
      using a safety and efficiency improved self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a
      functional MLD gene to correct the genetic defect by intracerebral injection to delivery the
      lentiviral vector carrying a normal ARSA gene to correct the pathogenic defect. The primary
      objectives are to evaluate the safety of the improved self-inactivating lentiviral vector
      TYF-ARSA, the in vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of degradative
      metabolite in patients at the time of treatment, assessment of vector integration sites, and
      finally the long-term correction of the related pathological symptoms.
