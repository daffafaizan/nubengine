        -  Determine the percentage of patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma with a reduction
           in tumor size after treatment with B7-1 gene-modified autologous tumor cell vaccine and
           interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the local and systemic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue for vaccine preparation is obtained when patients undergo palliative
      surgical resection of primary tumor or therapeutic resection of metastasis.

      At approximately 3-6 weeks after surgery, patients receive B7-1 gene-modified autologous
      tumor cell vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once on days 1, 29, and 57. At 6 weeks after the first
      vaccination, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC five days a week for 6 weeks (days
      43-82). Patients with stable or responding disease after day 106 may receive additional
      vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks after the last dose of IL-2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
