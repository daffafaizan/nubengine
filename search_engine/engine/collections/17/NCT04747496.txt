    
      This non-interventional, observational study will evaluate the safety of edoxaban treatment
      in adult patients with NVAF indications with one or more risk factors.

      The primary objective of the study is to collect and evaluate safety data up to 2 years in a
      real-world setting in relation to adverse event onset (related to edoxaban treatment),
      duration, severity, and outcome.

      The secondary objective will evaluate the effect of edoxaban treatment on stroke (ischemic
      and hemorrhagic), systemic embolic event (SEE), transient ischemic attack (TIA), major
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS), hospitalization related to cardiovascular condition, extent of exposure and compliance
      to edoxaban therapy, and rate and reasons of permanent discontinuation of edoxaban therapy.
