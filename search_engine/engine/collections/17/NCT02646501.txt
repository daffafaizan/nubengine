      patients with structural heart disease. It has been reported that cardiac sympathectomy
      reduces VT/VF episodes in patients with complex VT, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic
      polymorphic VT, or myocarditis. However, cardiac sympathectomy operation is hard to conduct
      in patients with hemodynamically unstable recurrent VT/VF or electrical storm. Therefore, we
      hypothesized that bed-side percutaneous stellate ganglion block (PSGB) reduces VT/VF episodes
      and mortality in patients with repetitive VT/VF who are properly managed with optimal medical
      therapies.
