      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cortex Eucommiae (CE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver extract)
      in subjects with mild OA. One hundred subjects with mild OA will be recruited and randomly
      divided into 2 groups, each group will receive Cortex Eucommiae (CE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver
      extract) or placebo and will take CE or placebo for 12 weeks. Outcomes will be evaluated by
      self-administered questionnaires and lab test results. The hypothesis is that Cortex
      Eucommiae (CE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver extract) which as a dietary supplementation may slow
      down or reverse OA.
