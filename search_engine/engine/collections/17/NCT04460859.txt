      physiologic benefits, randomized clinical trials comparing higher vs. lower PEEP levels
      failed to show improved survival of ARDS patients. Higher PEEP should fully exploit its
      benefits only when implemented in patients with higher potential for alveolar recruitment
      (i.e., the decrease of non-aerated lung tissue at higher airway pressure) or in patients with
      airway closure. Retrospective analysis of randomised clinical trials with PEEP suggests that
      when high PEEP is used in responders (oxygenation), survival may be better. Conversely, in
      the absence of significant recruitment, higher PEEP should be avoided and lower PEEP might be
      recommended.

      Titration of PEEP provided by the mechanical ventilator in patients with severe lung injury
      should thus be based on bedside information on lung recruitability. However, no valid method
      exists to define the best PEEP to optimize recruitment and minimize lung overdistention.
      Recruitability varies and is often not assessed. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a
      non-invasive bedside imaging technique for measuring the potential for lung recruitment in
      ARDS patients. By performing lung (de)recruitment maneuvers and in-depth analyses, we will
      define lung recruitability indices and develop methods for real-time and personalized PEEP
      selection. This study will prove the feasibility of minimizing risks associated with
      inadequate mechanical ventilation by EIT.
