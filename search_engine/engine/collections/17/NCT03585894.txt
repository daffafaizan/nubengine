      (vasodilatation), vessel wall inflammation and blood flow in arteries of headaches triggered
      by PACAP38 and for headache treated with sumatriptan (migraine medicine) and ketorolac
      (NSAID). In addition, we will investigate headache-related changes in the brain's network
      connectivity.
