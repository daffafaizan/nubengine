      Recovery (DAPPER). The investigators are adapting the Get Busy Get Better intervention by
      adding components (e.g. nurse visits and person directed goals) from the CAPABLE study for
      this intervention. The investigator will further develop the intervention through this
      two-phase pilot test. The aims of this pilot project are to 1) test the Depression and Pain
      Perseverance through Empowered Recovery (DAPPER) program for feasibility and acceptability.
      Specifically, the investigators will test the effect size of DAPPER on pain and depressive
      symptoms from baseline to 12 weeks (compare intervention to wait list control group) and then
      at 24 weeks to compare the intervention group to wait list control group once again. 2)
      estimate preliminary effect sizes for DAPPER in reduction pain and depressive symptoms, 3)
      measure effect sizes and feasibility of measuring cytokines and heart rate variability (HRV).
