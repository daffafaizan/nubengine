      activity such as cycling or an injury during a traffic accident. The pain after clavicle
      fracture surgery may be managed with combined superficial cervical plexus-interscalene block
      and recently clavipectoral fascia plane block (CPB). CPB was defined by Valdes in 2017
      firstly. It may be used for postoperative analgesia after clavicle surgery. The clavipectoral
      fascia covers the clavicular site of the pectoralis major muscle. It provides the potential
      interfascial space between the clavicle and the pectoralis major muscle. CPB provide
      effective analgesia after clavicle surgery. It is also easy to perform. With this advantage
      and its analgesic effectiveness for clavicle surgery, CPB may be an alternative to
      interscalene brachial plexus block. However, randomized clinical efficacy trials are needed
      to investigate the effectiveness of CPB for clavicle fractures. In the literature, data about
      CPB is so limited, however it seems a good alternative to brachial plexus block for pain
      management after clavicle fracture The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      US-guided CPB for postoperative analgesia management compare to no intervention control group
      after clavicle surgery. The primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and
      the secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), adverse effects related
      with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).
