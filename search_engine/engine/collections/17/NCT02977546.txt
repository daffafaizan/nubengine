      failure. The gold standard is intermittent thermodilution via pulmonary artery catheter
      (PAC). Because of its invasiveness, there are certain risks of this method, e.g. injuries to
      the nerves and vessels, excessive bleedings, pneumothorax, cardiac arrhythmias etc.
      Noninvasive pulse contour Analysis (NPCA) is a new method which is able to determine
      hemodynamics noninvasively via a finger cuff. Advantages towards pulmonary artery
      Catheterization include a lower risk and an operator-Independent easy handling. Some studies
      investigated the accuracy, precision and trend abilities of noninvasive pulse contour
      analysis during anesthesia and in the intensive care unit, but there is no data for its use
      in patients with chronic heart failure. The investigators therefore initiated this Trial to
      verify if NPCA is suitable for Determination of hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart
      failure. For NPCA the investigators use the CNAP monitor (CNSystems Medizintechnik AG). As a
      reference method the investigators use intermittent thermodilution via PAC (TD). Three
      averaged autocalibrated NPCA-CO-measurements are going to be validated against three averaged
      TD-CO-measurements. Moreover, measurements of cardiac index, stroke volume, systemic vascular
      resistance and a between-calibration-drift will be performed. The investigators will assess
      the accuracy and precision of the individual values.
