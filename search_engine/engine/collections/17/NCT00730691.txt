      of vortioxetine, once daily, 60 mg of duloxetine once daily, or a placebo once daily for
      eight weeks.

      Participants will be seen weekly during the first 2 weeks of treatment, and then every 2
      weeks up to the end of the 8-week treatment period. Participants who complete the 8-week
      treatment period will enter a 2-week discontinuation period in order to assess potential
      discontinuation symptoms. Total commitment time is up to 12 weeks.
