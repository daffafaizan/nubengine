      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
           breast cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate and paclitaxel versus placebo and
           paclitaxel as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the objective response rate and duration of response in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for
           Breast Cancer quality of life assessment score in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to site of metastatic disease (visceral [i.e., soft internal organs of the body,
      including lungs, heart, and the organs of the digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems]
      vs nonvisceral [i.e., osseous or soft tissue] sites). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 3 weeks. Patients also
           receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I and oral placebo twice daily on days
           1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, and every 8 weeks for 24 weeks, and then every 12
      weeks for the duration of study participation.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 months.
