      control of malaria. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT)
      evaluation, there will be a comprehensive evaluation of phased introduction of combination
      anti-malarials (CAT) in Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. In order to facilitate
      formulation of an effective regional drug policy and provide a database for decision-making
      on the implementation of combination therapy, it is essential that the in vivo response to
      CAT in all three countries be investigated. An SP therapeutic efficacy study will be
      conducted according to this modified World Health Organization (WHO) protocol to guide the
      selection of CAT. After CAT is introduced an in vivo CAT efficacy study will then be
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy of artesunate plus SP (or artemether-lumefantrine in
      KwaZulu Natal and Limpopo). In areas of low intensity malaria transmission the CAT in vivo
      study results will be compared across sites and with those found at baseline with
      monotherapy, for each site.
