    
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple doses of MB-102 in participants with normal and impaired kidney function; to
      determine plasma pharmacokinetics of MB-102 compared to the pharmacokinetics of iohexol in
      participants with normal and impaired kidney function; to demonstrate that
      MB-102-transdermal-fluorescence-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the optical
      renal function monitor (ORFM) Brilliance device is aligned with MB-102 plasma GFR; to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ORFM investigational medical device prototypes
      QuantumLeap, Radiance, and Brilliance for the non-invasive transdermal fluorescent detection
      of MB-102 in participants with a range of skin color types; and to determine the optimal dose
      of MB-102 for non-invasive measurement.
