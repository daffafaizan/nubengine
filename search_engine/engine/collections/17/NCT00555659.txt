      instrumented ALIF procedure. Comparisons in all variables will be made across diagnostic
      categories. Comparisons between type of interbody spacer, graft type, and type of
      instrumentation will also be made.

      This study is part of a larger Continuous Quality Improvement initiative at the Columbia
      Orthopaedic Group. The purpose of this effort is to improve surgical and non-surgical
      outcomes by using rigorous statistical analysis of our outcomes to guide our treatment
      decisions. Through an iterative feedback process we hope to optimize patient outcomes.
