      tolerability of Acthar versus oral prednisone in the treatment of MS relapses. Potential
      subjects will be identified during routine clinical evaluations. If patient is determined to
      be having a study-defined MS relapse, they will be invited to participate in this study.
      After consent is obtained, the patient will complete the first page of the ARMS survey. If
      prior steroid use was deemed tolerable then only the first page of the ARMS will be collected
      and analyzed and these patients will complete their participation in the trial. Their data
      from the ARMS will provide an estimate as to the number of patients who self-report
      tolerability and efficacy issues with steroids. However, if patients self-report prior
      steroid intolerability, then they will advance into the Acthar treatment arm of the trial.
