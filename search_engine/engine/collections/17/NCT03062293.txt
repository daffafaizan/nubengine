    
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether an six-week FRED exercise intervention
      reduces low back pain (LBP) and improves a range of related outcomes.

      The objectives of this study are to examine

        1. whether FRED exercise reduces mechanical LBP ( low back pain);

        2. whether FRED exercise improves functional and static balance in people with LBP;

        3. whether FRED exercise has an effect on cross-sectional area (CSA) of relevant
           lumbo-pelvic muscles;

        4. whether FRED exercise has an effect on TrA (Transversus Abdominis), LM ( Lumbar
           Multifidus), lumbar Erector Spinae, External and Internal Oblique muscle activity and
           function in individuals with LBP;

        5. whether FRED exercise has an effect on TrA and internal oblique muscle thickness;

        6. the rate of muscle physiology change in response to FRED exercise in people with LBP;

        7. whether FRED exercise affects the analgesic intake, need for intervention and physical
           activity level of individuals with LBP;

        8. whether FRED exercise affects wellbeing and every-day function in people with LBP;

        9. the rate of change of level of pain, wellbeing and of function (incl. balance) in
           response to FRED exercise in people with LBP.
