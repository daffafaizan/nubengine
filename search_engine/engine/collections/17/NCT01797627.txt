      ventricle size and poorer cognitive outcomes. This uncertainty stems from relatively few
      studies, problems with study design (possible confounding factors), varying study populations
      of hydrocephalus, and conflicting evidence. If the association is proven then aggressive
      strategies must be developed to maximally decrease ventricular size in these children to
      preserve long-term cognitive functioning. However, if the association is disproven then
      previous reservations for procedures such as Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) or
      higher-resistance shunting to prevent overdrainage complications will be further minimized.
      Either finding has a major potential to further improve the quality of life in our pediatric
      hydrocephalus patients. This study is unique as it will include pediatric patients presenting
      with hydrocephalus from a wide range of etiologies. This study is also unique in that we
      propose to conduct a brief pre-operative neuropsychological examination to act as internal
      controls along with the outcomes obtained at a more extensive neuropsychological examination
      at six months after initial hydrocephalus treatment surgery.
