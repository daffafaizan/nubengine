      intravenous sedation for pediatric radiotherapy(RT) patients in terms of success of the
      procedure (continuous completion of the RT session by providing inactivity) and complications
      such as desaturation, hypoventilation, airway spasm, bradycardia, tachycardia In addition, we
      aimed to investigate the incidence of anesthesia complications in RT patients and possible
      related factors with complications.
