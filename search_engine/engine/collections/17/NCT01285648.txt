      the lung parenchyma and alterations in the ventilatory function may trigger retention of
      secretions, atelectasis, pneumonia and respiratory failure, which prolong the duration of
      mechanical ventilation and hospitalisation and contribute to the increase in risk of
      mortality.

      In this study the oxygenation index (OI), Borg Scale, pain scale and the presence and
      duration of thoracic drainage was determined in the immediate postoperative (POi) period and
      in the first and second postoperative (PO1, PO2) days in 40 patients who underwent elective
      lung resection.

      Similar to Chest Physiotherapy, the preventive application of CPAP in the postoperative
      period after lung resection in our study also appeared to be a safe technique, which allowed
      improved oxygenation without increasing air leaks through the thoracic drains.
