      Aneurysms (AAA) measuring 3-5 cm in maximal transverse diameter (MTD). This study will assess
      the safety of MSCs in doses of 1 million MSCs/kg. or 3 million MSCs/kg. delivered
      intra-venously. This trial test the hypothesis that MSCs, in a dose dependent fashion,
      promote the frequency and immune suppressor function of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells
      and decrease AAA inflammation as measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of
      treatment related adverse events accrued over 24 months. Efficacy measures are changes in
      frequency and immune suppressor function of Tregs, number and cytotoxic activity of CD4+/CD8+
      CD28- T-cells, activated monocytes, and changes in aortic inflammation as measured by uptake
      of 18-FDG PET/CT compared to baseline. Incidence of surgical intervention, aneurysm related
      death, quality of life, and major adverse cardiac events will be recorded.
