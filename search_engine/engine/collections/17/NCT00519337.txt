      Despite prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers and amiodarone, post-operative atrial
      fibrillation occurs in approximately 22% of patients. We believe that by reducing the
      inflammation that is caused during CTS, we can see further improvements without any negative
      effects on hemodynamics. Ascorbic acid, a free radical scavenger has been found to lower
      inflammation mediators but never in a CTS population. This study will help determine the
      affect of ascorbic acid on the inflammation associated with CTS.
