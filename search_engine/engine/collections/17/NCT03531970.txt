      to local anesthetics in regional block injections. These investigations shown that the
      addition of dexamethasone to local anaesthetics may prolong the duration of anesthesia and
      also results in a faster onset. It is hypothesized that dexamethasone added to lidocaine may
      affect the success rate of inferior alveolar nerve block
