      of glutamate release, due to low cysteine-glutamate antiporter activity. Because of this
      mechanism, we are interested in whether acute administration of N-Acetylcysteine will improve
      performance of patients with schizophrenia on a battery of cognitive tasks utilized to test
      working memory and other cognitive domains, versus placebo. This pilot study will utilize a
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design.
