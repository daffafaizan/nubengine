      disease. Tralokinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-13, which may result in
      improved control of asthma. This study will determine whether the addition of tralokinumab to
      standard asthma medications results in a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations in subjects
      with severe asthma.
