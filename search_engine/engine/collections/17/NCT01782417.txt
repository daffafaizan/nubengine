      the most common causes of disability in this county. In addition, is associated with
      significant physical activity limitations, increased prevalence of obesity, decreased health
      related quality of life, and increased health care costs. Hispanics are affected by arthritis
      at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to non-Hispanic whites and African Americans.
      However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributed
      activity limitations (primarily related to OA), are less likely to receive hip replacement
      independent of health care access, and are less likely to receive knee replacement. In
      addition, there have been very few interventions to improve either medical or behavioral
      aspects of OA treatment recommendations among the Hispanic population. The study will
      developed and test a culturally appropriate Spanish educational materials and telephone
      scripts for the patient- and provider-based interventions and will test the patient and
      provider intervention in a group of Adult Hispanics with OA.
