      an unpredictable disease. Although some physicians can make some predictions about expected
      progression, the variable course of exacerbations makes it almost impossible to predict how
      MS will develop or affect function over time. As a result, people with MS must learn to live
      in a state of chronic uncertainty and the ability to tolerate and cope with this kind of
      uncertainty is central to quality of life with MS. Individuals who require certainty about
      the future and are not able to tolerate ambiguity are said to be high in a personality trait
      known as intolerance of uncertainty (IU). There is a significant gap in MS clinical
      intervention that necessitates attention. An intervention that specifically targets IU, is
      developed for people recently diagnosed with MS, and can be provided remotely via telehealth
      can make a significant impact for this population. Study aims include: (1) to determine the
      efficacy of CBT-UT relative to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (tCBT) or treatment
      as usual (TAU) in people diagnosed with MS in the past 3 years; and (2) To increase our
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying the intervention effects.
