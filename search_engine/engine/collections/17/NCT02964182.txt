      I. To characterize the effects of dual use of very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCC)
      and electronic cigarettes (ECIG) on abuse liability (nicotine compensation and product use,
      liking, and relative reinforcing efficacy [RRE]) and toxicant exposure among daily (DS)
      smokers.

      II. To characterize the effects of dual use of VLNCC and ECIG on abuse liability (nicotine
      compensation and product use, liking, and RRE) and toxicant exposure among intermittent (ITS)
      smokers.

      III. To characterize the effects of dual product use on abuse liability using measure of
      withdrawal, craving, affect, and satisfaction (reinforcement).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To characterize the effects of dual use of VLNCC and JUUL ECIG on abuse liability
      (nicotine compensation and product use, liking, and RRE) and toxicant exposure among daily
      (DS) smokers.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients smoke their usual cigarettes brand during week 1.

      PHASE II: Patients smoke VLNCC cigarettes provided during weeks 2-4.

      PHASES III-IV: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients smoke ECIG-high (Hi) for 3 weeks and then ECIG-low (Lo) for 3 weeks

      ARM II: Patients smoke ECIG-Lo for 3 weeks and then ECIG-Hi for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
