      patients hospitalized with acute Heart Failure (HF). Through the use of the information
      collected from acute care hospitals across the United States the following information may be
      coming out of this study: 1) Assist hospitals in evaluating and improving quality of care for
      patients with acute HF by tracking quality indicators and providing benchmark data reports;
      2) Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who are hospitalized
      with acute HF; 3) Characterize the initial emergency department evaluation and subsequent
      inpatient management of patients hospitalized with acute HF; 4) Identify patient
      characteristics and medical care practices associated with improved health outcomes in those
      hospitalized with acute HF; 5) Characterize trends and changes over time in the management of
      acute HF; 6) Offer surveillance of adherence to practice guidelines as these emerge for the
      inpatient management of acute HF. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
