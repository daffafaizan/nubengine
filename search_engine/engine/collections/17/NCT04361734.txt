      both adult and juvenile onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This suggests that defects
      in fat levels could contribute to disease pathogenesis. The immune system in patients with
      SLE does not work normally. In adult patients with SLE we know that many of the immune cells
      involved in protecting the body from infections or cancer are over-active and actually cause
      disease. In young people the immune system is still developing and very little is known about
      what goes wrong in patients that develop juvenile-onset SLE, whether this is the same as
      adult disease and whether the same treatments are relevant for this group of patients. This
      project aims to find out whether immune cells from SLE patients with adult-onset disease have
      the same defects as adult patients with juvenile-onset SLE. We know that an important factor
      that controls immune cell behaviour is the amount of fat that they have on their surface. We
      also know that a change in fat on immune cells from adult patients with SLE makes them
      defective. This project will investigate the level of fat in the blood and in immune cells
      from adult patients with juvenile-onset SLE and age matched healthy controls, and measure how
      changes in the amount of fat can affect the way immune cells behave. We will investigate how
      drugs that control fat levels can help to normalize the behaviour of immune cells from SLE
      patients.
