      probes. Vasoconstriction may reduce the reliability of PVI measurements in pediatric surgical
      patients prone to hypothermia. The vascular structure of the forehead area is resistant to
      changes in vasomotor tonus. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of PVI values
      measured at the finger and forehead areas to predict fluid responsiveness in these patients.

      Fifty pediatric patients with obtained parental consent and ethics committee approval
      underwent elective minor surgery were included into the study. Basic monitoring, finger and
      forehead perfusion index (PI) and PVI monitoring were applied. Hemodynamic parameters, PI,
      PVI, cardiac output (CO) values were recorded. The 15% increase in CO with passive leg raise
      (PLR) maneuver was estimated as fluid responsiveness. Two groups were created: Group R (fluid
      responsive); Group NR (fluid nonresponsive). Mann-Whitney U, t, chi-square and ROC tests were
      used in statistical evaluation.
