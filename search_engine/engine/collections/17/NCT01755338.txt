      cerebrospinal inflammatory markers. In this study we aim to investigate if this inflammatory
      response can be reduced after treatment with steroids.

      30 patients will be randomized to intraoperative treatment with either placebo or
      methylprednisolone 15mg/kg. CSF and blood will be collected the day before and the day after
      surgery, analyzed for markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8), neuronal damage (S-100) and blood
      brain barrier function (alb).
