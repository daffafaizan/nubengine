      multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is a pressing concern since older adults with depression
      face persistent health disparities. The Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST)
      research team seeks to address these health inequities, and improve health outcomes in this
      vulnerable and under-served population by developing and implementing an intervention that
      will improve patients' self-management ability, support their families and caregivers, and
      build capacity for primary care and other health and non-health providers to collaborate in
      delivering home and community services. The proposed study builds on our pilot study that
      evaluated a nurse-led intervention for older adult home care clients with MCC and depressive
      symptoms and demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and effective in reducing
      depressive symptoms.

      The overall aim of the study is to improve care transitions in older adults with MCC and
      depressive symptoms. The project will address three research questions:

        1. What is the effect of a new, nurse-led hospital-to-home transitional care intervention
           compared to usual care on health outcomes and costs for older adults with MCC and
           depressive symptoms?

        2. How is a care transition intervention adapted and implemented in diverse settings?

        3. What is required to sustain and scale up the intervention? We hypothesize that the
           intervention will improve health outcomes and reduce use of expensive health services
           compared to usual care at no additional cost, from a societal perspective.
