      to conventional multiport hysterectomy. Procedures are performed by an experienced
      two-surgeon team. Patients are randomized to either conventional multiport hysterectomy
      (N=62) or R-SSH (N=62). Eligibility criteria are the same as for study 1. Patient's
      satisfaction with body image and cosmesis is assessed at different time points pre- and
      postoperatively by means of validated cosmesis scales and Body Image Questionnaire.
      Postoperative pain and analgesia use will be registered as well as secondary outcome
      parameters as described above. A follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 month include evaluation of the scar
      and registration of port-site hernias and vaginal dehiscence or other complications.
      Interviews and diaries will include time of return to home and work, daily activities
      including sexuality The R-SSH is performed using da Vinci, Xi robotic system. One single
      port, diameter 2 cm is applied. Applying an additional assistant port is defined conversion
      of procedure The laparoscopy is performed using our standard equipment and 4 trocars, 5 mm
      each.

      Socio-economical consequences of R-SSH versus conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy Study
      details in preparation

      Sample size calculation was based a previous study on fast track hysterectomy, which showed a
      difference in return to work of 4 days. 62 women in each group is needed with standard
      deviation ±8 and a power of 80%. To include those not working, we calculated that with an
      expected visual analog pain score of 0.86 ±0.2 and 62 in each group the sample was sufficient
      to detect of difference of 0.1 in visual analog pain score with a power of 80%. All
      calculation are based on two-sided testing with alpha of 0.05.
