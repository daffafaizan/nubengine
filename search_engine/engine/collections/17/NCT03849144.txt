      repeated measures design will be used to compare study participant outcomes between a
      treatment (therapy dog activity) and comparison (low impact physical activity) condition.
      Outcome variables of interest are perceived stress measured by a stress visual analog scale
      (SVAS), mood measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and job satisfaction
      and commitment measured by an investigator-developed Job Satisfaction Survey (consisting of a
      combination of existing validated scales). Pet ownership, attitudes toward dogs measured by
      the Dog Attitude Scale, and trait stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, will be
      assessed as moderating variables.
