    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      RO4929097 (gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097) given 3 days on, 4 days off in combination
      with weekly paclitaxel and every 3 weeks carboplatin that will not cause a 30% or more
      decrease in paclitaxel area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC)0-24hr on day 15
      compared to day -1 in patients with clinical stage II-III triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure real-time pharmacokinetics of RO4929097 when administered in combination with
      weekly paclitaxel and every 3 weeks carboplatin in patients with stage II-III TNBC.

      II. To measure real-time pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when administered in combination with
      RO4929097 (3 days on, 4 days off) and every 3 weeks carboplatin in patients with stage II-III
      TNBC.

      III. To evaluate the rate of pathologic and clinical complete response to the treatment with
      combination of RO492097, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in patients with clinical stage II-III
      TNBC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097).

      Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3,
      8-10, and 15-17, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 (day -1
      of course one), and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 4 weeks
      after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo definitive breast surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
