      studies, but the mechanisms underlying this reduction remain largely unknown. The present
      study will investigate this phenomenon, and whether confirmed, the inspiratory muscle loading
      would be a new approach for lowering glucose levels and glucose variability in type 2
      diabetes.

      The subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited from the ambulatory of the Hospital de
      Clinicas de Porto Alegre. The patients will be randomized to inspiratory muscle exercise with
      a high intensity load (MIP 60%) or to exercise with a load placebo (MIP 2%), on two different
      days. The subjects will come in the laboratory for three days consecutively during 2 weeks.
      On the first day will be placed the CGMS device. On the second day will be the controlled
      ventilation protocol with subsequently inspiratory muscle exercise, using 2% or 60% of MIP as
      randomized a priori. On the third day the CGMS will be removed. Individuals who are using
      beta-blockers will be advised to withdraw the medication 24 hours before the protocols.
      During all protocols will be recorded the continuous blood pressure to assess heart rate and
      blood pressure variabilities, both time and frequency domains will be analyzed. Also, the
      calf blood flow, inspiratory pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation will be
      taking.
