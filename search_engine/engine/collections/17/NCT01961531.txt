      to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered in a more convenient 5 fraction
      schedule using non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) (AccuBoost System) in
      women with resected, early stage breast cancer.

      Non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB), using advanced image-guided radiation
      technology, has the potential to eliminate the disadvantages of the conventional APBI
      techniques. NIBB facilitates non-invasive partial breast irradiation without the use of
      catheters or implants. Yet by using breast immobilization and precise image-guidance, it
      reduces non-target breast tissue within the irradiated field compared with other non-invasive
      APBI techniques such as 3D-CRT. This has made NIBB an attractive approach to deliver APBI.

      We hypothesize that NIBB delivered in 5 treatments will be a more convenient, safe and
      effective modality to deliver partial breast irradiation.

      Anticipated advantages of NIBB protocol treatment include:

        -  Convenient treatment schedule

        -  Short course can allow for increased patient access to treatment

        -  Non-invasive approach

        -  Increased accuracy with precise targeting of lumpectomy cavity using advanced imaging

        -  Reduced irradiation of non-target breast tissue

        -  Reduced skin toxicity

        -  No heart or lung radiation exposure

        -  Reduced late skin or breast toxicity

        -  High rate of good or excellent cosmetic outcome

        -  High rate of ipsilateral breast tumor control comparable to other APBI techniques
