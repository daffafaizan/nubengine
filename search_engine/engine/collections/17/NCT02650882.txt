      muscle strength and aerobic physical performance of handball players. Nineteen male athletes
      took part in the study, divided into the experimental group (EG), which took part in the
      evaluations, maintained their regular sporting activities and carried out the IMT (n=10), and
      the placebo group (PG), which took part in the evaluations, maintained their regular sporting
      activities and carried out an IMT with a load considered to be placebo (n=09), Experimental
      procedures were carried out by trained researchers and a qualified team. The evaluations and
      IMT were carried out during the competitive season, the training frequency being based on the
      competition program, following the traditional annual model.

      The athletes were submitted to an initial evaluation composed of measuring the respiratory
      muscle strength (RMS) using a manovacuometer, and an evaluation of the aerobic physical
      performance carried out using the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).

      The athletes were reevaluated after 12 weeks for subsequent analysis and comparison with the
      initial values.

      All the subjects were previously informed about the experimental procedures, and signed a
      free and clarified term of consent. The project was approved by the Ethics in Research
      Committee of the Institution with the number 62/13.
