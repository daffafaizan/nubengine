      osteoarthritis (OA) in Norway has a potential for improvement as the provided care may not
      necessarily reflect evidence-based guideline recommendations. The overall purpose of the
      "Improve Osteoarthritis Care" study is that people with symptomatic hip and knee OA should
      receive care in line with current recommendations. To achieve this goal, tailored
      implementation strategies will be applied in order to: 1) Improve the quality of care offered
      to people with symptomatic hip and knee OA, 2) increase knowledge of recommended OA care
      among people with hip and knee OA, 3) Increase the number of primary care physiotherapists'
      offering group-based patient-education and structured exercise as part of their routine
      clinical practice, 4) Increase the number of general practitioners who have received a
      summary of the OA treatment recommendations.

      To evaluate the effect of the tailored implementation strategy a pre-post design will be
      applied, and members of the Norwegian Rheumatology Association with self-reported hip or knee
      OA will be asked to evaluate quality of OA care at the two timepoints.
