      and hyperalgesia following nerve injury. The pain-suppressing properties of soy protein have
      been shown to be predominately the result of soy pre-operative consumption.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for women diagnosed
      with breast cancer and scheduled to undergo breast cancer surgery. The trial will comprise
      two phases: 1. A 2-week preoperative dietary manipulation phase, and 2. A one-year
      postoperative follow up period. In the first phase eligible candidates will undergo a basic
      dietary evaluation followed by stratification into 4 study groups, based on their pre-vs.
      postmenopausal status and the planned type of surgery, i.e., formal mastectomy vs.
      breast-conserving surgery. Women in each group will be randomized to receive either powdered
      soy protein in the experimental group or milk protein in the control group. During the
      second, post-surgical phase women will resume their normal diet. If shown to be beneficial,
      this simple dietary manipulation may prevent one of the most severe sequelae of breast
      cancer.
