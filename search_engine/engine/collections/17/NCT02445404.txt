      but did not get satisfactory effect of therapy (progression-free survival 40%), primarily to
      consider the clinical trial at NCCN guideline.But why the CHOP regimen is widely used because
      physicians are accustomed to use. Fractionated ICED therapy is a therapy by adjusting the
      Original ICE regimen.This is how the capacity of Ifosfamide divided into three days.
      (Fractionated ifosfamide).Original ICE therapy has been widely used as a salvage therapy of
      patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma for a long time, it has been recommended as
      part of primary therapy of T-cell lymphoma.But Fractionated ICED is added to dexamethasone
      therapy in order to improve the effectiveness as a primary therapy.The recurrent lymphoma in
      75 patients with treatment after Fractionated ICE when the self-stem cell transplantation,
      showed a more than 40% progression-free survival.Thus treatment of Fractionated ICED
      targeting previously untreated patients, and if a combination of high-dose dexamethasone to
      expect to be able to induce a progression-free survival of 60% or more.
