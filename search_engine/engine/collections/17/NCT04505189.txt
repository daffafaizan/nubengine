    
      Anorexia nervosa is the most fatal of all psychiatric conditions. With the current paucity of
      effective pharmacological and psychological treatments, and fewer than half of those
      diagnosed making a full recovery, there is a great need for new treatment avenues to be
      explored. For this study, we will recruit patients who have been suffering from a DSM-V
      diagnosis of anorexia nervosa for 3 years or more, and who have found other forms of
      treatment ineffective. Over a period of 6 weeks, participants who are deemed eligible at
      screening will partake in 8 study visits, including three psilocybin dosing sessions with
      varying doses. The maximum dose of psilocybin a participant will receive in a single session
      is 25 mg. Across these 8 visits, there will also be 2 MRI scans, up to 5 EEG recordings and a
      range of psychological measures (questionnaires and interviews). There will be a follow-up
      period of 12 months following the final study visit.
