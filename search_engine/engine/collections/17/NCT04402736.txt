      patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Early rehabilitation in acute
      phase is beneficial for improving patient's activity of daily livings and motor function.
      However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke
      because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in
      China. The investigators assume that implementing program based on modified Barthel Index can
      realize nursing-directed motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic stroke. The
      present study is to conduct quasi-experimental research to confirm the feasibility and
      effectiveness of nursing-directed precision rehabilitation in acute stroke patients.
