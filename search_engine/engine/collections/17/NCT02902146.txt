      characteristic (defined as any of: cervical immobility, obesity, large tongue, short neck,
      small mandible, facial or neck trauma, airway edema, blood in the airway, or vomit in the
      airway).

      We will also analyze all outcomes for all patients enrolled, regardless of whether they have
      a difficult airway characteristic.

      We plan to enroll 374 patients with a difficult airway characteristic (DAC). The total
      enrollment for the trial will be higher, depending on the proportion of patients that have a
      DAC.

      Based on observational data, we aim to detect a 9% absolute difference in first pass success
      (95% with bougie compared to 86% without the bougie), which requires enrollment of 374
      patients with a DAC.

      To help achieve balanced randomization for patients with a DAC, patients are stratified into
      two groups: 1) obese or cervical immobilization present and 2) not obese and no cervical
      immobilization.
