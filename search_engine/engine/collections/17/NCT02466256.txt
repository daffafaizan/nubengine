    
      In this randomized, clinical trial, three types of injectors were compared :

        1. Manual, screw type injector (Monarch III)

        2. Manual, plunger type injector (Royale, ASICO)

        3. Motorized injector (Autosert, Alcon)

      Having performed a phacoemulsification through 2.2mm incision, IOL implantation was performed
      using a D cartridge and one of three injectors which was decided in a randomized fashion.

      The investigators evaluated incision enlargement at following points : at the end of
      phacoemulsification, and then, at the end of IOL implantation The investigators also looked
      at trypan blue ingress into the anterior chamber from the ocular surface. At 1 day, 1 week,
      and 1 month after surgery anterior segment OCT morphology was also studied.

      further, the surgeon was asked to subjectively grade the ease of implantation with each
      injector
