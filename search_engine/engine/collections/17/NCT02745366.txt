      (BFPSCs) is harvested from buccal fat pad tissues. The BFPSCs will be loaded on freeze dried
      bone allograft (FDBA) (SureOss, Hansbiomed, Korea). Furthermore, twenty milliliters of the
      venous blood is obtained, placed and collected in a sterile tube, and centrifuged (GAC
      medical) for 14 minutes at 2800 rpm (approximately 400 g). Following centrifugation, three
      layers are separated in the tube: cellular plasma at the top, platelet rich fibrin (PRF) clot
      in the middle and red blood cells at the bottom of the tube. The PRF clot is separated by a
      sterile pincette.

      The patients in the test group receives BFPSCs loaded on FDBA with PRF for posterior mandible
      augmentation and the control group receives combination of PRF and FDBA (lacking any cells).
      The BFPSCs+FDBA+PRF in the test group and FDBA+PRF in the control group are placed in the gap
      between the block graft and recipient site. The results will be evaluated by cone beam
      computed tomography (CBCT) in 6 months and microscopic evaluation of the biopsies by
      hematoxylin and eosine staining during implant placement.
