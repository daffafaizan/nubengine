      patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. Up
      to 44 qualified patients will be enrolled according to the exact single stage design.

      Irinotecan 90 mg/m2 intravenously for 90 minutes once a week for 2 weeks (Days 1 and 8)
      followed by 1-week rest period. Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2
      twice daily (total daily dose 2,000 mg/m2) as an intermittent regimen in 3-week cycles (2
      weeks of treatment followed by a 1-week rest period). For practical reasons, capecitabine
      doses are rounded to the nearest dose that could be administered with a combination of 500-mg
      and 150-mg tablets of drug. Capecitabine is given approximately 12 hours apart and taken
      orally with water within 30 minutes after ingestion of food (breakfast or dinner).
