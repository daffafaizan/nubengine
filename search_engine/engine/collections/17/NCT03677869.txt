      of the inner retinal layers for eyes with VMT and full-thickness MHs treated with PVL.
      Understanding the rates of VMT release and MH closures in eyes with full-thickness MH treated
      with PVL is of interest. Surgery would result in nearly 100% hole closure and VMT release,
      making vitrectomy a poor control group choice. Spontaneous resolution of MH is highly
      unlikely, making an observation arm unnecessary. Therefore, these eyes will be enrolled into
      a non-randomized cohort treated with PVL to assess the outcomes of treatment.
