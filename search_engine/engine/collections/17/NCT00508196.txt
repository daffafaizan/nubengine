      CO at rest and exercise, and on endothelial function and B-type natriuretic peptide, BNP, in
      patients with heart failure.

      Methods: Thirty patients with dual chamber pacemakers for sinus node disease will be
      recruited: 15 controls with normal LV function and 15 with stable impaired LV function
      (ejection fraction <40%). The pacemaker will be programmed to pace to back-up pacing at 55bpm
      in the atrial only (AAI, no right VP) for one week (baseline); and than programmed to
      overdrive pacing at 70-80bpm, randomised to either to dual chamber, DDD (sequential atrial
      and ventricular pacing) with a short AV delay (to ensure maximal right VP) or AAI (no RV
      pacing), for 1 week. There will be a crossover after a 1 week washout at backup AAI pacing at
      55 bpm. Resting and exercise CO will be measured at the end of each pacing mode intervention
      using the Inocor system (a validated non invasive method of CO measurement, using inhaled
      inert gas equilibriums). Endothelial function will be measured non-invasively at the same
      time points, as will plasma BNP, a measure of LV strain. Patients with unstable heart failure
      or angina will be excluded.

      Study Endpoints: Rest and exercise CO; and endothelial function and BNP with and without RV
      pacing, in patients with preserved and impaired LV function.
