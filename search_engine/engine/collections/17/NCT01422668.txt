      societies. This study was designed to determine the effect of coffee consumption on the
      glycemic index of a common variety of dates (Khalas) tested in healthy subjects and
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Methods:Composition analysis was carried out for Khalas dates (Tamer stage) and the weight of
      the dates flesh equivalent to 50 g of available carbohydrate was calculated. The study
      subjects were thirteen healthy volunteers with a mean (± SD) age of 40.2 ± 6.7 years and ten
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (controlled on lifestyle measures and/or
      metformin) with a mean HbA1c (± SD) of 6.6 ± (0.7 %) and a mean age (± SD) of 40.8 ± 5.7
      years. Each subject was tested on five separate days with 50 g of glucose (on 3 occasions)
      and 50 g equivalent of available carbohydrates from the dates without coffee (on one
      occasion) and with coffee (on another occasion). Capillary glucose was measured in the
      healthy subjects at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min and for the diabetics at 0, 30, 60, 90,
      120, 150 and 180 min. The glycemic indices were determined as ratios of the incremental areas
      under the response curves for the dates alone/with coffee compared to glucose. Statistical
      analyses were performed using Student's t-tests.
