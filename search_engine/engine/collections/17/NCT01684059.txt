      spermatozoa kinetic characteristics. These studies reported that NO may react with superoxide
      or hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the production of peroxinitrite, hydroxyl radical, or
      singlet oxygen, which cause oxidation of sperm membrane lipids and thiol proteins. NO also
      may inhibit cellular respiration by nitro-sylation of heme in mitochondrial enzymes,
      aconitase, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to a reduction of adenosine
      triphosphate and that is due to loss of motility of spermatozoa.
