      from schizophrenia. Motivational deficits seem to be one of the main barriers in the process
      of "functional recovery" among those patients and have been shown to be very treatment
      resistant. Effects of pharmacological compounds are at best moderate. There are some
      psychotherapeutic intervention studies that show promise but further controlled trials are
      needed to clarify the specific treatment effects.

      Therefore, patients shall be encouraged to remember memories that stand in an association
      with specific motives. Motives are conscious and unconscious affect-based needs that are
      activated by behavior and influence behavior toward specific incentives in specific
      circumstances. They influence the selection of everyday goals and have influence on the
      degree of the progress people are making towards these goals. The intervention is based on
      the assumption that a positive expectation of the future is constituted among others by
      positive experiences from the past and at the same time increases the motivation for future
      behaviour. The activation of specific, motive-associated memories from autobiographical
      memory and their transformation into images of the future by means of imaginative methods
      could be a possible way of strengthening certain motives and thus increasing motivation for
      certain behaviour. This is mainly because there is evidence that psychosis patients have
      difficulties specifically remembering memories, i.e. those that happened on only one day. In
      addition, there is a diminished ability to create specific images of their personal future.
