      rich meal will promote the absorption of provitamin A carotenoids and enhance the delivery of
      greater quantities of vitamin A. This objective will be accomplished by quantitation of the
      immediate post-prandial plasma concentrations of parent carotenoids and vitamin A metabolites
      after subjects consume a meal with or without avocado in combination with a serving of tomato
      sauce (containing nutritionally relevant amounts of beta-carotene) or carrots.

      The secondary objective of this study will be to determine if higher levels of carotenoids
      and other antioxidants transported in the bloodstream will have a protective role in
      promoting cardiovascular health. This objective will be accomplished by testing the oxidation
      capacity of lipoprotein fractions before and after meal supplementation.
