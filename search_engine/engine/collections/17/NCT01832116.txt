      of heterogeneity that is present in specific tumor types. The ability to safely and
      accurately predict the presence or absence of the target is essential for the therapeutic
      effect of the newly developed drugs. DMOT0439A is one of those novel designed molecular
      targeted drugs; an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the monoclonal antibody MMOT0530A and
      the mitotic agent monomethyl auristatin (MMAE). In the DMO4993g protocol (clinicaltrials.gov
      identifier NCT01469793), the safety and efficacy of DMOT4039A is assessed in patients with
      unresectable pancreatic or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. By performing a 89Zr-MMOT0530A
      PET scan prior to treatment with DMOT4039A, the uptake of the tracer in the primary and
      metastatic tumor lesions can be evaluated. This is likely to provide important information
      about target expression, whole body drug distribution and the correlation between tumor
      uptake and response to therapy. Ultimately the use of a 89Zr- MMOT0530A PET as a
      complimentary tool for patient selection and risk stratification can be evaluated. In part A
      of this study, the optimal tracer dose of 89Zr- MMOT0530A and schedule for PET imaging will
      be determined. In part B patients will have PET imaging before treatment in the DMO4993g
      study on the dose and time points as assessed in part A.
