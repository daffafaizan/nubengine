      monitor (similar to a pedometer) for 7 consecutive days and complete a packet of
      questionnaires. The questionnaires will take about 45 minutes to complete. All materials will
      be sent to participants via the US Postal Service and will need to be mailed back in the
      provided self-addressed stamped envelopes within 2 weeks. Participants will be asked to
      repeat these same assessments again in 6 months. NO lab visits will be required for
      participation. Women from all across the U.S. who have been diagnosed with breast cancer at
      any point in their lives are being sought. There is no limit on time since diagnosis or
      treatment status.
