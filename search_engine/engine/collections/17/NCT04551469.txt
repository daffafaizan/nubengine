      the standard of care group. It was estimated this sample size would be needed to detect a
      medium effects size of .30 with an alpha set at a level of .05.

      Patients, who agree to participate, will be randomly allocated to one of two groups,
      treatment and standard of care group using a computer-generated randomization scheme.

      On post-operative day one, a 30-minute music period will be used through personal headphones
      and a MP3 device. Music will be a selection that is symphonic music that has no dramatic
      changes. The standard of care group will listen to environmental sounds in the Cardiac
      Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

      Psychological, and physical responses as well as biomarkers will be collected pre and then 30
      minutes after the start of the intervention period in both groups. The psychological response
      will be assessed by the Spielberger State Anxiety Scale to measure state anxiety and a visual
      analogue scale for measurement of pain. Physical responses will be collected that includes
      Blood pressure in mmHg, heart rate in beats per minute and respirations in beats per minute.
      The biomarkers collected will be serum cortisol measured in micrograms per deciliter and
      Immunoglobulin in milligrams per deciliter.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample and the outcomes measure will be
      compared using a student t-test.
