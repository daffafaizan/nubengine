      accident. He suffered traumatic anterolisthesis at T10-11 with associated spinal cord
      transection and obliteration of the central canal. He and his family are requesting this
      Individual Patient Expanded Access IND with the purpose of possible restoration of nerve
      transmission and restoring sensation in his lower body using intravenous autologous adipose
      derived mesenchymal stem cells. This study will give 14 infusions of 200 million HB-adMSC's
      over a 52 week period.
