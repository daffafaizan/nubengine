      complete a glycogen depletion protocol, cycling at various intensities until failure.
      Participants will then consume a carbohydrate (CHO: 1 g/kg/hr) or an energy free control
      (CON) beverage matched for taste and color during the first 3-hr post glycogen depletion. For
      the remainder of the day participants will consume a diet designed to adequately (6.0 g
      CHO/kg/d) or inadequately (1.2 g CHO/kg/d) replenish glycogen stores. The following day
      participants will to complete 80-min of steady-state (~60% VO2peak) cycle ergometry consuming
      carbohydrate at a rate of 1.8 g/min enriched with a stable isotope of carbon to determine
      exogenous carbohydrate efficiency when glycogen stores are low or adequate at the onset of
      exercise.

      Following a minimum 7-d washout period volunteers will return to the laboratory to complete
      the second arm of the investigation. To ensure glycogen stores are similar between volunteers
      on testing day, 48-hrs prior to testing all volunteers will complete a glycogen depletion
      protocol and then consume a diet providing 6.0 g/kg/d carbohydrate to replenish glycogen
      stores.
