      II. Provide a repository for long-term storage of malignant, borderline malignant neoplasms,
      and related biological specimens from these patients.

      III. Make specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of cancer in
      these patients.

      Tumor tissue samples, blood, and bone marrow aspirates are collected and stored for future
      analysis.
