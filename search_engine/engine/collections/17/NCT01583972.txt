      given with BCG and oral polio virus (OPV) immunization within 48 h of birth on immune
      function in 300 Bangladeshi infants (150 in each group) at risk of vitamin A deficiency
      recruited in a poor community of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Infants will be followed from birth
      through 15 wk of age. Current evidence from community-based mortality trials is not
      conclusive but suggests that such supplementation will decrease infant mortality from
      infectious disease through 6 m of age. The biological mechanism underlying this potential
      benefit is unclear but is presumed to include improving immune function. The investigators
      hypothesize that vitamin A supplementation at birth prevents vitamin A deficiency during a
      critical window of a few days to weeks when the immune system is first exposed to both
      normal, non-pathogenic organisms (e.g., commensal gut flora) and to potential pathogens.
      During this period the investigators propose that vitamin A supplementation will improve
      three aspects of immune function that will have sustained benefits throughout infancy: (1)
      normal thymus maturation and function; (2) development and mucosal targeting of adaptive
      immune responses, including regulatory T-cells (Treg), T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, and
      IgA-secreting plasma cells and memory B-cells; and (3) mucosal barrier function. The three
      specific objectives of our project are: (1) Determine if vitamin A supplementation improves
      thymus maturation and function as indicated by ultrasonic analysis of thymus size and by
      analysis of thymic output of na√Øve T-cells using flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood
      T-cells and by quantification of T-cell-receptor excision circles (TRECs) in peripheral
      blood. (2) Determine if vitamin A supplementation at birth alters (2.1) the T-cell response
      to BCG and OPV immunization assessed at 6 and 15 wk of age; (2.2) the T- and B-cell response
      to OPV immunization, assessed at 15 wk of age, and the secretory IgA response to OPV assessed
      at 6, 11 and 15 wk of age; and (2.3) the B-cell response to tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization,
      assessed at 15 wk of age. (3) Determine if vitamin A supplementation at birth will decrease
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in capillary blood, a marker of bacterial
      translocation.
