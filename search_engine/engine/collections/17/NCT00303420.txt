      population. A common complication is low / no blood flow through the catheter due to clots.
      These are serious situations because patients may miss dialysis sessions and suffer
      significant morbidity. In an attempt to dissolve the clots and restore blood flow,
      thrombolytics are frequently instilled into the catheters between dialysis sessions .
      However, we have developed and new "push" protocol that advances fresh thrombolytic
      (alteplase) to the tip of the catheter in order to facilitate more effective and faster
      removal of the clot. We hypothesize that our new "push" protocol will dissolve clots in
      hemodialysis catheters better and faster than the current dwell method.
