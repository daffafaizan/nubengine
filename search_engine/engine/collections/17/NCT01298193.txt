      won't have a response to the treatment against vomiting. Reviewing bibliography, we think
      that the percent is approximately 25%.

      We are going to obtain an estimation of this percent with an accuracy of +/- 6%, with a
      bilateral confidence level of 95% bilateral. Whit all this premises it would be needed 201
      patients.

      Assuming a drop out of 5%, 212 patients will be included in the study.

      A maximum of 212 patients will be included in the trial. It is anticipated that around 48
      patients will enter the efficacy phase.

      APPROXIMATE DURATION OF THE STUDY. Inclusion period: 18 months approximately. Estimated
      follow-up: December 2012 Estimated date of end of study: June 2013
