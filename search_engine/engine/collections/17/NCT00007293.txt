      psoriatic scalp of patients with UV-B light via an optical fiber comb. Current methods for
      treatment of psoriasis with light are not applicable to the scalp because hair is usually
      blocking the light from reaching the affected skin. Our method overcomes this problem with
      the use of a comb that has optical fibers to deliver light directly to the skin. We have
      developed a UV-B light source and a fiber optic comb for use in clinics and doctors' offices.
      We will evaluate this device in a clinical setting.

      The results of this trial will provide data about the effectiveness of the device. We will
      use these results to tailor the design before it is ready for volume production. If
      successful, the UV-B light source and fiber optic comb will provide treatment to people
      affected with scalp psoriasis. At present, these people do not have any effective treatment
      available to them.
