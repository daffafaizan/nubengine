    
      Surufatinib (HMPL-012, previously named sulfatinib) is a small-molecule inhibitor targeting
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and
      colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. A multi-center , opened, Phase II study have identified
      the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib in advanced medullary thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC) and
      iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).Toripalimab is a humanized
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory
      human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (programmed death-1; PD-1), with
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. In the present study,
      we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      the combination of Surufatinib wiht Toripalimab in locally advanced differentiated thyroid
      cancer as neoadjuvant therapy.
