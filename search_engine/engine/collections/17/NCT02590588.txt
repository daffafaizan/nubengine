      IgM-associated AL Amyloidosis at Boston Medical Center. Boston Medical Center is
      internationally recognized as a leader in amyloidosis research and patient care through the
      activities of the multidisciplinary Amyloid Center at Boston University. The problematic cell
      in most forms of AL amyloidosis shares similarities with multiple myeloma. However, in the
      small subset of AL Amyloidosis patients with an IgM paraprotein, the cells are more typically
      related to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Because clonal
      cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20)+ lymphoplasmacytic cells are usually responsible
      for IgM paraproteins, treatment paradigms based on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) may
      be more appropriate than myeloma-based strategies. Idelalisib has been shown to be active and
      well tolerated in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma including chronic
      lymphocytic lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without Waldenstr√∂m's
      macroglobulinemia (WM). The side effect profile of idelalisib merges well with the known
      predisposition to toxicity of amyloidosis patient.

      The investigators expect to enroll 15 participants with IgM-associated AL amyloidosis onto
      this Phase II clinical trial. Idelalisib will be self-administered orally at a dose of 100 mg
      (1 tablet) twice daily (may be escalated to 150 mg (one tablet) twice daily after 3 months at
      investigator discretion). Participants will be treated until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be
      performed every three months until disease progression.
