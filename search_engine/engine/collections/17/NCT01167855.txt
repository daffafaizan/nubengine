      subjects will be between the ages of 7-14 years. The remaining 540 subjects will be comprised
      of the primary caregiver of the participants. Thirty (30) school nurse/s providing care to
      the 270 intervention participants will also be enrolled in the study. To test our hypotheses,
      the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 7-14 years
      and their parent/guardian(s), to address the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in
      improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to children
      receiving usual care.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on
      asthma self-management skills of intervention caregivers and participants compared to a usual
      care group. The investigators will compare changes in asthma self-efficacy, quality of life,
      and knowledge between groups.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the cost of the intervention in relation to health outcomes.
