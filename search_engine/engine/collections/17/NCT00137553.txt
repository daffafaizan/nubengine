      children. If the included children during follow-up get malaria again they are, according to
      the recommendations of the National Malaria Programme, treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP).

      In 1995 - 1996 the efficacy of this re-treatment regimen was evaluated in the same area.

      To evaluate if treatment with SP is still efficient we want to follow children included in a
      study comparing treatment with chloroquine and amodiaquine having recrudescent malaria for 35
      days following the re-treatment with SP.

      Children with reappearing parasitaemia will be treated with SP. If accepting to participate
      in this study the children will be visited once a week and a capillary blood sample will be
      drawn. The blood sample taken on the day of reappearing parasitaemia in the
      chloroquine/amodiaquine study will be used as the day 0 blood sample in the SP-study.

      If the child gets malaria during the follow-up he will be treated according to the guidelines
      of the Bandim Health Centre. All treatment during follow-up will be free.
