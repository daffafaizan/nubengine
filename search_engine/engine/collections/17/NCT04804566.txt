      representative parents/caregivers of patients) living with Fabry disease. All study
      participants will complete the RSVP followed by a structured interview conducted by trained
      interviewers. It is estimated that each respondent will need up to 60 minutes for the entire
      process; 10 minutes to complete the RSVP including uploading the proof of Fabry disease
      diagnosis or verifying membership with Fabry groups, including but not limited to: Fabry
      Support and Information Group, National Fabry Disease Foundation, MPS Society UK, Morbus
      Fabry Selbsthilfergruppe, Fabry International Network, or others, and approximately 50
      minutes to complete the interview.
