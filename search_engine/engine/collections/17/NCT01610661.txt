    
      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the relative comparability for an
      isocaloric exchange of (1) refined-carb for simple-carb and (2) refined-carb for
      unrefined-carb, on established and emerging CVD risk indicators. To achieve this goal,
      subjects with moderate dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol > 100mg/dL) will consume diets enriched
      in 3 types of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb and unrefined-carb) according to a
      randomized, cross-over design.
