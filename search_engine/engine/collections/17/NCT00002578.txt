      AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate after failure on first-line
      chemotherapy regimen. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in
      these patients, and determine if there is a correlation between those parameters and
      response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium nitrate IV continuously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
      complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Patients who relapse after
      achieving CR may be retreated in the absence of disease progression. Treatment for relapse
      after a second CR is at the discretion of the principal investigator. Patients with
      leptomeningeal disease at study entry must receive intrathecal (IT) methotrexate with IV
      leucovorin calcium or IT cytarabine. Patients who develop leptomeningeal disease while on
      study may continue treatment with gallium nitrate but must also receive IT methotrexate and
      leucovorin calcium (with or without radiotherapy) or IT cytarabine. Patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
