        -  Determine the toxicity of adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin with amifostine
           cytoprotection in patients with completely resected locally advanced bladder cancer.

        -  Compare recurrence rate in these patients when treated with this regimen to historical
           control patients who had a cystectomy performed by the same surgeon.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin
      IV over 60 minutes and amifostine IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 28
      days for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
