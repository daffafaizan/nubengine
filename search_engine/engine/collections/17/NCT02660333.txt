      on inflammatory response and indicators of nutritional status in patients with morbid
      obesity. Adult individuals of both sexes with morbid obesity (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m²)
      will be invited to participate in this randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind study.
      The participants will be divided into three groups: G1 - control group (placebo), G2 -
      prebiotic group and G3 - synbiotic group. The study will consist of four experimental time
      points: M0 - baseline and start of supplementation; M1 - after fifteen days of the first
      outpatient visit and fifteen days after the start of supplementation with prebiotic,
      synbiotic or placebo; M2 - after thirty days from the first outpatient visit and end of
      supplementation with prebiotic, synbiotic and placebo; and M3 - time after sixty days from
      the first outpatient visit. At all time points the inflammatory response will be assessed by
      determination of plasma cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF) and acute phase proteins
      (c-reactive protein and albumin), besides the evaluation of laboratory and anthropometric
      indicators of nutritional status. The primary endpoint will be the reduction in
      concentrations of inflammatory markers (cytokines and acute phase proteins).

      Investigators expect to contribute with new information in this field of knowledge, which may
      facilitate the clinical application of these results.
