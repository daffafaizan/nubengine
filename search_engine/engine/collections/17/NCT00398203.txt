    
      Smart Medical Systems has developed the NaviAid™ Balloon Guided Endoscopy (BGE) Device, an
      innovative medical device for the GI tract diagnosis and treatment. The Balloon Guided
      Endoscopy (BGE) is a procedure intended for the examination of the small intestine, which
      utilizes the NaviAid™ BGE Device in conjunction with a standard endoscope.

      The objectives of this prospective controlled study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of using the NaviAid™ BGE device in the examination of the small intestine in conjunction
      with a standard endoscope.

      Efficacy will be assessed by comparing NaviAid™ BGE Device performances to a reference
      Enteroscopy procedure.
