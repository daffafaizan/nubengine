      services for community-dwelling older people, will be invited by a convenience method to work
      as collaborators in this study. Using computer-generated random numbers, a biostatistician
      not affiliated with this study will randomize the centres in a 1:1 ratio into either: the
      control or the experimental groups (WAT group).

      The WAT group will receive a 3-month exercise programme plus WAT intervention which aims to
      strengthen the participants' motivation to develop the intention to gradually increase their
      physical activity levels to eventually meet the level recommended for older people by the
      American Heart Association (AHA). Two face-to-face sessions followed by weekly to monthly
      telephone sessions offering support on dealing with technical issues and BCTs will be
      arranged for the experimental group. The additional technical support given alongside the WAT
      intervention will be gradually withdrawn from the participants. Eventually, all additional
      measures to support the use of WATs among participants will be stopped. Participants will be
      left to use the WAT on their own for 3 months during the follow-up period. In addition, they
      will receive a weekly 45-60 minute center-based structured exercise programme for 3 months,
      which is designed according to the AHA's recommendations on exercise for older people.

      The control group will receive another 3-month exercise programme with face-to-face, and
      telephone-delivered BCTs follow-up sessions, with the number and timing of all sessions
      similar to that in the experimental group.
