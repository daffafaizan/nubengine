      infection is caused by a robust cytokine storm that leads to lung tissue damage. Several
      studies reported a correlation between disease severity and the release of excessive
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-1, IFN-Υ,
      IFN-Υ-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage
      inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This
      finding was confirmed by the high level of plasma cytokines found in most severe COVID-19
      patients associated with extensive lung damage. Therefore, finding an effective therapeutic
      option to control the devastating cytokine storm of COVID-19 and regenerate the damaged lung
      is crucial.

      Previous studies reported that the hypoxic condition of MSCs could enhance the release of
      their active soluble molecules known as Secretome-MSCs (S-MSCs), such as IL-10 and TGF-β that
      useful in alleviating inflammation. Moreover, they could also increase the expression of
      growth factors such as VEGF and PDGF that accelerate lung injury improvement. These active
      molecules could potentially serve as a biological therapeutic agent for treating the severe
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to recent studies, we successfully isolated the S-MSCs from
      their culture medium using tangential flow filtration (TFF) strategy with several molecular
      weight cut-off category. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19
      patients with several comorbidities treated with S-MSCs in Indonesia.
