      sclerosis (SSc). Multiple drugs have been approved for the treatment of New York Heart
      Association (NYHA)Class III/IV PAH in scleroderma. Bosentan is an endothelin-1 antagonist
      which showed significant improvement in distance walked during 12 week clinical trials in PAH
      patients (7). Therapy for asymptomatic systemic sclerosis patients diagnosed incidentally
      with PAH (World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class I) remains controversial. We
      hypothesize that asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with systemic sclerosis and
      normal resting pulmonary artery pressures who demonstrate an abnormal rise in pulmonary
      artery systolic pressure with stress Doppler echocardiography testing represent a subset of
      patients who already have pulmonary vascular disease and who are at risk for the development
      of severe PAH. We further hypothesize that early identification and treatment of such
      patients may retard the progression of that disease.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Stress echocardiography identifies early pulmonary vascular disease by detecting
           exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in patients with systemic sclerosis.

        2. Treatment of exercise-induced PAH with Bosentan will lead to improved exercise endurance
           in patients with systemic sclerosis.

      Subjects will be recruited from those patients who have had an abnormal exercise test as part
      of an earlier study, Exercise Echocardiograms in Scleroderma (IRB# 03-363).
