      subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib. Following a 7-day washout period,
      600-mg oral doses of rifampin were administered once daily (QD) on Days 8 through 17. It was
      anticipated that steady-state concentrations of rifampin would be achieved by Day 17. On Day
      17, a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 600-mg dose of
      rifampin.
