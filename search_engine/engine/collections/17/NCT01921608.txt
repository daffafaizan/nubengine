      such as Sub Saharan Africa. In 2009, the US Government (USAID) reported that scaling up male
      circumcision to reach 80 percent of adult and newborn males in 14 African countries by 2015
      could potentially avert more than 4 million adult HIV infections between 2009 and 2025 and
      yield annual cost savings of US$1.4 - 1.8 billion after 2015, with a total net savings of
      US$20.2 billion between 2009 and 2025.

      There are over 38 million adolescent and adult males in Africa that could benefit from male
      circumcision for HIV prevention. The challenge Africa faces is how to safely scale up a
      surgical procedure in resources limited settings.

      The government of Rwanda has a national plan to decrease the incidence rate of HIV by 50%,
      and to support this, needs to conduct 2 million voluntary adult male circumcisions in 2
      years, a nearly impossible goal with surgical methods. Hence, the government embarked upon a
      pre-safety and pivotal study to test The PrePexâ„¢ device, a new device and methodology for
      rapid adult male circumcision in resource limited settings.
