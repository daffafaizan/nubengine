      secretions. At first stage the optimal pressure for reducing air trapping will be determined.
      In addition, all patients will undergo a maximal exercise test. A baseline complete pulmonary
      function test is performed followed by continuous positive air way pressure at the
      pre-determined pressure. This will be followed by exercise at 60% of maximal obtained
      previously.
