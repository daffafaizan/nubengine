      Primary:

      â€¢ To determine the effect of once daily dosing with tiotropium bromide inhalation solution
      for 22 consecutive days on trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) change from
      baseline compared with that of placebo inhalation solution in subjects with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the effect of once daily dosing with tiotropium bromide inhalation solution
           for 22 consecutive days on trough FEV1 change from baseline compared with that of
           Spiriva Respimat; area under the curve (AUC) FEV10-6 change from baseline compared with
           that of placebo and Spiriva Respimat; and trough forced vital capacity (FVC) change from
           baseline compared with that of placebo and Spiriva Respimat

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of tiotropium bromide inhalation solution in
           subjects with COPD

        -  To assess the relative bioavailability of tiotrop
