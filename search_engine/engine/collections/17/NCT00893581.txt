    
      Hypotheses 1 & 2 predict that following 6 weeks of treatment with lithium or quetiapine,
      manic adolescents who demonstrate symptomatic improvement will exhibit normalized (decreased)
      VLPFC and ACC activation and increased activation of compensatory posterior attentional brain
      areas as well as normalization of VLPFC and ACC neurometabolite measures (increased NAA and
      decreased Glu levels) compared with those who do not experience symptomatic improvement and
      healthy adolescents.

      Hypothesis 3 predicts significant associations between fMRI activation changes (i.e.
      decreased activation in VLPFC and ACC ROIs and increased activation in the posterior
      attention ROI) and MRS changes (increases in NAA and decreases in Glu levels in the VLPFC and
      ACC) for patients who exhibit symptomatic improvement with either treatment.

      Hypothesis 4 predicts that decreases in mI levels at 1 week will be associated with lithium,
      but not quetiapine, response at endpoint.

      In contrast, Hypothesis 5 predicts higher baseline Cho levels will be associated with
      quetiapine, but not lithium, response at endpoint.
