      prescribing in our country by evaluating the delayed prescription of antibiotics. The
      proposed trial will take place in the context of a prior similar study we conducted in
      adults. The study currently underway is the DAP-Adults study (a randomised controlled trial
      that evaluates several antibiotic prescribing strategies, including de delayed prescription
      in uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in adults in primary care).

      The aim of this study DAP-Pediatrics (randomized, multicenter parallel) to determine the
      efficacy and safety of delayed prescription of antibiotics compared to direct prescription
      and non-prescription of antibiotic in uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in pediatric
      patients. This 3 arms clinical trial will include 450 children and will evaluate the duration
      and severity of symptoms, antibiotic consumption, parents' satisfaction, the perceived
      efficacy of antibiotics and the number of visits generated. The project also includes a
      qualitative study, by means of structured interviews, to assess the perception and attitudes
      of parents towards the different treatment strategies and carry out a full analysis of
      economic evaluation.
