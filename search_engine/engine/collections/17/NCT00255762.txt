      bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with unresectable stage IV
      melanoma.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary I. Determine the distribution of overall survival times in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the
      changes in blood levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      IV. Determine the changes in immune homeostasis in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, and 15, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
