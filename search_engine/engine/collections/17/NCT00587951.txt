      which seizures originate (the epileptogenic zone). There are many non-invasive tests
      (including EEG and MRI) to indicate this area. Some patients require implantation of
      intracranial electrodes in order to determine the epileptogenic zone. A test known as SISCOM
      (subtraction ictal-interictal SPECT co-registered with MRI) has been validated as a
      non-invasive means of indicating the epileptogenic zone. However, this test is not widely
      available in the US, and it is not known how often the additional information provided by
      SISCOM makes a difference to clinical decision-making.

      In order to determine the contribution of SISCOM towards clinical decision-making in epilepsy
      surgery candidates, we will ask epileptologists at Mayo Clinic to consider case presentations
      given all clinical information except for SISCOM results, and then to reconsider those same
      cases in conjunction with SISCOM data. This will indicate the degree to which SISCOM
      influences decision making.

      50 patients at Mayo Clinic (38 adults, 12 children) will be enrolled.
