      I. To estimate the objective response rate (complete responses + partial responses) after
      treatment with alisertib (MLN8237) in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To assess overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient
      population.

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MLN8237 treatment for this patient
      population.

      IV. To explore the association between pre-treatment aurora kinase A expression in tumor
      biopsies as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and objective response rate
      in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) treated with MLN8237.

      IV. To investigate the copy number, mutational status, expression of aurora kinase (A, B, and
      C) and associated signaling pathways in PTCL utilizing tissue microarray analysis (TMA)
      before and after treatment with MLN8237.

      V. To investigate changes in the serum cytokine profile pre- and post- aurora kinase
      Inhibitor treatment.

      VI. To evaluate serum markers of apoptosis pre- and post- aurora kinase inhibitor treatment
      as pharmacodynamic markers of efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years.
