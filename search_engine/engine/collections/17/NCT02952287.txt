      features of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR). With standard 2D phase contrast (PC) flow
      measurements, each vessel is measured separately at a predefined location. Planning and
      scanning can be time consuming while the patient is inside the scanner. In addition, when the
      scan time is long, the hemodynamics may be assessed at different physiological states. In
      contrast to a 2D PC acquisition 4D PC captures all the information about blood flow
      velocities within a 3D anatomical volume. Once this predefined volume has been acquired, the
      flow within the heart and vessels of interest can be measured at any desired location
      offline, i.e. after the patient has left the scanner. This is especially advantageous in
      cases where multiple 2D PC MRI scans are needed such as in congenital heart disease (CHD). In
      addition to standard measurements, 4D PC provides flow patterns, which might change our
      current understanding of pathologic flow conditions. Although there has been increasing
      interest in this new technique, only a few papers have proved its accuracy in adult
      population. The purpose of our study is to validate the accuracy of 4D PC flow method in
      quantification of thoracic and upper abdominal blood flow volumes in children. In this
      validation study, 4D PC flow method will be applied in 100 pediatric patients undergoing
      clinically indicated CMR with 2D PC flow measurement.
