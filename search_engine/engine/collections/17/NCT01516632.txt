      quit or cut down, quit rates in this age group have remained stagnant in the last ten years.
      Text messaging may represent a compelling intervention delivery method for smoking cessation
      for young adults because it is a medium they have widely adopted. Cell phone interventions
      also are unique because of their 'always on' capability - interventions are never far from
      the young adult's reach and they are received automatically instead of requiring the
      participant to initiate contact in order to receive the information. Dr. Ybarra, along with
      Drs. Holtrop and Graham, have developed SMS Turkey, an innovative behavioral intervention
      that uses text messaging to deliver CBT-based smoking cessation information to participants
      daily. Successful use of text messaging to deliver smoking cessation programs has been
      reported by Rodgers and colleagues in New Zealand and a replication study they are leading in
      the United Kingdom. These data provide optimism for the feasibility of text messaging-based
      smoking cessation programs in the United States. Using qualitative methods to inform design
      and content, and quantitative methods to assess the feasibility of the program, we propose to
      design and test SMS (Stop My Smoking) USA, a cell-phone based smoking cessation program for
      young adults ages 18-25. This innovative smoking cessation program uses technology widely
      adopted by young adults, an under-targeted population, to deliver a proactive, cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention. Our multidisciplinary team of researchers brings
      together expertise in Internet health and the design of tailored smoking cessation
      interventions.
