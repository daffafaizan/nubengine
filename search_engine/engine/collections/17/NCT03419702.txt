      Secondary objectives are to investigate if improved chronic glucose metabolism in subjects
      with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose after long-term almond
      consumption translates into improved peripheral and brain vascular function, and enhanced
      cognitive performance. In addition, the investigators will address to what extent improved
      chronic glucose metabolism in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired
      fasting glucose after long-term almond consumption can be explained by (combined) effects of
      lowered hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, skeletal muscle characteristics,
      visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation, pancreatic function or fecal microbiota
      composition.

      Study design:

      The proposed study will be a 12 months randomised, controlled trial with a cross-over design.
      Two experimental periods of five months will be separated by a two months washout period.

      Study population:

      Forty-three impaired glucose tolerant and/or impaired fasting glucose subjects, with
      overweight and mild obesity (BMI 25-35 kg/m2), aged 40-70 years.

      Intervention:

      During the intervention period of 5 months, subjects will receive daily 50 gr almonds, but
      not in the 2 months washout and 5 months control periods.
