      intra-discally. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction
      using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue
      specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.

      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected from the patient's abdomen using a liposuction
      cannula. In addition, a sample of peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of
      platelet rich plasma. The adipose tissue is processed for separation of the adipose
      tissue-derived stem cells, which are then resuspended in platelet rich plasma and transferred
      for intra-discal administration. The number of cells injected will vary depending on the
      amount of tissue processed and the number of cells obtained from the process. Following the
      injections follow-up data will be collected 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.

      Total study time frame is anticipated to be approximately 6 months. This study will enroll
      approximately 100 patients.
