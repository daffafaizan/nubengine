      to provide informed assent. If the child elects to participate in the research project,
      he/she is enrolled in the study and assign to one of two groups: Active Comparator or Sham
      Comparator. If possible, his/her ability to maintain balance is then assessed using a
      standard extended mCTSIB protocol (standing for 25 seconds on a hard surface/4" tall foam
      cushion with eyes open/closed and head neutral/turned right/left/flexed or extended) and
      his/her baseline qEEG are recorded. A series of questionnaires will be administered to the
      child and/or his/her parents/legal guardian/caretaker.

      Afterward the child will be instructed to wear the prescribed device (either the Active
      Comparator (Mente Autism™) or the Sham Comparator (a device externally identical to Mente
      Autism™, providing binaural beats but not tailor-made neurofeedback binaural beats)) to use
      at home for 40 minutes a day for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12 weeks treatment period, the
      child will again be tested as at the beginning of the trial (posturography, qEEG, and
      questionnaires). At the end of the study, participants in the Sham Comparator group will be
      offered the option of receiving the full therapy.
