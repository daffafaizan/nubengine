      systemic cancer treatment. The participants will complete a CGA and patient-reported outcome
      (PRO) measures at baseline. Based on any impairments found during the CGA, participants will
      be referred to specialists to help address these difficulties. Participants will complete the
      CGA and PRO measures again at 3 months and 1 year after the initial assessment. The goal of
      this study is to see if patients with advanced bladder cancer are interested in referrals to
      specialists to address their impairments, and whether participants attend those appointments.
