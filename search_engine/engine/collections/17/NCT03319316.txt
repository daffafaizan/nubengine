      confirmation of response or tumor stabilization, patients will be registered and allocated
      into two cohorts based on the tumor histology and each cohort will be randomized into two
      arms. The experimental arm will receive combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab, the other
      arm is according to standard of care.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a maintenance approach with the
      combination immunotherapy with durvalumab + tremelimumab improves progression-free survival
      (PFS) compared to standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC. Each cohort is powered
      separately based on PFS.
