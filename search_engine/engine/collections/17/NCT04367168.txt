      colchicine 1.5 mg at day one followed by 0.5 mg BID to complete 10 days of treatment. The
      researchers will recruit patients 18-70 years of age who are hospitalized because of the
      diagnosis of mild or severe COVID-19. Patients will be randomized to receive one of the
      treatment arms, colchicine or placebo. The aim of the study is to evaluate if colchicine may
      be able to improve the outcomes in patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Patients will be
      followed-up during the entire hospitalization time and during convalescence. The importance
      of this intervention is highlighted because currently, there is not an effective treatment
      for the virus, nor for the prevention of the cytokine storm or the disseminated intravascular
      coagulation. Therefore, an early intervention to prevent the development of these
      complications would be valuable to prevent the morbi-morbidity secondary to severe and
      critical COVID-19
