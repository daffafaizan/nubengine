      initial insomnia using the SSRI antidepressant escitalopram combined with ramelteon or
      placebo. Patients will be assessed at each visit for depressive symptoms and insomnia, using
      the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Clinician-Rated version (IDS-C30; Rush et al
      1986; Rush et al., 1996) as the primary outcome measure. The IDS self-report version will be
      used to assess self-reported changes in symptom severity. The 17 item Hamilton Rating Scale
      for Depression, (HRSD17; Hamilton, 1960) will also be administered, as it is the most
      commonly utilized depression symptom severity measure at this time.
