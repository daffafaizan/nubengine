    
      This will be a single arm study. Patients will be administered Lucentis™ on Day 1, at Months
      1 and 2, and then as needed at intervals of at least 30 days through Month 11 based on the
      retreatment criteria algorithm. These patients will also be administered Visudyne® only on
      Day 3.

      Consenting patients will participate in the Screening Period to evaluate study eligibility.
      Patient eligibility assessments will include BCVA, contrast sensibility, speed reading and
      VFQ-25, a standard ophthalmic examination, OCT, color fundus photography, Fluorescein
      Angiography (FA), Green Indocyanine Angiography, Microperimetry and multifocal ERG.

      BCVA and mean central retinal thickness measured by OCT will be repeated at every follow up
      visit.

      Fluorescein Angiography (FA), Green Indocyanine Angiography, contrast sensibility and speed
      reading mean retinal sensitivity measured by microperimetry will repeated at month 3, 6, 9
      and 12 month.

      Color fundus photography at month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month. Multifocal ERG will repeated at
      month 3 and 12 month. VFQ-25 will repeated at month 3 and 12.

      The patient will receive ranibizumab monthly unless the BCVA got worse than 5 letters from
      the baseline BCVA and / or mean central retinal thickness evaluated with OCT increased less
      than 100 µm compared to month 2 visit (last date treatment). The repetition of the dose of
      ranibizumab should not begin before the thirtieth day following the end of the previous
      treatment.
