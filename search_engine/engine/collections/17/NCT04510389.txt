           protein and caloric intake;

        -  Evolution of weight loss, lean mass, fat mass and metabolic rate before and after
           supplementation with WP or placebo;

        -  Changes in protein status (assessed by muscle strength and serum levels of total
           protein, albumin, prealbumin, ferritin, hemoglobin) before and after supplementation
           with WP or placebo

        -  The inflammatory blood profile (assessed by cytokine levels and before and after
           supplementation with WP or placebo).

        -  The influence of the rS9939609 polymorphism of the FTO gene on the nutritional status,
           biochemical and inflammatory parameters in the postoperative (after 18 months) of
           surgery;
