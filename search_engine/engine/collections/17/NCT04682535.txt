      caregiving relationships and social connectedness are associated with dementia caregivers'
      health, health behaviors, and diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol. Investigators are asking
      caregivers to complete 14-days of surveys which ask about their relationships and health
      behaviors, in addition to 2 longer surveys (baseline and 3-month follow up). Investigators
      hypothesize that on days when caregivers receive more emotional support, they will report
      better health behaviors (e.g., improved sleep quality). On days when caregivers experience
      greater 1) strain and 2) loneliness, they will report poorer health behaviors. Information
      about which aspects of social relationships and social connectedness most affect health will
      be used to inform interventions programs.
