      daily for 8 weeks or an identical dose of a control sunflower seed oil low in oleic acid and
      phenol content. EVOO high in oleic acid and phenolic content will be identified and shipped
      from Italy and stored protected from heat and light in the Bionutrition Core at the Clinical
      Research Center at the University of Vermont Medical Center. Women will undergo a detailed
      cardiovascular assessment at baseline and following treatment, including assessment of blood
      pressure, pulse-wave velocity, calculation of arterial distensibility and beta stiffness,
      flow-mediated vasodilation, cardiac output, response to volume challenge and dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Lipid profiles and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and
      metabolic dysfunction will also be assessed at both study visits.

      Investigators hypothesize that treatment with high oleic acid and phenolic EVOO will be
      associated with decreased blood pressure, improved vascular compliance and blood vessel
      function, and with improvement in lipid profile, inflammation and markers of metabolic
      dysfunction.
