      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks associated with these treatments leaves
      considerable room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the
      human immune system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and
      induce a level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical
      testing in an early-stage trial. The ONE Study aims to answer the question as whether ATDC
      treatment, or immunoregulatory cell-based therapy in general, has any place in the clinical
      management of solid organ transplant recipients.
