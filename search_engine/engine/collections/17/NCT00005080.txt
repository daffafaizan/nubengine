      I. Determine the complete and partial remission rates and remission duration in patients with
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or refractory or relapsed noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma
      treated with 506U78.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving complete response receive up to 8 courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year or until
      relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
