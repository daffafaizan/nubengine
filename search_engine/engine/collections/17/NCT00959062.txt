      analgesia. Providing effective sedation for children in the PICU requires careful balancing
      of the need for sedation with the adverse effects associated with sedative medications.
      Inadequate sedation may result in undue pain and suffering for children, ventilator
      dysynchrony and may risk removal of life sustaining devices. Excess sedation limits patients'
      interaction with their parents and care-givers and may result in delayed weaning from
      mechanical ventilation, prolonged PICU stay and the attendant risks of increased morbidity.
      Critically ill children may also experience withdrawal when these medications are stopped.
      Randomized trails in adults have shown that sedation related interventions can improve
      patients outcomes, but such trials have not been performed in children.

      Clonidine is often used as an adjunctive sedative and analgesic in children but a well
      designed and adequately powered randomized trial is required to test the effect of
      clonidine-based sedation. Because there are no large randomized trials of sedation related
      interventions among critically ill children there are many unknown factors.

      This pilot trial, focussing on feasibility outcomes will assess the feasibility of, and
      inform the design of, a larger randomized controlled trial which will focus on clinically
      important outcomes.
