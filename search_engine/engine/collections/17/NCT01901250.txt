      with other primary preventive modalities, the use of xylitol gummy bears as snack food during
      school hours to reduce dental caries among children attending Kindergarten at the time of
      recruitment.

      Classrooms in five elementary schools were randomized to receive xylitol gummy bears or the
      control sugar-free (fiber) gummy bears. All gummy bears were formulated to be similar in
      size, consistency, color, and sweetness. They were in six bright colors attractive to
      children, and in strawberry and cherry flavors which are popular among children. Children
      were encouraged to chew the gummy bears slowly to maximize the xylitol exposure time in the
      mouth. The children received xylitol or placebo gummy bears throughout the 9 month
      kindergarten year, 3 times/day within the supervised school environment.

      In addition to gummy bears, all participating children received oral health education, tooth
      brushing and fluoridated toothpaste, topical fluoride varnish treatment, and dental sealants
      when the first permanent molars have completely erupted. This design allows for the
      comparison between the current best recommended public heath practices and the addition of
      the new strategy, xylitol gummy bear snacks. Children were enrolled in kindergarten and
      followed until the middle of 2nd grade.
