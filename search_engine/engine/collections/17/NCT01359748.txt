      KEITO Devices was designed to offer to the general public a convenient way to do so easily in
      the public sites.

      One of the most important parameter is the Blood Pressure (BP)measurement. To warrant their
      efficacity and accuracy, was essential to perform this trial to ensure that the measurements
      obtained meet with the requirements of the specific U.S. standard about Non-invasive
      sphygmomanometers.

      By Validating with auscultatory reference sphygmomanometer, as defined on the ANSI/AAMI/ISO
      81060-2:2009 , we have been intending to demonstrate that the multifunction KEITO devices,
      particularly about the Blood Pressure (BP) Measurement, have the same efficacy and accuracy
      as the conventional auscultatory sphygmomanometers.

      To include most of the groups of Blood Pressure (BP) measurements types on this clinical
      trial, a great variety of BP ranges have been selected, always in accordance with the
      standard.
