      Dexamethasone

      Patients will receive 40 mg dexamethasone days 1-4 only, every 3-4 weeks. Response will be
      assessed at least every 3 months while on maintenance therapy. Appropriate H2 blocker and
      antibiotics will also be given.

      Thalidomide

      Thalidomide will continue at a dose of 400 mg daily, or at the dose that was reduced and
      judged to be well tolerated in induction therapy. Thalidomide will be given as an oral, once
      daily dose at bedtime. Those patients unable to tolerate dexamethasone may continue on
      thalidomide alone until criteria for removal from treatment is met.
