        -  Step 1 (The patient inclusion may stop after this step):

             -  Patients will be enrolled at the RD until there are maximum 16 evaluable patients
                at this DL

        -  Step 2:

             -  Depending on the response rate at step 1, up to 26 patients will be included and
