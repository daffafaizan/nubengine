    
      This is a national, multicenter, ambispective, observational post-authorization study (EPA-SP
      for its acronym in Spanish) to describe the incidence, clinical management and outcome of
      aplastic anemia in hospitals throughout Spain.

      The study includes a retrospective chart review to identify all cases of aplastic anemia
      diagnosed between January 2010 and the date of the study initiation and a prospective study
      to detect new cases of aplastic anemia during an 18-month period since the study initiation
      in the participant hospitals. The study is also designed to collect both retrospective and
      prospective data on clinical management and outcome of patients with confirmed aplastic
      anemia. All patients included in the study, including those cases of aplastic anemia
      identified since 2010 until the study initiation through the retrospective chart review that
      are alive at the time of inclusion in the study, will be followed up until death or
      lost-to-follow-up or until 6 months after the last patient is enrolled in the study.

      The study consists of a baseline visit, follow-up visits every 6 months (Â± 15 days) until
      death or lost-to follow-up or up to 6 months after the last patient is enrolled in the study,
      and a final visit (final/premature withdrawal visit) which will be performed at the study end
      (6 months after the last patient is enrolled) or in case of premature withdrawal, except for
      patient withdrawal of consent, loss-to-follow-up or death.
