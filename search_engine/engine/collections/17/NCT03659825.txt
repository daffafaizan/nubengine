      both individual and team performance. This degradation is linked to falling brain energy
      (ATP) levels and an increased reliance on anaerobic energy production from glucose. Ketone
      bodies are the evolutionary alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic
      requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies
      (ketosis) maintains brain ATP levels and reduce cerebral anaerobic glycolysis during hypoxia.
      Ketosis can be achieved when fasting or following a ketogenic diet; however, these approaches
      are impractical. Exogenous ketone ester supplementation allows for rapid (< 30 mins) and
      significant elevation of blood ketone levels without the need to maintain a diet or fast.

      HVMN, in collaboration with researchers at IHMC, proposes a study to investigate the effects
      of consuming an FDA-approved ketone ester 'food' on cognitive performance in the setting of
      hypoxia. For the proposed 4-arm within-subject study, participants will complete a cognitive
      performance test battery under the conditions of normoxia and then hypoxia following
      consumption of a ketone ester drink or a placebo drink (N.B for each study drink cognitive
      performance in both hypoxia and normoxia will be assessed in ONE visit):

      VISIT A:

      Arm1: Normoxia + Placebo Arm 2: Hypoxia + Placebo

      VISIT B:

      Arm 3: Normoxia + Ketone ester Arm 4: Hypoxia + Ketone ester

      The investigators hypothesize that ketone ester supplementation will attenuate
      hypoxia-induced deterioration of operator cognitive performance.
