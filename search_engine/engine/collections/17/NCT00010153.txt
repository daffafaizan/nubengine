        -  Determine the inhibitory effect of ICI 182780 on the development of metastasis, as
           measured by disease-free survival and overall survival, in women with operable stage I
           or II primary breast cancer.

        -  Determine toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center and menopausal status (premenopausal vs
      postmenopausal).

      Patients are randomized to receive either ICI 182780 IM or placebo IM over 2 minutes on day
      1. Patients undergo surgery between days 8 and 29.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,656 patients (1,828 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
