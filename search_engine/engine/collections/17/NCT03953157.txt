      I. To recruit an ethnically, racially and culturally diverse sample of postmenopausal women
      diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer who are currently taking aromatase
      inhibitor (AI), establish eligibility, and randomly allocate 20 participants to a two-arm
      parallel intervention trial.

      II. Conduct baseline measurements of: body composition and bone mineral density, reported
      muscle and joint pain; inflammatory, cardiovascular and bone health markers contained in
      blood serum; and, cardiovascular function.

      III. Conduct a three month anti-inflammatory dietary intervention in one arm, and bone
      strengthening exercise intervention in the other study arm.

      IV. At completion of these 3-month interventions, evaluate changes since baseline of body
      composition, bone density, reported muscle and joint pain, and inflammatory and
      cardiovascular measurements within each intervention arm, and preliminarily contrast changes
      between intervention arms.

      V. Utilize results from both intervention arms to design a larger 2x2 randomized factorial
      trial designed to assess effects of anti-inflammatory diet, effects of bone promoting
      exercise, and combined diet and exercise intervention effects on joint and muscle pain,
      inflammatory markers, bone mineral density, and cardiovascular measures.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a controlled anti-inflammatory diet over 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo controlled exercise sessions with a dedicated trainer 3 times a week
      for up to 1 hour each over 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 week.
