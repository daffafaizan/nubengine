      simple and effective treatment for angle closure glaucoma. LPI can widen or reopen an
      existing angle close or angle adhesion in order to reduce the risk of attack of the angle
      closure glaucoma. However, there are very little research on the laser site, laser
      wavelengths, laser energy and laser spot intervals.Conventional LPI uses wavelength 532nm
      laser. However, our preclinical studies have found that the laser penetration of the laser
      wavelength 561nm is stronger than that of the laser wavelength 532nm. It can produce a
      stronger contraction effect.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum laser wavelengths of LPI. Baseline and
      7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, the structure of anterior chamber, including angle
      anterior chamber depth(ACD), angle of anterior chamber (AA), anterior chamber angle opening
      distance 750(AOD750) are measured with ultrasound biomicroscopy. Baseline and 7days, 1 month,
      3 months after LPI, the outflow resistance of aqueous humor are evaluated with C value.
      Baseline and 1hour, 1days, 3day, 7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, intraocular pressure are
      measured with Goldmann tonometry. Baseline and 3 months after LPI, retinal nerve layer
      thickness and the optic disc cup disc ratio are measure with optical coherence tomography.
