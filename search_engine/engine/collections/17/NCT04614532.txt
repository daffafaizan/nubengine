      disease, in the early stages of the disease and to check whether pain-related changes in the
      autonomic nervous system via the Nociception Level index (NoL® system) differ from a control
      group of subjects matched in age, gender and education level. To induce pain, the
      investigators will use the "cold pressor test" technique, which consists of leaving the arm
      immersed in ice water for as long as the pain is bearable. The investigators will also record
      before, during and after the immersion, the variations of several parameters derived from the
      autonomic nervous system during the painful stimulation via the NoL® system. During this
      experience, the participants will be filmed in their entirety to observe the facial emotions
      related to pain.
