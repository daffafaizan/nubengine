      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. It has been demonstrated that the combination
      of a short acting beta2-agonist and a short acting anticholinergic yields greater efficacy as
      measured by FEV1 when compared with the response to the individual short acting
      bronchodilators. However, daily bronchial response to these agents is poorly understood. It
      is also poorly understood how the variation in magnitude of the response to the individual
      agents and how the variation in response for one agent coincides with the variation in
      response to the other agent. This study will seek to define the pattern of response of each
      individual agent and the relationship between them. The study will also explore if the
      combination of the two agents leads to less variation in response compared to the individual
      agents. This is a randomized, open label, two period cross-over study. Eligible subjects will
      be randomized to a sequence of either albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler (MDI)
      followed by ipratropium via MDI or the same dose of each bronchodilator given in the opposite
      order. Each study period will consist of 10 clinic visits to be conducted over 10 to 14 days.
