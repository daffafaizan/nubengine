      communicate their questions and concerns about self-management for hypertension to their
      physician; and (b) improving provider's communication skills for enhancing and encouraging
      self-management of hypertension.

      A health educator met with each participating veteran in the intervention arm prior to the
      2nd visit to develop a plan for enhancing communication about self-management of
      hypertension.

      The PI provided the Four Habits communication training to the 5 primary care providers in the
      intervention arm. Two clinic visits between each participating provider-patient pair were
      videotaped and coded.

      This project had a goal of enrolling 10 VA primary care providers to participate in the
      randomized control trial and 30 veterans (3 veterans from the panel of each of the 10
      participating providers) who had a stroke and now demonstrated poorly controlled
      hypertension. The study evaluated the difference between the two groups, and compared the
      content of the provider-patient conversations around hypertension management.
