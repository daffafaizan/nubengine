    
      Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice used in high-income countries to
      help individuals with psychotic disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively with
      the illness. FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the mechanisms of
      action for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified in any context. The goal of
      this study is to pilot test a culturally tailored Family Psychoeducation model (called KUPAA)
      for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives that is appropriate for cultural
      settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness and that
      incorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention. Formative research has already
      been conducted to culturally tailor the model for the Tanzanian context. This pilot study is
      a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 72 patient/relative dyads that will test the
      KUPAA intervention to a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted family
      psychoeducation intervention for 12 weeks, and b) explore its impact on patient relapse,
      quality of life and disability.

      Primary study objectives

        1. To pilot test the KUPAA intervention to explore its impact on patient relapse, quality
           of life and disability

           Secondary study objectives

        2. To elucidate the mechanisms of action for KUPAA (e.g. hopefulness, self-efficacy) and
           refine the mediation and study outcome measures for a future R01/fully powered clinical
           trial
