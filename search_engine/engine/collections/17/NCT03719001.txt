    
      This is a single center, nonrandomized, nonblinded, interventional clinical pilot research
      study that plans to enroll 40 patients.

      Study will be conducted while subjects are under general anesthesia.

      Myogenic oscillations will be measured using finger photoplethysmography. Changes in the
      amplitude and/or frequency of these oscillations will be analyzed in response to the
      interventions. Arterial blood pressure will be recorded to verify the efficacy of the
      interventions.

      Six different interventions that will either lower or increase blood pressure will be applied
      to the subjects. Each subject will receive 1 or 2 of the six interventions. Each of the 6
      interventions will be applied to 8 subject.

      The interventions that the subject will not be randomized. They will be determined by the
      subjects blood pressure immediately before the intervention to guarantee that the blood
      pressure manipulations are within a safe range.

      Data will be analyzed offline using Matlab.
