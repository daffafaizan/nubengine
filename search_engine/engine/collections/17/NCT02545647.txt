      because weight regain can occur. An intervention to prevent weight regain in the future is to
      place a silicone band (non-adjustable) around the pouch of the RYGB (Banded-RYGB: BRYGB)
      which increases weight loss and decreases weight regain on the longer term. The question is
      whether primary application of a banded bypass gives a greater weight loss and / or prevent
      weight regain in the future versus a standard RYGB.

      The Study design is a prospective, randomized, single center study.

      Study population: patients who qualify for a RYGB are eligible to participate. The primary
      RYGB patients may participate if there is a BMI of 35 kg / m2 with a morbidly obesity-related
      comorbidity or a BMI of 40kg / m2 or higher.

      Intervention: The standard RYGB with a vertical pouch over a 40 french feeding tube with a
      volume of 30-50 ml, is compared with a banded-RYGB (BRYGB)
