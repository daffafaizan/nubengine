      are treated with carbetocin to reduce blood loss from the lining of the womb after delivery
      of the baby. The study is a randomised double blind controlled trial with 2 groups. One group
      will receive carbetocin quickly, the second group will receive carbetocin slowly. The
      investigators will compare the difference between groups with respect to side effects and the
      effect of carbetocin on the cardiovascular system.
