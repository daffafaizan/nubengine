      have suggested that adequate calcium intake can have a favourable effect on some metabolic
      variables. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of (Caltrate 600 + D ®)
      on body composition and various indicators of metabolic health in overweight and obese
      females characterised by a usual low daily calcium intake, on a weight-reducing program.

      The main hypotheses of this study were:

        -  Caltrate 600 +D® increases body weight and fat mass losses of individuals on a
           weight-reducing program.

        -  Caltrate 600 +D® improves the metabolic profile of these subjects, independently of
           variations promoted by body fat loss.
