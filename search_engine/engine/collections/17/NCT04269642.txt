      comparison, phase IIa clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sustained release
      (SR)-Exenatide (PT320) in the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Exenatide (GLP-1) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and obesity. In addition, several research groups have
      confirmed that Exenatide has beneficial aspects due to the neuroprotective effects in
      neuronal cells in patients with PD. Peptron has developed a sustained-release (SR)-Exenatide,
      (PT320, Q1W and Q2W), which has shown a higher Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration rate and
      better patient compliance.

      Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of PT320 on symptom improvement
      and the inhibition of disease progression in the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's
      disease. Also, pharmacokinetic analysis of PT320 in blood cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      exosome analysis of biomarkers related to Exenatide will be being tested, as exploratory
      measurements.
