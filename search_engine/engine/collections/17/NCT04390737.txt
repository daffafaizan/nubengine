    
      This first-in-human study of HH2853 will be conducted in patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas or patients with advanced solid tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to
      prior therapies and have a high degree of unmet medical need in terms of available treatment
      options. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase II
      dose (RP2D) and preliminary efficacy of HH2853 administered orally on a continuous twice
      daily (BID) schedule in adult patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or
      advanced solid tumors.
