      pain following mastectomy should be minimized, as in a number of women it may chronically
      persist for months in the form of post-mastectomy pain syndrome.

      Morphine administration for acute pain after mastectomy surgery has many side effects.
      Regional block techniques as para-vertebral block and thoracic epidural anesthesia have
      possible complications and technical difficulties.

      The new alternative regional techniques such as erector spinae plane block and retrolaminar
      block are clinical trials for providing a safe and easy with good hemodynamic and recovery
      profile with adequate perioperative analgesia for a large section of patients undergoing
      mastectomy operation in order to reduce opioids consumption and subsequently avoid
      opioid-related adverse effects.

      As percent of post-operative rescue analgesia is 16.7% and 60% for RLB group and ESPB group
      respectively. So, sample size is 46 patients (23 patients in each group). Sample was
      calculated using OPEN EPI program with confidence level 95% and power 80%.
