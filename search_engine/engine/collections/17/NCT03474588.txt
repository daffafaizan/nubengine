      which 90 Spanish-speaking individuals with alcohol use disorder will be randomized to (1)
      standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic (ST; typically consisting of weekly
      individual and group supportive counseling) or (2) CBT4CBT-Spanish as an adjunct to ST. Other
      aspects of the trial will parallel those in the investogators completed trial of the English
      version of CBT4CBT-Alcohol to facilitate comparability across studies. Treatments will be
      delivered over an 8-week period with a 6-month follow-up to assess durability and/or delayed
      emergence of treatment effects. The primary outcome measure will be percent days of
      abstinence (PDA) by week. Secondary outcomes include percent heavy drinking days and number
      of individuals with no heavy drinking days in the last 4 weeks of treatment.

      Participants will be 90 individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use at the Hispanic Clinic
      of CMHC. The clinic treats a heterogeneous population, where 42% of those in the co-occurring
      treatment program report alcohol as their principal substance related issue and 43% are
      women. As reported above, the investigators have demonstrated the ability to recruit,
      randomize, retain, and follow-up high numbers of closely related samples in this setting.
