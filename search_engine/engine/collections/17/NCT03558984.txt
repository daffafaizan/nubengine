    
      This is Phase III study to evaluate the anti-infective efficacy and safety of D-PLEX, a new
      formulation of extended release of Doxycycline, over a period of 3 months post operation by
      preventing sternal infection post cardiac surgery in patients above the age of 18, including
      high risk patients for infection. Study will be conducted in about 45 sites in US (about 15
      sites), Europe and Israel, recruitment period will last about 18 months. D-PLEX will be
      administered as a single application. For subjects randomized to the investigational
      treatment arm, D-PLEX treatment will be applied at the end of the index surgery just before
      closing the chest, as an adjunct to the SOC prophylactic antibiotic treatment. For subjects
      randomized to the control arm, the surgical treatment will be as per the SOC. Pre- and
      post-operative care for both arms will be performed per site SOC. Patients will followed-up
      during 6 months after surgery.
