        -  Determine response to gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and cisplatin (GTP) among
           patients with regional or distant metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of the
           urothelium or local/regional recurrence after cystoprostatectomy.

        -  Determine response in patients who receive GTP as the initial chemotherapeutic treatment
           as well as in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.

        -  Determine response duration, freedom from progression, and overall survival.

        -  Assess the toxicity of GTP.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (yes vs no).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving a partial response or complete response undergo surgical restaging and
      debulking. Four to 6 weeks later, patients receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.
