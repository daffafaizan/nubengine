      disorders such as urinary and fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and sexual disorders.
      However there are no studies in the literature that address the application of therapeutic
      resources available to improve the PFM awareness. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of transvaginal electrical stimulation, vaginal palpation, vaginal
      palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt and contraction of accessory muscles in the
      acquisition of ability to contract the PFM, as well as to evaluate the sexual function of
      women studied. One hundred twenty women with PFM function graded 0 and 1 measured by Oxford
      Modified Scale will be submitted at random to physical therapy with transvaginal electrical
      stimulation, vaginal palpation, vaginal palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt and
      contraction of accessory muscles (glutes and hip adductors) and the control group who receive
      verbal instructions related to the pelvic floor and its contraction. For the evaluation of
      the sexual function will be applied the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

      The patients will be assessed by vaginal palpation, perineometry and surface electromyography
      before and after the intervention.
