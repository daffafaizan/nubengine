      who received at least one dose of PD-1 inhibitors plus regorafenib from 5/2019 to 2/2021 in
      14 Chinese medical centers. Patients received the study treatment as part of routine medical
      care based on the consensus of clinicians and patients. In addition to the primary and
      secondary outcomes, other patient and treatment characteristics including baseline
      microsatellite instability status, metastatic sites, previous treatment regimens,
      post-treatment regimens, are collected in order to describe the real-world treatment
      patterns.
