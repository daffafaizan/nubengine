      serious infusion related reaction (IRR) throughout the main study will be eligible to enroll
      in an optional, open-label, non-randomized substudy to MN30035 and receive one additional
      shorter infusion of ocrelizumab at the Week 96 visit. This substudy will enroll approximately
      100 patients from MN30035 main study.
