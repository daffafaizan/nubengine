      in infected erythrocytes AMA1 has become a leading candidate vaccine antigen. This is based
      on several facts, most notably that in several field studies an association was found between
      antibodies to the ectodomain of AMA1 and protection against clinical malaria. Also, in the
      Gambia, presence of antibodies to AMA1 and MSP-1 has been shown to enhance clearance of
      chloroquine resistant parasites in vivo.

      There are a number of trials currently ongoing in Oxford which are aimed at examining a
      simian adenovirus as a delivery vehicle and liver and blood stage malaria antigens as
      inserts. AdCh63 is currently in use with the MSP-1 insert, a blood stage antigen, in a phase
      I dose escalation clinical trial in Oxford (VAC037 / GTAC 166). The trial design includes
      AdCh63 MSP-1 administered alone and with MVA MSP-1 as part of a heterologous prime boost
      schedule, with sporozoite challenge of 3 volunteers in the higher dose group. At the most
      recent interim analysis, AdCh63 MSP-1 demonstrates an excellent safety profile.

      Also, AdCh63 is currently in use with the ME-TRAP insert, a liver stage antigen in a phase I
      dose escalation clinical trial in Oxford, (VAC033 / GTAC133) and a phase I/IIa trial with
      sporozoite challenge (MAL034 / OXREC: 09/H064/9). AdCh63 ME-TRAP has been administered alone
      and with MVA ME-TRAP as part of a heterologous prime boost schedule at various doses with
      excellent safety and immunogenicity to 87 volunteers at time of interim analysis.
