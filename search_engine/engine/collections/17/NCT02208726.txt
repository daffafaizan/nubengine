      two-week period at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Health Clinic, Doornfontein Campus.
      Thirty university students, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited into the study by
      means of advertisements placed on the campus with relevant permission given. Participants
      will attend an initial consultation and will be requested to sign a Participant Information
      and Consent form, complete the Participant Information Sheet, and a Remedy Symptom
      Questionnaire to determine inclusion into the study. Participants' vital signs will be
      measured. Participants will then receive a 16ml vial of either the Picricum acidum and
      Phosphoricum acidum Homaccord pillules, or a placebo (unmedicated sucrose pillules), which
      will be randomized and dispensed by the UJ Homeopathic Dispenser. Participants will be
      requested to take 5 pillules in a daily dose for 14 days, commencing 21 days before and
      ceasing 7 days prior to the start of examinations. The State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI)
      and the Anxiety Symptom Score Card will be completed 21 days prior to the first academic
      examination, as well as on the last day of taking the medication. Data will be collected and
      analyzed by Statkon, using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon
      signed ranks test.

      The outcome of this research may show that the Homeopathic Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum
      acidum Homaccord has a positive effect in alleviating anxiety in university students,
      allowing for further studies in the field.
