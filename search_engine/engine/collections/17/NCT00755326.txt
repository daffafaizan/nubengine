        1. To determine whether HLXL improves pain and/or function in patients with OA of the knee
           who continue to have symptoms despite receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        2. To identify an optimal dosage of HLXL, among two dosages, as determined by pain relief
           and/or functional improvement, in a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled double-blind
           randomized phase II clinical trial, in conjunction with indicia of safety and
           tolerability in patients with OA of the knee who are receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        3. To explore mechanisms of action of HLXL, correlating changes in biological markers of
           suppression of systemic inflammation with changes in clinical response
