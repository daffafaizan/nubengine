      through selective microbiota transplantation (SMT) or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
      for radiation enteritis (RE). FMT is the whole profile of fecal microbiota transplantation.
      SMT is the intermediate composition of bacteria between traditional probiotics and whole
      profile of microbiota; it aims to stimulate the efficiency of fecal microbiota
      transplantation. At enrollment, "Shared Decision Making" intervention was applied to support
      patient involvement in making health decisions. Patients have opportunity to choose selective
      microbiota transplantation (SMT) or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Patients will
      receive follow-up for at least 4 weeks. Blood test, endoscopy and questionnaire will be used
      to access participants at study start and at study completion. Fecal microbiota compositions,
      blood and urinary metabolic profiles of patients will be analyzed to assess associated
      microbial changes.
