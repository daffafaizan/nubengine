      Screening and advising at-risk drinkers to cut-down is a highly effective and cost-effective
      intervention when conducted in primary healthcare settings. However, these interventions are
      seldom implemented at the primary care level.

      Twelve out of the 26 primary health care units of the Dão Lafões Grouping of Primary Health
      Care Centres will be randomized to two groups: the intervention arm will receive the new
      implementation program; the control group will be on a waiting list for receiving the
      implementation program and will receive the intervention after the testing phase of the trial
      is completed. The study will last for one year, starting in January 2017. The implementation
      program was designed in order to overcome known barriers for implementing alcohol screening
      and brief advice in primary health care. The Behaviour Change Wheel and the Theoretical
      Domains Framework were used to pinpoint the constructs and behaviour change techniques most
      suited to address the barriers in order to achieve practice changes.
