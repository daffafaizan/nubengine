      treatment comprising etoposide and cisplatin improves the survival of patients with extensive
      stage small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the tumor response rate and failure-free survival
      of these patients treated with these regimens. III. Describe and compare the toxic effects
      associated with these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to performance status
      and gender. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Arm II: Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and cisplatin and etoposide as in arm I. Patients then
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 4-18. Treatment repeats in both arms every
      21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed at least every 2 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and
      then at least every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 670 patients (335 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 16 months.
