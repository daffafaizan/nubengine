      efficient, but it creates an unfavorable environment for preterm infants. Indeed is a primary
      source of continuous noise in neonatal units and causes discomfort, pain, skin lesions. High
      flow nasal cannula (HFNC) introduced more recently in neonatal care supplies high allowing
      for carbon dioxide nasopharyngeal wash-out, reduction of work of breathing and is well
      tolerated. HFNC could help to improve the environment of preterm infants by reducing
      deleterious stimuli (noise, pain, discomfort) and by facilitating the contact between parents
      and babies. Efficacy of HFNC seems to be similar to other non-invasive respiratory supports
      for preventing treatment failure, death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The benefits of HFNC
      implementation was only slightly analyzed in extremely preterm infants. the place of HFNC is
      becoming increasingly important in neonatology and could help to improve the quality of care.
      Few HFNC devices are available but their cost of use has not been evaluated in Europe.

      HIFLO study aimed to assess the impact of HFNC therapy introduction, on exposure to nCPAP and
      on the duration of oxygen therapy and hospital stay in preterm infants and in a subgroup of
      extremely preterm infants. The investigators also aim to evaluate the cost of use of nCPAP
      and HFNC using two different devices.
