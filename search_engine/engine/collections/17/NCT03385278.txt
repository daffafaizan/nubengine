    
      Background:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was supposed as an
      experimental approach to disorders of consciousness treatment. Its therapeutic effects have
      been variously documented.

      Objective: The study aimed to investigate the reactivity of electroencephalography (EEG) and
      the clinical response of patients with disorders of consciousness and explore the
      neuromodulatory effects of high-frequency rTMS in DOC.

      Method:In this randomised,sham-controlled study,real or sham 20 Hz rTMS were applied to the
      left primary motor cortex (M1) of participants with disorders of consciousness for 5
      consecutive days . Evaluations were blindly performed at baseline, immediately after the end
      of the 5-days treatment and 1 week later with the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R)
      scale and EEG.

      Hypothesis:Real rTMS can be an effective awakening method.
