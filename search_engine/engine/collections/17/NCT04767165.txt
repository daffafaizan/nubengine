      In addition to the water/fat ratio in bone marrow there are also other parameters for
      quantitative MRI assessment. These include the apparent diffusion coefficient (ACD), the T1
      relaxation time, mapping of the macromolecular proton fraction. The undoubted advantage of
      MRI is its non-invasiveness and the ability to assess any localization of the bone marrow.

      MRI may become a new non-invasive method for assessing the ratio of fat to cells in the bone
      marrow in children with hematological malignancies, which can help in making a diagnosis and
      monitoring the response to therapy.
