    
      This is a randomized, 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence, crossover, placebo- and
      active-controlled, double-blind for ALXN1840, open-label for moxifloxacin, in healthy adult
      participants. Participants will be domiciled in the clinic for 7 days during Treatment Period
      1 and for 6 days during Treatment Period 2 and 3. A single oral dose of each treatment
      (ALXN1840, matching ALXN1840 placebo, or moxifloxacin) will be administered on Day 1 of each
      period following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. There will be a minimum 14-day
      washout between study intervention administrations for each treatment period. Cardiodynamic,
      pharmacokinetic, and safety assessments will be performed at certain times during the study.
      An end-of-study visit will occur 14 days (Â±2 days) after the last dose.
