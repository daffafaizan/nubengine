      Placebo-ontrolled, Phase I/II, Dose-Ranging Study of the Safety, Reactogenicity, and
      Immunogenicity of Intramuscular Inactivated Influenza A/H5N1 Vaccine in Healthy Adults
      (04-063)" and also "in Healthy Elderly Adults" (04-076). All adult subjects enrolled in the
      main vaccine trials at Vanderbilt (04-076), Maryland (04-063), and Rochester (04-063) will be
      eligible for enrollment in the cell-mediated immune response sub-study. A maximum of 232
      healthy ambulatory male and female subjects; 180 subjects 18 to 64 years old and 64 subjects
      aged 65 years and older, in the United States, could be enrolled. The primary objectives are:
      to establish a reproducible, functional cell-mediated immune response assay to evaluate the
      magnitude and functional capacity of T cells responding to monovalent subvirion H5 influenza
      vaccine and to evaluate the percent of subjects demonstrating a CD4+ and/or CD8+ response
      approximately 14 days after the first vaccination and 14 days and 6 months after the second
      vaccination (04-063), and 14 days after the first and second vaccination and 14 days and 6
      months after the third vaccination (04-076). The secondary objectives are: to evaluate
      dose-related and age-related humoral immunogenicity compared to the cellular immune responses
      approximately 14 days after the first vaccination and 14 days and 6 months after the second
      vaccination (04-063), and 14 days after the first and second vaccination and 14 days and 6
      months after the third vaccination (04-076) and to establish CMI assays that can be applied
      to future avian vaccine immunogenicity evaluation, such as the Chiron H9N2 avian influenza
      vaccine, future H7 vaccines, or vaccines with other avian HA molecules. The study outcome
      measure, immunogenicity will be based on H5 strain-specific cell-mediated immunity measured
      14 days after the first, second, and third (04-076 only) dose, and month 6 after the last
      dose of vaccine.
