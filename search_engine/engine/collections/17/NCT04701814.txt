      during the movements of a joint. For example, shoulder abduction or elevation needs the
      scapula to move upward rotation with posterior tilt and external rotation. Moreover, needs
      glenohumeral (GH) joint glide inferior and posterior these movements occur normally to permit
      us to elevate our shoulder without any restriction and the full range of motion(ROM). so in
      the patients with shoulder problems and have difficulties reaching full ROM of elevation the
      investigators applied mobilization of scapula toward upward rotation with external rotation
      and posterior tilt and by using mobilization belt applied posterior and inferior glide to GH
      joint. However, mobilization techniques have a short-term effect to enhance this effect, the
      investigators adding a motor learning approach to achieve a long-term effect and prevent
      recurrent .the investigators applied this technique 3 times per week for 3 weeks.
