        -  Compare overall survival, response rate, and time to progression of patients with
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus gemcitabine
           and cisplatin.

        -  Compare the toxicities of each of these 2 regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to weight
      loss in the past 6 months (less than 5% vs at least 5%) and disease stage (stage IIIB with
      pleural or pericardial effusion or pleural implants vs stage IV/recurrent). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30
           minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by
           cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 only.

      Treatment continues in both arms every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-90 patients (20-45 per arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 12 months.
