      tumor effect as conventional myeloablative therapy without causing high treatment related
      toxicities. Non myeloablative transplant has been gaining wider acceptance as a way to
      achieve longer disease free and over all survival in patients with low grade B-cell
      malignancies, which otherwise is an incurable disease. Recent studies of non-myeloablative
      HSCT have demonstrated the powerful effect of graft versus leukemia alone against myeloma and
      other malignant B-cell malignancies if the transplant is performed for low grade, low volume
      disease.
