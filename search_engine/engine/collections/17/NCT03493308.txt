      feasibility of implementing an intervention consisting of pain neuroscience education in
      addition to exercise. It is antecipated that the intervention will consist of 1 to 2 sessions
      per week during 8 weeks and will be delivered in small groups. Participants will be assessed
      for pain intensity, duration, catastrophizing, fear of movement, knowledge of pain
      neuroscience, depression and performance.
