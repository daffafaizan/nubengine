      for Motivation Phase smokers. We hypothesize that, compared with the NRT-only group, the Take
      a Break group will have a greater number of days abstinent during the 'break' period, a
      greater increase in self-efficacy at the end of the 'break' period, a lower time to first
      quit attempt, and a higher rate of quit at 6 months. This research study will also provide
      valuable insight into this population of smokers and increase our understanding of which
      tools may be effective in helping them quit smoking Our Specific Aims are

        -  AIM 1: Refine the Take a Break mHealth tool and implementation program.

        -  AIM 2: Conduct a randomized trial of the effectiveness of Take a Break.

        -  AIM 3: Follow participants in the AIM 2 randomized clinical trial for 6 months to
           evaluate time to quit attempts, number of quit attempts, and 6-month biochemically
           verified point prevalent cessation.
