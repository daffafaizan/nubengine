    
      The objective of this protocol is to determine whether a neuromodulation intervention
      associated with functional electrical stimulation, when combined with task-specific training
      over several sessions, decreases upper limb motor disability, motor impairment, overall
      disability and improves quality of life compared to the sham intervention and functional
      electrical stimulation.

      The interventions will consist of three sessions per week, over six weeks, of outpatient
      functional electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist and task-specific training. In each
      session, either active peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) or sham PNS will be applied. Before
      the first session, patients will be familiarized with the procedures.
