      disease (Goodpasture's disease, i.e. GP) with Adverse Renal Prognosis. The primary efficacy
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an IdeS based regimen to salvage independent renal
      function measured as no need for dialysis at 6 months after IdeS treatment. The primary
      safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IdeS in patients
      with severe anti-GBM disease on background of standard care consisting of
      pulse-methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) combined
      with plasma exchange (PLEX). The patients will be followed during 6 months according to the
      study visit plan.
