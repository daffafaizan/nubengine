      patients with moderate hypovolemia/dehydration requiring parenteral rehydration. It is
      expected that this study will describe the onset or change in cardiac output using Hylenex
      augmented subcutaneous rehydration from ages 2 months up to 3 years and at a flow rate
      satisfying clinical needs, especially in reference to changes in cardiac output observed in
      standard intravenous rehydration.
