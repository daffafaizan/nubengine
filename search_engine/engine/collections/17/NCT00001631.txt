      passage of intravenously injected gadolinium contrast will be used to evaluate regional
      myocardial perfusion in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The MRI results will be compared with conventional radionuclide
      perfusion studies (ex. dipyridamole thallium). A clinically defined normal group will also be
      studied without radionuclide correlation.
