      to be recorded will include your medical history, the disease, treatments you have received
      and how you have responded to any treatments, as well as any side effects you may have had.

      The data will be stored on a password-protected computer at MD Anderson for use in future
      research related to cancer.

      Your data will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to
      your data. Only the researcher in charge of this study will have access to the code numbers
      and be able to link the data to you. This is to allow medical information related to your
      data to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your data will not be able to link this
      data to you.
