    
      This clinical trial will evaluate how an on-line health information sharing community of
      patients called PatientsLikeMe, www.patientslikeme.com, [or "PLM"] may help patients feel
      better supported during treatment. This study will also evaluate how much PLM can help
      collect information on side effects from chemotherapy and endocrine treatments, and radiation
      therapy.
