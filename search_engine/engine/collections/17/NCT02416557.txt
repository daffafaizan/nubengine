      clinical outcomes in various study populations. Intraoperative hypothermia has various
      adverse effects including impaired drug clearance, cold diuresis and hypovolemia,
      immunosuppression with increased infection risk, electrolyte disorders, coagulopathy with
      impaired platelet function, negative nitrogen balance, shivering, insulin resistance, and
      myocardial events. Numerous methods have been introduced to prevent intraoperative
      hypothermia, such as warming of infusion fluid, forced-air warming, heat-pads, heated water
      mattress, and heated humidifiers. However, in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery in the
      prone position, these methods to prevent intraoperative hypothermia may partially effective
      because these methods, in clinical practice, have a significant limitation in their
      application.

      Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) reduces the venous return by increasing intrathoracic
      pressure. This causes carotid unloading, which leads to a secondary peripheral
      vasoconstriction by increasing thermoregulatory vasoconstriction threshold and blunts
      intraoperative hypothermia. Previous studies demonstrated that intraoperative PEEP
      significantly attenuated the extent of intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing
      tympanoplasty. However, the beneficial effect of PEEP on thermoregulation is not investigated
      in patients with the prone position for spinal surgery.

      The investigators hypothesized that PEEP can reduce the extent of intraoperative hypothermia
      via thermoregulatory modulation. In this study, the investigators investigated the effect of
      PEEP on intraoperative core body temperature and the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia
      in patients undergoing spinal surgery
