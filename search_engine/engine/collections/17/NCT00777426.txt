      versus non-HAD individuals in a cognitively characterized cohort followed for one year.

      Increasing evidence links strong CD4+ T helper function to robust CD8+ CTL responses.
      HIV-1-infected individuals who are able to maintain strong HIV-1 specific T cell responses
      have better clinical outcomes and rarely develop neurological signs or symptoms.
      Monocyte/macrophage (M/M) infiltration into the white matter of the brain is a hallmark of
      HAD; however, the mechanisms by which M/M are recruited to the brain are not clearly
      understood. We hypothesize that the loss of specific HIV-1 T cell response results in
      activation/dysregulation of M/M leading to their accumulation in the brain.

      To test this hypothesis will characterize Thai HIV-1-infected individuals as follows: 25 HAD
      individuals, 25 CD4-, education-, gender-, and age-matched non-HAD individuals and 10 HIV
      negative controls. We will then: 1) define CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function by evaluating HIV-1
      specific responses in HAD vs. non-HAD groups; 2) simultaneously correlate these responses to
      M/M subpopulation cell number, percentage, and immune function; 3) correlate these responses
      to HIV-1 proviral load and autologous viral sequences (viral escape sequences and HIV
      quasispecies); and 4) evaluate the impact of ARV on dementia related to changes in
      immunological responses. Since little is known of the interaction between CD4+ T helper
      responses, CTL function, and the level of M/M subpopulation activation in the
      neuropathogenesis of HAD, this innovative study will elucidate the role of HIV-1 specific
      immune responses in HAD and provide new insights into HIV-1 neuropathogenesis and its
      relationship to peripheral immune responses, potentially opening exciting new areas for
      further investigation.
