      3,700 Chinese patients. Two subtypes of patients will be enrolled: I, acute disabling
      ischemic stroke (<24 hours of symptoms onset); II, acute TIA (<24 hours of symptoms onset).

      Patients will be randomized into 3 groups:

        -  Receiving a 100-mg dose of aspirin and placebo rivaroxaban from day 1 to day 30

        -  Receiving a 5-mg dose of rivaroxaban and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 30

        -  Receiving a 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 30

      The primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or
      hemorrhage) at 90 days.
