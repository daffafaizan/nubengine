      through the subacromial area. Problems in upper limb function in people with SIS adversely
      affect quality of life and functional independence of the patients. Recovery of restricted
      daily life functions (such as dressing, personal care, eating and body care) is one of the
      main goals of physiotherapy and rehabilitation in SIS and currently, conventional
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods are most commonly used. The main purpose of this
      method is to reduce pain, increase range of motion and muscle strength. With the developing
      technology various virtual reality applications have begun to take place in physiotherapy and
      rehabilitation programs recently. These virtual reality applications are used to motivate the
      patient and keep their interest in the rehabilitation. In addition, the diversity of virtual
      reality applications is increasing day by day so that participation of the patients and the
      interest in the treatment can be increased. Various measurements of the user's performance
      can be transferred to the clinician simultaneously with these systems. Also for most of these
      systems exercise modes, difficulty and duration are programmable so that the training
      sessions can be varied. The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of game-based
      virtual reality exercises added to conventional physiotherapy and rehabilitation program in
      patients with SIS.
