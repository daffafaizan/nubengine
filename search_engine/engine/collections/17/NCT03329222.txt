    
      A randomised, double blind, controlled, multi-centre study to assess the efficacy of an
      infant formula in the dietary management of infantile colic.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the test product, compared to the control formula, will
      reduce the crying time in infants with infantile colic.

      The various time points of the outcome are:

      V1 (screening : Day -5 to day 0); V2 ( Randomization: Day 0); V3 (Day 7); V4 (Day 21); Phone
      Call (Day 28); V5 (End -intervention: Day 42); V6 (Day 56)
