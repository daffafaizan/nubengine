      multicenter, non- interventional. During this observational study, subjects diagnosed with
      severe or moderately severe (with severe phenotype) hemophilia A receiving routine
      prophylaxis treatment with ReFacto AF as per local standard clinical care, and in line with
      local labeling, are to be observed for 12 months.

      The primary objective is to assess the health-related quality of life in subjects treated
      with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the subjective physical functioning of subjects treated with ReFacto AF
           routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months;

        -  To assess the treatment satisfaction of caregivers of children and subjects above 18
           years treated with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis at baseline and after 6 and 12 months;

        -  To determine in routine clinical practice the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in
           subjects treated with ReFacto AF routine prophylaxis;

        -  To describe the status of joint health measured by HJHS before and after starting
           routine prophylaxis for subjects above 18 years.
