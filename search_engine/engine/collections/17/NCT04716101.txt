      back pain and asymptomatic volunteers will undergo a research dynamic ultrasound (US) exam of
      the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) of the lower back. A musculoskeletal radiologist will perform
      the US exams consisting of a series of 5 dynamic scans of both the right and left paraspinal
      muscles, obtained during 15 degrees of passive flexion of the lower body using a motorized
      table.

      Following the US exam, the group of patients and the group of volunteers will be respectively
      randomized to receive either a standardized massage technique intervention or a sham
      technique. The US exam will be repeated after the intervention.

      Ultrasound image segmentation will be performed by two independent observers and inter-rater
      variability will be assessed. Post-processing of the US recordings will include assessment of
      geometrical (thickness), mechanical (percent shear strain between the TLF and the
      epimysium-muscle complex) and tissue ultrastructure features (the mean intensity μ, the
      scatterer clustering parameter α and the structure parameter κ of the echo envelope). These
      features will be compared between patients and volunteers and between the intervention
      groups.
