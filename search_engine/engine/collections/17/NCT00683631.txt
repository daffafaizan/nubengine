      disease-free survival in patients with primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)).
      Unfortunately, most of these patients present with disease that is not amenable to surgery
      (multifocal disease) or have other medical contraindications to surgery (limited hepatic
      reserve related to advanced cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis). Fewer than 15% of HCC patients
      are suitable surgical candidates. The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to
      selectively administer a potentially lethal dose of radioactive material to cancerous tissue
      in the liver of patients with HCC. This type of regional therapy may have several advantages
      over systemically administered treatments and may also be of value as a 'bridging' treatment
      for HCC patients awaiting a donor organ for liver transplantation.
