    
      Patients with suspected AF will be initially referred to a community-based, nurse-led
      Arrhythmia clinic by their General Practitioners over a 15-month period.

      All patients will be issued with a one week ACER (the 'R. Test 4 Evolution'), seen as the
      'best-practice' investigation for this population group. Participants will also be issued
      with a PHRM for three months. They will be instructed to take regular twice-daily, 30 second
      recordings with additional recordings in the event of relevant symptoms. They will return the
      ACER after one week and the PHRM after 3 months.

      A subgroup of participants (target recruitment number = 100) will undergo transthoracic
      echocardiography. A 40ml venous blood sample will also be taken. Another small subgroup
      (target recruitment = 20) will be asked to continue twice-daily recordings using the PHRM for
      a further nine months and will be issued with a repeat one week ACER at study completion.
