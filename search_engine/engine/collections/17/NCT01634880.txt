      local and distant recurrence-free survival, and treatment-related toxicities. Also, the
      investigators plan to study EGFR-related and immune biomarkers in baseline tumor tissue as
      well as blood samples obtained prior and after therapy.

      Subject Population We will enroll patients with completely resected, locally advanced
      salivary gland cancers.

      Treatment Plan Standard radiation 64-70Gy with 2.0 Gy daily fractions in 6-7 weeks.
      Panitumumab 2.5 mg/Kg IV, weekly during radiation (total of 6-7 doses).

      Statistical Design and Sample Size Phase II, one-stage, study with the 3-year recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) as the primary endpoint. The sample size is 30 patients.
