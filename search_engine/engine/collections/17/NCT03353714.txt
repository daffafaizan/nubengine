      women. One common complication is short-term postoperative voiding dysfunction. Approximately
      20% of patients undergoing MUS have difficulty voiding in the immediate postoperative period
      and are discharged home with an indwelling bladder catheter. A pudendal block provides
      analgesia to the vulva, vagina, and perineum and is used in various fields, ranging from
      obstetrical indications to hemorrhoidectomies. The colorectal literature has demonstrated an
      improvement in postoperative voiding dysfunction with intraoperative bilateral pudendal
      blockade, presumably due to pain relief. However, only one study has explored the effect of a
      pudendal blockade on postoperative voiding in patients undergoing MUS. This was a small
      French case series of 9 patients, and it concluded that it was a safe procedure with good
      patient satisfaction. Given the scant literature evaluating voiding dysfunction following
      pudendal blocks in MUS, and the encouraging data from anorectal surgeries, we aim to study
      this effect via a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial.
