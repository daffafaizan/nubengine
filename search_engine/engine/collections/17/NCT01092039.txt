      significant morbidity and economic loss. At the present time no truly effective therapy is
      available. Therapeutic interventions with compounds such as zinc have been found to be
      helpful however well reported side-effects have prevented its extensive use.

      Based on several years of anecdotal clinical evidence which has shown that XIGO is effective
      in alleviating the symptoms of the common cold-the findings of which are supported by
      competent and reliable evidence from in vivo and in vitro and clinical trials studies on each
      of the individual active ingredients of the formulation, it has been proposed that XIGO, when
      administered orally, has a direct stimulatory effect on multiple components of the immune
      system. It is proposed that this stimulation increases both the immune cell population as
      well as its functionality and this will be observed in cells and molecules from both the
      innate and adaptive responses.
