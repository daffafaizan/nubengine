      activation and differentiation of monocytes/macrophages. From our Preliminary Studies( VA
      Merit Review Grant), we propose that Vitamin D deficiency may alter the 'pro-inflammatory'
      ('classically activated') M1 macrophages , characterized by i] high expression of NOS2,
      TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-a, CXCL10, and CCL19; and ii] minimal expression of arginase 1
      and mannose R.

      The clinical relevance of these findings is suggested by the presence of activated M1
      macrophages in liver biopsies from patients with severe drug-induced liver injury
      (unpublished observations).

      Prospective vitamin D supplementation studies with appropriate endpoints are needed to define
      the role of vitamin D on inflammation in patients with chronic liver diseases.
