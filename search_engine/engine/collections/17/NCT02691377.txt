      effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of Primary Sj√∂gren Syndrome.The
      eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive acupuncture or sham acupuncture
      for 8 weeks.

      Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 85%, and a 20% drop-out, a sample sized of 30
      would be needed for each group. The statistical analysis will be based on the
      intention-to-treat principle. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test or
      Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables will be analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's
      exact test or Kruskal-Wallis H test as appropriate. For comparison between two time points,
      paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used as appropriate. A statistically
      significant difference was set at P<0.05.
