      metabolism disorders. However, apart from some extreme situations, the assay achieved solely
      is not helpful. This is due to the varying levels encountered from one subject to another for
      the same disease. This is related to the facts that values considered to be normal cover a
      wide range and that a value obtained for a given patient at a given time, can be influenced
      by many factors.

      It has been reported that a a single oral iron dose induced an increase of serum hepcidin
      level in healthy subjects which is abolished in subjects with genetic hemochromatosis linked
      to insufficient hepcidin expression related to mutations in the HFE or TFR2 genes.

      In patients with a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, it was suggested that the expected
      hepcidinemia increase found after an iron intake was altered, likely due to a slight
      inflammatory signal responsible for hepcidin induction.

      The investigators hypothesize that a dynamic response of iron parameters, including
      modulation of hepcidin level, to an iron intake will allow to discriminate patients with
      ferroportin disease or dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, situations whose clinicobiological
      presentation is often confusing.

      Thus, the three objectives in this study will be :

        1. To define pharmacokinetic characteristics of serum hepcidin in response to iron oral
           intake and to determine the ability of this pharmacokinetic to discriminate dysmetabolic
           hepatosiderosis and ferroportin disease.

        2. To correlate amplitude of this response to the iron parameters modulation

        3. To correlate amplitude of this response to the concentration of divalent cations whose
           metabolism uses common genes to those involved in iron metabolism.
