    
      Patients listed for a direct anterior total hip arthroplasty by a single surgeon will be
      recruited for this study and allocated to one of two groups:

        1. intervention group: 25 grams of iv dexamethasone at induction followed by 10 mg of iv
           dexamethasone 12 hours later

        2. control group: 5 grams of iv dexamethasone at induction followed by placebo 12 hours
           later Both patients and surgeons will be blinded. Primary outcome measure will be number
           of steps during the first 6 weeks as measured by a pedometer. Secondary outcome measures
           will be side effects, complications, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, pain, nausea,
           stiffness, achievement of clinical milestones and use of analgesia/anti-emetics. This
           data will be collected using a tailor made application for a smartphone or tablet and
           data collecting will start one week before surgery until 6 weeks after surgery.

      Based on a power analysis both groups will consist of 35 patients each.
