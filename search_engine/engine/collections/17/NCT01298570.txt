    
      This randomized (2:1 ratio), multi-center, placebo-controlled, phase II efficacy study is
      designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between regorafenib + FOLFIRI
      (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan [ARM A] versus placebo + FOLFIRI [ARM B]) in
      patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) previously treated with a FOLFOX
      (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin) regimen. Secondary objectives include objective
      response (OR) rates, disease control (DC) rates, and overall survival (OS). A pharmacokinetic
      (PK) evaluation of irinotecan will be conducted in a subset of patients at selected sites.
      This trial also incorporates a number of exploratory analyses designed to evaluate potential
      correlations between blood and tissue biomarkers and clinical benefit.
