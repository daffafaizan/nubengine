      inflammatory process of the prostate, it is usually a recurrent bothersome problem, so
      patients who fail to response to classic medical treatment are expected to benefit from a
      strong anti inflammatory injection like betamethasone, which has strong anti inflammatory
      plus anti oedematous properties so limitation of this inflammatory process across the
      prostate is expected to relieve the patients symptoms
