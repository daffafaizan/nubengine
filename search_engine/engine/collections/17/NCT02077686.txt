      empowerment approach and is based on the previously evaluated education and treatment program
      for type 1 diabetes: PRIMAS (NCT01220557). The module is designed as a group session held by
      a trained diabetes educator. Patients are randomized either to the immediate participation in
      the module or to the control group. Control group is a waiting-list control group. Patients
      in this waiting-list control group get the education after the completion of the 6-month
      follow-up.
