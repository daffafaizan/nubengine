    
      This is an observer-blinded, block-randomized, dose-finding, phase I trial, comparing
      different dose levels of MV-ZIKA-RSP to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity, of this novel ZIKA-RSP vaccine. Placebo (physiological saline solution) will
      be applied to blind the different treatment schedules.

      After the screening procedures, 48 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-55 years will
      be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (A, B, C or D). Participants will be
      assessed for immunogenicity on days 0, 28 and 56 (treatment period), as confirmed by the
      presence of functional anti-zika-rsp antibodies determined by (PRNT50) and by ELISA, at the
      same time safety will be also assessed. After the treatment period, participants will be
      called by phone (day 182) for evaluation of safety follow-up.

      The investigator and site personnel assessing AEs, all participants, as well as one of the
      sponsor's representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be blinded
      to which vaccine was administered. Only the unblinded monitor, site personnel performing
      randomization, preparation and administration of IMP will be unblinded.
