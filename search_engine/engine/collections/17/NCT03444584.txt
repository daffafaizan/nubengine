    
      This is an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI0382 versus placebo in overweight/obese participants with T2DM
      treated with metformin and dapagliflozin dual therapy. The study will enroll participants
      with T2DM treated either with metformin monotherapy or with metformin and dapagliflozin dual
      therapy. After the screening period, participants treated with metformin monotherapy only
      will enter a 4-week run-in period where participants will be administered oral dapagliflozin
      10 mg a day, which will be provided by the sponsor. Enrolled participants that are already
      treated with metformin and dapagliflozin dual therapy will continue this dual therapy
      throughout the study and can be randomized after the screening period without entering the
      run-in period. All participants (ie, on monotherapy and dual therapy) entering the
      double-blind treatment period will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg a day, which will be provided
      by the sponsor.

      Participants in this study will participate for up to 20 weeks including a screening period
      of up to 60 days, a 4-week run-in period (for participants on metformin monotherapy only), a
      4-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up post-treatment period.
