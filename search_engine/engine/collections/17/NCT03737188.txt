      For many of these BGMS, the system accuracy is unknown or it has not yet been assessed in
      manufacturer-independent studies. The IDT surveillance program aims at assessing the system
      accuracy of different BGMS that are available in Europe in a manufacturer-independent,
      investigator-initiated study. The initial study will cover 18 BGMS from 18 different
      manufacturers. Per BGMS, one test strip lot will be assessed based on procedures stated in
      the international standard ISO 15197:2013 / EN ISO 15197:2015.
