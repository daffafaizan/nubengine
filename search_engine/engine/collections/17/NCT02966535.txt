      robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or cystectomy. Due to increased intrathoracic
      pressure and absorbed CO2 gas insufflated into abdominal cavity, hypercapnia as well as
      hypoxia may occur. Inverse ratio ventilation or prolonged inspiratory time during mechanical
      ventilation has been reported to be improve gas exchange in adult respiratory distress
      syndrome. The investigators attempt to test the hypothesis that prolonged inspiratory time
      (I:E ratio = 1:1) may improve the gas exchange during robot-assisted laparoscopic urologic
      surgery.
