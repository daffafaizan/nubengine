      Infants meeting inclusion criteria were identified daily by reviewing the list of patients
      scheduled for a 2 or 4 month well child visit at the outpatient site. The parent or legal
      guardian was approached prior to vaccination by the research assistant for participation in
      the study. If the parent/guardian accepted to participate in the vaccine study, the
      consenting process was performed and patients were brought to a designated examination room.
      Infants of parents or guardians who consented were randomly assigned to one of four study
      groups using pre-sealed cards. Ten cards were assigned to each group for a total of 40 cards,
      which were recycled with each group of 40 infants enrolled into the study. The four groups of
      the study included:

        1. 2 ml of water 2 minutes prior to immunization and comfort by parent or guardian after
           Immunization (Control Group)

        2. 2 ml of 24% oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunization and comfort by parent or
           guardian after immunization (Sucrose Group)

        3. 2 ml of water 2 minutes prior to immunization and physical intervention using the 5 S's
           by researcher after immunization (Physical Group)

        4. 2 ml of 24% oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunization and physical intervention using
           the 5 S's by researcher after immunization (Physical and Sucrose Group)
