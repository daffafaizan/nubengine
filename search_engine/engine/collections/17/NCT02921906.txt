      sulphonylurea-treated KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes, when they eat, may experience mild
      hypoglycaemia if the food consumed lacks carbohydrate. It has been suggested that this may be
      due to regulation of insulin secretion via the incretin pathway as opposed to the classical
      ATP pathway. Therefore the investigators hypothesise that foods with a relatively high
      protein content compared to those with a relatively high carbohydrate content will result in
      excessive insulin secretion and relatively lower glucose values in KCNJ11 patients. This
      would be in contrast to healthy control subjects or subjects with SU-treated T2D where the
      insulin secretion will be moderated by the ambient glucose via the classical ATP pathway. The
      investigators will formally study this hypothesis by comparing the insulin, glucose and
      incretin hormone responses to a high protein meal with a high carbohydrate meal in people
      with KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes, people without diabetes and people with sulphonylurea-treated
      Type 2 Diabetes. To assess whether any effect seen is due to direct stimulation of the beta
      cell by the sulphonylurea itself, people with KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes will also undergo the
      same tests in the fasting state, having taken the sulphonylurea in the absence of any food.
