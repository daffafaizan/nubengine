      anesthesia can cause sudden, dangerous, difficult-to-control changes in blood pressure and
      heart rate (a "carcinoid crisis") in patients with carcinoid tumors. Patients who have crises
      for a duration of 10 minutes or longer have a 12-fold increased risk of major complications
      during surgery.

      Historically, it has been believed that crises were due to a massive release of carcinoid
      hormones from tumors in the blood; therefore, this study will investigate if telotristat
      ethyl (Xermelo®) can help block this hormone release and reduce the rate of dangerous
      complications that patients with carcinoid tumors may experience during surgery to remove
      their tumors.

      What will this study involve and how long will it last for participants? The study involves
      blood tests before, during and after surgery, and taking telotristat ethyl (Xermelo®) tablets
      orally for two weeks before surgery and on the day of surgery (no later than 2 hours prior to
      surgery).
