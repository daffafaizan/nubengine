      amount of tumor-derived nucleic acids in the blood of patients diagnosed with an early stage
      solid tumor who are either commencing, currently undergoing or have completed treatment. This
      approach will allow the investigators to develop a quantitative measure of therapy efficacy
      via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course of treatment.

      The presence of circulating tumor-derived cfDNA in the plasma of patients can potentially
      enable a non-invasive means of detecting the presence or absence of tumor, assessing tumor
      burden and characterizing tumor biology in patients with cancer. The ability to measure the
      distribution of circulating tumor DNA may allow determination of a quantitative tumor load
      score in plasma that correlates to clinical tumor load. Clinical tumor load is a measure of
      disease burden, and the investigators propose to test in this study whether the tumor load
      score can measure this disease burden. A simple, reliable measure of disease burden would
      have diverse utility during patient therapy.
