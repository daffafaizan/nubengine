        -  Determine the efficacy of trimetrexate glucuronate with leucovorin calcium rescue in
           children with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia, recurrent osteogenic sarcoma, or
           refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma resistant to methotrexate.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (acute lymphocytic leukemia,
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs osteogenic sarcoma).

      Patients receive trimetrexate glucuronate orally or IV every 12 hours on days 1-21 and oral
      leucovorin calcium every 12 hours on days 1-24. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks. Patients
      with stable or responsive disease may receive up to 4 courses of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
