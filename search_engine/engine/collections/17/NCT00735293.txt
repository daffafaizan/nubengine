    
      Patients with excessive underarm sweat and/or odor are recruited. The effect that excessive
      underarm sweat and/or odor has on their lifestyle is evaluated. They are surgically treated
      with the VASER system and followed up for 6 months to evaluate side effects, adverse events
      and effectiveness. Additional lifestyle evaluations are completed for comparison to
      pre-surgery answers.
