      neurodegenerative origin to cognitive disorders. Indeed, a ratio of 0.1 on the occurrence of
      worsening cognitive disorders has been reported in case of normal brain FDG PET.

      However, in patients without cognitive complaints, the risk of developing objective cognitive
      impairment is estimated to be 8% per year and the risk of developing dementia in patients
      with mild cognitive impairment 22% per year.

      Brain 18F-FDG PET is a prognostic factor for the occurrence of MCI or for the conversion of
      MCI to Alzheimer's disease , but we do not really know the impact on the longer-term
      occurrence of cognitive impairment in patients with a normal brain 18F-FDG PET.

      Also, it is commonly accepted that a normal brain 18F-FDG PET scan can rule out a
      neurodegenerative origin for cognitive impairment.

      However, the detection sensitivity of brain 18F-FDG PET is about 90% . Furthermore, we do not
      know the pathophysiological factors that cause false negative PET scans and it would be
      interesting to study them (age, sex, medical history, results of neuropsychological tests,
      etc.).

      Based on subjects available freely on the internet, an American team showed that brain
      18F-FDG PET was predictive of cognitive decline in subjects with no or minor cognitive
      disorders.

      Only a longitudinal study will allow to really know the true negative predictive value of a
      normal 18F-FDG PET scan and the factors associated with a risk of dementia in these subjects.
      This will allow us to better understand the prognostic impact of a normal brain 18F-FDG PET
      scan and to identify a subpopulation that remains at risk, including in case of normal brain
      18F-FDG PET.
