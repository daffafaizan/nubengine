      post-anesthesia follow-up will be performed by Investigator I who is blinded to the study
      treatment. Investigator II will only perform general anaesthesia for CABG surgery and will
      therefore necessarily be unblinded to the treatment conditions.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following study groups. Group 1 (Xenon) will
      receive xenon for maintenance of balanced anesthesia for CABG surgery before and after
      extracorporal circulation. Group 2 (Sevoflurane) will receive sevoflurane for maintenance of
      balanced anesthesia for CABG surgery before and after extracorporal circulation. During
      extracorporal circulation, general anesthesia will be maintained intravenously in both
      groups.
