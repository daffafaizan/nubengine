      (FEV1, the FEV1/FVC ratio and a moderate to severe hyperresponsiveness to methacholine
      challenge were risk factors of asthma exacerbations (OR 11.3). In the present study, these
      parameters will be evaluated in prospective design.

      One hundred children will be included in the study. Baseline parameters will be collected in
      a healthy interval (visit 1), then the children will be followed up for 1 year. If the
      patients fulfill the criteria for an exacerbation the children will present in our
      department. We expect that 44% of the children have an exacerbation. All children will
      present at a second visit after one year (visit 2).
