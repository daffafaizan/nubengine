      methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine. The combination of lenalidomide and azacitidine is
      novel to CLL, but has been tested in a phase I clinical trial involving patients with MDS and
      has been found to be safe with promising activity in that disease. Studying the activity of
      this combination in CLL may allow us to shift the CLL treatment paradigm from cytotoxic
      chemo-immunotherapies therapies towards an epigenetic-immunomodulatory approach and offers
      the unique opportunity to further understand the complex biology of this disease, mechanisms
      of resistance and its interaction with its microenvironment.
