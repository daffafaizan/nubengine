    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase III study comparing the progression free
      survival, overall survival, response rate, toxicity, quality of life between Osimertinib
      monotherapy and combination of osimertinib, pemetrexed, carboplatin in first-line treatment
      of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent EGFR and TP53 mutation.
      Besides, the association between other genetic mutations and efficacy will also be analyzed
      as exploratory endpoint. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either osimertinib
      or osimertinib combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin in a 1:1 ratio.
