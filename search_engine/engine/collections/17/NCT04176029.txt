      malaria that will be included in the cohort. The study will take place at the Maluku District
      Hospital, located in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.

      Lung ultrasound will be performed on admission, h24, and unscheduled timepoints (in case of

      oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be assessed at each time points. All children will be observed
      from admission to hospital discharge. At 30 days a phone call will be made by the study staff
      to follow up clinical conditions of the child.

      The total duration for each subject's participation in the study is approximately 1 month.
      The study period is approximately 12 months
