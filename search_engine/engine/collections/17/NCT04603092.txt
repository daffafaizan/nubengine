      disadvantaged women living in underdeveloped areas of Pakistan, especially in the age of
      coronavirus pandemic, social distancing, and lockdown of communities. This project will be
      the first of its kind in aiming to provide women with a smartphone and digital access for a
      digital health literacy intervention through community healthcare workers. The majority of
      poor women in Pakistan who are dependent on primary health services: 1. suffer from health
      challenges more than men due to multiple social and structural disadvantages, 2. are the
      dominant care-providers and nurturers in the home, and 3. need support in understanding
      public health messages during health crises due to low health literacy and awareness. The
      digital health literacy intervention will be delivered in target two areas: (i) hygiene and
      sanitation, and (ii) coronavirus awareness and prevention. Women will be sampled from
      disadvantaged areas across the four provinces of Pakistan- Baluchistan, KPK, Punjab, and
      Sindh. A target of 1,000 women will comprise the sample with 500 women each assigned to the
      control and experiment group.
