      monofilament test and the static 2-point discrimination test. The test points were at the
      center of the radial or ulnar portion of the pulp. The donor site, i.e. radial- or
      ulnar-dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx of the donor digit, was also evaluated. Each area
      was tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). We stopped at 4mm as a limit
      of 2PD and considered this normal.
