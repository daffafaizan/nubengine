      gastric acid. The clinical significance of this phenomenon is however unclear. This study
      aims to examine whether or not healthy volunteers, who over a relatively short period of time
      treated with a PPI, develop dyspeptic symptoms after cessation of therapy. Dyspeptic symptoms
      will be measured subjectively using a validated questionnaire, which is filled out each day.
      Gastric acid will be measured indirectly with measurement of acid secretion markers (Gastrin
      and chromogranin-A).
