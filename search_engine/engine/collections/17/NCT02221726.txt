      "placebo" patch (an inactive patch that contains no active drug), JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G
      transdermal (through the skin) system. In this study, this patch is NOT being compared to a
      patch with a drug, and is NOT being used to test if the patch with the drug has a real effect
      in a clinical trial. The study consists 3 parts: Screening (21 days before study commences on
      Day 1), an adhesion assessment period (4 days), and an end of Study (EOS) assessment
      (recorded at 24 hours +/- 4 hours following patch removal). Total study duration per
      participant will be 26 days (including Screening). JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023 small (5.5 cm^2) and
      large (44 cm^2) patches will be applied on to left or right side of the paraspinal region
      based on randomization schedule. Adhesion assessments will be performed at patch application
      (hour 0, Baseline), and during the time interval of 8 to 10 hours, 24, 48, and 72 hours
      following patch application. Adhesion quality will be assessed by visual grading, United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scale, digital image analysis and visual grading
      grid system. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
