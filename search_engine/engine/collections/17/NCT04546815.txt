      infections, skin and soft tissue infections, infective endocarditis and other infectious
      diseases caused by MRSA, MRCNS, and VRE have greatly increased patient mortality and medical
      burden.

      Daptomycin has strong anti-bacterial activity and rapid sterilization. It is almost 100%
      sensitive to common Gram-positive bacteria. Both domestic and foreign guidelines recommend
      its use for the treatment of infectious diseases such as bacteremia, central venous
      catheter-related bloodstream infections, infective endocarditis, skin and soft tissue
      infections, bone and joint infectionsï¼Œand so on. However, there is a lack of actual clinical
      use of daptomycin in China, as well as efficacy and safety assessments based on real world
      data.

      The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze data on the use of daptomycin in the real
      world. The clinical cure rate and inefficiency, temperature drop time, 28-day mortality rate
      are the primary outcome measures, and the overall incidence of adverse events, the results of
      CPK monitoring and its correlation with dose, renal function, length of hospital stay, and
      treatment costs are secondary outcome measures to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      daptomycin in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infection.
