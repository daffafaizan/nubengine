      staging of rectal cancer. The decision to administer pre-operative chemotherapy/radiation
      therapy is often made based on the results of the TRUS. The greatest limitation of TRUS is
      its operator-dependence. Three-dimensional TRUS (3-D TRUS) is a new modality that provides
      all of the information of traditional TRUS as well as the ability to provide three
      dimensional views of the tumor. This provides greater detail regarding the configuration of
      the tumor as well as the ability to calculate tumor volume. The results of 3-D TRUS are
      interpreted after the study and thus, operator-dependence is reduced. There are no currently
      accepted techniques that allow for objective and accurate assessment of a rectal tumor's
      response to pre-operative treatment short of post-operative pathologic evaluation. Our
      objectives are to evaluate the ability of 3-D TRUS to quantify the tumor's response to
      pre-operative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy and to correlate these findings with
      post-operative pathologic examination of the specimen. These objectives can be accomplished
      with 2 ultrasounds, one before treatment and one before surgery. All patients with
      biopsy-proven (with pathology confirmed at MSKCC) rectal cancer are eligible for the study.
      The size, volume and depth of penetration and lymph node involvement will all be assessed
      during both ultrasound examinations. Our findings will then be compared to those found at
      post-operative pathologic examination. These data will then be analyzed to determine if 3-D
      TRUS was accurate in predicting the tumor's response to preoperative treatment.
