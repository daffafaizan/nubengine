      represents a marker for premature cardiovascular events.

      Despite the high prevalence of PAD and the strong association with cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality, patients with PAD are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their
      atherosclerotic risk factors than those who are being treated for coronary artery disease.

      Because PAD represents a peripheral manifestation of atherosclerosis, most traditional and
      novel cardiovascular risk factors are strongly associated with this condition. Smoking,
      diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity were
      identified as significant modifiable risk factors that should be targeted for secondary
      prevention.

      Atherosclerotic risk factor identification and modification plays an important role in
      reducing the number of adverse outcomes among patients with atherosclerosis. Risk reduction
      therapy decreases the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with PAD.
      Because of the efficacy of these techniques, several expert committees have recommended their
      use in patients with PAD. Despite clear guidelines, several studies have shown that patients
      with PAD are routinely undertreated for these risk factors, which may contribute to high
      rates of morbidity and mortality.

      Our trial will evaluate the impact of a 12-week, structured lifestyle and risk factor
      modification programme on medical and lifestyle risk factors modification, as well as on
      clinical vascular outcomes, among patients with peripheral arterial disease. We will compare
      these outcomes to that of standard healthcare traditionally provided to this high-risk
      patient group.
