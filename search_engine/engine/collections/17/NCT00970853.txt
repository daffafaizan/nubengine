      trial (RCT) of a mixed professional home visiting program to promote positive developmental
      outcomes among children in poverty. The earlier study found significant differences in both
      school participation and behavior among the intervention group at ages 33 and 60 months of
      age. Families from the original MOM Program RCT that provide informed consent will be
      eligible for the study when the children are 8 years of age.
