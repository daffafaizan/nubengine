      features an intuitive push-button interface, a short 30-second treatment time and an
      over-the-wire, balloon-based approach familiar to most cardiac and vascular specialists. The
      Vessix System has both CE Mark and TGA approval and is currently available for sale in
      Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and selected markets in Asia. The Vessix
      System is an investigational device and not available for sale in China. An current analysis
      of the REDUCE-HTN post market study affirms the device's safety profile and effective
      treatment for resistant hypertension.
