      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide following intermediate dose
      ARA-C (cytarabine) in relapsed/refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate immune reconstitution in patients in complete remission (CR) treated at the MTD.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of the regimen in the expanded group treated at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 6-26 and cytarabine intravenously (IV) over
      3 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
