      General anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg and sevoflurane.
      At the time of separation from parents, separation score was recorded. When the children have
      a separation score of three or four point, they received half dose of thiopental before going
      to the operation room. They randomly assigned to group S (sevoflurane alone) or group R
      (sevoflurane with remifentanil infusion at the rate of 0.1 ㎍/kg/min) or group A (sevoflurane
      with remifentanil infusion and intravenous injection of alfentanil 5 ㎍/kg 10 min before the
      end of surgery). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and sevoflurane concentration
      were checked every 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia. Time to extubation from
      discontinuation of sevoflurane inhalation was measured. Time to discharge from postanesthesia
      care unit (PACU) was assessed with postanesthetic Aldrete recovery score. Emergence agitation
      scoring system was used to evaluate the incidence and severity of EA.
