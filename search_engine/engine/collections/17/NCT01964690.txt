      as criticals, and if lactate> 4 mmol.l-1 as septic shock. However, results are usually slow
      to obtain, especially if we want to respect the Surving Sepsis Campaign, which preconize
      antibiotic as soon as possible (first hour).

      In admission room, arterial sample can't be easily done and usual results need more than 30
      minutes. On the contrary, using analyzers like "EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout*" can give
      results faster with capillary blood (15 seconds). We will compare this results with both
      veinous and arterial lactate.

        -  For primary outcome, we will determine the most accurate value of capillary or veinous
           lactate that may be able to detect critical patient suspected of infection.

        -  for secondary outcomes, we will determine if quick capillary lactate test may replace
           arterial lactate in this indication and be able to predict mortality.
