      cardiac function. Anesthetic management, of patients with cardiomyopathy with reduced
      systolic function, is challenging and may be associated with high mortality.

      Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of combined
      spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, underwent vascular
      surgery in the lower half of the body, in addition to assess the safety of this anesthetic
      technique in the early postoperative period.

      Method: After approval by local research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, and
      informed written consent obtained from all patients, 24 patients having dilated
      cardiomyopathy, subjected to vascular surgery in the lower half of the body under CSEA. The
      effects of CSEA on hemodynamics; IBP, HR and CVP (measured at base line and then every 10
      min), in addition to cardiac complications during the hospital stay period were studied.
