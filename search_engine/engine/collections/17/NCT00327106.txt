      decreases allogeneic red blood cell transfusion. In hip fracture surgery, an emergent
      procedure, transfusion is frequent. Transfusion increases adverse events such as
      postoperative bacterial infection and venous thrombosis. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the efficacy of tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, in hip fracture surgery
      on the reduction of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion. The trial will also evaluate if
      the reduction in transfusion will be associated with less postoperative infection and without
      an increase in the thrombotic risk.

      Patients with an isolated hip fracture of less than 48 hours will be randomized to either
      tranexamic acid 15mg/kg IV at skin incision and three hours later or saline.Patients will
      receive fondaparinux for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis.
