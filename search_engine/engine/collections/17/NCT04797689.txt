      use interventions and RCT for online delivery to address unhealthy eating behaviours and a
      negative relationship with food for women within the context of COVID-19. The second
      objective is to test if an online group body-oriented intervention (trauma-sensitive yoga)
      that has been designed to increase awareness of physical sensations, is superior to an online
      group verbal narrative intervention (mental wellness talking circle), and to control group.
      The investigators theorize that the body-oriented intervention may offer the opportunity to
      reprogram automatic physiologic hyperarousal in response to COVID-19 triggers and increase
      positive body awareness, and mindful attention to the ways in which habitual self-protective
      behaviours, like unhealthy eating behaviours, may be impacting health. The third objective is
      to examine the impacts of our interventions on adults with pre-existing mental health and
      disordered eating issues, and those with previous experiences that may make them more
      susceptible to these problems during COVID-19. We will track other supports they engage in
      during the study and the perceived impacts of these supports on their outcomes with the goal
      of shedding light on how to best match COVID-19 related services to adults who need them the
      most.
