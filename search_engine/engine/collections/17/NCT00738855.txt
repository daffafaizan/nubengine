      Background:

      Many published studies have shown that Gastrografin can be used for diagnosis post operative
      acute small bowel obstruction (ASBO) and assessing the need for surgical intervention
      .However,the studies have reported conflicting results hence the aim of our study to test
      this hypothesis.

      Patients and methods :

      Altogether 100 patients with 117 episodes of ASBO were randomized into control and
      gastrografin groups in a double blinded fashion. Eight episodes in eight patients were
      excluded due to protocol violation. In Gastrografin group,100 ml of the dye administered
      through a nasogastric tube and complete obstruction has been considered if the contrast
      failed to reach the colon on the 24-hour film. Patients were operated on only if they
      developed signs of strangulation or failed to improve within 48 hours.
