    
      The purpose of this project was to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of a peer
      support intervention in improving diabetes outcomes by conducting a group-randomized,
      controlled implementation trial of a volunteer peer support intervention.

      The study had three specific aims:

      Aim 1. In Phase I (months 0-8), to perform a qualitative needs assessment with peer advisors
      and health care providers to inform peer advisor roles and responsibilities (i.e., the
      intervention) and peer advisor recruitment strategies, curriculum and training; and patient
      recruitment plans.

      Aim 2. Also in Phase I, to pilot our collaboratively developed intervention and, based on
      pilot test results, to recruit and train peer advisors for the intervention, and begin
      patient recruitment.

      Aim 3. In Phase II (months 9-32), conduct the group randomized implementation trial and
      evaluate it using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM)
      framework.
