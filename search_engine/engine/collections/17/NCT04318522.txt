      and sham. Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) and high-definition
      transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) will be used to stimulate the prefrontal
      cortex of the brain. EEG and fMRI will be collected before, during and after stimulation to
      understand the impact of stimulation on brain dynamics. The investigators hypothesize that
      the stimulation of the prefrontal cortex will improve performance during cognitive tasks
      along with changes in the neural processing detected by neuroimaging modalities.
