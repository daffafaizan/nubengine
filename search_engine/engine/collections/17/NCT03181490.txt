      participants with pulmonary nodules 5-30mm in diameter.

      The assay analyzes the ctDNA methylation profiles of lung cancer-specific biomarkers
      non-invasively using whole blood specimens collected before invasive surgery.

      The performance characteristics(sensitivity and specificity) of the pre-surgery ctDNA
      methylation test for detection of early lung cancer is evaluated in comparison to
      post-surgery pathology.
