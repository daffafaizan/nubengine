      offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation.

      Several strategies are being evaluated, including anti-TNFÎ±, aimed to prevent early
      inflammatory events that limit islet engraftment. Among possible mechanisms CXCL8 could play
      a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction and might represent a relevant
      therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure.

      Preliminary data obtained in transplanted patients recruited in the ongoing pilot trial
      coupled with the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies provide a sound rationale for
      further development of reparixin in islet transplantation and prompted the conduct of this
      phase 3 clinical, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel assignment study aimed at
      assessing the efficacy and safety of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet
      transplantation in T1D subjects.

      At least 42 patients receiving pancreatic islet transplant were involved. Patients might
      receive up to 2 islet transplants, with the second transplant on average 6 months after the
      first one. Patients were randomly (2:1) assigned to receive either reparixin or placebo
      (control group). The Investigational Product was administered as an added on treatment to the
      immunosuppressant regimen.
