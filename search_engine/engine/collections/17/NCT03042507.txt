      acceptability data for a family-based behavioral intervention to reduce tic severity and the
      negative impact of TS-related symptoms in young children (ages 4-8) with chronic tics and
      Tourette syndrome. This intervention entails the use of targeted psychoeducation about tics
      and related conditions and a functional analytic protocol designed to identify and correct
      environmental influences thought to exacerbate and/or maintain child tic expression. Although
      similar to the family-based component used in our recently completed CBITS trial for older
      children, an independent body of literature supports the efficacy of functional analysis for
      ameliorating a variety of both behaviorally and biologically-driven behaviors. The
      investigators will work with an early child interventionist to adapt the current family-based
      protocol for younger children. The new manual will then be feasibility tested in anticipation
      of a larger externally-funded trial to further develop and evaluate the efficacy of this
      intervention.

      More specifically, the study aims are to:

        1. Adapt the current CBIT Manual for use with the families of 4-8 year old children with
           chronic tic disorder. Our revision will be informed by a meeting of the study PI's and
           Dr. Mary O'Connor, an early childhood interventionist at UCLA to review our current
           family-intervention and other treatment protocols targeting related psychopathology in
           young children.

        2. Document the feasibility, acceptability, and cross-site portability of the new manual in
           a small open trial of 15 youngsters (five each at UCLA, UWM, and Weill Cornell).
