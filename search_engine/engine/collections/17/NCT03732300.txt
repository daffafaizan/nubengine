      year around 800'000 people all over the world die due to suicide (WHO, 2017). Preceding
      suicide attempts and self-harming behaviour have been found to be the main risk factor for
      completed suicide. The "Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program" (ASSIP) has been
      designed to reduce further suicide attempts and suicide in patients after a suicide attempt.
      This study aims to replicate the findings of another study (Gysin-Maillart, Schwab, Soravia,
      Megert, & Michel, 2016) that show the efficacy of ASSIP. Further, it is intended to identify
      predictors for positive treatment outcome, i.e. a reduction of further suicide attempts in
      patients that had already committed a suicide attempt.

      Main objective:

      Assessment of efficacy of ASSIP by comparison of the number of patients that committed
      suicide attempts in the intervention (ASSIP) and the control group.

      Secondary objectives:

      â€¢ Identification of sociodemographic, clinical, electrophysiological and smartphone-based
      marker predicting the treatment outcome, rehospitalization rates and treatment costs
      Identification of predictors of treatment efficacy of ASSIP (by means of electroencephalogram
      parameters, electrocardiogram parameters, sensing app parameters, sociodemographic parameters
      and voice/video material parameters.

      Identification of electrophysiological representations of suicidality (patient group, control
      group, healthy controls).
