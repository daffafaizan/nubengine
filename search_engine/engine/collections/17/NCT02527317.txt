      development of pegylated form of G-CSF (pegfilgrastim and lipegfilgrastim), which offered the
      convenience of single subcutaneous injection, rather than multiple daily injections

      Lipegfilgrastim is a pegylated long-acting covalent conjugate of filgrastim (G-CSF). In a
      pivotal randomized phase III study in breast cancer lipegfilgrastim was shown to be
      non-inferior to pegfilgrastim.

      In this prospective observational study the incidence of treatment-related neutropenia
      following four cycles of dose dense (every 2 week) doxorubicin cyclophosphamide (AC) with
      lipegfilgrastim support is being investigated.

      Data will be collected on 40 consecutive patients treated with AC and lipegfilgrastim in
      Ireland.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of treatment-related
      neutropenia following four cycles of dose dense doxorubicin cyclophosphamide (AC) with
      lipegfilgrastim support (8 weeks).

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determine the incidence of febrile neutropenia during 4 cycles (8 weeks)of dose dense AC
           with lipegfilgrastim

        2. Examine the incidence of treatment-related neutropenia during subsequent intravenous
           cancer therapy up to 1 year.
