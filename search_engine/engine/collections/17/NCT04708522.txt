      deliver a breath control and guided mindfulness exercise to individuals experiencing
      post-concussion symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomized into one
      of the study arms after they have met eligibility criteria and have given informed consent.
      Study arm interventions include a 20-minute paced breathing (breath control) exercise, a
      20-minute guided mindfulness exercise, and a sham control arm that incorporates a minimal
      instruction 20-minute quiet sitting meditation exercise. The participant is asked to complete
      their assigned intervention daily for a period of eight weeks and to complete weekly and
      biweekly follow-up questionnaires. The questionnaires will include the Rivermead
      Post-Concussion Syndrome Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Positive Affect Negative Affect Survey
      Short Form (PANAS) completed weekly, the General Anxiety and Depression questionnaire (GAD-7)
      and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) completed biweekly. These questionnaires will be
      completed prior to a participant commencing the study (pre-test measure), at weekly intervals
      throughout the study (at end of week), and at the conclusion of the 8-week study (post-test
      measure). At the conclusion of the study participants will be asked to complete the Treatment
      Acceptability / Adherence Scale (TAAS), a measure used to assess the acceptability of the
      intervention from the point of view of the participant. All participant outcome measures, and
      intervention tracking questionnaires will be administered through a secure internet
      user-input interface.
