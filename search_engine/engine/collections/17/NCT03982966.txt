    
      2-All Participants agreed to take part in this clinical research and provide informed
      consent.

      3-Patients undergo both undergo hemodialysis (HD) will be enrolled from dialysis unit in al
      Moussa Hospital Alexandria.

      4-Serum samples will be collected for measuring the biomarkers. 5-Our design is randomized,
      controlled, open-intervention study. 6- All enrolled patients will be divided into 2 groups,
      Group 1 will be 40 patients that will take omega 3fatty acids and Group 2 will be 20 patients
      will not take omega 3 fatty acids.

      7-All patients will be followed up during 6 months' period. 8-Statsicial tests appropriate to
      the study design will be conducted to evaluate the significance of the results.

      9-Measuring outcome: the primary outcome is the increase of the serum levels of the vascular
      calcification biomarkers after 6months.

      10-Results, conclusions, discussion and recommendations will be given.
