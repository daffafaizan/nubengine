      the study is to determine whether the iota-carrageenan content in the saliva of subjects who
      sucked Coldamaris® lozenges is sufficient to inhibit the replication of 4 of the most common
      respiratory viruses causing common cold. At least 29 subjects will be screened, in order to
      get 24 subjects included.

      The primary objective is whether the mean iota-carrageenan concentration in saliva during
      sucking an iota-carrageenan containing lozenge reaches published IC90 values for HRV1a and
      HRV8.

      The secondary objectives are whether the mean iota-carrageenan concentration in saliva
      (µg/ml; base line corrected) during sucking an iota-carrageenan containing lozenge reaches
      the respective IC90/MIC values (paired t-tests) of the clinical saliva samples for HRV1a,
      HRV8, hCoV OC43, influenza virus H1N1n and Coxsackie virus A10.
