      we compared the perioperative hemodynamic parameters, recovery profiles and cost containment
      of sevoflurane and propofol based general anaesthesia for otorhinolaryngeal surgery. Patients
      were equally divided into four anaesthetic subgroups. In groups A and C anaesthesia was based
      on sevoflurane or propofol, respectively, without bispectral index (BIS) and train-of-for
      monitor (TOF) monitoring. In groups B and D anaesthesia was based on sevoflurane or propofol,
      respectively, with BIS and TOF monitoring. Drug consumption, recovery profiles and
      anaesthesia costs were analysed.

      ECG, main arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, oxygen saturation of peripheral haemoglobin
      (SpO2), pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide was monitored continuously and registered at 5
      min intervals during anaesthesia. Each group received propofol for anaesthesia induction. In
      group A and B anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, in groups C and D with propofol.
      In groups B and D the depth of anaesthesia (BIS® Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor, Covidien)
      and the neuromuscular blocking status (Infinity®, Trident® NMT SmartPod®, Dräger Medical)
      were monitored too. BIS and TOF values were recorded at 5 min intervals.
