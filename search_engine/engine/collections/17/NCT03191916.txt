      Alzheimer's disease) and affects approximately one million people in the United States. Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is very common even in early stages of PD. In addition to
      cognitive impairment, patients with PD also suffer cognitive fatigue (defined as the general
      sensation of difficulty in initiating cognitive activity) and cognitive fatigability (defined
      as "deterioration in the performance of attention tasks over an extended period of time").
      Cognitive impairment, cognitive fatigue, and cognitive fatigability affect quality of life in
      patient with Parkinson's disease.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive and safe brain stimulation
      technique that has been shown to be effective in improving cognitive function in subjects
      with Parkinson's disease. During tDCS, low-voltage, low amplitude current is passed through a
      pair of surface electrodes placed over the areas of brain of interest.

      The specific aim of this study is to examine if atDCS to LDLPFC at 2 milliamps (mA) for 20
      minutes daily for 5 days will improve cognitive function and reduce cognitive fatigue and
      fatigability in PD patients with MCI. The study will examine if the effects may last for two
      weeks.
