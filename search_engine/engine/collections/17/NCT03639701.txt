      which is the encoding system ( "recipe") for making the proteins that allow the mitochondria
      to function. Reduced amount of mitochondrial DNA, caused by genetic mutations in certain
      genes, Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome. This can result in symptoms; such as fatigue,
      weakness, and deficiencies in various body systems. TK2 deficiency is considered a
      mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Patients with TK2 deficiency have weakness and walking
      difficulty. They also have depleted levels of chemicals (phosphorylated deoxythymidine and
      deoxycytidine) used to make mitochondrial DNA. Based on previous studies with a similar
      compound, patients reported more energy and better motor skills.

      Eligible patients include those with genetic mutations in the TK2 gene who are willing to
      attend several outpatient visits, and have motor skills testing, neurological exam by doctor,
      and blood samples.
