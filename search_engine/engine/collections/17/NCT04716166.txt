      mouthpiece and corrugated tubing which is attached to a plastic bellows. The volume of air
      displaced is indicated on a scale located on the device enclosure. After the patient has
      achieved the maximum volume, the individual is instructed to hold this volume constant for 3
      to 5 seconds.

      Studies suggest a physiologically significant difference in the effect of the flow- and
      volume-oriented incentive spirometer. Flow-oriented devices enforce more work of breathing
      and increase muscular activity of the upper chest. Volume-oriented devices enforce less work
      of breathing and improve diaphragmatic activity.

      Research was carried out a study on two experimental groups of patients in order to evaluate
      the effects of aerobic exercise training and incentive spirometry in controlling pulmonary
      complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, results indicated a significant
      reduction in heart rate, Oxygen Saturation of hemoglobin (SaO2), and inspiratory capacity for
      both groups. The researchers concluded that aerobic exercise and incentive spirometry were
      beneficial in reducing the postoperative pulmonary complications after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.

      Another study observed the comparative study on the effect of preoperative and postoperative
      incentive spirometry on the pulmonary function of fifty patients who had undergone
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The authors concluded that pulmonary function is well-preserved
      with preoperative than postoperative incentive spirometry.

      Another study observed that the volume incentive spirometry resulted in early recovery of
      both pulmonary function and diaphragm movement in patients who undergone laparoscopic
      abdominal surgery.
