    
      Background: The lateral ligament complex of ankle joint consisting of the anterior
      talofibular ligament (ATFL), the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and the posterior
      talofibular ligament (PTFL), is often injured by an ankle sprain. Improper diagnosis and
      treatment of lateral ligament complex injury are not only prone to recurrent sprain, pain,
      swelling and other symptoms, but also can lead to chronic lateral ankle instability, and
      osteoarthritis, which could seriously affect the joint motor function.

      Method and objective: This study is a prospective diagnostic test. By comparing the
      sensitivity and specificity of stress X-ray, B-ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), and
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and analyzing the imaging manifestations and
      characteristics of different diagnostic methods of lateral chronic ankle instability, We aim
      to propose the criteria of the imaging diagnosis of lateral ankle ligament injury.
