      Cognitive Rehabilitation (Cognitive Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy for
      Parkinson's disease; CogSMART-PD) or 2) Supportive Care. Interventions are held within a
      group format consisting of approximately 5 individuals with PD. Groups will meet once per
      week for 1.5 hours over a 10-week period. Neuropsychological testing will be administered
      pre- and post-intervention as well as 6- and 12-months after the intervention.
