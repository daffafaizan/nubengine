      efficacious of systemic therapies, with aromatase inhibitors (AI's) being considered the most
      active anti-estrogen therapy in early stage breast cancer. But, use of these treatments has
      been shown to cause musculoskeletal (joint/muscle) side effects that sometimes cause patients
      to discontinue the use of them. Also, Vitamin D deficiency is a well know cause of a wide
      array of musculoskeletal issues. There is evidence that Vitamin D supplementation may help
      prevent arthralgia while on AI's. Therefore, the investigators want to see if giving a higher
      dose of Vitamin D could decrease the incidence of AIA as compared to a standard dose of
      Vitamin D. The investigators believe that this could possibly result in patients continued
      treatment with AI therapy for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
