    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mCi/kg (max 120 mCi) 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan) (anti-CD20) combined with fludarabine (fludarabine
      phosphate) (30 mg/m^2 x 3) and 2 gray (Gy) total body irradiation followed by human leukocyte
      antigens (HLA) matched allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for patients with relapsed or
      refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 24-48 hours prior to therapy infusion, patients receive rituximab intravenously
      (IV) over 4-6 hours and then receive a therapy-dose of high-dose yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
      tiuxetan IV over 30 minutes on day -14 prior to transplant. Patients also receive fludarabine
      phosphate IV on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI followed by allogeneic PBSCT on day 0. Patients
      also receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day
      180 (related donor) or -3 to 100 with taper over 11 weeks (unrelated donor) and mycophenolate
      mofetil PO BID on days 0-27 (related donor) or PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-40 with taper
      to day 96 (unrelated donor).

      After completion of study treatment and assessments through ~day 100 following transplant,
      patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually up to 2 years
      thereafter.
