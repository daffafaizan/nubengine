      Tumors of the kidney, bladder, prostate, testis, and adrenal represent a large part of the
      adult urologic practice, but are relatively infrequent in children.

      Genitourinary tumors contribute to pediatric solid tumors. Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and
      germ cell tumors are the most common malignant genitourinary tumors in children.

      The natural history and management of these tumors in the pediatric age is different from
      that of the adults. As result of the successful work of several clinical trial groups in
      recent decades, there has been a significant improvement in their cure rates.

      Patients & Methods:

      From January 2001 till December 2015, retrieval & analysis of the medical records of
      pediatric patients with genitourinary tumors will be made at the pediatric oncology
      department, South Egypt Cancer Institute which represents the largest referral center in
      Upper Egypt. These data will be categorized according to demographic characteristics,
      clinico-pathologic features, treatment modalities received, and outcomes of treatments in
      these patients.
