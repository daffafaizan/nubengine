      measure the amount of oxygen in the muscles of injured and non-injured legs and forearms in
      specific situations. The name of this technology is NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy). We
      have shown NIRS can be helpful in diagnosing ACS. We think two of the primary advantages of
      this device are that it is noninvasive (not painful) and it collects data continuously, so
      that if the disease develops, it can be detected early and treated appropriately. We have
      studied the capabilities of NIRS for many years. The last step in the process of proving NIRS
      and its use in ACS will be to test our recommendations and guidelines. The goal of this study
      is to test and prove our clinical guidelines we developed through previous work. This is an
      interventional study, which means the data we collect will be used to manage the patient and
      their care.
