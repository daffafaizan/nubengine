    
      Phase I: This is an open label Phase I to determine the RP2D of ABTL0812 in combination with
      FOLFIRINOX. All patients will receive ABTL0812 in combination with FOLFIRINOX.

      A dose de-escalation phase will be performed in which up to 3 different ABTL0812 dose levels
      will be tested in combination with FOLFIRINOX. ABTL0812 doses are: 1300 mg tid (starting
      dose), followed (if necessary) by 975 mg tid and 650 mg tid. Patient intra-escalation is not
      allowed.

      Phase II: This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II multicenter study
      to evaluate ABTL0812 in combination with FOLFIRINOX for first-line treatment of metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: arm A) receiving
      ABTL0812 in addition to FOLFIRINOX and arm B) receiving FOLFIRINOX plus placebo.

      Arm A) ABTL0812 + FOLFIRINOX Arm B) PLACEBO + FOLFIRINOX
