      is a failure if it does not take into account eating disorders. Among them, food addictions
      seem to be frequent among obese patients. Clinical diagnosis and therapeutic approaches
      depend on presence of these FA. Moreover, eating disorders are associated with visible brain
      abnormalities in fMRI but the cerebral fMRI phenotype of FA is not known.
