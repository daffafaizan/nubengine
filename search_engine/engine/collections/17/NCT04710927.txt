    
      This is a three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial and will be performed in
      participants between the age of 5 to 15 years presented with hypomineralised molar of MIH in
      origin.

      Clinical assessment, radiograph, and photographs will be taken for assessment. Patients that
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be invited to the study. After that, the patient will
      be explained and a Patient Information Sheet (PIS) will be given. Once consent obtained and
      the patient randomly allocated for the treatment group, treatment will be done as below:

      For group 1, any caries if present will be removed using a hand instrument. The tooth then
      will be filled with High Viscous Glass Ionomer Cement (HVGIC) following the manufacturer's
      instruction. If the participant is assigned to group 2, after caries has been removed using a
      hand instrument, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) will be applied for 1 minute on the affected
      area prior to restoration with HVGIC following the manufacturer's instruction. If the
      participant is assigned to group 3, papain-based gel (Papacarie Duo) will be applied as a
      deproteinizing agent, caries will be removed using a hand instrument if present. Then, silver
      diamine fluoride will be applied for 1 minute on the affected area prior to restoration with
      HVGIC following the manufacturer's instruction.

      The patient will be followed up after 6 and 12 months. The teeth and restoration will be
      assessed clinically and through radiographic evaluation by an assessor that is not involved
      in the provision of treatment. Sign and symptom of pain, tenderness to percussion, presence
      of swelling or fistula, the scale of sensitivity using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale
      (SCASS), quality if restorative assessment using ART Index
