      assessing the distribution of activated lymphocytes in SLE patients. Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), often defined as the prototypical autoimmune disease, is a chronic
      occasionally life threatening, multisystem disorder. Determining disease activity in SLE is
      essential for the selection of appropriate and effective therapeutic regimes. Lymphocyte
      activation is the hallmark of SLE and correlates well with disease activity. 2-deoxy-2 [F-18]
      fluoro-2-D-Glucose positron emission scanning (FDG-PET) is a physiologically based method of
      imaging that provides non-invasive information on uptake and metabolism of glucose in various
      tissues. Actively metabolizing cells will preferentially take up the radioactively labeled
      glucose analog and therefore demonstrate increased signal. Actively proliferating lymphocytes
      take up FDG at a higher rate than resting lymphocytes and are expected to accumulate in
      selected lymph nodes or spleen that are the anatomic sites of lymphocyte activation.
      Lymphocyte activation will be confirmed by FACS analysis of circulating lymphocytes.

      This study is designed as a single center pilot study with two groups of patients divided
      into active vs. non-active SLE and both groups will undergo FDG-PET scanning. The primary
      objective will be to evaluate the feasibility of FDG-PET in assessing distribution of
      activated lymphocytes in active and inactive SLE patients. The goal is to detect activated
      lymphocytes at their homing sites and correlate the pattern of distribution with clinical
      disease activity.
