      this study, this CT is replaced by a wholebody PET/CT scan. Afterwards, the patients goes to
      sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy and then to operation.

      By combining biomarkers and molecular imaging in patients with a clinically T1/T2N0M0 oral
      cancer, we want to characterize the tumor physiologically and correlate these physiological
      features to the clinical appearance of the cancer.

      Aims of the study:

        -  can PET/CT in this patient group metastases with consequently change of treatment?

        -  can fusion of SPECT/CT and PET/CT with calculation of standardized uptake value (SUV)
           indicate, how much tumor tissue there should be in a positive sentinel node to be
           detected by PET?

        -  can dual-time PET scanning better determine lymph node metastases, than single-time PET
           scanning?

        -  correlation between SUV in PET with molecular-biological findings both in the primary
           tumor and in metastases
