        1. A molecular diagnostic test that differentiates MS from other inflammatory and
           non-inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases (area under receiver-operator
           characteristic curve-AUROC of 0.98);

        2. A molecular test that differentiates relapsing-remitting MS from progressive MS variants
           (AUROC of 0.91); and

        3. A molecular test that predicts future rates of disability progression, concordance
           coefficient of 0.425 (p<0.001).

      Because these results are derived from a single research center (NIAID/NDS), it is imperative
      to determine their performance in real clinical practice settings as a necessary step for
      their potential regulatory approval.

      Consequently, this application has 2 specific aims:

      AIM 1. To independently validate afore-mentioned CSF-biomarker-based tests for their clinical
      value within the multicenter Spinal fluid Consortium for MS (SPINCOMS). In Aim 1, each of the
      3 defined tests will be validated in 100 new SPINCOMS patients. To validate the prognostic
      test, 100 MS patients with CSF collected at least 3 years ago will be evaluated at follow-up
      examination with standardized clinical outcomes. CSF will be analyzed blinded using
      pre-defined statistical models.

      AIM 2. To explore whether collected CSF-biomarkers point towards pathogenic heterogeneity
      that may predict patient-specific efficacy for different disease-modifying treatments (DMTs)
      or identify pathogenic mechanisms not targeted by current DMTs. In Aim 2, clustering analysis
      will assess pathogenic heterogeneity and explore potential predictors of response to therapy.
