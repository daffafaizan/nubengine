    
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing two approaches to post-TBI comprehensive day
      treatment. Executive Plus offers systematic treatment of post-TBI executive function
      deficits, through a focus on problem solving and emotional self-regulation, as well as
      systematic treatment of post-TBI attention deficits. It relies on modular, contextual, and
      embedded approaches to treatment. It will be compared to Mount Sinai's currently operating
      day treatment program. The 26-week programs will run concurrently and potential participants
      will be randomly assigned to Executive Plus or the standard program, using rolling
      admissions. Program staffs will be separate. Outcomes will be assessed using measures that
      focus on functioning within cognitive domains, across domains and in everyday life, and that
      assess long-term outcomes. Detailed manuals will be developed to guide the implementation of
      each program's operation.
