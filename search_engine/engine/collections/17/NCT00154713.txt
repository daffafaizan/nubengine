      CEA-pulsed DCs mixed with tetanus toxoid by subcutaneous injection. Low dose IL-2 will be
      given subcutaneously following DC vaccination to boost the growth of T cells. We will adapt
      "Simon's optimal two-stage design" for this study. In the first stage, we will treat 12
      patients to evaluate the safety of this new protocol. If there are no severe toxicities/side
      effects and there is at least one patient that had stable disease or better clinical
      response, then we will proceed to the second stage and treat additional 25 patients. We will
      follow the clinical outcome of these 37 patients. The immune responses against CEA before and
      after vaccination will be examined.
