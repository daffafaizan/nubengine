      for falling. In studies examining the relationship between postural instability and spinal
      curvatures, it was stated that the balance and functional performance of patients with
      increased kyphosis were affected. Increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis loss in
      geriatric individuals, degenerative spinal deformities are common and functional limitations
      lead to negative clinical consequences such as an increase in the risk of falls or fractures
      and impaired quality of life.

      Dubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has
      been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals.
      The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of
      four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and
      backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground,
      and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same
      time.

      In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional performance in
      elderly individuals.However, there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function
      Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of adult individuals in elderly
      individuals. For this reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of
      Dubousset Function Test in older adults.
