      with the primary goal of demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of MRT methods and the
      secondary goal of providing proof-of-concept data on the impact of the text messaging
      intervention components on the proposed risk factors (stress, negative mood, self-efficacy)
      and the proximal (coping, motivation, and daily drinking) and distal outcomes (reduction in
      risky drinking).
