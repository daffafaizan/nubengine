      sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The hemodynamic responses resulting from
      sympathetic nervous system stimulation are tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension,
      increased intraocular pressure, increased intracranial pressure, bronchospasm and myocardial
      ischemia. Tachycardia is one of the major predictor of intraoperative myocardial ischemia and
      causes an imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Although hemodynamic responses to
      laryngoscopy and intubation is transient, these effect may be harmful to patients suffering
      from myocardial and cerebrovascular diseases. The placement of double lumen endotracheal tube
      may produce similar or greater pressor response than endotracheal tube because of larger
      sizes and greater carinal stimulation.
