      baseline visit are to be assigned to one of the second-generation antidepressant drugs,
      including escitalopram, duloxetine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, etc based on
      investigators' clinical practice. Initial treatment consists of a 8-week course with one of
      these monotherapies. Patients who meet criteria for full remission are followed for a
      22-month follow-up phase to monitor for depression recurrence. Patients who do not remit are
      offered another 8 weeks of acute treatment, including combination therapy or switching to
      other antidepressant based on investigators' clinical practice. The clinical assessment
      (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HAMD)/ Clinical general impression (CGI) /the Positive and
      Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) /subtypes of depression, Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale
      (DARS) , etc), early life stress, neuropsychological test, and biological examination (MRI,
      genetics, neurochemistry, and immunology) were conducted to identify the biomarkers
      associated with diagnosis, treatment efficacy prediction of depression. Among the 400
      patients, about 100 patients receive MRI scans at baseline and after treatment.
