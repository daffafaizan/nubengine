        1. To determine the influence of IMST on resting blood pressure and baroreceptor
           sensitivity.

        2. To determine the effect of IMST on sympathetic nervous system by measuring plasma
           cathecholamines and nerve recording (MSNA).

      Population:

      30 subjects aged 30-75 years, who have previously been diagnosed with obstructive sleep
      apnea, as defined by the National Institutes of Health (National Heart Lung, and Blood
      Institute) will be included in this study.

      Study Protocol:

        -  Pre-training assessment and overnight sleep study

        -  5-10 minutes each day breathing training (IMST) at home using a hand-held device for 6
           weeks

        -  Once weekly laboratory visit

        -  Post-training assessment and overnight sleep study

      Pre- and post-training assessment include blood pressure measurement, body weight, neck
      circumference, cardiorespiratory monitoring, nerve recording, blood draw and sleep surveys.
