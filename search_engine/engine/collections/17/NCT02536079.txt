      and safety of NeuroAiD in clinical practice. An online NeST Registry was set up to allow easy
      entry and retrieval of essential information including demographics, medical conditions,
      clinical assessments of neurological, functional, and cognitive state, compliance,
      concomitant medications and side effects if any, among patients on NeuroAiD. Participation is
      voluntary. Data collected are similar to information obtained during standard care and are
      prospectively entered by the participating physicians at baseline (before initialization of
      NeuroAiD) and during subsequent visits. The follow up visits are timed with clinical
      appointments. Anonymized data will be extracted and collectively analyzed. Initial target
      sample size for the registry is 2000.
