      brain barrier and the ways in which a brain metastasis or radiation would impact the
      permeability of the blood brain barrier. This study would be one of the first to examine the
      concentrations of systemic cancer therapies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with matched
      serum samples. Additionally, the concentration of these therapies in brain metastasis
      surgical specimens would be of particular interest to correlate with serum and CSF levels,
      length of time on therapy, and latency to developing brain metastases in future studies.

      As participants in this study, patients scheduled for a lumbar puncture per their standard of
      care treatment will be subject to a withdrawal of 15cc's of cerebrospinal fluid for
      pharmacokinetic analysis. They will also have a blood draw of 5mL within 2 hours of the
      lumbar puncture for serum pharmacokinetics. If the patient is eligible for and elects to
      proceed with surgical resection of a brain metastasis, optional CSF and serum samples would
      be drawn at the time of resection.
