        -  Compare whether a complete mediastinal lymph node dissection versus mediastinal lymph
           node sampling improves overall survival of patients with N0 or non-hilar N1 non-small
           cell lung cancer undergoing resection.

        -  Compare these two methods with reference to identification of occult mediastinal lymph
           node involvement.

        -  Compare the effect of these two methods on operative time and duration of postoperative
           complications, including chest tube drainage and length of hospitalization for these
           patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these two methods on local recurrence free survival and local
           regional recurrence free survival of these patients.
