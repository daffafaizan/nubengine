    
      Trial design: Open label, randomized, 3-way cross-over, 3-treatments, 3-periods in 24 healthy
      male and female adult subjects.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To assess the relative bioavailability of 10 mg enalapril administered as orodispersible
           minitablets (ODMT) with water versus a standard enalapril tablet formulation (reference
           product: Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets) taken with water;

        2. To assess the relative bioavailability of 10 mg enalapril administered as orodispersible
           minitablets (ODMT) dispersed in the oral cavity versus a standard enalapril tablet
           formulation (reference product: Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets) taken with water.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To assess whether the PK of enalapril is affected when the orodispersible minitablet
           (ODMT) is entirely swallowed with water versus dispersion in the oral cavity.

        2. To assess the general safety and tolerability including local tolerability and
           palatability of enalapril administered as orodispersible minitablet (ODMT).
