      observation followed by 4 weeks of a randomized controlled trial of melatonin or matched
      placebo. The three randomized treatments were melatonin 0.5 mg 2.5-3 hours before bedtime,
      melatonin 0.5 mg upon morning awakening, or placebo capsules. Twelve of the women were
      admitted to the GCRC at baseline and at the end of randomized treatment for 24-hour sampling
      of blood for LH. Morning urine samples were collected twice weekly to measure LH excretion.
      Subjective responses measured throughout baseline and treatment included sleep and hot flash
      logs, the CESD and QIDS depression self-ratings, and the SAFTEE physical symptom inventory.
