      Canakinumab is a high-affinity human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-1β (IL-1β)antibody of
      the IgG1/k isotype), developed for the treatment of IL-1β driven inflammatory diseases.
      Canakinumab binds human IL-1β and functionally neutralizes the bioactivity of this
      pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1β is produced mainly by mononuclear phagocytes in response to
      injury and infection and plays a dominant role in the pathobiology of autoinflammatory
      syndromes (e.g. Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome, CAPS), systemic Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis and gout. Canakinumab is expected to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation
      and the underlying structural damage of disease. Canakinumab has been administered in
      clinical trials as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion or as a subcutaneous (sc) injection and has
      been approved under the trade name ILARIS® in the US for patients ≥ 4 years of age with CAPS
      and in the European Union and Switzerland for CAPS patients ≥ 4 years of age.
