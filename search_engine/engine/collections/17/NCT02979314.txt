      egocentric mental transformations. Corroboratory behavioral evidence showed interaction
      effects between vestibular stimulation and egocentric transformation. Yet, no study so far
      has investigated which cortical areas are involved in vestibular processing and/or illusory
      self-motion and mental transformation tasks within the same participants. This however seems
      crucial, as important individual differences exist for both mental transformation abilities
      as well as in subjective perception of artificial vestibular stimulation.

      The primary objective is to reveal which brain area(s) are involved in the interaction of
      illusory self-motion (as induced by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS)) and egocentric
      mental transformation, as compared to no illusory self-motion or object-based mental
      transformation. It is hypothesized that the GVS induced illusory self-motion dampens the
      ability to perform egocentric mental transformation more than object-based mental
      transformation.

      As previous behavioral studies on such an interaction were always done in a sitting position,
      a secondary objective is to first replicate previous behavioral mental rotation studies that
      used GVS, in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) -scanner comparable setting. Moreover, as no brain
      imaging study so far has investigated subjective illusory motion experience induced by GVS,
      illusory self-motion will be measured and included in the statistical model to find specific
      brain regions modulating the illusory self-motion perception.
