      Affective Disorder (SAD, winter depression). Although the exact cause of this condition is
      unknown, bright light has proven to be an effective therapeutic treatment for many people
      with SAD. The light sources that have been traditionally used for treatment of SAD produce
      white light with great variability in the balance of wavelengths that are emitted across the
      visible spectrum. Although several studies have attempted to test the effectiveness of
      different wavelengths for treatment of SAD, the devices used in those studies employed broad
      bandwidths of light. With the technological advancements in light emitting diodes (LEDs) the
      production of new light therapy equipment with much narrower bandwidths of light is possible.
      Side effects of exposure to traditional white light therapy for SAD have included hypomanic
      activation, irritability, headache, eyestrain and nausea. We hypothesize that when the
      wavelength of light therapy is optimized, it should be feasible to elicit strong therapeutic
      benefits with lower light intensities and fewer side effects. Previous studies, approved by
      the Jefferson IRB and successfully completed by our laboratory have shown that some colors of
      light are more effective in treating SAD than other colors.
