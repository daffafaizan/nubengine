      Primary

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with solid tumors who have persistent
           paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy who benefit, defined as a decrease of at least
           20% on their FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY/ GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY GROUP
           NEUROTOXICITY (FACT/GOG-Ntx) FACT-GOG-NTX score, from treatment with subcutaneous
           amifostine.

        -  Determine whether there is sufficient evidence of reversal activity of this drug in
           these patients to justify a phase III study.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the acute toxic effects of this drug administered subcutaneously in these
           patients vs IV administrations of this drug historically and/or during the GOG-0192
           study.

        -  Determine the capability of the Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test to provide objective,
           quantitative evidence for improvement in patients who have subjective improvement as
           self-reported on the FACT-GOG-NTX scale.

        -  Determine whether any benefit in patients treated with this drug is transient or lasts
           at least 8 weeks.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive amifostine subcutaneously three times weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of
      symptom progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial
      response receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy.

      Neuropathy symptoms are assessed using the FACT-GOG-NTX questionnaire administered at
      baseline, weekly during therapy, and at 12 weeks and the Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test
      administered at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-20
      months.
