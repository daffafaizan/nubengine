      requiring at least one crown on a posterior tooth. A maximum of two crowns per patient will
      be completed. All the crowns will be made from the same resilient ceramic CAD/CAM
      block(Tetric CAD/Ivoclar Vivadent). The crowns are placed using an adhesive bonding process
      including a total etch process with a universal adhesive (Adhese by Ivoclar Vivadent) and
      dual-cured resin cement (Variolink Esthetic by Ivoclar Vivadent). The crowns are planned to
      be evaluated at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and if funding permits, 4 years, and 5
      years. At each appointment, an examination of the crown will be completed as well as clinical
      photographs, an intraoral digital scan, and impression of the crown.
