      research on behavioral programs designed to increase exercise in adolescents. Psychosocial
      characteristics, such as self-efficacy for exercise, social support for exercise from family
      and peers, and perceived benefits of and barriers to exercise, may predispose adolescents
      toward the adoption and maintenance of physical activity. This study will implement a
      multifaceted behavioral program specifically designed to increase bone strengthening physical
      activity by addressing many of the psychosocial factors relating to exercise.

      Girls in this study will be enrolled in Project Fitness and Bone (FAB). The Project FAB
      intervention is delivered during a regular school class period 5 days per week for 10 months.
      One day per week is devoted to didactic presentations and/or discussion about reasons for
      being active, ways of overcoming barriers to being active, and strategies for maintaining an
      active lifestyle. The remaining four days are structured activity sessions, including a range
      of activities such as modified basketball, aerobic dance, and walking around a track. Primary
      outcome measures will include bone mass (measured via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer
      [DEXA]) and serum and urinary measures of bone formation and resorption. Participants will be
      contacted by telephone 12 months after their final clinic visit to ascertain their activity
      level at that time.
