      health workers and will be conducted in collaboration with CHASS, a community agency
      providing health care to underserved residents of Detroit with diabetes. The new
      intervention, Fit Families (FF), will be tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial in
      order to evaluate FF feasibility, finalize outcome measures, estimate intervention effect
      sizes on health outcomes (i.e., youth adherence, glycemic control, quality of life) and
      determine potential cost savings associated with reduced hospital admissions. These steps
      will allow for finalization of intervention content and other trial parameters in preparation
      for a larger R18 dissemination trial.

      The design for the proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial using a sample of 60
      adolescents. Half will be randomly assigned to the treatment intervention, Fit Families plus
      standard medical care, and the other half will be assigned to standard medical care alone.
      Families who are randomized to FF receive intensive, home-based family therapy delivered by a
      community health worker (CHW) for approximately six months.
