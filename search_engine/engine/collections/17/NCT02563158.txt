      (HCC) in Asia. Liver resection remains the mainstay of treatment for HCC. Hepatic inflow
      occlusion, known as the Pringle maneuver, is most commonly used to reduce blood loss during
      liver parenchymal transection. A major issue about this maneuver is the ischemia-reperfusion
      injury to the remnant liver. And the hemodynamic disturbance to the tumor-bearing liver
      remains an oncologic concern. Given the technical advances in living donor liver
      transplantation, vascular occlusion can be avoided in liver resection by experienced hands.
      This study aims to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of liver resection for
      HBV-related HCC without versus with hepatic inflow occlusion.

      This study will include eligible patients with HBV-related HCC elected for liver resection.
      57 patients will be enrolled in each randomized arm to detect a 20% difference in the serum
      level of total bilirubin on postoperative day 5 (80% power and Î± = 0.05). The secondary
      endpoints include procedural parameters, perioperative liver function and inflammatory
      response, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and long-term outcomes. Patients will be
      followed for up to five years. Data will be statistically analyzed on an intention-to-treat
      basis.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility of liver
      resections for HBV-related HCC without vascular occlusion. Clinical implication of its
      outcomes may change the present surgical practice and fill the oncologic gaps therein.
