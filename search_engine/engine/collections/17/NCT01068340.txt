    
      This is a retrospective review of all trauma patients admitted to the Los Angeles County -
      University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Medical Center from January 2006 to June 2009
      (3.5 years). The trauma registry will be utilized to identify patients >= 15 years old who
      underwent a laparotomy during the study period and survived > 72 hours. For patients meeting
      inclusion criteria, all imaging studies obtained within the hospital course will be reviewed
      to identify patients who developed early SBO. The rationale for utilizing imaging studies is
      that obtaining these studies for patients with high suspicion of SBO is standard practice to
      establish the diagnosis. The charts of these patients will subsequently be reviewed and data
      will be collected using a predefined data collecting form.
