      substudy of ongoing Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC) disease treatment studies. After
      enrollment is complete, specimens from cases of treatment failure and relapse will be
      evaluated in comparison to control samples to measure the prognostic value of the following
      tests: 1) quantitative rRNA in 2-month sputum to predict relapse, 2) MTB 85B mRNA to detect
      reactivation, 3) 1- to 4-month NAA and broth culture tests to predict relapse, 4) mRNA, rRNA
      and DNA at and after end of therapy to predict relapse, 5)sputum rRNA and blood DNA to detect
      recurrence during prodrome, 6) sputum rRNA compared to cultures to diagnose "paradoxical
      reactions," 7) compare blood DNA to cultures at end of induction and end of treatment, 8)
      compare accuracies of different NAA assays and standard cultures, 9) determine MTD rRNA assay
      positive to negative conversion time, 10) characterize quality and quantity of sputum over
      time in relation to culture and clinical outcome, 11) assess ability of clinical,
      radiographic, and microbiologic risk factors to predict treatment failure and relapse.
