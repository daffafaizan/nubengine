      affects breastfeeding among mothers at high risk for postpartum depression. We will recruit
      40 mothers of healthy singleton births in a U.S. hospital who are at high risk of postpartum
      depression and randomly assign them to receive a pacifier or not. We will ascertain pacifier
      use, maternal stress, and infant feeding behaviors with web-based surveys at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18,
      and 24 weeks. Mothers will also wear a wristband to detect maternal heart rate variability
      throughout the first 6 weeks as a marker of maternal stress.
