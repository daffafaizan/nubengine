      anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, it remains unclear whether
      these abnormalities can be used for the diagnosis of anxiety disorder„ÄÅOCD and prediction of
      treatment effects. It is also unclear whether there are shared imaging biomarkers between
      different subtypes of anxiety disorder and OCD.And it still lacks reliable neuroimaging
      biomarkers in anxiety disorder and OCD. Based on the previous studies, this study aims to
      examine the whole-brain anatomical and functional abnormalities in 30 general anxiety
      disorder (GAD),30 panic disorder(PD),30 social anxiety disorder,30 obsessive-compulsive
      disorder patients and 30 healthy controls by using a combination of cross-section and
      longitudinal study designs, including a longitudinal study in patients with anxiety disorder
      and OCD with 4 weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine
      treatment.First, neuroimaging biomarkers are definitively selected in subjects at different
      subtypes of anxiety disorder and OCD population for the purpose of diagnosis by using a
      cross-section design. After that, a longitudinal study is conducted in patients with anxiety
      disorder and OCD with 4 weeks of paroxetine treatment to validate that the selected
      neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to predict treatment response of medication. The
      definitively selected neuroimaging biomarkers are expected to be useful for the diagnosis of
      anxiety disorder and OCD, and prediction of treatment effects; and finally be helpful for
      understanding the pathophysiology of anxiety disorder and OCD.
