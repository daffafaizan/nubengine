      of either AZD8108 or placebo on Day 1. In Part 2 of the study (multiple ascending dose
      portion), approximately 24 subjects will be randomly assigned. Eight (8) subjects will be
      randomized in each of 3 dosage-level cohorts. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be
      randomized to receive AZD8108 and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Each
