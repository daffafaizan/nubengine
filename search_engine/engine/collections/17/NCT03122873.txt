      extension strength. The device was designed for point of treatment use, patient safety and
      portability. Strength will be measured in 5 paired trials, first with neck extended and then
      with neck flexed. Two protocols will be evaluated, one testing isometric strength against a
      fixed resistance and the second testing strength against dynamic resistance. McArdle's sign
      is the difference between strength with neck extension and strength with neck flexion.

      The data will be digitally registered and dynamic neck position will be recorded
      electronically in real time. Graphs of dynamic changes in torque versus neck position will be
      generated and superimposed. Strength will be quantitated using Matlab software.

      Consecutive patients with myelopathy of any cause with detectable finger extensor weakness
      will be studied, either due to MS or due to other cause of myelopathy (other inflammatory,
      vascular, compressive, neoplastic and other). Additionally, normal controls will be studied
      as will patients with finger extension weakness due to peripheral nerve lesions.
