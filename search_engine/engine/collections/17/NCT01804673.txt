      multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate safety and efficacy of the fentanyl-ITS for management of acute
      moderate to severe pain in post-operative participants' who have undergone elective surgery
      (surgery which could be postponed or not done at all without danger to the participant). The
      study will consists of 2 phases: screening phase (which comprises of pre-operative and
      post-operative stages) and an open label treatment phase. The participants will be treated
      with 40 microgram (mcg) of fentanyl transdermally per on-demand dose; each delivered over 10
      minutes for a maximum of 6 doses (240 mcg) per hour for 24 hours and a maximum of 80 doses
      (3.2 milligram [mg]). Each system will inactivate at 80 doses or 24 hour, whichever occurs
      first. A new system will be applied every 24 hours unless the participant has used 80 doses
      in less than 24 hours. Maximum treatment duration of 72 hours is allowed. Participants will
      be expected to require parenteral (administration by injection) opioids (morphine like
      medications) for at least 24 hours post-operatively. This study will evaluate participant's,
      nurse's and physician's assessment of fentanyl-ITS under routine conditions. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
