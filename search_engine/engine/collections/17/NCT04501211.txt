      presentation of gastroparesis is very heterogeneous but can generally categorized into
      emesis-predominant, regurgitation-predominant and dyspeptic-predominant gastroparesis.

      The underlying cause of nausea is very difficult to identify, and physician is often treat
      nausea symptomatically with anti-nausea and anti-emetic medications.4, 5 Phenothiazine's such
      as prochlorperazine (Compazine®), promethazine (Phenergan®), and trimethobenzamide (Tigan®)
      have significant side effects and the potential of withdraw symptoms when these medications
      are stopped. Serotonin (5- HT3) antagonists have central emetic effects and have been
      utilized in acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron, granisetron,
      palonosetron, and dolasetron are currently available as 5- HT3 antagonists for nausea and
      emesis. Oral dissolving and oral tablet formulation is suboptimal in outpatients with
      frequent emesis. Transdermal formulation may be optimal for patients with prolong nausea and
      vomiting, but data for chronic symptoms associated with gastroparesis is very limited.
