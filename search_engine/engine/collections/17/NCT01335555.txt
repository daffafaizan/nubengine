    
      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of chemotherapy on pre-operative fitness of patients prior
      to major cancer surgery.

      Design: Patients will act as their own case-control.

      Patients will be consented at the earliest available opportunity following the decision that
      they have surgically treatable disease and they consent to pre-operative NAC. Consent for the
      study will be gained as an outpatient. At "visit 1" patients will undergo CPET, as is our
      current standard practice, prior to commencing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As part of the
      assessment, they will have pulmonary function testing (static lung volumes, lung diffusing
      capacity),and a nutritional assessment using bioimpedance measurements. They will then
      undergo 3 cycles of NAC lasting a total of 6 weeks, as is standard current practice at our
      institution. At "visit 2", approximately four to six weeks following chemotherapy and just
      prior to planned surgery the CPET and other assessments will be repeated. This is also
      current standard practice at our institution.

      Data from visit 1 and visit 2 will be compared in a paired manner. A statistician will be
      consulted to assess the degree of normality of the data, the statistical tests to use, and
      for power calculations. At no point will any treatments be postponed or changed solely for
      the purposes of collecting data for the research. 12 months survival will be assessed as an
      outcome variable.
