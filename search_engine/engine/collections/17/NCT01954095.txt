      recurrent preterm birth while intravaginal progesterone has been shown to reduce the rate of
      preterm birth in women with short cervix. While these interventions have reduced the rate of
      preterm birth, the mechanisms of action of these medications are unknown. The objective of
      this study is to collect and analyze blood and cervicovaginal fluids from pregnant women
      receiving these medications or other interventions such as cerclage, pessary, NSAIDs, and
      combinations thereof. The goal of the analyses is to assess the impact of these interventions
      on the cervical proteome, cervical cytokines and cervical structure and to identify potential
      biomarkers of response and non-response thus providing insights into the mechanisms of action
      of these drugs.
