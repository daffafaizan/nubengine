      MMT patients undergoing antiviral treatment for hepatitis C. In the first phase of this
      project (Year 1), we will develop and pilot the intervention with 20 patients. In the second
      phase of the project (Years 2 and 3), we will conduct a preliminary, randomized trial with 60
      MMT patients to examine the efficacy of the CBT-D intervention relative to standard care
      condition (SC).

      We expect that, relative to the SC condition, participants randomized to the CBT-D condition
      will have decreased likelihood of depression-related antiviral treatment failure, will report
      lower levels of depressive symptoms, will complete more IFN injections, will have lower HCV
      RNA levels, and will have fewer illicit drug use days. If the efficacy of this intervention
      can be established in this trial and in subsequent clinical trials, MMT patients who elect to
      undergo antiviral therapy will have a valuable adjunct or alternative to the use of
      antidepressants to prevent depression. If found to be efficacious, this intervention will
      maximize the receipt of IFN treatment by MMT patients, thereby aiding in the prevention of
      liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death among those with HCV.
