      technology, the method used to obtain the most critical parameter in labor management -
      cervix dilatation, remains a vaginal (manual) examination. This vaginal examination, intended
      to estimate the dilatation of the cervix and the progress of the baby's head, is inaccurate,
      non-continuous and involves the risk of infection to both fetus and mother. It is also
      uncomfortable to the mother. The consequences of infections or delayed treatment may range
      from simple complications to irreversible damage. Early detection of abnormal patterns of
      labor progress could prevent complications and shorten the labor process and hospitalization,
      thereby saving both aggravation and cost.

      To truly manage the labor process, a labor management system is required. Such a system is
      expected to provide the obstetrical staff with the flow of accurate, continuous, real-time
      information, such as cervix dilatation.
