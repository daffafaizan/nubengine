      eating disorder) and first degree relatives (with no eating disorder) will be tested for
      emotional accuracy (seing faces on a screen with different core emotions), pain threshold
      (how long they can support a cold probe), body size (how they see themselves), appetite and
      cognitive flexibility (a test where the capacity to change rules during a game is done easily
      or not).

      Then all subjects will do a standardized physical exercise which represents an effort with
      the equivalent level of energy for each participants as being chosen according to each level
      of competency (assessed through the "maximal aerobic power").

      The third step consists in the repetition of (nearly) initial tests.
