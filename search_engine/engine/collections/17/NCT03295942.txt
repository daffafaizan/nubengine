    
      This is an open-label, Phase 1a dose escalation study of OMP-336B11 administered as a single
      agent to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic tumors. This study consists of a screening period, a
      treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed
      for survival for up to approximately 2 years. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a
      dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.
