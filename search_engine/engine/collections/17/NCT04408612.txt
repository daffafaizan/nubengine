      single-centre prospective study. In addition to routine clinical examination patients will be
      interviewed to determine the nature of shortness of breath, angina, presence of chronic heart
      failure or anxiety using the Medical Research Council Dyspnea scale, the visual analog scale
      of dyspnea, Borg scale, modified "dictionary" of dyspnea, G. Rose questionnaire, Seattle
      Angina Questionnaire, Framingham criteria for chronic heart failure and the SHOCK scale.
      During the subsequent in-depth examination including thyroid hormones, NT-proBNP, hsTroponin,
      ECG monitoring, six-minute walk test, stress-echo with a diastolic stress test, spirometry
      and coronary angiography (if necessary) main reason for dyspnea will be established.
      Possibilities of early (before in-depth examination) determination the reason for dyspnea in
      stable patients with coronary artery disease will be evaluated.
