      In the Dose-Escalation Stage, ascending dose cohorts will be treated in 2 periods until the
      maximum tolerated dose is identified. In Period 1, subjects will receive 2 doses of IGN002
      administered weekly. In Period 2, subjects will receive up to 24 additional doses of IGN002
      administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not progressed following the
      treatment period will be followed for another 6 months.

      In the Expansion Stage, subjects will receive up to 24 doses of IGN002 at the identified
      maximum tolerated dose administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not
      progressed following the treatment period will be followed for another 6 months.
