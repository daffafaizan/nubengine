      maternity units. Twenty-two maternity units in Greece will participate in the trial involving
      20,000 to 25,000 births, with two of the units entering the intervention period each month
      (stepped randomization). The maternity units will apply the interventions for a period of
      6-16 months, depending on the time they enter the intervention stage of the trial. There will
      also be an initial baseline phase of the trial, lasting from 3 to 13 months; this phase will
      include observation and data collection of routine obstetric practices. The interventions are
      based on educational, behavioral and organizational modifications and will include the
      implementation of the Hellenic Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (HSOG) guidelines on
      labor management and targeted training in cardiotocography (CTG), obstetric emergencies, and
      the classification of cesarean section through Robson criteria. During the trial period, the
      rates and indications for cesarean sections will be available to participating units on a
      live platform, using an anonymous reporting system. Participating obstetricians will be able
      to see their own and other units' performance and also get feedback on their rates. Î¤he final
      three-month phase of the trial will be devoted to completion of questionnaires by the
      participating obstetricians. The total estimated duration of the trial will be 22 months. The
      primary outcome assessed will be the change in cesarean section rate and the secondary
      outcomes will be maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The intervention and control
      periods will be compared using mixed effects logistic regression with adjustment for any
      underlying secular trends.
