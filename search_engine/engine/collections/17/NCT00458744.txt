      Primary

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of talotrexin in
           younger patients with recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or refractory leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the tolerability of the defined MTD of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis (solid tumor vs leukemia).

        -  Stratum 1 (recurrent solid tumor): Patients receive talotrexin IV over 10 minutes on
           days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of talotrexin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        -  Stratum 2 (recurrent or refractory leukemia): A cohort of 3-6 patients with leukemia
           receive treatment as in stratum 1 at the MTD determined in stratum 1. If 2 or 3 or 2 of
           6 patients experience a DLT at the solid tumor MTD, accrual is stopped.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
