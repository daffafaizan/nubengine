        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine and irinotecan in women with
           advanced breast cancer.

        -  Determine the degree of accumulation of cells in S-phase in tumor biopsies from patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other major or unusual toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen, including the active metabolite SN-38,
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen with the biological changes
           observed in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the relationship of tumor response with modulation of S-phase
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1.5 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 1-14 and 23-36. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and capecitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
