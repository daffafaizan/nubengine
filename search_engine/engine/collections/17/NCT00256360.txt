    
      Arm A:

      The three cycles of conventional FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel regimen will be
      given at the following doses:

      Fluorouracil 500 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion, Epirubicin 100 mg/m² by 30 minutes i.v.
      infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion followed by docetaxel 100
      mg/m2 i.v. infusion. All drugs will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day
      cycle without support of growth factors.

      Pegfilgrastim is only allowed in secondary prophylaxis: febrile neutropenia or prolonged
      grade IV neutropenia. In the event of febrile neutropenia or prolonged grade IV neutropenia,
      pegfilgrastim or filgrastim is given for treatment, and pegfilgrastim should be further
      administered on day 2 of each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy.

      The total duration of treatment is 18 weeks.

      Arm B:

      The three cycles of conventional docetaxel followed by three cycles of FEC regimen will be
      given at the following doses:

      Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 i.v. infusion followed by Fluorouracil 500 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or
      infusion, Epirubicin 100 mg/m² by 30 minutes i.v. infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² by
      i.v. bolus or infusion. All drugs will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day
      cycle without support of growth factors.

      Pegfilgrastim is only allowed in secondary prophylaxis: febrile neutropenia or prolonged
      grade IV neutropenia. In the event of febrile neutropenia or prolonged grade IV neutropenia,
      pegfilgrastim or filgrastim is given for treatment, and pegfilgrastim should be further
      administered on day 2 of each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy.

      The total duration of treatment is 18 weeks.

      Arm C:

      The four cycles of dose-dense FEC followed by four cycles dose-dense docetaxel regimen will
      be given at the following doses:

      Fluorouracil 375 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion, Epirubicin 75 mg/m² by 30 minutes i.v.
      infusion and Cyclophosphamide 375 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion followed by docetaxel 75
      mg/m2. FEC regimen will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 10-11-day cycle and
      docetaxel will be given on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle.

      Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) fixed dose of 6 mg (0.6 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution) as a single
      subcutaneous injection will be given in on Day 2 of each study cycle.

      The total duration of treatment is 14 weeks.

      Arm D:

      The four cycles of dose-dense docetaxel followed by four cycles dose-dense FEC regimen will
      be given at the following doses:

      Docetaxel 75 mg/m² followed Fluorouracil 375 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion, Epirubicin 75
      mg/m² by 30 minutes i.v. infusion and Cyclophosphamide 375 mg/m² by i.v. bolus or infusion.
      Docetaxel will be given on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle and FEC regimen will be administered
      intravenously on Day 1 of each 10-11-day cycle.

      Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) fixed dose of 6 mg (0.6 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution) as a single
