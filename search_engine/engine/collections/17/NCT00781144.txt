      research hypothesis is that both experience and gender will affect the amount of pressure
      exerted with diagnostic springing. The data will be valuable in characterizing practice
      parameters of novice and skilled osteopathic clinicians in palpation and will provide data on
      skill maturation from novice to experienced clinician. It will also allow far more precise
      teaching of these skills to students, who can use the transducers to determine how much
      pressure they are using compared to skilled clinicians. For measuring the palpatory forces, a
      thin film pressure transducer will be used in the hand of the clinician. Data will be
      collected on a portable computer via an analog to digital interface.
