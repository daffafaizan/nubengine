      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine.

      II. Determine the toxicity experienced by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are
      treated with sorafenib plus gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 months.
