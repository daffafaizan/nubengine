      peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a controversial topic although many patients find it provides
      gratifying relief of pain and numbness. Neural electrical monitoring has been used
      intra-operatively to diagnosis nerve abnormality, monitoring for ongoing normal nerve
      function and confirm nerve integrity for spine surgeries and thyroid surgeries with success.
      Presently there is not objective data to indicate the the use of neural electrical monitoring
      is reliable or effective. The goal of this study is to measure objectively and quantifiable
      clinical surgical outcomes of nerve decompression surgery in diabetic neuropathy patients.
      The study is designed to measure changes in nerve function, gait, balance and blood flow in
      the lower limb.
