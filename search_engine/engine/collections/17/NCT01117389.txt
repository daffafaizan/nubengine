      sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, the second most common
      cancer among women worldwide. HPV vaccine uptake is particularly important for females
      surviving childhood cancer, many of whom are at high risk for HPV complications due to the
      direct and indirect effects of cancer treatment. Thus, Version 3.0 of the Children's Oncology
      Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult
      Cancer has recently recommended HPV vaccination for all eligible females surviving childhood
      cancer. Because this vaccine was only FDA approved in 2006, little is known about the
      complexity of vaccination uptake among those surviving cancer, and how the factors
      influencing vaccination decision-making differ among families with and without a history of
      pediatric cancer.

      The purpose of this exploratory study is to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination and to
      assess predictors of HPV vaccination (and intent) among 9-26 year old females who have
      survived childhood cancer, while making comparisons to healthy acquaintance controls. In a
      cross-sectional design, those surviving childhood cancer (and acquaintance controls) will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire which queries sociodemographic, medical, and psychological
      variables which may relate to HPV vaccination or intent. Current vaccination rates will be
      examined and factors which associate with HPV vaccination (and intent) will be identified.
      Findings of the present study will inform recruitment strategies for future studies examining
      the immunogenicity, safety, tolerability, and behavioral outcomes of HPV vaccination among
      females surviving childhood cancer. More immediately, this work will further our
      understanding of familial decision-making regarding HPV vaccination among female survivors of
      childhood cancer and will determine whether vaccination recruitment models developed for
      healthy adolescents and young adults generalize to the pediatric cancer population.
