    
      This is an open-label proof-of-concept phase 2A study. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with
      primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with compensated liver function with an inadequate
      (suboptimal) response to ursodeoxycholic acid.

      In this study the inadequate (suboptimal) response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is defined
      as screening alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level > 1.67 ULN (the upper limit of normal) despite
      treatment with UDCA in stable dose for at least 6 months before signing the ICF.
