    
      Patients with MS between 0-5,5 score according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      and healthy individuals of similar age and sex to patients will be included in the study. The
      balance, mobility, upper extremity performance, cognitive function, fatigue, physical
      activity level, mood, sleep quality, quality of life will be evaluated once.

      We will use descriptive statistics and t-tests to compare demographic characteristics between
      groups and for the categorical variables chi-square. Effect of the group (MS patients or
      healthy controls), condition (Single task and dual-task conditions), and group Ã— condition
      interaction will be compared using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. We will examine the
      correlations between fatigue severity, physical activity level, mood, sleep quality, quality
      of life using Pearson bivariate correlations. The significance level is set at p<0,05.
