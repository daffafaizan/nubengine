    
      Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model and using a quasi-experimental
      cohort control research design, the primary aim of this study is to: Determine the
      feasibility of the biobehavioral self management approach (BSMA) program involving physical
      activity (PA) in patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML. The primary feasibility
      outcomes for this aim will be rates of recruitment, refusal, retention and attrition; in
      addition investigators will test methods and procedures of the prescribed BSMA PA program,
      including assessing adherence, participant acceptance and perceived benefit.
