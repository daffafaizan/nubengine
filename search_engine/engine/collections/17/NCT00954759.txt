      Primary: To investigate the effect of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic.

      Secondary: A) To investigate if infants with suspected musculoskeletal problems respond
      differently to the treatment than those without. B) To investigate whether health visitors
      and chiropractors can agree on the diagnosis of "suspected musculoskeletal problems".

      METHOD:

      A randomized controlled single blind multicenter clinical trial with a nested case-crossover
      study.

      Infants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for colic will be recruited by health visitors and
      randomized to chiropractic treatment or no treatment. The parents will be unaware of the
      child's allocation. All children will be taken to the chiropractors' treatment room while the
      parents stay in the reception areas. Before treatment, both the recruiting health visitors
      and the chiropractors will note, whether they suspect musculoskeletal involvement or not. All
      analyses will be adjusted for known confounders, which will be recorded by the health visitor
      at baseline.

      PERSPECTIVE FOR HEALTH CARE:

      First of all, the study will evaluate the effect of chiropractic treatment of infantile
      colic. Secondly, it will clarify if the treatment effect differ between children with
      suspected musculoskeletal problems and those without. If children with musculoskeletal
      problems respond better to chiropractic treatment than others, the study will also indicate
      whether the health nurse is able to identify these children.
