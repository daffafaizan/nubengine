      Procedural Pain) recommends pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods to effectively
      manage and prevent acute procedural pain in children. Nonpharmacological methods alone or in
      combination with pharmacological methods help reduce pain, and therefore, have become popular
      especially in recent years. For pain management, nonpharmacological methods are easy to use,
      and cost- and time-effective methods with no side effects. Studies have evaluated a large
      number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for procedural pain management
      in children. However, most of those interventions are not used by healthcare professionals
      because they are expensive, time-consuming or hard to use. Therefore, easy-to-use, practical,
      non-invasive, cost-effective, and reusable nonpharmacological methods, such as distraction
      cards, virtual reality and BuzzyÂ®, can be used especially in acute settings.
