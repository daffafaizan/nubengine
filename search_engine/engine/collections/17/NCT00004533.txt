    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, dose escalation, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to receive either adeno-associated virus-CFTR (AAV-CFTR) vector or
      placebo.

      Patients undergo tests on days -10 to -4 to rule out adenovirus and adeno-associated virus
      infections. Patients then receive AAV-CFTR vector intranasally to the right or left inferior
      turbinates and placebo to the other side of the nose. The next day, patients receive an
      endobronchial dose of AAV-CFTR vector to the superior segment of the right lower lobe.

      Cohorts of 2-4 patients each receive escalating doses of AAV-CFTR vector until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately
      preceding the dose at which at least 2 subjects develop dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at day 10, then at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
