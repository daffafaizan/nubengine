      contribute to improving the learning of electric wheelchair driving and access to electric
      wheelchair for people who can not currently claim for physical risks and weak psychology for
      the participant in the research.

      The present clinical investigation aims at evaluating the performances, the safety and the
      satisfaction of the users with regard to a simulator of driving of electric wheelchair in
      virtual reality.

      The main objective is to evaluate the feasibility of a virtual electric wheelchair driving
      training, comparing driving performance in virtual reality versus reality, in identical real
      and virtual standardized circuits, in regular users of electric wheelchairs with neurological
      disorders.
