      Pharmacology Laboratory at the Bauru School of Dentistry - University of SÃ£o Paulo (FOB-USP),
      which will be provided to patients daily doses of piroxicam 20 mg 4 days. Thus collect data
      related to pain, swelling, trismus, amount of rescue medication required by patients, overall
      assessment and satisfaction about taking medicine, saliva samples for the analysis of the
      pharmacokinetics of the drug, genotyping and phenotyping of the subjects of the research.

      The global clinical evaluation along with genotyping and phenotyping these individuals can
      show us if there is an influence not only in adverse effects, but also in the therapeutic
      effects of the drug in the Brazilian population. Research of this nature are rare in this
      area of Clinical Pharmacogenetics and can be of great help in prescribing these drugs to
      control pain and inflammation.After the removal of third molars will make collecting 6 mL of
      saliva in several post-surgical moments for analysis of the pharmacokinetics of the drug
      piroxicam and 10 mL of saliva for the analysis of genetic material. It is noteworthy that
      this project will initiate the nucleation of a new line of research in college, the first in
      Pharmacogenetics area conducted in FOB / USP.Will be assessed the following parameters in all
      patients after surgery of at least a third lower molar with a high degree of difficulty
      (Annexes 1, 2 and 3): 1) onset and duration of surgery after the administration of the local
      anesthetic, 2) open mouth prior to surgery, on the 2nd day after the surgery and on the 7th
      day after surgery (removal of stitches); 3) measured the facial edema in the second day after
      surgery and on the 7th day after surgery (compared to the measurements obtained before
      surgery); 4) body temperature before surgery, on the 2nd day after the operation and on the
      7th day after surgery (removal of stitches); 5) incidence, type and severity of adverse
      reactions, 6) plug pain (VAS - visual analog scale) filled by patients for 4 days after
      prescription Piroxicam; 7) amount of rescue medication required by patients.

      The comparative analysis of the data, along with data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug,
      genotyping and phenotyping the CYP2C9 gene, provide the basis for evaluation of the influence
      of the gene in clinical efficacy, side effects and need for relief medication required by
      patients after surgery third- molars with a high degree of difficulty, which was prescribed
      as anti-inflammatory piroxicam.
