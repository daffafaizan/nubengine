    
      Healthy infants will be enrolled and randomized to receive either 4 doses of MenACYW
      conjugate vaccine or 4 doses of the licensed control vaccine, MENVEOÂ®. All participants will
      receive routine vaccines as per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
      recommendations.

      All participants will be assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination), and after
      completing the infant schedule and the second year of life vaccination schedule.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study period, and includes solicited injection site
      and systemic reactions as well as unsolicited adverse events after each vaccine injection,
      and serious adverse events occurring throughout the trial.
