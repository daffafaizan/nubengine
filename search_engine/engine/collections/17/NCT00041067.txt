        -  Determine the 1-year survival of women with HER2-positive stage IV breast cancer treated
           with trastuzumab (Herceptin), docetaxel, and vinorelbine with filgrastim (G-CSF)
           support.

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in the
           subset of patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Obtain tissue blocks for the determination of predictors of response (e.g., beta-tubulin
           mutations) to microtubule interacting agents in this patient population and for other
           future studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days
      2-21, vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 8 and 15, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. If docetaxel and vinorelbine are discontinued due to
      unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue to receive trastuzumab. If trastuzumab is
      discontinued due to unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue to receive chemotherapy with
      G-CSF support.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-22.5
      months.
