      young adults (young people) living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV infection is
      globally most prevalent. Innovative, low cost, and easily scaled strategies are urgently
      needed to improve young people's engagement to HIV treatment and reduce the public health
      consequences associated with nonadherence including secondary transmission of HIV infection.
      Modern mobile health (mHealth) interventions improve adherence to care among young people but
      are currently not feasible for many low-resource areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This includes
      theory-driven applications that use gamification, where real-life adherence behaviors are
      combined with interesting story-lines in a mobile game to promote HIV treatment engagement.
      Whereas web and smartphone access can be limited, traditional cellphones and text messaging
      are near universal and have been used previously to promote adherence through simple
      reminders and linkage to staff support in sub-Saharan Africa. However, to date, no text
      message adherence intervention has been enhanced through the use of gamification. To increase
      access to this potentially powerful intervention approach, the current study will test a
      novel mHealth intervention that uses text messages to gamify adherence behavior among YPLH in
      Ghana. Piloting this intervention will provide information on its feasibility and signs of
      preliminary efficacy. The ultimate goal following is further evaluation and refinement will
      be to disseminate the intervention on a large scale across Ghana and other areas of
      sub-Saharan Africa.
