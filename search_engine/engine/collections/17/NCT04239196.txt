      the standard high-dose steroid treatment. Each patient will receive the reference treatment,
      i.e. one pulse of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone per day during 3 days, followed by
      1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone, and low dose aspirin. Depending on the randomization, each
      patient will receive the reference treatment only, or will received in addition to the
      reference treatment four subcutaneous injections of tocilizumab 162 mg over one month (1
      injection per week), the first tocilizumab injection being delivered on the same day than the
      first steroid IV pulse. Study visits will take place at 4, 8 and 13 weeks. The primary
      endpoint will be the ocular improvement at W8, defined as an increase of at least two lines
      of visual acuity on the ETRS chart. For each patient, the duration of participation will by
      of 3 months. The study duration is expected to be 15 months.
