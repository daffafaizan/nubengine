      VAL-1221 (at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) or positive control (rhGAA). Patients randomized to VAL-1221
      will receive 7 intravenous (IV) infusions of VAL-1221 (one infusion every other week) over 12
      weeks. Control patients will continue receiving their accustomed dose and regimen of
      MyozymeÂ®. Part 2 is an uncontrolled extension to evaluate long-term effects of VAL-1221 given
      by IV infusion once every other week at doses up to 40 mg/kg.
