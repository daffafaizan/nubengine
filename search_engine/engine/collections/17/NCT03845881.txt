    
      -  Aim 1 will be to compare the postoperative pain levels both in the hospital setting as
           well as daily for two weeks following discharge between patients in the opioid treatment
           group and those in the non-opioid treatment group. This will be performed with clinical
           exams while in the hospital and with phone surveys on discharge. Results will be
           recorded using the Visual Analog Scale for pain scores.

        -  Aim 2 will be to compare the overall morphine equivalents used during hospitalization
           between the opioid and non-opioid treatment groups. This will be calculated based on the
           amount of intravenous breakthrough narcotic pain medication used in the hospital setting
           (divided by the total number of post-surgery hospitalization hours to account for
           varying lengths of stay). Investigators will also measure the total number of opioid
           pills (these would be placebo pills for the non-opioid group) consumed during the first
           two weeks post-discharge, and the post-surgery day on which opioid pills were
           discontinued, and compare these outcomes between the opioid and non-opioid groups.

        -  Aim 3 will be to compare postoperative constipation, nausea, and vomiting between the
           two treatment groups. This will be assessed with daily clinical examinations while in
           the hospital and with daily phone surveys on discharge. Constipation will be recorded as
           presence or absence, while nausea and vomiting will be measured using the Postoperative
           Nausea and Vomiting Scale.

        -  Aim 4 will be to compare the length of post-surgery hospitalization between the two
           treatment groups.
