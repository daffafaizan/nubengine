      text-message-delivered, Social Cognitive Theory-based, culturally relevant intervention
      designed to promote physical activity among African American women. In an 8-week, 2-arm
      randomized trial, 30 African American women will be assigned to receive either: a)
      culturally-relevant, technology-based physical activity intervention delivered via Facebook
      and text messages, or b) a standard print-based physical activity promotion intervention
      consisting of high quality physical activity promotion brochures produced by the American
      Heart Association delivered via USPS mail.

      Aim 1: Test the feasibility of a culturally relevant, social media and text-message delivered
      physical promotion pilot intervention among adult African American women. The investigators
      hypothesize that the culturally relevant Facebook and text message delivered intervention
      will be feasible as measured by the acceptability, implementation, and practicality of the
      intervention program.

      Aim 2: Examine the impact of the culturally-relevant, Facebook and text message delivered
      intervention to increase physical activity and enhance associated Social Cognitive Theory
      constructs explicitly targeted by the intervention activities. Physical activity will be
      objectively measured by accelerometers and Social Cognitive Theory constructs of
      self-efficacy, social support, self-regulation, and outcome expectations will be assessed by
      validated self-report questionnaires. The investigators hypothesize that participants
      receiving the culturally-adapted, Social Cognitive Theory-based Facebook and text-message
      intervention will demonstrate higher physical activity levels and greater enhancements in
      Social Cognitive Theory constructs when compared to the standard print-based intervention
      group at the post-intervention assessment.

      Aim 3: Examine the preliminary effect of a culturally relevant, social media-delivered
      physical activity promotion intervention on anthropometric, blood pressure, and blood lipid
      outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that increased physical activity at the
      post-intervention follow-up will be associated with improvements in these variables.
