      pancreatic complications in patients undergoing elective pancreatic resection. II. Compare
      the postoperative complications occurring within 45 days after surgery unrelated to the
      pancreas, days of hospitalization and survival at 45 days after surgery, number of
      rehospitalizations, and number of postoperative blood units or packed red blood cells
      administered in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection on
      day 1 and receive vapreotide subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-7. Arm II: Patients undergo
      surgical resection and receive a placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at days 28 and
      45.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 580 patients (290 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
