      with cotton rolls. Caries status was assessed using DIAGNOdent pen (DIAGNOdent pen 2190,
      KaVo, Biberach, Germany) at the occlusal and proximal sites. Teeth having DIAGNOdent readings
      of 12 or less at the occlusal site and 7 or less at the proximal site were included in the
      study. Then, the teeth were divided into three groups. The first group (Grup A) of teeth were
      etched with phosphoric acid, the second group of teeth (Group L) were etched with Er:YAG
      laser and the third group of teeth (Group A+L) were etched with both Er:YAG laser and
      phosphoric acid. The patients were recalled for follow up examination at the 3rd, 6th and 9th
      months. The teeth were assessed using mouth mirror and explorer regarding new caries
      formation and retention of the fissure sealants. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS
      24.0 (SPSS 24.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
