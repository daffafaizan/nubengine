      (MBLM) is a holistic therapy for patients with mental disorders. Influenced by Ayurveda and
      Yoga, it uses mantra meditation, ethical conduct and healthy life style to promote physical,
      mental and spiritual health. MBLM explains processes within the body and the mind and their
      relation to diet, exercise, biorhythms, social and personal conduct in an easy but profound
      way and on an experiential level. Besides providing tools for physical, mental and emotional
      self-regulation, MBLM lays ground for personal growth and transcendence of the mind. It is
      intended to be implemented in groups of patients as well as individual daily training, and
      because of its modular structure can be adjusted in intensity, duration and weighting of the
      components according to the specific needs and disorders to be addressed. This makes it also
      eligible for its potential use in prevention of mental disease and treatment of psychic
      comorbidities in patients with chronic somatic illness.
