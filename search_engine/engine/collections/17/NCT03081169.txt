    
      This a randomized prospective study that compares the efficacy and complication rates of
      early (24 hours) versus late (72 hours) VTE prophylaxis administration to TBI patients.
      Patients who are identified as having an intracranial injury will be randomized to early
      versus late VTE prophylaxis using a 1:1 random numbers allocation. Patients in both treatment
      groups will be monitored for development of VTE, primarily with scheduled duplex ultrasound
      studies of the lower extremities. Any clinical suspicion of VTE will also be investigated
      with duplex ultrasound and/or CT angiogram of the chest. Patients will be monitored for
      development of complications from bleeding post commencement of VTE prophylaxis. Intracranial
      bleeding complications will be monitored by physical examination and CT scanning of the head
      when indicated. Patients who undergo craniotomy or craniectomy will have VTE prophylaxis
      started 72 hours post-surgery and will undergo CT scan of the head (to assure bleeding
      stabilization) prior to administration of VTE prophylaxis.
