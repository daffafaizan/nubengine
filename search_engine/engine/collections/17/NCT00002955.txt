      in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma. II. Evaluate the toxicities associated with
      this regimen in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas.

      OUTLINE: The treatment plan consists of an IV infusion of trimetrexate, followed 24 hours
      later by IV infusions of leucovorin and fluorouracil. After another 24 hours oral leucovorin
      will be given every 6 hours for 7 doses. A treatment cycle consists of the regimen repeated
      weekly for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Treatment cycles will be repeated until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 3 or more complete or partial responses are observed in the first 22
      patients, an additional 11 patients may be accrued for a maximum of 33.
