      referral diabetes retinopathy, referral age-related macular degeneration, referral possible
      glaucoma, pathological myopia, retinal vein occlusion, macular hole, macular epiretinal
      membrane, hypertensive retinopathy, myelinated fibers, retinitis pigmentosa and other retinal
      lesions from fundus photography. The effectiveness and accuracy of this algorithm was
      evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      area under curve, and F1 score.
