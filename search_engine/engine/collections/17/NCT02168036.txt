      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) as part of their diagnostic work up as recommended by the treating
      physician. The procedure will be performed as standard of care, either under general
      anesthesia in the operating room or in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation and
      analgesia. Bronchoscopy with EBUS-TBNA is normally an ambulatory procedure. During the
      procedure, biopsy needle will be passed through the tube and a small sample will be taken for
      both diagnostic and research purposes. Samples collected for diagnostic purposes will be sent
      to the Department of Pathology. Additional biopsy samples will be collected for research
      purposes. The subject is observed after the bronchoscopy, including vital signs and level of
      consciousness, until they are back to baseline. All subjects will be discharged with an
      escort as per Hospital policy. An overnight stay would be required for ambulatory individuals
      only if the individual is not, in the judgment of the treating attending physician, safe to
      be discharged as is standard practice.
