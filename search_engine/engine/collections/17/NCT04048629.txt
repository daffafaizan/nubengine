      will be included in the study with half offering VL testing at the first antenatal care visit
      using the centralized VL system (standard of care cluster) and the other half offering onsite
      POC VL (POC cluster). The primary end-point will be the proportion of enrolled pregnant women
      who are virally suppressed at the time of delivery. Positivity rate will be measured as a
      secondary outcome. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between study arms. As
      well, a baseline assessment in each facility will be included to enable a difference in
      difference analysis within clusters, in which viral suppression rates at delivery and other
      outcomes are compared before and after the intervention.

      The primary research question to be addressed by this study is: Does the availability of POC
      VL testing during ANC increase the proportion of women who are virally suppressed at the time
      of delivery?

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the impact of POC VL on ensuring viral suppression at
      the time of delivery (defined as a viral load < 1,000 cpm within 2 weeks of delivery) for
      pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) who are on ART in order to avert vertical
      transmission.

      In addition, this study will:

        -  document the at-birth and 4-6 week EID positivity rate

        -  document proportion of women who have undetectable VL at the time of delivery (defined
           as below the limit of detection (LOD) of the VL test)

        -  document the baseline coverage of VL monitoring during the first ANC visit for WLHIV on
           ART â‰¥ 6 months

        -  compare the timeliness of VL result receipt by clinics (HCW) and clients between
           facilities with POC VL and those using centralized testing

        -  calculate the cost-effectiveness of POC VL for increasing the proportion of women who
           are virally suppressed at delivery
