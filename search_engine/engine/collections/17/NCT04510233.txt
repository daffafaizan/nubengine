      potential therapeutic effects against COVID 19. It has been previously investigated as an
      antiviral agent. It showed 5000 fold reduction of SARS COV 2 viral RNA in-vitro studies.

      However, some researchers questioned its efficacy in the oral form as very high doses will be
      required to achieve a proper tissue concentration and viricidal effect in the respiratory
      system.

      Our hypothesis is that, since COVID-19 has shown to be particularly damaging to the
      respiratory system, using inhaled forms of Ivermectin will deliver the drug directly to the
      infection site and make it a treatment option.
