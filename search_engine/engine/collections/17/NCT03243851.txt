      placebo for the patients with recurrent or refractory Glioblastoma.

      The dosage of the Metformin will follow the domestically permitted dose to minimize side
      effects.

      The patients will be allocated randomly to arm 1(experimental) and arm 2(placebo controlled)
      and administered the investigational products for up to 6 cycle. Each cycle consists of 4
      weeks.

      After 6 cycle(24 weeks), the patients will be checked progression and survival every 24 weeks
      up to 96 weeks.
