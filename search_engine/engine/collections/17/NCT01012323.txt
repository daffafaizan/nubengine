      intravenous administration. It is supplied as a liquid formulation ready to use. The primary
      therapeutic use of immunoglobulins is to provide antibodies to prevent viral and bacterial
      diseases (replacement therapy). IVIG has proved to be useful in a variety of clinical
      conditions other than for replacement of immunoglobulins; IVIG exhibits an immunomodulatory
      effect. Children and adults with a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) have an increased
      risk of recurrent bacterial and viral infections that typically attack the respiratory tract
      (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract
      (gastroenteritis). Theses diseases can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity.
      Responses to antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most primary immune
      deficiencies are not curable, but IVIGs have been shown to decrease the total number of
      severe infections and the duration of hospitalization.
