      living kidney donation who have a titer of Donor Specific anti HLA Antibody (DSA) between
      1000 and 3000 MFI with a multicentre pilot study of 10 patients. The effect of bortezomib
      will be observed up to 6 month after bortezomib treatment prior to transplantation and 12
      month after transplantation if performed. The living kidney donation will be performed only
      if the DSA level drops below 1000 MFI which means an efficacy of the desensitization.
