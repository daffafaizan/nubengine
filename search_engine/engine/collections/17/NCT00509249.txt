      I. To determine the antitumor activity of aflibercept as assessed by the hematological
      response rate.

      II. To determine overall and progression-free survival in patients with myelodysplastic
      syndromes.

      III. To assess hematologic improvement and time to leukemic transformation. IV. To assess the
      toxicity profile of aflibercept in this patient population. V. To perform correlative studies
      to better understand the ability of aflibercept to reach and modulate its respective targets.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients will receive aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained periodically for pharmacokinetic and biomarker
      correlative studies. Pharmacokinetic analysis by ELISA; anti-aflibercept antibody
      measurements; analysis of VEGF and VEGFR expression; and analysis of gene expression by
      quantitative PCR will be conducted. The effect of aflibercept on apoptosis and proliferation
      of CD34+ cells will also be analyzed by flow cytometry based assays.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
