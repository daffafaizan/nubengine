      swelling, and warmth. The inflammation may cause progressive joint damage and destruction,
      resulting in deformity and loss of function. Both traditional and biologic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been prescribed for RA patients to control existing
      inflammatory symptoms and affect long-term prognosis. However, DMARD use is expensive, and
      the long-term safety of DMARDs is unknown. Lovastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (also
      known as a statin) used to lower levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in controlling
      inflammation in individuals with RA who have mildly active RA disease despite treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms (Experimental or Placebo).
      There will be four study visits over 12 weeks. At each visit, a physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, medication history, a pregnancy test (if applicable), and blood collection will
      occur. Additional safety blood testing will occur at Week 2. Tender and swollen joint counts
      and a Physician Global Assessment will occur at study entry and Week 12. Participants will
      also be asked to complete self-assessments at study entry and Week 12.
