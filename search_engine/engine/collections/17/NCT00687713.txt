      methamphetamine use in subjects with methamphetamine dependence who report using
      methamphetamine 29 or less days during the 30 days prior to signing consent. Secondary
      objectives included but were not limited to: assessing the success or failure to achieve
      abstinence (confirmed by at least two methamphetaminenegative urines and no
      methamphetamine-positive urines) each week during the last two weeks (Weeks 11 and 12) for
      subjects using methamphetamine 18 or less days during the 30 days prior to signing consent,
      assessing the safety of bupropion in this study population, assessing other measures of
      efficacy of bupropion in reducing methamphetamine use or craving, and other psychological
      assessments of methamphetamine dependence.

      It is hypothesized that bupropion, compared to placebo, would be associated with an increase
      in the proportion of subjects who achieved abstinence (confirmed by at least two
      methamphetamine-negative urines and no methamphetaminepositive urines) each week during the
      last two weeks (Weeks 11 and 12) for non-daily users.
