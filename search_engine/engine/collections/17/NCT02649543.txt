      and vacuum assisted closures in contaminated and dirty/infected laparotomy wounds.

      Social, demographic, surgical, postsurgical and medical variables were registered. A
      descriptive analysis expressed as total and percentages, medians and interquartile ranges.
      Comparison between groups was made using the Kruskal-Wallis, U-Mann Whitney or Chi-squared as
      appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
