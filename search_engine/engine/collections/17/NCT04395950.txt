      As its name suggests, it is not associated to heavy alcohol use. Non-Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition of liver inflammation and damage that is caused by the
      buildup of fat in the liver. It is usually associated with prediabetes, diabetes (high blood
      sugar in the blood), a high concentration of fat (triglycerides) in the blood, and obesity
      (increase in fat all over the body). The signs and symptoms of NASH are often not seen until
      the liver is damaged beyond repair, making NASH very difficult to diagnose (be picked up by
      your doctor) in its early stages where treatments might be able to reverse the damage. There
      are no treatments currently approved for people with NASH but several new medications are
      under study in people with NAFLD or NASH. This study uses a treatment being developed for
      treating NASH. The investigators will conduct a study to assess the effects of PF-05221304
      (PF'1304) on the way the liver handles fat. In early studies, this new drug has shown promise
      for lowering the level of fat in the liver. However, it also, unexpectedly, increases the
      level of fat in the blood, which could increase the risk of heart disease and inflammation of
      the pancreas
