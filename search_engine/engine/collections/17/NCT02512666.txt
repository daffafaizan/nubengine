      obtain WBC counts from images of small blood vessels called capillaries. These would be
      obtained by pressing a small device on the surface of participants' finger nails to look
      through the nail. These images will be obtained using a portable microscope called the
      Dino-Lite Digital Microscope.

      Having a non-invasive way to quickly measure WBC counts could be useful for a variety of
      healthcare applications.
