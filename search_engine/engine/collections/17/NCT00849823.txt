      Hispanic counterparts to be infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has termed AIDS a "health crisis" for African
      Americans and has called for a heightened national response to this glaring racial disparity.
      The crisis is especially dramatic in the Southern United States. Thus, the search for
      effective interventions tailored to this population is a national priority. This study
      expands upon a previous study conducted among young African American men. In the previous
      study we developed and tested the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, program designed to
      interactively promote safer sex for African American men (18 to 29 years of age) engaging in
      sex with women. Adjusted findings from the previous study provided relatively robust support
      for program efficacy, with men who received the intervention program being about two-thirds
      less likely, than controls, to acquire an STI during a 6-month period. This study expands on
      the work performed in the previous study by developing and testing a version for younger
      African American males (i.e., teen males).

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based and theory-guided,
      intervention designed to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years
      old) males presenting themselves for STI testing.
