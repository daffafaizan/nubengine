    
      A sample of children with an age range of 6-9 years, having a first permanent molar erupted
      with deep occlusal carious lesion, will be selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric
      Dentistry and Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University after
      securing necessary consents. All selected 108 first permanent molars will be randomly equally
      allocated into three groups according to capping material used. Group I (n=36) SDF/ KI and
      Group II (n=36) SDF and Group III (n=36) Glass ionomer cement. Indirect pulp capping
      treatment procedure will be performed with identical protocols except for the capping
      material to be used and its application will be according to manufacturer's instructions.
      Glass ionomer cement will be used as a base and resin-based composite restoration will be
      used in the three groups.
