      microbiota, which are a critical regulator of host metabolism and immune responses. gut
      microbiota interacts with host signaling pathways, leading to modulation of the endocrine
      system, immune responses. gut microbial metabolites, in particular, short-chain fatty acids,
      have been significantly associated with liability to diabetes. patients with positive fecal
      short-chain fatty acids will be given rifaximin
