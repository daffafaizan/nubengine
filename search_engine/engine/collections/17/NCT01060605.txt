    
      Pre-transplant rapamycin is administered for at least four weeks prior to the first islet
      infusion at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (target trough levels: 8-10 ng/mL). During the
      pre-transplant rapamycin treatment rapamycin trough levels, renal and liver function, white
      blood cells count, total lymphocytes and lymphocytes subpopulations, hemoglobin, fibrinogen,
      cross-linked fibrin degradation products, C-reactive protein, exogenous insulin requirement
      every week for the first month, and monthly thereafter are measured. Induction and
      maintenance immunosuppressive regimen after each islet infusion is administered according to
      the Edmonton protocol (daclizumab, rapamycin, target trough levels: 12-15 ng/mL during the
      first 3 months and 10-12 ng/mL thereafter and tacrolimus 2 mg/day,target trough levels: 4-6
      ng/mL). Islets are infused into the liver through the portal vein under local anesthesia
      Portography is performed before and after infusion. The islet function is evaluated measuring
      fasting C-pep, EIR, and HbA1c, immediately before the first islet infusion and subsequently
      every day for the first week, and then weekly for the first month ; every month after the
      last islet infusion for the first year and every 6 month thereafter.
