      localized prostate cancer who receive infusion with hyperpolarized pyruvate (13C) injection
      and undergo metabolic MR imaging with endorectal coil within 12 weeks of subsequent radical
      prostatectomy. At least 20 patients will be required to have high risk disease as defined by
      primary Gleason score of 4 or 5 on prior prostate biopsy.
