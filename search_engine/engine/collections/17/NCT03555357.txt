      procedures. Most notably, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) has been used in surgical settings to
      stimulate healing and promote tissue regeneration. In the field of cosmetic medicine, PRP has
      been used topically or as an injection to stimulate collagen production and enhance the
      efficacy of cosmetic procedures such as fat transfer, hair loss therapies, laser treatments,
      and microneedling. Harvested PRP has platelets, fibrin, and white blood cells, which
      contribute to wound healing, neocollagenesis, and elastogenesis. Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF)
      is the next generation of PRP and contains very high concentrations white blood cells, fibrin
      and a small amount of mesenchymal stem cells found circulating in our bloodstreams. Due to a
      lack of anticoagulant in the tube, PRF becomes a gel after 15-20 minutes of being isolated.
      These properties make PRF useful in reconstructive and aesthetic medicine but may also be
      beneficial for scar therapy in the same way PRP is currently used.The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of platelet rich plasma vs. platelet rich fibrin for scar therapy
      in abdominoplasty who are at least one-year post operation.
