      protein intake, muscle mass might be maintained. The current recommendation for protein
      intake for elderly is the same as for younger adults, but researchers and geriatricians
      appeal for a higher recommended protein intake to maintain health and function. One way to
      reach a higher intake is by providing protein-enriched foods. Because of concerns that these
      foods are more satiating, careful monitoring of protein intake after introducing these foods
      is warranted.

      Objective: To investigate whether a protein-enriched daily menu is acceptable and effective
      in increasing protein intake in elderly in a residential care home up to an intake of 1,2
      gram/ kg body weight per day.

      Study design: Dietary intake will be monitored before and after introducing a
      protein-enriched daily menu. The menu will be provided for 10 days to all residents of the
      care home. For residents who give consent, intake will be recorded by trained research
      assistants and nurses on 2 consecutive days before the pilot and on days 9 and 10 of the
      pilot. After the pilot residents will return to their regular menus.

      Study population: The study population consists of elderly men and women (aged 65 or older)
      living in a care home in Wageningen, the Netherlands.

      Intervention: A protein-enriched daily menu for 10 days.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Protein intake and resident satisfaction with the menu.
