      disability and pain and places a huge financial burden on healthcare worldwide. In recent
      work, the gene expression profile of bone marrow lesions (BML) in osteoarthritis has been
      evaluated. BML in OA have a novel gene expression profile which includes genes involved in
      inflammation, neurogenesis and matrix turnover. The plan is to investigate the functional
      significance of the genes found at the protein biomarker level in studies of joint tissue,
      blood and urine from participants with knee OA and compare these changes with participants
      who have other forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis.

      A study amendment was added in April 2020 due to Covid-19. We are studying up to 150
      additional participants with or without inflammatory conditions who are being treated with
      immunomodulatory drugs compared with participants who are not on immunomodulators. We will be
      evaluating the course of Covid-19 infection in people without autoimmune inflammatory
      conditions, compared with people who have autoimmune inflammatory diseases who are on
      immunomodulators.
