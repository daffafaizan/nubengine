    
      This study will evaluate up to 15 subjects in each age group for a period of 8-10 weeks
      performing neurocognitive tests before and after each intervention. The first study phase
      will be up to 2 weeks of a training period to allow participants to get acquainted with the
      use of the CGM if they are not familiar with the use of the device. This training period will
      be followed by a 4-week sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period using a study CGM and the
      subject's personal insulin pump. The subjects will return to clinic at the completion of the
      SAP period and will be trained on the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ and G6 CGM. At the
      completion of the system training session, subjects will begin 4-weeks of Closed-Loop Control
      (CLC). Questionnaires will be completed by the study subject at screening, after completion
      of SAP and after completion of CLC. Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and actigraphy
      data will be collected in the last 14 days of the SAP and CLC periods.

      A parent/guardian of the enrolled children will also be asked to participate in all
      trainings, complete parental Patient-Report Outcomes (PRO) Questionnaires, and collect sleep
      patterns while wearing the actigraph watch.
