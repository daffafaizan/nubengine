    
      This is a multi-center triple blinded randomized clinical trial in which we'll compare two
      techniques for the treatment of simple low transsphincteric perianal fistulas. 40 patients
      will undergo a fistulotomy with marsupialization and 40 patients will undergo a fistulotomy
      with open wound. There will be an inclussion visit in which personal information will be
      recorded and the consent will be signed. Randomization will be done after inclusion,
      following a balanced blocks model. Information of the surgery technic won't be available for
      the investigator. The patients will have a journal in which they'll write their postoperative
      symptoms. Follow up will be done at weeks 2, 4 and 6 by the main investigator of each center.
      Data will be based in clinical examination, patient's diary and medical records. Statistical
      analysis of the primary outcome will be based in a superiority analysis using the Mantel-Cox
      test, or in case needed, a multivariate Cox regression analysis. The secondary outcomes will
      be analyzed by comparing times, percentages, mean or median with parametric or non parametric
      tests as it corresponds.
