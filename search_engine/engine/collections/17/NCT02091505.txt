      after intravitreal injection of Lucentis (Ranibizumab) in eyes with macular edema associated
      with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) using various comprehensive clinical tests
      including visual filed, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), ultra
      wide-field fluorescein angiography, new flicker electroretinogram (ERG) using skin
      electrodes. Corrected visual acuity, visual filed, spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography (SD-OCT), ultra wide-field fluorescein angiography, and new flicker
      electroretinogram (ERG) using skin electrodes are performed before and 3, 6, 9, 12 months
      after the treatment. Predictive factors of treatment outcome are statistically analyzed.
