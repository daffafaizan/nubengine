      trial of adult patients with community acquired sepsis recruited from the Emergency
      Department and Medical and Surgical Assessment Units across ~10 UK NHS Hospitals. The
      treatment phase will be the first 6 hours following randomisation. 30-day and 90-day follow
      up will be conducted using routine data only. The exception to this will be the first 50
      patients enrolled in the study, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be measured using
      the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 7 days and at 180 days. At baseline, the participant or their
      relative will be asked to recall the quality of life 4 weeks prior to the index hospital
      admission. Questionnaires will be administered by direct patient completion or, postal or
      email survey with telephone follow up for non-responders after two mailings two weeks apart.
