      intervention group, when the anaesthesiologist considers the depth of anaesthesia to be
      sufficient, a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), will be placed into
      the patients mouth. The best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade
      positioned normally in the vallecula anterior to the epiglottis. The epiglottis will be
      elevated from the vocal cords indirectly, identical with direct laryngoscopy. After this, the
      best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade positioned
      alternatively in the vallecula posterior to the epiglottis, such that the epiglottis is
      downfolded and elevated directly from the vocal cords. Views will be scored in both positions
      using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. When correct laryngoscope positioning
      can't be achieved with a size 3 blade, a size 4 blade will be used.

      For patients not randomized to the intervention group, anaesthesia will also be induced in
      the conventional matter. When the anaesthesiologist considers the depth of anaesthesia to be
      sufficient, a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), will be placed into
      the patients mouth. The best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade
      positioned normally in the vallecula anterior to the epiglottis. The epiglottis will be
      elevated from the vocal cords indirectly, identical with direct laryngoscopy. The view will
      be scored in this position using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. After this,
      the patient will be intubated.

      Patients will be interviewed 2 and 24 hours postoperatively about sore throat, dysphonia,
      dysphagia and coughing.
