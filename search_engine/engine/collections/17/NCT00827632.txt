      failure rates of about 7% per year. This gap may be due to incorrect use or to decreased oral
      contraceptive (OC) effectiveness in population subgroups. Recent reports suggest greater OC
      failure among heavier women, particularly those using the lowest doses. The prevalence of
      obesity in the US population has recently increased to about 23% in women aged 20-29, peak
      years for OC use. OC physiology and effectiveness have not been evaluated in obese women.
