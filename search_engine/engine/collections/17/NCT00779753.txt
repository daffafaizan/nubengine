      neonates as this amino acid is the limiting amino acid in the diet of neonates. Feeding
      lysine at requirement improves the likelihood that other amino acids will be utilized
      appropriately for building proteins. In addition, lysine plays a major role in calcium
      absorption, development of muscle proteins and in the production of hormones, enzymes and
      antibodies. We believe that the lysine requirement will be 158 mg/kg/day which is
      significantly lower than the current 267 and 327 mg/kg/d that is found in the current
      Trophamine and Primene parenteral solutions.
