    
      Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF) is a sub-category of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
      (IIPs). IIPs are progressive lung conditions, with limited treatment options and unknown
      etiology. Though the IIPs have been associated with both genetic risk factors and
      environmental exposures, the molecular mechanism underlying disease progression remain poorly
      understood. This investigation seeks to identify a group of genetic loci that play a role in
      the development of familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) or FPF, where 2 or more cases of IIP
      are seen within a family.
