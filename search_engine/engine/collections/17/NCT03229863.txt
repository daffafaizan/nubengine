      infants changes in response to ingesting solid foods; 2) how infant cognition develops in
      response to ingesting solid foods; and 3) the relationship between infant gut bacteria and
      infant cognition during the first year of life.

      This study is designed to determine how specific complex carbohydrates in commonly used first
      foods encourage the growth of different bacteria in the infant gut. The two foods used in
      this study are commercially-available sweet potato (Plum Organics) and pear (Earth's Best).
      These two foods have been chosen because they differ substantially from each other in their
      carbohydrate composition. For example, sweet potato is mostly made up of starch which is
      digestible and pear is made up of other types of sugars found in fruits and vegetables that
      are not digestible and may have "prebiotic" effects (food for good bacteria in the gut).
      Thus, the use of these two foods could provide a good contrast for comparing how gut bacteria
      respond to different carbohydrate compositions during complementary feeding.
