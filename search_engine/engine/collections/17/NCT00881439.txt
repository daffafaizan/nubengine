      trial, enrolling 100 patients (67 vs. 33) with stable CHF. Patients will be randomized to
      Aliskiren 300 mg once daily or corresponding Placebo for a period of 6 months. Efficacy
      measures will be performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Primary efficacy outcome
      is change in renal blood flow as measured by 131I-Hippuran clearance. Secondary outcome
      include change in renal function, neurohormones, left ventricular function and blood
      pressure. Safety assessments include renal function, changes in electrolytes, and blood
      pressure. Patients will be uptitrated to maximum tolerated doses of Aliskiren, and safety
      visits are planned 1 week after initiation and on a 2 month interval afterwards. A total of 8
      visits are planned during the entire study period.
