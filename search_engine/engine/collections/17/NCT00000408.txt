      allows subjects to talk with each other and with health professionals via an Internet
      discussion group. The intervention consists of a book and a videotape and is based on
      interaction with other participants in the program and health professionals through a closed
      password protected moderated Internet discussion group. Outcome measures include health
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care use,
      such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Patients will be
      randomized either to the treatment group and followed for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with the
      intervention.
