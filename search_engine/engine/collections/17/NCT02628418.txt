      stroke and requires an intensive approach.

      Regarding upper limb rehabilitation, several research groups have developed robotic devices
      to provide passive and/or active movements. Their use appears to reduce the motor deficit of
      the arm and affected hand and to improve hand function both at the wrist and fingers. Hence,
      the evidence supporting specific robot-assisted rehabilitation of the hand is very promising
      even if further study is required.In particular, evidence is limited about the benefit of
      passive exercises and mobilization of the hemiplegic upper limb following stroke, and further
      research is called for.

      In this study the investigators used Gloreha, a new hand rehabilitation glove that provides
      computer-controlled, repetitive and passive mobilization of the fingers, with multi-sensory
      feedback. The purpose of the study was to evaluate in the rehabilitation of patients with
      ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the sub-acute phase: 1) the feasibility of this new
      neuromotor rehabilitation device 2) its efficacy in improving arm function abilities, and 3)
      the costs involved.

      Post-stroke patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation between May 2013 and January 2014
      were screened for enrollment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned, following a simple
      randomization procedure (computerized random numbers) conducted independently of the study
      investigators, to Treatment group or Control group, on a 1:1 ratio.
