      feature allows acclimatization to the targeted positive airway pressure setting. Using the
      Acclimate feature, the pressure increases incrementally over a period of time. The feature
      can be only be used for a set period of time, afterwards which the device initiates the
      therapeutic session at the prescribed pressure.
