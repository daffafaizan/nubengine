      GI bleeding can arise from peptic ulcers, malignancy, angiodysplasia or during endoscopic
      resection procedures such as endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal
      dissection. This is conventionally treated using heat therapy or clips. These methods carry a
      risk of thermal injury or perforation. Purastat® is a novel synthetic haemostatic agent
      licensed as a CE marked device for use in GI bleeding. It also has the potential to enhance
      endoscopic mucosal wound healing and may play a role in preventing delayed bleeding. However,
      clinical data on its effectiveness in the GI tract is limited. Prospective data collection on
      the range of indications for Purastat® use and outcome data related to clinical
      effectiveness, safety and feasibility is required to inform clinicians about the best use for
      this agent.

      Research question / hypothesis

      To establish a prospective registry study to collect outcome data related to the use of
      Purastat® for the clinical management of GI bleeding or prevention of bleeding

      Study Design

      Prospective multicentre cohort study

      Study Participants

      Adults with GI bleeding or a high risk of bleeding during endoscopic procedures where
      Purastat® has been used

      Follow-up duration

      All patients will be followed up as per standard clinical care where applicable

      Planned Study Period

      2 years

      Primary Objective

      To assess the effectiveness of Purastat® as a haemostatic agent when used in the treatment of
      GI bleeding

      Secondary Objectives

      To assess the incidence of delayed bleeding after use of Purastat®, defined as procedure
      related bleeding up to 28 days following endoscopic resection To evaluate the rate of
      rebleeding following primary application of Purastat® for haemostasis To assess the technical
      feasibility and ease of use of Purastat® when used in the treatment or prevention of GI
      bleeding To monitor any unexpected reactions that may be attributed to the use of Purastat®
      To describe utilisation patterns in different clinical centres (indication, patient
      characteristics etc) and to observe trends in utilisation over time
