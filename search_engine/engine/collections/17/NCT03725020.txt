      groups. The intervention will start at onset of the fixed appliances and will be finalized
      one year after debonding. The primary outcome will be incidence of white spot lesions on the
      labial surfaces of the maxillary incisors, canines and premolars, as assessed from
      high-resolution digital photos. The secondary outcome is the prevalence of WSLs at debonding.

      During the course of the orthodontic treatment, the patients are regularly checked every 6th
      week. At the end of each such occasion, the clinical staff will apply either the test or the
      placebo varnish with a small brush in a thin layer around the base of the braces on the
      maxillary teeth.

      The pre- and post-treatment photos are projected on a screen (Hewlett Packard ProBook 6650b,
      Palo Alto CA, USA) in a dark room and the incidence and severity of enamel demineralization
      will be registered independently by two experienced and calibrated orthodontists according to
      the index of Gorelick et al. (1982).
