    
      This is a Phase 0, multiple-center observational study of biomarkers and clinical parameters
      in patients with lupus, including discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), subacute cutaneous LE
      (SCLE) and active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is no study-related therapeutic
      intervention and this protocol will not restrict or introduce any medical interventions
      including medications. Study participants will undergo procedures that include collection of
      urine, blood samples, and skin biopsy. At least 30 participants (≥10 DLE, ≥10 SCLE, and ≥10
      SLE) will be enrolled in this study. All participants will continue to be managed by their
      personal physicians per their standard of care. The data obtained in this study will help in
      the evaluation of new therapeutics for lupus and may facilitate lupus drug discovery. A blood
      sample for genomic analysis will be collected for research purposes from patients who provide
      consent and where local regulations permit. There will be a single sample collection time
      point for each patient. The safety assessments will include laboratory measurements (serum
      chemistry and hematology), monitoring of adverse events (AEs) related to study procedures,
      and physical examination.
