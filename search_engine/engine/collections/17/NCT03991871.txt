      perfusion, endothelial function, angiogenesis and artery genesis of the coronary blood vessel
      to refractory angina pectoris patients Refractory angina pectoris patients in Harapan Kita
      hospitals who do not respond to drugs adequately will be divided by 2 groups, control &
      treatment. Inclusion criteria include age 21 - 80 years, Refractory angina CCS III-IV whom
      are not candidate for Re-revascularization with proven data of: have stenosis on left main
      more than 50%, stenosis on main coronary right artery more than 70% or stenosis more than 70%
      on others vessels, conducted in coronary surgery conference with conservative decision
      (optimal medications).

      Exclusion criteria include aorta aneurysm, abdominal aneurysm, acute coronary syndrome, acute
      heart failure, heavy aortic regurgitation, malignant arrhythmia, blood pressure above
      180/100mmHg, acute limb ischemia, DVT, active thrombophlebitis, and pregnancy.

      the investigator conducts a double-blind randomized control trial. The participants will get
      35 hours ECP treatment, initial treatment pressure is 300 mmHg. whilst control groups will
      get 75mmHg. At the end of treatment, the investigator compare the hemodynamic effect on
      coronary perfusion, endothelial function, angiogenesis, and coronary blood vessel
      arteriogenesis. Quality of Life Improvement based on WHO-5 between groups
