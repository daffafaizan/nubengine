      in the province. These infants are at significant risk for complications but no guidelines or
      follow-up programmes exist for decreasing the short and long-term complications associated
      with LPTB. This project will lay the groundwork for gathering the research evidence to
      support:

        1. An RCT that will study if a specialized LPTB clinic is effective in reducing short-term
           medical and developmental complications and hospital readmissions,

        2. Development of a sustainable long-term follow-up programme supported by evidence,

        3. Development of a database to track long-term complications, with the goal of identifying
           potential risk factors earlier in late preterm infants,

        4. Creation and dissemination of Evidence-Based Guidelines, research results for frontline
           health care providers (GPs, Midwives, etc.), community hospitals and Local Health
           Integration Networks,

        5. Creation and dissemination of Parent Educational Resources for discharge of LPTB
           infants.
