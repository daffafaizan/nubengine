      non-absorbable sutures. We will if scar formation (symptoms and aesthetics) if different
      between the two types of closures as determined by the patient and observer scar assessment
      scale version 2.0 (POSAS) and the patient-rated wrist/hand evaluation (PRWHE), between
      absorbable and non-absorbable suture for wound closure of open carpal tunnel release and
      trigger finger pulley release.
