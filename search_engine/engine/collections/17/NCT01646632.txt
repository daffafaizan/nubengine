      training, balance training, and functional training will be used in a sample of
      institutionalized elderly people. The exercise program has a frequency of 2 times a week and
      a duration of 16 weeks. The intensity is moderate, measured on a 0-10 scale. The level of
      intensity is specified as follows: on a 10- point scale, where no movement is 0 and maximal
      effort of a muscle group is 10, moderate-intensity effort is a 5 or 6, and high- intensity
      effort is a 7 or 8. There is currently insufficient evidence that a combined exercise
      program, developed to improve physical fitness, can improve ADL performance and care
      dependency also.
