      influence chronic pain, such as pain and psychological vulnerability; (ii) genetic factors
      relating to mechanistic pathways to persistent pain generation. Patients will be recruited
      from those undergoing breast cancer surgery at the mentioned site. Pain and anxiety
      assessment will be conducted via visual analogue scoring, mechanical temporal summation
      assessment and a series of questionnaires. After the surgery, all patients will be given
      appropriate analgesia, and the pain score and analgesia usage will be recorded. Phone survey
      will be conducted 4 and 6 months, respectively, after surgery to determine the outcomes.
