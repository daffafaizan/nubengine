      I. To determine if pomalidomide monotherapy induces a minimal level of antitumor efficacy to
      justify its further development for HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in sub-Saharan Africa
      and is safe and tolerable.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of pomalidomide monotherapy on standard measures of HIV control,
      i.e., CD4 counts and HIV viral loads, in this participant population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on serum cytokine levels. II. To evaluate
      if changes in serum cytokine levels correlate with clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 48 weeks.
