      A. To compare the following elements between the two patient groups:

        -  the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by EPISPOT

        -  the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by CellSearch

        -  the percentage of patients with at least 2 CMCs per ml of blood according to the two
           techniques

        -  the % of CMCs expressing KI67

        -  the % of CMCs expressions S100 (only the EPISPOT technique)

      B. To compare the EPISPOT and CellSearch techniques is terms of the following:

        -  the number of CMCs detected per ml blood

        -  the number of CMCs expressing antigen KI67

      C. To re-evaluate the 2-CMC per ml blood threshold
