      of adolescents with chronic illnesses from pediatric to adult health care. Over the past few
      years, several recommendations have been introduced with respect to the transitional care of
      adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). According to the international
      recommendations, joint visits (involving both pediatric and adult gastroenterologists) are
      highly recommended during the transition period. Although joint visits are considered to be
      the most optimal form of structured transition, so far, no randomized controlled trial
      providing strong scientific evidence to prove the superiority of joint visits over usual care
      has been conducted. TRANS-IBD is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical
      trial designed to demonstrate the benefits of a structured transitional intervention
      involving joint visits. Patients in the intervention arm attend a total of four joint visits
      between the ages of 17 and 18. In the control arm, patients only meet the pediatric
      gastroenterologist but there is balanced consultation between the adult and the pediatric
      gastroenterologist, regarding the patient's medical history and treatment plan. Patients in
      both groups receive the same training and education, the only difference between the two arms
      is the presence of the adult gastroenterologist at the joint visits. The intervention period
      of the study starts at the age of 17 and lasts until the age of 18, when the participants are
      transferred to the adult gastroenterologist. The follow-up period starts from transfer and
      lasts until the end of the first year spent in the adult gastroenterology care.
