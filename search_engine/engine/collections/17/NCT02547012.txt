      pylori-infected adult patients with failure of non-bismuth quadruple therapy are randomly
      assigned to either EALT (esomeprazole 40 mg b.d., amoxicillin 500 mg q.d.s., levofloxacin 500
      mg o.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.d.s.) therapy or EAL (esomeprazole 40 mg b.d., amoxicillin
      500 mg q.d.s., and levofloxacin 500 mg o.d.) for 10 days. Repeated endoscopy with rapid
      urease test, histological examination and culture or urea breath tests is performed at six
      weeks after the end of anti-H pylori therapy.
