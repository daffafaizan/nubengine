    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability. (Phase 1) II. To determine the recommended phase
      II dose. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the efficacy (by International Working Group [IWG]
      criteria - Phase 2) of the MDM2 inhibitor, milademetan tosylate (DS-3032b), in combination
      with low dose cytarabine (LDAC), with or without the addition of venetoclax in both the
      frontline and in relapsed/refractory (non-TP53 mutant) patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of time to response variables including overall survival (OS), event-free
      survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR).

      II. Determine biomarkers that may be predictive of DS-3032b activity. III. Molecular
      profiling at screening, on study, and at relapse to determine genomic predictors of response
      and resistance.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of milademetan tosylate, followed by a
      phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive low dose cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-10 and milademetan tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-14, 8-21, or 5-7 and
      15-17. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive low dose cytarabine SC BID on days 1-10, milademetan tosylate PO QD
      on days 8-14, 8-21, or 5-7 and 15-17, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-14. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment participants are followed up at 30 days.
