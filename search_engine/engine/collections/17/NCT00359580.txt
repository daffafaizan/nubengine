      genetic disease for a number of reasons. There is a high degree of inbreeding, resulting in a
      high frequency of recessive disorders, many of which are seen rarely or are unknown outside
      of this population. Extensive genealogical records are available, and the average family size
      is large. This proposal includes a number of collaborators who have had extremely close,
      extensive interaction with the Lancaster County Amish over the past decade; their
      relationships with the community are invaluable to the success of this project. We have had
      substantial success with this research over the past seven years, leading to the discovery of
      the molecular etiology of four human diseases and the establishment of a useful database and
      tools for genealogical analysis. We propose to continue this line of research to further
      characterize these disorders and identify additional ones, as well as enlarging a
      computerized Anabaptist genealogy.
