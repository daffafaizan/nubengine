    
      This is a prospective randomized trial of clomiphene citrate (CC) preceded by
      progestin-induced endometrial shedding (PIES) vs CC without PIES in the treatment of
      infertility in patients with PCOS, for up to 5 treatment cycles.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either progestin followed by CC starting on day 3
      of the induced menses, or CC without induced menses. Study participants will be monitored at
      regular 2 to 4 wks intervals for response to medication using ultrasound and hormonal
      parameters. The maximum dose of CC will not exceed 750 mg/cycle. Treatment will not exceed 5
      ovulatory cycles. Participants who are resistant to 150 mg of CC will exit the study.

      170 anovulatory PCOS women actively seeking pregnancy, aged 18 through 40 years will be
      enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 treatment ratio into the two study arms. Anovulation will be
      the only infertility factor in all patients.
