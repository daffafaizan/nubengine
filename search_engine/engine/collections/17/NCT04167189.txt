      study will assess the frequency of ineffectiveness in the target population. This study will
      be compared with a similar assessment among the general population (NCT03676725). The
      controlled trial will assess the ability of lidocaine oral gel to block taste (e.g., sweet)
      in 40 adults, with a history of ADHD.
