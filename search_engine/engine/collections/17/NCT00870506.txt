    
      We propose a community-based randomized controlled trial involving 450 intervention and 450
      control patrons visiting Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicle branches (OBMV) to obtain a driver's
      license. Interventions patrons will watch a 5-minute video prior to entering the OBMV. Study
      personnel will interview intervention and control patrons after they leave the OBMV to
      determine whether they signed an organ donor card. We will also determine the effect of the
      video intervention on willingness to donate organs while living.
