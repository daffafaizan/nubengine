        -  Determine the activity of docetaxel in women with platinum resistant, refractory ovarian
           epithelial or primary peritoneal serous cancer.

      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 6 courses of therapy, including 2
      courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
