      primarily in women which cannot be lost by diet, exercise or bariatric surgery. Arms are
      affected in 80% of women with lipedema to varying degrees. The etiology of lipedema is not
      known and there are no evidence-based treatments that work for a majority of individuals
      except for excision of the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) by liposuction which has risks.
      Millions of women are affected with lipedema yet they are grossly under-diagnosed, have
      mobility issues and can develop lymphedema. The goal of this project is to better understand
      the etiology of lipedema SAT, find out how it is different from non-lipedema SAT, to improve
      our ability to identify the abnormal SAT and determine the response of the tissue to
      therapeutics by imaging and biomarkers. People with diffuse Dercum's disease (DD) appear to
      have lipedema plus a tissue inflammation that causes illness and pain. People with SAT
      disorders that have similarities to lipedema will also be included in this protocol. More
      research is needed to determine how these fatty disorders are similar and different from each
      other and from obesity so they can be distinguished clinically and by laboratory testing and
      imaging. Since these painful fatty disorders are associated with SAT growth, research focused
      on these disorders may provide unique insight into mechanisms of obesity.
