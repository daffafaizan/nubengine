      dysfunction and an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, a
      major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality characterized by increased blood
      pressure, proteinuria and edema, which affects approximately 3% to 7% of all pregnant women.
      Other risk factors, besides obesity, that increase the likelihood of developing preeclampsia
      include chronic hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

      Reactive oxygen species (ROS) [superoxide anions (•O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and
      hydroxyl radicals (•OH)],5 interact with proteins, nucleic acids and lipids and in a process
      called lipid peroxidation (LPO), can cause severe cell and tissue damage. There is current
      evidence that ROS are common activators of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a factor that
      initiates a systemic inflammatory process by promoting the synthesis of cytokines,
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and expression of
      intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1).

      To maintain balance of the oxidative state, the human body possesses intracellular
      antioxidant enzyme systems, including superoxide dismutase (SOD, glutathione peroxidase
      (GPx), and catalase (CAT), which is located mainly in peroxisomes and cytoplasm of the cell.

      The epidemiology of preeclampsia, which is more common among poor women, had previously
      suggested that nutrients may be involved in the disorder, unfortunately, the nutritional data
      obtained from women with the syndrome has been poorly defined.

      The objective of this paper was to provide an overview of the biological plausibility and
      potential mechanisms underlying associations among maternal nutrition, oxidative stress in
      placenta and the risk of preeclampsia.
