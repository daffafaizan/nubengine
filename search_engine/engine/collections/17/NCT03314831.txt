      septic patients, either alone or in combination. Only a fraction of them is used in clinical
      practice. The reasons vary, low sensitivity or specificity is the main one, cost/benefit or
      difficult processing with the need of highly specialized laboratory to name the other.

      Recent pilot study from Swedish authors (A.M.Kauppi et al.) published in 2016 showed high
      correlation of myristic acid levels in blood in patients with sepsis and bacteraemia. There
      was no other publication on this molecule in relation to sepsis before. Cambiaghi et al.
      observed its significant decrease in nonresponders to the treatment of septic shock.

      Myristic acid is an organic acid of linear structure. Measurement of its level will be
      performed using gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometry.
