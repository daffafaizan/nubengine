      incident rate of various types of arrhythmias may be as high as 86-100% in patients who
      experience acute myocardial infarction within 10 days. Serious arrhythmias can endanger lives
      instantly. According to statistics, 500,000 people die of severe arrhythmia every year in
      China, which constitutes approximately 50% of the death rate for cardiovascular diseases. In
      the United States, among 1,500,000 myocardial infarction patients, approximately 540,000
      patients die each year, which is mainly caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden
      cardiac death (SCD).

      dose level added as needed to deemed appropriate following review of safety and tolerability
      data at the prior dose level(200mg,400mg). A safety review committee will review data from
