    
      Primary Aim 1. To determine if adjunctive probiotic administration can reduce relapse for
      participants first hospitalized for mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving adjunctive
      probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have a lower rate of relapse as defined
      by a re-hospitalization (e.g., admission to an inpatient unit) during the 24 week study
      period.

      Secondary Outcomes. The number of new mood episodes, the severity of psychiatric symptoms,
      and changes in cognitive scores over the 24 week study period will be evaluated.

      Exploratory Aim 1. To study the effect of probiotic therapy in lowering the levels of
      inflammatory markers following an acute episode of mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving
      adjunctive probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have reduced levels of
      antibodies to casein, gliadin, and the NMDA receptor, and reduced levels of C-Reactive
      protein and the cytokine TNF alpha following 24 weeks of probiotic therapy.

      Exploratory Aim 2. To evaluate changes in the gut microbiota following probiotic
      administration. Hypothesis: Probiotic administration will enrich the gut microbiota of
      participants with the given microorganisms and these changes may correlate to changes in the
      peripheral inflammatory markers being measured.
