    
      In the "ProPEL" study the investigators will introduce a patient protocol designed for
      patients above 75 years where emergency laparotomy or laparoscopy is indicated.

      Patients with abdominal pathology requiring emergency surgery will be evaluated for frailty
      by the surgical team using standardized frailty scores.

      The results from the scorings indicate whether the patient should be offered surgery or
      palliation. The clinical decision is made together with the patient and/or relatives in a
      shared-decision-making process.

      If surgery is planned, the patient enters a specific care-bundle for emergency laparotomy.
      Mortality and morbidity will be analyzed in patients treated according to the principles of
      this bundle. The bundle will be applied to all patients above 75 years undergoing emergency
      laparotomy/laparoscopy with a Clinical Frailty Scale scoring from 1-6.

      Essential elements in this care-bundle are frailty scoring, surveillance and Optimizing of
      patients, surgical treatment within pre-defined criteria, and monitoring for delirium
      postoperatively.
