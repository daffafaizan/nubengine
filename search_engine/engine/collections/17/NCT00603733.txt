    
      A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy and
      safety of a new modified oral extended release Pentasa® (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet to the
      currently marketed Pentasa® (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet in subjects with active mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis treated with 4 g/day for 8 weeks and in maintenance of remission
      of ulcerative colitis in subjects treated with 2 g/day for 24 weeks. The study involves male
      or non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 75 years.

      Subjects were randomised on entry into the trial, and if they were in remission at the end of
      the 8-week Active Phase or the 4-week Run-in Phase, they were eligible for enrolment into the
      24-week Maintenance Phase, remaining on the original randomised treatment.
