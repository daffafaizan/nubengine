      cognitive, psychological, and social consequences that are far-reaching for the patient.
      Despite our keen awareness of this significant public health issue, little is known regarding
      the biological mechanisms leading to PTE. One plausible mechanism is that unchecked
      neuroinflammation, a process that occurs in animal and human models of both traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) and epilepsy, leads to altered synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.
      However, the direct relationship between neuroinflammation and PTE has been difficult to
      ascertain from pre-clinical studies as they may not accurately reflect the human condition,
      as few animal models can induce the progression of PTE without a pharmacological enhancer and
      are predominately limited to studies of mild-to-moderate TBI given high animal mortality
      rates from more severe injuries. Measurements of neuroinflammation in human TBI and epilepsy
      has also proven difficult without invasive monitoring or post-mortem evaluations, and
      measurements of inflammatory mediators in blood or serum may not meaningfully reflect the
      extent of neuroinflammation.

      Encouragingly though, positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to measure the degree of
      in vivo glial activation in the central nervous system through radiotracer binding of the
      translocator protein (TSPO), serving as a surrogate of neuroinflammation. Minimally expressed
      in the uninjured brain, TSPO binding is increased in a number of brain disorders associated
      with neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, recurrent head trauma
      in football, brain metastases, TBI, and epilepsy, and is expressed predominately by activated
      microglia, the main mediators of neuroinflammation. Currently, no pre-clinical or clinical
      study has analyzed the relationship between glia activation, as measured by TSPO PET, and the
      risk for developing PTE. Accordingly, we plan to use [18F]DPA-714 to characterize
      neuro-inflammation following moderate-to-severe TBI in order to better understand the
      temporal time course of neuro-inflammation following injury and its potential role in
      epileptogenesis.
