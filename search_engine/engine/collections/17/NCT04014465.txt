      In the case of cancer patients, ctDNA is a fraction of the cfDNA derived from tumor.
      Currently, the ctDNA is widely used in "liquid biopsy" for not only does it carry the same
      somatic alterations as the tumor itself but also its percentage is correlated with tumor
      burden.

      This study will investigate the clinical value of efficacy evaluation and prognosis of ctDNA
      detecting technique in patients with radiotherapy.
