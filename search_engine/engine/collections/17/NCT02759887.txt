      of 15 DS subjects aged 21 and older who do not qualify for the diagnosis of dementia at the
      beginning of the study. (2)The DS/AD group will consist of 15 DS subjects aged 40 and older
      who do qualify for the diagnosis of dementia by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Diagnoses will be by standard consensus review
      of all cases. (3)Normal control (NC) adult will consist of 10 cognitively normal, non-DS
      individuals, age-matched to the DS group. Blood will be collected to assess apolipoprotein E
      (ApoE) genotype. Participation in the dried blood spot collection (DBSC) will be an optional
      sub-study. Only participants and/or their caregivers/legally authorized representatives
      indicating they wish to have DBSC performed on the consent will provide specimens.
