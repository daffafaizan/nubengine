      with resectable, squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the oropharynx.
      Survival rate and treatment response of OPSCC varies based on HPV infection status and
      genotype; therefore, in this study, only patients who are HPV seropositive and have HPV type
      16 will be enrolled. All patients will receive the same treatment, i.e. there is no active
      control group.

      In this trial, patients will undergo transoral surgery followed by de-intensified adjuvant
      radiotherapy plus nivolumab. The radiotherapy will consist of 45 or 50 Gy (depending on tumor
      volume) in 25 daily fractions, 6 fractions per week. Nivolumab will be administered at a
      fixed dose of 240 mg over 30 minutes IV every 2 weeks during radiotherapy, and at 480 mg over
      60 minutes IV every 4 weeks for 6 doses after radiotherapy. The first dose will be given
      prior to the first fraction of radiation (Day 1) on Day -3 (+/- 2 days), and continued every
      2 weeks (+/- 2 days). Nivolumab will thus be given in weeks 2 and 4 of radiotherapy. Adjuvant
      nivolumab will then be given for a total of 6 additional doses after the completion of
      radiotherapy every 4 weeks (+/- 7 days), starting in the second or third week after the
      completion of radiotherapy. Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued
      depending on how well the subject tolerates the treatment. Relevant outcome measures include
      disease free survival (2 year post surgery); percutaneous gastronomy dependence (1-year
      postsurgery); acute and late toxicity; patient-reported Quality of Life measures,
      locoregional control and distant metastatic control.
