      common risk factors for diabetes and heart disease underscore the urgency of developing
      effective, accessible, and sustainable interventions that use an integrated, multicondition
      care management approach. The RAINBOW trial will rigorously evaluate the clinical and cost
      effectiveness and potential for "real-world" implementation of an innovative intervention
      that integrates a behavioral weight loss program and a collaborative stepped care program for
      depression, incorporates conventional clinic- and home-based modes of care delivery (e.g.,
      office visits plus phone consults and take-home DVD), and leverages low-cost, wide-reach
      health information technologies (e.g., Web, secure email, and mobile texting). Beginning Jan
      11, 2016, at least 100 of newly enrolled trial participants will also be consented to undergo
      additional assays evaluating neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation, including
      emotional regulation, cognitive control and self-reflection. Given its focus on transforming
      primary care management of obesity and depression and common cardiometabolic risk factors to
      evidence-based, patient-centered care, as well as the likely scalability of the proposed
      intervention, the study has high potential for significant clinical and public health impact.
      Furthermore, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation will significantly
      advance precision lifestyle medicine by enabling mechanism-targeted individualization of
      treatment.
