      aspects of quality of life have been shown for physical activity in cancer patients during
      treatment, none of the pre-requisites above (i-iv) is fulfilled in the setting of patients
      with advanced colon cancer.

      However, evidence, primarily from the adjuvant setting, that physical activity impacts on
      treatment tolerability and tumor progression is a strong enough rationale to now embark on
      this prospective trial. By assessing in a large randomized controlled trial whether a 12-week
      structured physical activity program during chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed
      colorectal cancer undergoing standard first-line chemotherapy improves progression-free
      survival as compared to standard first-line chemotherapy alone, all pre-requisites for a
      practice-changing intervention are met.

      The physical exercise ACTIVE-program describes a 12-week exercise program consisting of a
      combination of a bi-weekly aerobic exercise (cycle ergometer) supervised by a physical
      therapist and a self-paced increase in physical activity during daily life using a pedometer
      with a daily step goal as a motivational tool.

      In addition to the supervised exercise program twice a week, patients of the intervention
      group are recommended to be physically active at home.

      All patients will undergo standard systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Patients in the care-as-usual group are not actively encouraged to change their physical
      activity level e.g. to start a fitness program during chemotherapy.
