      based on symptoms will be randomized to receive oral nitazoxanide or placebo twice daily for
      5 days. Subjects will be monitored by daily by telephone or home visit to monitor symptoms
      and complications of influenza for safety and will be referred for medical care as required.
      Subjects will complete a diary twice daily to record the presence and severity of symptoms,
      ability to perform normal daily activities and time lost from work. Complications of
      influenza (including sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, central nervous system
      disease) and other adverse events will be reported. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected at
      Baseline (Day 0) and Day 7 for all patients and on Days 1 through 4 for a subset of patients
      to test for influenza A (including novel H1N1), influenza B and 17 other respiratory viruses
      by RT-PCR and culture and to evaluate quantitative viral shedding. The primary analysis will
      be for patients with confirmed influenza, and secondary analyses will be conducted for
      subjects with any respiratory virus and for all treated subjects.
