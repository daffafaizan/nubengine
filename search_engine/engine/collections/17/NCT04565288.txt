    
      This proof-of-concept study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, single-site study designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      tolerability of atomoxetine for alcohol use disorder among adolescents ages 14 to 19 years.
      In addition, this project will test the effects of atomoxetine, as compared with placebo, on
      responses to in vivo alcohol cue exposure in the human laboratory setting. After obtaining
      consent/parent permission/assent, youth and, if younger than 18 years, their parent will
      complete a medical history interview to screen for eligibility. Youth will also be screened
      for eligibility. If eligible for the study, participants will be randomized in an approximate
      1:1 ratio (targeting 21 participants per group - 42 participants total) to either atomoxetine
      or placebo for 6 weeks. Atomoxetine will be dosed at 40 mg/day for three days then increased
      to the maintenance dose of 80 mg (active) taken orally once daily (QD) for an additional 5.5
      weeks. Participants randomized to the placebo condition will be given an equal number of
      visually matched capsules.

      Participants will be seen in the clinic at the in-person screening appointment, the
      randomization/baseline session, and at 8 other times during the study. Three follow-up
      telephone interviews will occur at 2 weeks and three and six months after the last in-clinic
      visit. At the randomization/baseline visit and after 4 weeks of investigational product
      administration (i.e., Study Week 7), participants will undergo a human laboratory paradigm
      (i.e., alcohol cue reactivity assessment). In addition, participants will complete EMA on a
      smartphone throughout the day in their daily lives.
