    
      This study will enroll patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome. All
      patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit
      (CR,PR, or SD) then will undergo a second 4-week cycle of treatment.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of high dose Vitamin C

        2. Estimate the proportion of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with Ten-eleven
           translocation-2, (TET2) mutations who exhibit a biological response defined as maintaing
           a vtamin C serum concentration of â‰¥1mM over the treatment cycle.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Estimate the clinical efficacy, namely objectiveresponse rate (ORR). [including complete
           response (CR) and partial response (PR)] duration of response (DOR) and progression-free
           survival (PFS) as defined in the IWG (International Working Group) response criteria in
           myelodisplasia.

        2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of Vitamin C as hypomethylating or
           demethylating agent
