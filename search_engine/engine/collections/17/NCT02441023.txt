      (primary care), with HbA1c >6.5% and <13.0%, without advanced macro or microvascular
      complications of diabetes.

      Two arms: the experimental group with nutrition therapy plus education in diabetes through a
      multimedia application. The application had seven modules: Introduction, nutrition, physical
      exercise in diabetes, myths and truths on diabetes, metabolic control parameters, knowing
      diabetes, complications of diabetes. The control group received only usual nutrition therapy.

      A monthly follow up during the first 7 months and then bimonthly, until 21 months of total
      follow up, with reinforcement in each visit of nutrition and other non-pharmacological
      therapy, with control on weight and blood pressure. Laboratory studies included HbA1c, lipids
      profile, creatinine and albuminuria, performed at 7, 14 and 21 months. Results were provided
      to both the patient and his family physician, so modification in drug treatment if needed,
