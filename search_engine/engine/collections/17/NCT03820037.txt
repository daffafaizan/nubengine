    
      This will be a Phase I, open label, randomized, partial-replicate, three-period,
      three-sequence crossover study to investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence
      of 2 API sources of OPC (BIA 9-1067 [Test] and OngentysÂ® [Reference]) in healthy adult
      subjects.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 3-period, 3-sequence crossover design; each subject will
      receive 2 single oral 50 mg doses of the Reference API source of OPC, and a single 50 mg dose
      of the Test API source of OPC under fasting conditions.

      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28
      days prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical
      Research Unit (CRU) on Day 1 and be confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 3. There will
      be a washout period of at least 14 days between each dose. A follow-up visit will be
      performed 7 to 14 days after dosing in the last treatment period or early discontinuation.
