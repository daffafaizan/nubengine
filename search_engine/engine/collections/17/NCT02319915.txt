      and blood transfusion in the perioperative period. Tissue damage is associated with the
      activation of a cascade of mechanisms, in which the activation of the fibrinolyse plays an
      important role. This is why anti-fibrinolytic agents are regularly used in this context to
      reduce the perioperative bleeding and the use of blood transfusions.

      In the majority of cases, tranexamic acid, an analogue agent of lysine, is administered by an
      intravenous injection and more recently, by an intra-articular injection.

      Several questions however remain unanswered.

        -  what is the clearance of this substance ?

        -  does an intra-articular resorbtion exist, resulting in a plasmatic rate of the substance
           ? If yes, what is the plasmatic rate ?

        -  Is the intra-articular effect of tranexamic acid predominant compared to its systemic
           effect ?

        -  Does the addition of adrenalin increase the effect of the tranexamic acid by acting on
           its absorption ?

      The efficacy, safety and better administration route of the tranexamic acid remain unknown
      when injected intra-articularly. The goal of this study is to realize the first
      pharmacokinetic study after an intra-articular injection of tranexamic acid, alone of along
      with adrenalin, in a knee neo-articulation.
