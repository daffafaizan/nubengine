    
      A cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of placing GeneXpert Omni
      platforms at primary health care clinics combined with rapid communication of results on time
      to treatment initiation of microbiologically confirmed TB.

      In a setup period (survey of study centers) before randomization, the healthcare facilities
      (=clinics) of 4 sites will be asked to provide information about the number of TB
      notifications per quarter covering the period 1/2018-6/2020. From this information the
      foreseeable number of examined patients ("size of a clinic") will be derived, which will be
      used as a strata variable in randomization process.

      Facilities will be randomly allocated to the standard of care (control), or GeneXpert
      OMNI/UltraÂ® (and MTB/XDR cartridges).

      A cluster refers to a clinic. The clusters will be assigned to intervention or control arm to
      one of two diagnostic procedures (SOC [smear microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra off-site]
      vs Omni/Ultra on-site) following a restricted randomization strategy, whereby 6 to 8 strata
      of clusters will be established using the stratification variables site (clinics belong to a
      site) and size and apply balance criteria for them. The number of strata per site depends on
      heterogeneity of the sizes of the clinics as established in setup period and may be
      increased, typically 1 or 2 strata per site will be established.

      The primary endpoint will be compared in an individual level analysis with strata and
      intervention as fixed effects and cluster as random effect.
