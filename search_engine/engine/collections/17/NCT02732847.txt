    
      6 family doctors and 2 nurse practitioners in a small rural town will issue delayed
      antibiotic prescriptions to adult patients with new acute respiratory tract infections. The
      delayed prescriptions will be randomly dated for either the day of the office visit, or 2
      days later. The 2 local pharmacies will note whether the prescription is cashed, and when.

      It is hypothesised that post-dating the prescription will result in a reduced cashing rate.

      Each arm of the study (Usual v Post-Dated) will contain 75 subjects. This sample will have
      the power to detect a 25% change in prescription use.
