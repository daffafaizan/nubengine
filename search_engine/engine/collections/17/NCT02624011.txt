      sedentary lifestyle. Increased sedentary time has consistently been associated with lower
      muscle mass and compromised metabolic health. However, there is currently a lack of direct
      evidence to support these associations.

      Therefore, this study will investigate whether increased sedentary time (reduced step count
      and exercise cessation) directly influences long-term measures of muscle protein synthesis
      and metabolic health in young, active adults. Following a 7 day period of normal habitual
      physical activity, participants will undertake a 7 day period of step reduction and exercise
      cessation. It is hypothesised that 7 days of increased sedentary time will result in a
      reduction in long-term rates of muscle protein synthesis and a worsening of metabolic health.
