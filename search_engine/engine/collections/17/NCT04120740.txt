      ActivPAL acitivity monitors, respectively, and direct observation in order to investigate to
      which degree the two types of activity monitors are able to classify activity (i.e. lying,
      sitting, standing, walking, up/down transitions and steps).

      Thirty-six patients from three different patient populations will be included: 12 acute
      high-risk abdominal surgery patients (+18 years), 12 hip fracture patients (+65) and 12 older
      medical patients (+65). Inclusion criteria to be fullfilled: 1) admission from own home.
      Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: inability to walk independently with or
      without a walking aid; inability to transfer from lying to sitting, inability to transfer
      from sitting to standing, inability to cooperate, and inability to speak or understand
      Danish.

      Each patient will be asked to wear two sets of activity monitors (on the right thigh and on
      the chest) while performing a predefined, supervised protocol consisting of a range of
      positions and activities including lying down, sitting, standing and walking.
