      (i.e less than 100.000) . In ITP, platelet surface membrane proteins become antigenic for
      unknown reasons , leading to stimulation of the immune system , autoantibody production, and
      platelet destruction In recent years ,the list of etiologies of ITP has been steadily
      increasing, so the term "idiopathic" is becoming obsolete, increasingly replaced by
      "immune"TP.

      Treatment of ITP may be conceptually divided into rescue therapy and maintenance therapy. the
      terminology of corticosteroid-dependence means The need for ongoing or repeated doses
      administration of corticosteroids for at least 2 months to maintain a platelet count at or
      above 30 _ 109/L and/or to avoid bleeding. So, patients with corticosteroid dependence are
      considered non responders The recent entry of Helicobacter pylori to the growing list of
      etiologies of itp has stirred much interest. . The relationship between H pylori infection
      and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is less clear .

      However, among patients with H.pylori-associated ITP, a significant percentage achieve
      lasting remission after eradication of H.pylori .

      H.pylori can be readily detected by non invasive methods, the C-urea breath test and antigen
      detection in stools are considered to be the most accurate, with both sensitivity and
      specificity in the range of 90% to 95% .
