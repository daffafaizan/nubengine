      SRH among adolescent girls. As a result, the data collected in the PREVENT study will be
      grouped into two main themes: SRH knowledge and attitudes, as well as family planning
      (pregnancy avoidance) and contraceptive services uptake and outcomes. All data collected
      during the study will be directly entered and stored into the secure PREVENT mobile platform
      and related secure storage functions within the platform.
