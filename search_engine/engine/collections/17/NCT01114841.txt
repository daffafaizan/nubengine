    
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce contact sensitization following
      repeated exposure under maximal stress conditions in healthy adult volunteers. Approximately
      240 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled.

      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam and vehicle foam.
      Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema, edema, papules) or superficial effects at patch
      sites will be visually assessed and scored according to the corresponding grading scales.

      The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the following phases: 3
      week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if indicated, a second 2 week Rest and
      1 week Repeat Challenge.
