    
      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes on FDG-PET scan to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions
      in 3 weeks (1.5 Gy BID with minimum 6 h interfraction interval).

      Dose-constraints: MLD > 20 Gy. In that case, CT-based replanning will be done after 1 week of
      treatment and shrinking field techniques will be used if appropriate.

      The radiation doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be
      applied, as well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in
      standard practice at MAASTRO clinic.

      Radiotherapy shall start during the first cycle of carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.

      Chemotherapy (standard schedule in the Comprehensive Cancer Centre Limburg region):

        -  carboplatin AUC 5 day 1

        -  etoposide 120 mg/m2 days 1-3

      Q 3 weeks; 5 cycles

      In patients with no progression and a WHO PS 0-2, after the completion of chemotherapy, PCI
      will be given (25 Gy in 10 fractions, QD)
