      OA is the most common type of OA. Since the prevalence of knee OA increases with age, it is
      anticipated that the prevalence and burden of knee OA will increase significantly given the
      aging population.

      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical intervention for treating patients with severe
      knee OA. Research has found that TKA reduces knee pain, and improves patient's function and
      quality of life. However, studies have also found that patients with post-TKA may be more
      likely to fall as compared to age- and gender-matched asymptomatic counterparts. It is
      estimated that around 20% to 50% of patients fall within in the first year after TKA. As
      such, it is essential to improve the balance of post-TKA patients.

      Studies have found that Tai Chi can significantly improve the balance and function of older
      people. Therefore, a fall prevention program aiming at strengthening, proprioception, balance
      training, and behavioral modification may improve balance, pain, and function of post-TKA
      patients.

      As such, the current 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the
      effectiveness of a post-operative community-based fall prevention program in improving knee
      pain, function and balance of patients with unilateral TKA with a group of patients receiving
      standard post-operative care, and age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls over 1 year.
