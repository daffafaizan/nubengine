      killing approximately 2 million individuals annually. This is a major public health concern
      worldwide, and there has been a huge impetus to implement strategies for better tuberculosis
      control.

      The investigators have established a system to track all patients with microbiologically
      proven tuberculosis treated at Singapore General Hospital, with vigilant recording and
      reporting systems, from the first instance when patients were diagnosed to the time they have
      completed anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. The investigators endeavour to use this system to
      improve patient care by adopting patient-supportive approaches that lead to high compliance
      rates and best possible outcomes of treatment.
