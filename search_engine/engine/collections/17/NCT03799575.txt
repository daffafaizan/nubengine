    
      A non-randomized prospective study of eyes with MH willing to have surgery at the Department
      of Ophthalmology of Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon.

      Surgeries are performed under local or general anesthesia, pars plana vitrectomy with
      internal limiting membrane peeling, fluid gas exchange and face down position.

      Two samples of discarded ILM peeled in Macular hole surgery is studied in Laboratory.

      Laboratory Analysis Two samples of ILM per patient are harvested, one will be immediately
      fixed and submitted to Optic Microscopy (OM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
      analysis, and another sample will be incubated in enriched medium 199 (Gibco) for 20 minutes
      at room temperature, after which it will also be fixed and submitted to OM and TEM analysis.
      Both samples from same patient will follow the protocol available at
      dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.qjiduke.

      Image acquisition Six electron-micrographs will be acquired for each fragment, using a
      Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope equipped with a megaview III digital camera. Fields of
      interest will be randomly selected, and acquisition of 15,000x magnification images.

      Histology and immunohistochemistry ILM samples will be stained with anti-GFAP antibody
      (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein), to detect this protein in glial cells.

      Results:

      Only successful macular hole closure will be considered, BCVA will be compared before and
      after surgery and related to OCT findings. ILM findings in TEM analysis will be compared with
      and without enriched medium.
