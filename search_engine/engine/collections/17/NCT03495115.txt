      cancer in comparison to standard breast MRIs.

      RSI is a technique that has been shown to address the limitations of certain types of MRI
      exams used to make images of the prostate and brain. RSI is not a FDA-approved technique for
      screening, but is a type of advanced diffusion technique and diffusion weighted imaging is
      used as a part of the standard breast MRI. RSI has been shown to improve tumor detection in
      prostate and brain. For example, a recent pilot study in prostate showed that adding RSI
      improved the ability to find a certain stage of prostate cancer in comparison to an MRI
      without the use of the RSI technique. By comparing RSI's ability to diagnose breast cancer,
      future clinical testing can determine whether RSI is a more efficient way to screen for
      breast cancer.
