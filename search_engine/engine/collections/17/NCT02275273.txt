      imaging techniques (echography, scanner and magnetic resonance) and corresponding to benign,
      borderline or malign masses (Kurtz et al 1999, Grabowska-Derlatka et al, 2013, Tanaka et al
      2011, Asch et al 2008).

      Recently, studies have even established ecographic and magnetic resonance imaging scores
      combining these characteristics (Thomassin-Naggara 2013, Timmerman 2005), some of these
      characteristics being considered as more suspect than others.

      However, these studies have considered adnexal masses in their globality only and to our
      knowledge, none have correlated their imagery characteristics with their precise
      anatomopathology characteristics.

      The goal of this study is thus to correlate the pelvic magnetic resonance imagery
      characteristics of the adnexal masses with their anatomopathology characteristics, in order
      to add complementary information for the future management of masses that are defined as
      borderline according to imagery.
