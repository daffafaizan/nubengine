      lifetime. After low back pain, neck pain is the most common reason patients give for seeking
      chiropractic care, and the second most common reason for the use of spinal manipulation.
      Usually, the underlying cause of neck pain is non-specific and cannot be related to a
      particular pathology as a cause of the presenting symptoms. Due to the uncertainty of the
      results obtained in the limited number of studies of manipulation and mobilisation for neck
      pain, further studies are needed to compare the different therapies available for neck pain.
      Participants in the study were treated as they would normally be with the exception of the
      type of spinal manipulation. There were three groups: a manipulation group, a mobilisation
      group, and an Activator instrument group.
