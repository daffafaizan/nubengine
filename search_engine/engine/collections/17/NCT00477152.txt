    
      Pediatric patients (2 months to 10 years of age), presenting to the emergency department (ED)
      with mild to moderate dehydration and requiring parenteral rehydration, were treated with
      HYLENEX-augmented subcutaneous (SC) rehydration. An initial volume of 20 mL/kg of isotonic
      fluid was to be administered by continuous SC infusion over the first hour, and additional SC
      rehydration could be continued as clinically indicated. The preferred anatomic site for the
      SC infusion was the anterior thigh, unless there was an overriding preference for an
      alternate site.

      The duration of HYLENEX-augmented SC rehydration was to be a minimum of 1 hour and a maximum
      of 72 hours. The investigator or designee performed a clinical assessment of the subject's
      hydration status at baseline and at the end of SC infusion or at discharge from the ED. Other
      assessments of effectiveness and safety were made directly during the rehydration period and
      ED stay, and by telephone on Days 3 and 7 after discharge from the ED.
