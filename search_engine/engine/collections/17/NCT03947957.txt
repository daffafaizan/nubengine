    
      This is a multicentric study in 3 phases:

        -  Pre-inclusion: at the first visit to the CRCM (support for a positive screening
           confirmed by sweat test and genotyping CFTR)

        -  Inclusion: possible between the 2nd visit to the CRCM (about 2 months old) and the 6th
           month

        -  Follow-up: up to 24 months old. The pace of visits will be based on the usual follow-up
           rate of CF infants

      The clinical data as well as samples (expectorations, stools) will be collected on a monthly
      basis up to 6 months old and then every 2 months until one year old and finally quarterly
      until 2 years old.

        -  Tracheo-bronchial secretions will be collected at the CRCM

        -  Stools samples will be carried out by the parents prior to consultation with the CRCM

        -  A blood collection will be carried out annually in an annual report.
