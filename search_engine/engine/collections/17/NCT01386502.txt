    
      Background:

        -  PD1 is an inhibitory receptor that belongs to CD28-B7 family.

        -  PD1 binds to two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to down modulate T-cell immune responses.

        -  PD1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, and NK cells.

        -  The over expression of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) in tumors is associated with an immune
           suppression and poor prognosis.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of anti PD1 antibody
           (CT-011) in combination with subcutaneous p53 vaccine.

        -  To determine the immune response to wt p53 (264-272) peptide.

        -  To determine the clinical efficacy of this combination.

      Eligibility:

        -  18 years of age or older, not pregnant or nursing and not immunocompromised or having an
           autoimmune disease.

        -  HLA-A2 haplotype.

        -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

        -  Advanced solid tumors over expressing p53 protein with a histological confirmation of
           the original primary tumor via the Pathology Laboratory, CCR , NCI.

      Design:

        -  Single arm, pilot/phase I trial in patients receiving a fixed dose of vaccine in
           combination with an escalating dose of CT-011.

        -  The vaccine will be administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks followed by CT-011 two
           days after each vaccine until disease progression or toxicity.

        -  Patients will undergo blood draw or aphaeresis for immunologic assays prior to starting
           treatment and after every second cycle.

        -  Patients will be assessed for overall safety, immunologic efficacy, tumor response using
           RECIST criteria and survival.

        -  Patients will be followed for up to two years after the last vaccination for assessment
           of safety and efficacy.
