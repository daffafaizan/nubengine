      underwent upper enoscopy with biopsy were randomly assigned to medication and control group.
      In the medication group, sodium alginate was administered after EGD during 3 days. All
      patients underwent a questionnaire to check the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at
      baseline and on the day after return home. After 3 days, gastrointestinal symptoms were
      investigated by telephone survey. Gastrointestinal symptom was scaled by upper
      gastrointestinal symptom rate score (GSRS). Upper GSRS contains 8 items and 3 scales;
      abdominal pain (abdominal pain, epigastric pain/hunger soreness, nausea), reflux symptom
      (Heartburn/reflux/belching gas), indigestion symptom (abdominal distension, borborygmus).
