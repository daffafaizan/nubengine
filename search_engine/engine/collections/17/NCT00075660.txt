      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of 3-AP (Triapine®), in terms of objective response rate, in
           patients with previously untreated locally recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the adverse events and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and 15-18. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses (for stable patients) in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional
      course after documentation of CR. Patients who achieve a partial response (PR) receive 2
      additional courses after documentation of stable PR.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until relapse and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
