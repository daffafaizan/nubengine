    
      Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) of 64-detector rows or greater represents a
      novel noninvasive anatomic method for evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD). Early studies suggest a potential for prognostic risk assessment by CCTA
      findings but were limited by small patient cohorts or single centers. The CONFIRM Registry is
      a large, prospective, multinational dynamic observational study of patients undergoing CCTA.
      The primary aim of CONFIRM is to determine the prognostic value of CCTA findings for the
      prediction of future adverse CAD events.

      The CONFIRM registry currently represents 27,125 consecutive patients at 12 cluster sites in
      6 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. CONFIRM sites were chosen on the basis of
      adequate CCTA volume, site CCTA proficiency, and local demographic characteristics and
      medical facilities to ensure a broad-based sample of patients. Patients comprising the
      present CONFIRM cohort include those with suspected but without known CAD, with known CAD, or
      asymptomatic persons undergoing CAD evaluation. A data dictionary comprising a wide array of
      demographic, clinical, and CCTA findings was developed by the CONFIRM investigators and is
      uniformly used for all patients. Patients are followed up after CCTA performance to identify
      adverse CAD events, including death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, target vessel
      revascularization, and CAD-related hospitalization.
