      1mcg; 3mcg or Placebo, at 90 centers worldwide. Each center will enroll approximately 10
      patients.

      Study drug will be added to optimized background anti-retroviral therapy of patients whose
      HIV RNA is incompletely suppressed by their therapy (HIV RNA 400-50,000 copies/ML) after 2-6
      months.

      A single dose reduction of 50% will be allowed for toxicity. An Interim Analysis will be
      conducted when 50% of patients have completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study treatment phase
      will be 48 weeks with monthly visits for virologic virologic and safety monitoring. The
      primary endpoint is change in HIV RNA from baseline to week to assess efficacy. Durability of
      response will be assessed at 48 weeks.
