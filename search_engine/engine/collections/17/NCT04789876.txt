    
      This study is a multi-centred randomized, open label-controlled trial where a total of 66 HD
      patients (33 intervention vs 33 control) with hyperphosphatemia were recruited from
      government, private and non-governmental organization settings.

      Patients who consented were subjected to screening for identification of hyperphosphatemia
      and other eligibility criteria. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were grouped
      according to shift and block randomized to either the intervention or control group using a
      web-based randomiser.

      The intervention group received a phosphate mobile app for 12 weeks and the control group
      received one-off phosphate counselling delivered by a dietitian with a phosphate booklet.
      During the 12 weeks study period, patients in both control and intervention groups were
      assessed at baseline and 12 weeks for changes in serum phosphorus, serum corrected calcium,
      phosphate knowledge, dietary intake and phosphate binder adherence.

      These parameters were compared at baseline and 12 weeks for within- and between-group.
