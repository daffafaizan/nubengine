      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide,
      vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and dexamethasone) + ofatumumab in patients
      with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with any level of CD20 expression:
      event-free survival; overall response rate; overall survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of this combination.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSES 1, 3, 5, 7: Patients receive hyper-CVAD comprising cyclophosphamide intravenously
      (IV) over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1-3; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on
      day 4; vincristine sulfate IV over 15 minutes on days 4 and 11; and dexamethasone IV over 30
      minutes or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4 and 11-14. Patients also receive
      ofatumumab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 11 of courses 1 and 3.

      COURSES 2, 4, 6, 8: Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 2 hours and then over 22
      hours on day 1 and cytarabine IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 2-3. Patients also
      receive ofatumumab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 8 of courses 2 and 4.

      Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive maintenance therapy for an additional 30 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
