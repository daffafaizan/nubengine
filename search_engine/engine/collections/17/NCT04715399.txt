      neurodegenerative diseases and is continually expanding research efforts and collaborations
      regarding the factors which may contribute to these illnesses. Investigators seek to better
      understand the basis of neurodegenerative conditions by creating a multimodal repository,
      including: clinical data such as demographic characteristics, vital signs and motor scales;
      cognitive and speech data; neuroimaging data; and biological specimens with associated
      biofluid biomarkers and genetic data. Investigators pursue acquiring these data from
      neurodegenerative disease patients, people at risk for neurodegenerative disease due to a
      family history, and unaffected adults. Targeted conditions include frontotemporal
      degeneration (FTD), primary progressive aphasia PPA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), familial frontotemporal
      lobar degeneration (fFTLD), non-amnestic variants of Alzheimer's disease including logopenic
      progressive aphasia and posterior cortical atrophy, and Lewy body disease. This study aims to
      collect clinical and cognitive data, imaging data, and biospecimen samples from people whose
      background can inform research and treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and make these
      samples and data available to qualified researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and
      collaborating academic centers and industry partners.
