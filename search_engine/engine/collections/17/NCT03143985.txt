    
      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum tested dose level of
           Vactosertib given in combination with pomalidomide (POM) for the treatment of relapsed
           or relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of Vactosertib in combination with
           POM at the MTD

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the activity of the combination of Vactosertib/POM regimen in terms of:

        -  Overall response rate (complete response [CR] + very good partial response [VGPR]
           +partial response [PR]) and clinical benefit rate (CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response
           [MR]) based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria and
           the duration of response (DOR) in RRMM patients.

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6)

      Exploratory Objective:

      To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib combination
      therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple myeloma.

      Study Design To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib
      combination therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple
      myeloma. This study is a Phase I, open label trial of Vactosertib in combination with
      standard doses of POM. The study will be conducted as a modified Fibonacci 3 + 3 dose
      escalation design to determine the MTD of Vactosertib in combination with standard doses of
      POM. Patients will receive combination Vactosertib/POM.
