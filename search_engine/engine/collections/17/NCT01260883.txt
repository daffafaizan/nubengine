    
      Population kinetic analysis of ketorolac stereo-isomer concentrations after single dose given
      postoperatively in infants aged 2-18 months. Safety assessments of renal and hepatic function
      tests by blood tests before and after drug administration, urinalysis pre- and post-drug,
      continuous oximetry before and for 12 hours after drug. Morphine use between active drug
      groups and placebo group in the first 24 hours after surgery was assessed as a surrogate
      analgesic measure in these non-verbal infants. A modified infant pain scale was used to
      assure consistent pain management.
