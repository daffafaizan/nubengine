      parallel-group, dose-ranging study with a 24-week follow-up period to evaluate the safety and
      potential efficacy of two doses (60 μg/ml and 180 μg/ml) of recombinant human nerve growth
      factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution versus vehicle in patients with typical retinitis
      pigmentosa (RP).
