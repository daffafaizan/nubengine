      evidenced by improvements in peripheral endothelial function (as measured by brachial
      Flow-mediated dilatation, FMD). There is also emerging evidence suggesting that flavanol-rich
      diets protect against cognitive aging, but mechanisms remain elusive. In this study the
      investigators suggest that such mechanisms might be associated with benefits within the brain
      vasculature. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether intake of
      flavanols enhances cerebral oxygenation in frontal cortical areas of the brain during a
      hypercapnia challenge (which is a well-established biomarker of vascular reactivity in the
      brain) to a greater extent than a low-flavanol intervention in young healthy adults.
