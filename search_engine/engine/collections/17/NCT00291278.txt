      with a more dramatic short-term decline at the time of menopause. Because of the association
      with osteoporosis and fracture, evaluation of BMD at the time of menopause is recommended, as
      is identification and treatment of any reversible causes of bone mineral loss. Most studies
      of women with endometriosis have shown no change or decreased BMD, while rats with induced
      endometriosis had a marked decrease in BMD. Often, studies in women did not control for
      factors that are known to affect bone density such as body mass index (BMI), exercise, or
      calcium intake. To address the question of whether endometriosis is associated with a change
      in BMD, we previously matched healthy volunteers and endometriosis patients for age, race,
      BMI, exercise level and calcium intake and compared BMD in the two groups. We found a
      decrease in BMD in women aged 40 - 50 who had a history of endometriosis, in comparison to
      women who did not have such a history. This study will expand that experience by studying
      more women aged 40 - 50 years with a history of endometriosis and matching them to women of
      the same race with similar age and BMI, who do not have a history of endometriosis.
      Participants will fill out a questionnaire about their medical, exercise and dietary history
      and will provide a single blood sample. A bone density study will be done and results will be
      made available to the participants.
