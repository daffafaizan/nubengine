      I. To determine whether mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established using a
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma.

      II. To determine whether mixed chimerism, established with non- myeloablative conditioning
      regimens, can be safely converted to full donor hematopoietic chimerism by infusions of donor
      lymphocytes (DLI).

      OUTLINE:

      CYTOREDUCTION: If necessary, patients with advanced malignancies undergo cytoreductive
      chemotherapy to reduce tumor size at discretion of primary physician and study investigators.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo low-dose total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine intravenously (IV) twice daily (BID) on days
      -1 to 0 and then orally (PO) BID on days 1-35 with taper to day 56. Patients also receive
      mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27.

      POST-TRANSPLANT DLI: Patients with mixed chimerism on day 56 and no evidence of graft-vs-host
      disease (GVHD) undergo DLI over 30 minutes on day 65 and may receive up to 3 additional
      infusions in the absence of GVHD and disease progression or persistence. Patients who have
      not achieved mixed chimerism at day 56 undergo DLI if complete response is not obtained after
      a 2 month monitoring period.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      and then annually thereafter.
