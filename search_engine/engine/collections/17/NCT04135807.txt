    
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study device in brain tumors.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the microdevice as a
      treatment for any disease.

      Investigators are studying the safety of the microdevice and the effects of different drugs
      for each specific tumor. Brain tumors are known to be very different from each other and
      respond differently to different drugs. It would be very helpful to find out what drugs have
      the best chance of working in each specific tumor.

      This research study involves drugs that are released by a small device, as small as the tip
      of a needle, that is inserted into the tumor at the time of surgery and is removed at the end
      of the surgery. The goal of this research study is to prove that microdevices can be used to
      find out which drugs have better effects on treating malignant brain tumors.

      Participants will be in this research study for up to 30 days.

      Expected enrollment is about 12 people.
