      induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as IIA level-evidenced
      treatment for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage II-IVa),there is still about
      20-30% of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma experienced recurrence and
      metastasis after radical treatment.

      Our previous results showed that patients with plasma Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) DNA> 0 copy/mL
      or stable disease/progressive disease(SD/PD) after induction chemotherapy had a significantly
      higher risk of disease progression than patients with plasma EBV DNA=0 copy/mL and complete
      response/partial response(CR/PR),according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST). As for these high-risk patients, the urgent clinical problem to be solved is
      whether increased treatment intensity during concurrent chemoradiotherapy can improve their
      survival rates.

      Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.Multiple retrospective studies have shown that chemoradiotherapy combined with the
      EGFR blocker nimotuzumab improved the survival rate of patients with locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with chemoradiotherapy alone. However, phase II randomized
      clinical trial about the incorporation of nimotuzumab into concurrent chemoradiotherapy is
      still limited.

      This is the first phase II randomized clinical trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or
      without Nimotuzumab for high risk locally advanced NPC patients, determining whether
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with nimotuzumab can improve the survival rate of
      high-risk patients and may provide new evidence for individualized comprehensive treatment of
      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
