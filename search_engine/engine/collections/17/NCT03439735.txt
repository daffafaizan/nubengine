      progesterone receptor (ER/ PR) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Data regarding
      primary resistance and patterns of emergence of acquired resistance in treatment na√Øve
      patients treated with aromatase inhibitor (AI) and cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)
      inhibitors are limited. Understanding these mechanisms could result in improved selection of
      treatment options and provide new targets for therapy development. In this study, the
      investigators aim to identify and characterize determinants of intrinsic and acquired
      resistance to endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative MBC treated with the combination of an AI
      and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in the first -line setting.

      Investigators will determine the prevalence of genomic alterations at baseline in the primary
      tumor, metastatic tissue and plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA). This will include in the gene encoding
      estrogen receptor- alpha (ESR1). The mutational tumor burden in the primary tumor, metastatic
      tumor and blood will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected at several time points,
      allowing the detection of changes in molecular markers over time. The investigators will
      further characterize tissue markers associated with progression and duration of response by
      evaluating these markers in available tissue obtained at progression. The investigators goal
      is to evaluate the prevalence and role of known alterations determining endocrine resistance
      in patients previously untreated for metastatic disease, as knowledge regarding this
      population remains limited. The investigators also hope to unveil novel markers of endocrine
      resistance.
