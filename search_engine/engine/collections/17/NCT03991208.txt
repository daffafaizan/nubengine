    
      A clinical trial under controlled heat exposure and moderate intensity exercise, determined
      by VO2max testing and calibration, to determine if physiologic changes during heat exposure
      and exercise change the pharmacokinetics of malarone to a degree that falls outside the range
      of that which is considered bioequivalent or 80-125% concentration using AUC and Cmax for
      rate and extent of exposure. Participants will be randomized to order of rest and exercise
      components. Single dose malarone will be used during both arms. Single dose malarone
      pharmacokinetics will give insight into risk of toxicity or risk of under treatment during
      prophylaxis administration.
