      of the disease and avoid life-threatening infections on patients. Babies with SCID are unable
      to fight infections. They become severely ill in their first months of life and do not
      survive unless their immune systems can be restored. SCID can be treated by bone marrow
      transplant if recognized early. The newborn screening test to be employed in this study is
      designed to diagnose SCID before infections occur. By conducting a pilot testing program in a
      high-risk population on the Navajo Indian Reservation, where one in 2,000 infants is born
      with SCID, we hope to confirm the benefits of newborn screening for early diagnosis of SCID
