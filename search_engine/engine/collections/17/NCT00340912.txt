      growth medium. Fibroblasts cultured in this way retain the genetic characteristics of their
      donor but can be used for experiments where study conditions are much more precisely
      controlled than they can be in in vivo studies. We plan to culture fibroblasts from Pima
      Indians for two purposes: 1) to look for an in vitro system to measure insulin resistance,
      the underlying abnormality in Pima diabetics; and 2) to look for biochemical markers of
      diabetes or obesity in Pimas employing two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques.
