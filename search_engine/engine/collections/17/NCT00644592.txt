      null hypothesis is that over a four week period, fenofibrate (160mg/day orally) is equivalent
      to placebo in terms of relative changes in cytokines ENA-78 and MCP-1 over a four week
      periods, separated by a four week washout. ENA-78 is a marker of inflammation. See
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL5 for more details.
