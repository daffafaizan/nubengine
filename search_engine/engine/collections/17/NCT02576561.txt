      vaccine construct in achieving the absence of histologic HSIL (CIN2/3) (regression to LSIL or
      less) as assessed by biopsy at last study Visit 11, Day 270.

      The objective of the TVGV-1 program is to develop a non-surgical alternative that is
      reliable, safe, and would avoid potential surgical risks such as preterm birth, perinatal
      mortality, risk of infertility, incontinence and disfigurement, as well as reduced cost and
      inconvenience for an otherwise economically productive young subject population.
