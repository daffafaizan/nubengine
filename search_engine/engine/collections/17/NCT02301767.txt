      multi-center hospital-based case-control study, cases will be women diagnosed with incident
      breast cancer who have undergone or are about to undergo a bilateral breast MRI with contrast
      to assess extent of disease. The cancer-free controls will be women at high-risk of breast
      cancer undergoing a bilateral breast MRI with contrast for screening. The MRI collected for
      the study may be post-biopsy and post-surgery (unilateral lumpectomy/mastectomy), but prior
      to bilateral mastectomy, radiation, hormonal, and/or chemotherapy. Study participants also
      need to have a bilateral mammogram available at the study site within 24 months prior to, or
      up to 24 months after the study MRI (as long as prior to surgery, radiation, hormonal, and/or
      chemotherapy), to be included in the secondary aim analysis. The MRI/mammogram selected for
      this study do not need to be conducted at the recruitment site, the digital images just need
      to be accessible from the patient medical records at the site. Questionnaire data, optional
      saliva samples, MRIs, mammograms, and medical records will be collected over a 27 month
      period from women at three NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers (MSK, Penn, Utah).
      Each site has demonstrated experience with recruitment, patient interviews and collection of
      MRIs and mammograms.
