      immunoglobulin superfamily, and its expression is upregulated on phagocytic cells in the
      presence of bacteria or fungi (1). Several experiments by Bouchon and colleagues showed that
      TREM-1 mediates the acute inflammatory response to microbial products. Human tissues infected
      with bacteria are infiltrated with neutrophils and macrophages that express high levels of
      TREM-1. Conversely, TREM-1 is only weakly expressed in samples from patients with
      noninfectious inflammatory disorders. In addition, TREM-1 is shed from the membrane of
      activated phagocytes and can be found in a soluble form in body fluids. The presence of a
      soluble form of TREM-1 in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mechanically
      ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia. During
      sepsis, a progressive decline of plasma sTREM-1 concentration indicates a favorable clinical
      evolution during the recovery phase of sepsis. In addition, baseline sTREM-1 level may prove
      useful in predicting outcome of septic patients. We will collect the dialysate of peritonitis
      in peritoneal dialysis patients and analyze the time serials change.
