      after anesthesia and examine how is affected by the amount of supplemental oxygen patients
      are receiving in the immediate postoperative period, since hyperoxemia (ie., higher than
      necessary partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood) has been associated with
      ventilatory depression via suppression of the hypoxic ventilatory drive.

      In this feasibility randomized controlled trial, the investigators plan to estimate and
      compare the cumulative segment of time during which the transcutaneous partial pressure of
      carbon dioxide will exceed an upper limit of 45 mmHg (i.e., TcPCO2 > 45 mmHg) for the
      90-min-long post-anesthesia period, between the conventional (titrated to an oxygen
      saturation > 96%) and the conservative (titrated to O2 saturation 90 -94%) O2 supplementation
      interventions.

      Hypothesis: Conservative use of O2 (titrated to an SpO2: 90 - 94%), will be associated with
      less hypoventilation (i.e., less time spent with an TcPCO2 > 45 mmHg) during recovery from
      general anesthesia, compared to liberal O2 supplementation (SpO2 > 96%).
