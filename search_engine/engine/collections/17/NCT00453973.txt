      inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin.
      Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other
      nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The presence and severity of anemia
      are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure. Anemia is associated with increased
      mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased
      left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

      Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been established as a treatment for anemia in
      subjects with chronic kidney disease, and have improved the management of anemia over
      alternatives such as transfusion. Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the
      treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Peginesatide binds to and
      activates the human erythropoietin receptor, and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell
      precursors in a manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

      Study participants had received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide dosing in a previous
      Affymax-sponsored study and were to receive doses of peginesatide for up to 54 months.
      However, the Sponsor ended the study early.
