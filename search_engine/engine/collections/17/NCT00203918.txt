      prostate cancer treatment decision-model and to understand the implications for doing so for
      cost-effectiveness analysis. To do this, it is first necessary to obtain patient utility
      scores (i.e., patient preference weights). To do this we will perform a survey of patients
      visiting the urology clinic to undergo prostate biopsies to validate a method of utility
      assessment, and understand the patients' individual evaluations of treatment-related health
      studies. We will also ask patients questions relating to their anxiety levels concerning the
      possible diagnosis of prostate cancer.
