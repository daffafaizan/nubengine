      the Worldwide shortage of donor organs has led to increased use of implantable mechanical
      circulatory support devices. The treatment with implantable pumps in the form of a Continuous
      Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device (CF-LVAD, or simply LVAD) is extremely effective for a
      selected patient groups leading to significant improvement in survival and quality of life.

      The device is a battery-powered flow pump that carries the blood from the left ventricle to
      the main artery, via a cannula, and thus relieves the failing left ventricle with up to 10
      liters of blood per minute. An LVAD can be used both as lifelong support therapy (Destination
      Therapy, DT) or until transplantation can take place (Bridge therapy).

      As patients today live for more than 10 years with the device as DT, the focus has shifted
      from mere survival to quality of life and physical ability.

      In recent years, our research group showed that the pump speed and the patient's baseline
      heart rhythm (sinus rhythm vs atrial fibrillation) and reduced ability to regulate the
      intrinsic rhythm after implantation (chronotropic incompetence) are significant contributors
      to the reduced exercise capacity seen in this patient group.

      Until now, studies have elucidated the work capacity of this patient group using a 6-minute
      walk test or bicycle test - none of these reflect how well the patient actually functions in
      his everyday life.

      In this study, we will describe oxygen uptake related to specific daily activities (ADL-VO2)
      and compare these with the well-known maximum work capacity (percentage of expected oxygen
      uptake / pVO2) in this patient group.
