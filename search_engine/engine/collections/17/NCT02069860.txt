    
      STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate feasibility
      regarding safety, efficiency and clinical performance of the BAP as a permanent access for
      chronic haemodialysis therapy in patients with renal failure to reach the certificate
      European (CE) mark and conduct a post market follow-up study.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT

      1) Device survival probability after one year (product - limit estimator of Kaplan-Meier
      Analysis). An event is the primary failure of BAP, defined by necessity to remove the device:
      for any medical reason (e.g. infections at wound or mastoid, thrombosis, and severe patient
      discomfort)

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

        1. Performance - Implantation and primary healing process

             -  Failure to implant a device due to procedural complications or unforeseen
                anatomical reasons, except for intra-operatively detected exclusion criteria

             -  Successful attempt on the site contralateral to the planned side

             -  Duration of the implantation procedure measured from incision to final suture

             -  Duration of hospitalization before implantation / after implantation

             -  Time from implantation to first use for haemodialysis

             -  Rate of patients with complications stratified by

                  -  Dura mater exposed / injured

                  -  Blood sinus injured

                  -  Injury of facial nerve

                  -  Carotid artery puncture

                  -  Central vein perforation

                  -  Bleeding, defined as requirement for blood products

                  -  Pneumothorax

                  -  Hematothorax

             -  Initial healing and stabilization of BAP, Infections at implantation site

             -  Septicaemias with no other source of infection than surgical-procedures impairment
                for mechanical reasons

        2. Performance - removal of catheter

             -  Failure to provide a blood flow â‰¥200ml/min for more than 2 consecutive weeks

             -  Catheter related and untreatable infection

             -  Surgical or interventional (Seldinger technique) procedure

             -  Persistent recirculation higher than 15%

        3. Performance - Dialysis use

             -  Average blood flow rate

             -  Average venous pressure

             -  Average arterial pressure

             -  Recirculation

             -  Volume-corrected clearance (Kt/V)

             -  Access thrombosis reversible by non-surgical means

             -  Infections of any kind

                  -  in anatomical structures around implant

                  -  remote infections possibly related to the BAP

                  -  bacteriemia/septicemia

        4. Design Validation

             -  Questionnaire for the implantation surgeon

             -  Questionnaire for the dialysis staff

             -  Questionnaire for patients

             -  Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire (EQ-5D)

             -  Questionnaire for change / removal of catheter
