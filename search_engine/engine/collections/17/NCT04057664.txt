    
      To treat patients with chronic pelvic and belly pain in an interdisciplinary way, we
      developped a group therapy consisting of twelve sessions and a booster session. The therapy
      is based on the bio-psycho-social model of pain and includes group sessions of psychotherapy
      as well as physiotherapy.

      All patients fill in questionnaires (concerning pain impact, pain chronicity, depression,
      anxiety, stress, well-being and sexuality) before and after the therapy as well as three and
      twelve months after.
