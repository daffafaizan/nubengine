    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the proportion of participants with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) (with or without human
      immunodeficiency virus [HIV], regardless of previous treatment status) treated with
      pomalidomide who respond to treatment with a durable response (i.e., response duration of at
      least one year).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in participants with KS. II. To estimate the
      overall response rate (ORR) in subgroups of KS in regard to HIV and previous treatment
      status.

      III. To assess the safety of pomalidomide therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on the tumor microenvironment and explore
      the relationship with clinical response.

      II. To describe the effects of pomalidomide on CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV viral load in
      HIV positive (+) participants.

      III. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on serum biomarkers and explore the
      relationship with clinical response.

      IV. To assess Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral copy number in plasma and
      explore whether changes correlate with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After 12 cycles, patients with complete response, partial response, or stable
      disease may continue pomalidomide for an additional 12 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
