    
      To address the pharmacokinetic profiles of everolimus and tacrolimus in combination in de
      novo kidney transplant recipients, comparing 1.5 and 3 mg per day of everolimus in fixed
      doses. For comparison purposes, pharmacokinetic profiles will be performed at first dose
      (abbreviated), 4th day, 14th day, and 42nd day post-transplantation. Patients will receive
      triple therapy steroids, tacrolimus and everolimus. Tacrolimus will be administered at a dose
      of 0.15 mg/kg/day to achieve 10-15 ng/ml 14 days, and 5-10 thereafter. During the first 6
      weeks (the PK study period) everolimus will be assigned to fixed dose of 0.75 or 1.5 mg bid.
      After day 42, everolimus will be adjusted for 3-8 ng/ml and tacrolimus minimized to optimize
      graft function. Efficacy and safety parameters at 6 months post-transplantation will be
      secondary endpoints.
