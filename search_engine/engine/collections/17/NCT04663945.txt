    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a
      multicomponent tele-rehabilitation program during COVID-19 recovery. The tele-rehabilitation
      program will include biobehavioral training and high intensity exercise facilitated through
      an online application ('Platform'). Initial efficacy will be assessed primarily by
      performance on the 30" Chair Stand Test and secondarily through other physical function tests
      and patient reported outcome measures.

      This study will advance the feasibility of tele-rehabilitation as a more generally useful
      intervention in patients lacking access (distance, availability, mobility) to standard
      rehabilitative services and could transform the way in which acute rehabilitation and
      post-hospital care is delivered for all patients.
