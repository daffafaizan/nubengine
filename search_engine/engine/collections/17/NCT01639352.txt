      28 days. Dose reduction will be allowed for toxicities which are deemed to be
      therapy-related. Patients will receive SOM230C (IM) as an outpatient and will be observed for
      at least 30 minutes for any immediate adverse reactions. Toxicity checks will be done every 2
      weeks and laboratory tests every 4 weeks during study therapy). Safety and efficacy will be
      assessed throughout the treatment period. Toxicities will be graded using the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.02.

      Therapy will continue for maximum of two years if the patient shows no evidence of disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity. After completion of all study related therapy patients
      will complete a 30 day safety follow up visit. Patients who are still benefiting from therapy
      after two years may continue longer only after discussion between the Principal Investigator
      (PI) and the drug sponsor.
