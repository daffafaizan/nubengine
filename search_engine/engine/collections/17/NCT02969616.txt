      United States, with a minimum enrollment of 120 subjects study-wide, will be enrolling
      subjects. The primary objective of this study is to measure the lumbar fusion rate in
      subjects at 24 months when lumbar arthrodesis is performed using Trinity Elite with or
      without local bone. Surgical approach (PLF, TLIF,ALIF, XLIF, etc.) is according to the
      physician's discretion, but must comply with FDA approved/cleared indication for use and
      labeling. The primary endpoints are radiographic evidence of fusion and the absence of
      serious adverse events attributable to Trinity ELITE. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to measure the clinical and economic outcomes when posterolateral arthrodesis is
      performed using Trinity Elite and/or local bone with supplemental pedicle screw fixation.
