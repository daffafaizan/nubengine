    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the correlation between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)
      radiomics and dynamic 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FMAU) PET kinetic
      analysis parameters.

      II. Explore the different pattern in radiomics mpMRI and FMAU PET kinetic analysis parameters
      between patients with presence or absence of recurrent tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-FMAU intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/CT scan over 60 minutes.
      Patients then undergo standard of care mpMRI over approximately 45 minutes.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 24-96 hours after their
      18F-FMAU PET/CT scan.
