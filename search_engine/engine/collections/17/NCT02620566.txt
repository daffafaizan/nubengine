    
      Total of 80 children aged 6 month to 7 years of ASA physical status I or II, undergoing
      unilateral hernia repair will be enroled in the study. One group will receive caudal block
      (CB) and the other group will receive local wound infiltration (LWI).

      Group CB will receive 1ml kg 0,25% bupivacaine and group LWI will receive 0,2 ml kg 0,25%
      bupivacaine. Data taken will than be analyzed and interpreted. Postoperative pain will be
      assess using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS, 0-10)(8) and the
      Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability tool (FLACC, 0-10)(9) at 30 min and 1, 2, and 3 h after
      operation. The time to first supplemental oral acetaminophen demand (first acetaminophen
      time) was defined as the time from the end of surgery to the first registration of more than
      4 on both CHEOPS and FLACC by the investigator. Twenty-four hours after surgery, reports of
      delayed side-effects and demands for rescue acetaminophen from the child will be gathered.
      The investigator, who will be blind to the treatment group, will document these data with the
      medical records.
