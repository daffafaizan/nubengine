      glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in pancreatic Î²-cells and liver cells, which represents the first
      step of glucose metabolism. GK also acts as a glucose sensor and exerts a key role in
      maintaining glucose homeostasis. HMS5552 is a 4th-generation GK agonist or activator (GKA),
      which was originally licensed from Roche and subsequently developed by Hua Medicine. HMS5552
      has been shown to activate GK in pancreatic beta cells, liver and intestinal epithelial
      cells. It regulates systemic blood glucose through a variety of mechanisms including directly
      enhancing insulin release (pancreas), inhibiting production of endogenous glucose (liver) and
      by indirectly promoting GLP-1 release (enteroendocrine L-cells).
