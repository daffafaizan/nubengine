      their medical care. They are more likely to be discharged against medical advice,
      rehospitalized after discharge, and experience personal chaos and reduced family support.
      Hospital systems are moving to implement hospital-based and community disease management
      strategies to help patients transition post-discharge, however, few provide specialized
      follow-up for patients with SUDs. This proposal will test whether an extended, specialized
      community disease management program can improve outcomes over an existing nurse navigator
      disease management strategy for patients with co-morbid medical conditions and SUDs. The
      investigators will enroll 222 inpatients with co-occurring medical conditions and SUDs and
      will randomly assign them to either 1) Treatment as Usual - a 90-day, post-discharge program
      that consists of medical monitoring by workers who have no special training in working with
      SUD patients, or 2) the Specialized Community Disease Management program - a 90-day program
      that will employ specialized teams including a trained clinical social worker and a
      peer-specialist community health worker who will provide evidence-based telephone continuing
      care, home visits, and increased focus on patients' substance use. All participants will be
      followed at 3- and 6-months post-discharge. The investigators hypothesize that (1) patients
      randomized to SCDM will demonstrate larger reductions in substance use measured by
      urine-confirmed self-reported days using over the 6-month follow-up compared to patients
      randomized to TAU, (2) patients randomized to SCDM will attend more specialty substance abuse
      intervention and treatment sessions over the 6 month follow-up than patients randomized to
      TAU, (3) patients randomized to SCDM will demonstrate reduced HIV transmission risk behaviors
      and greater rates of HIV testing over the 6 month follow-up than patients randomized to TAU,
      and (4) patients randomized to SCDM will experience fewer days of rehospitalization and use
      of acute emergency services than patients randomized to TAU.
