      with a known or suspected diagnosis of epilepsy for eligibility to participate in ongoing
      protocols. The secondary objectives are to: follow the natural history of subjects with
      epilepsy and epilepsy-related disorders, and to use data obtained through clinical care for
      descriptive and/or correlative research. Study Population: Adults and children age 8 years
      and older referred with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy Design: Participants In this
      protocol will be evaluated by study investigators with standard diagnostic clinical studies
      as clinically indicated to fully characterize their uncontrolled or suspected seizures and
      related clinical features. There are no study procedures other than data collection for this
      protocol after screening. Patients will be followed clinically, as needed, to follow the
      natural history of epilepsy. Follow up will be performed to allow for evaluation of the
      natural history of drug-resistant epilepsy and its co-morbidities. Outcome Measures: Patients
      will be screened for eligibility for epilepsy-related research protocols and clinically
      characterized, including clinical features, imaging, and electrophysiological and
      neuropsychological characteristics. In addition, standard of care evaluation and treatment
      will be carried out under this protocol.
