      is human parathyroid hormone 1-34, for increasing bone mass and improving bone structure in
      adults affected with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Osteogenesis imperfecta is an inherited
      disorder of type I collagen, a major component of bones, and is characterized by multiple
      fractures and deformities. OI affects approximately 1-2 of every 10,000 individuals.
      Virtually all of the studies of potential treatments for OI have evaluated the effects of
      medications only on children with OI. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and there
      is no established medical therapy for adults with the disorder. There are very limited data
      concerning the usefulness of parathyroid hormone therapy in OI. An effective anabolic therapy
      for the treatment of adult patients with OI could be a valuable asset to the affected
      patients. In this study, the working hypothesis is that individuals affected with OI who are
      treated with Forteo will experience increased spine and hip bone mineral density and an
      increase in bone strength. Although Forteo is not expected to change the defect in the
      collagen produced, but is postulated to increase the quantity of bone formed and improve bone
      strength.

      This will be a placebo controlled, double blinded trial; half the patients will receive
      Forteo 20 ug/day SQ. Adult patients (age at least 18 yrs) with OI will be enrolled for a
      treatment duration of 18 months. Blood, urine, and bone density/strength tests will be done
      during the study to assess efficacy and safety.
