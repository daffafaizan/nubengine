      mortality. Preventing neonatal hypothermia is important in high resource countries, but is of
      fundamental importance in low resource settings where supportive care is limited.

      Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a low-cost intervention that, whenever possible, is strongly
      recommended for temperature maintenance. During KMC, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      guidelines recommend the use of a cap/hat, but its effect temperature control during KMC
      remains to be established.

      In the hospitals participating to the projects of the non-governmental organization CUAMM,
      KMC represents a standard of care, but the head of the babies often remains uncovered due to
      local habits or to the unavailability of a cap.

      Objective: The aim of the present study will be to assess the effectiveness and the safety of
      a woolen cap in maintaining normothermia in low birth weight infants (LBWI) during KMC.

      Methods: This is a multicenter (three hospitals), multi country (three countries),
      prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial of KMC treatment with and without a woolen
      cap in LBWI. After obtaining parental consent, all infants with a birth weight <2500 g and
      candidate to KMC will be assigned to KMC with woolen cap or to KMC without cap group in a 1:1
      ratio according to a computer-generated randomized sequence. The primary outcome measure will
      be the temperature in the normal range (36.5-37.5Â°C) in course of KMC during the first week
      of life. In all participants, axillary temperature will be measured with a digital
      thermometer 4 times per day. In addition, maternal and room temperature will be recorded.
      Secondary outcome measures will be: episodes of apnea; sepsis; mortality before hospital
      discharge; in-hospital growth; age at discharge.
