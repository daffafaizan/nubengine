      conditions, it may be corrected by glasses or contact lens.When these possibilities are not
      more possibles, it may be corrected by corneal ring surgery ore corneal transplantation
      depending your degree.

      In this study, the patients with a degree of keratoconus on I or II, will be submitted to
      corneal collagen crosslinking and then a corneal ring surgery.

      The corneal collagen crosslinking promote the stiffness of the cornea across the
      riboflavin-UVA irradiation, avoid the progression of the keratoconus.After three months of
      crosslinking, these patients will be submitted a corneal ring surgery.

      These patients will be allowed by two years and various exams will realized them.
