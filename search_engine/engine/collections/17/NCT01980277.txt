      The purpose of this study will be:

        1. to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for LY2780301 in combination with
           weekly paclitaxel in HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or MBC patients

        2. to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination in first-line treated,
           HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or MBC patients. In addition, this study will
           assess the role of PI3K/AKT/S6 pathway activation as potential predictive factor for
           response to LY2780301 in this patient population.

      This trial will be a phase Ib/II prospective, multicentre, open label, uncontrolled study.

      Phase Ib will use a continuous reassessment method (CRM) design, allowing to reach safely and
      quickly the MTD and the RP2D of the combination, but ensuring the treatment of at least 18
      patients to secure the tolerance profile.

      Phase II will estimate antitumor activity in the overall patient population and in patients
      with activation of PI3K/AKT/S6 axis, allowing to examine its potential value as predictive
      biomarker
