      system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. It is characterized by an ongoing
      process of demyelination and axonal loss, even at the beginning of the disease course, which
      will result in brain atrophy. A first manifestation of clinical definite MS, is called a
      clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Brain atrophy occurs even in patients with a CIS. Optic
      neuritis (ON) is a common feature of a CIS. The axons in the retina represent the most
      proximal part of the optic nerve which is devoid of myelin. Because the retina is part of the
      central nervous system (CNS), measurement of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RFLN) by Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT) offers the opportunity to visualize the unmyelinated axons of the
      CNS directly. OCT is a non-invasive method to measure the thickness of the optical layer. The
      thickness of the RNFL is reduced in MS patients with or without ON history.

      Glatiramer acetate (GA), an immunomodulatory drug for RRMS and CIS, reduces brain atrophy and
      stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which in turn could stimulate
      neuroregeneration.

      In this pilot study we would like to assess the feasibility of OCT measurement in patient
      with CIS other than ON in the Dutch clinical setting and to assess the effect of GA on the
      RNFL and visual function in patients with CIS or in early relapsing remitting MS patients.
