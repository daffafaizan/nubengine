      into two parallel groups: (1) orange juice (n = 39), composed of individuals subjected to a
      diet low caloric diet and plus intake of 500 ml orange juice; (2) control (n = 39) composed
      of individuals subjected to a diet low in calories. The recruitment process began in
      September 2015, the intervention was carried out from October 2015 to January 2016, and the
      data analysis started in February 2016. The sample number took into account variances on body
      weight with a type I error α = 0.05 and a type II error β = 0.2 (80% power). The minimum
      sample size should have 36 individuals per group (n = 72), considering an approximately 15%
      dropout rate. Thus, the final sample size of study was constituted by 39 individuals per
      group (n = 78). Primary and secondary endpoints were the reduction of weight and modification
      of the levels of obesity-related metabolic biomarkers, respectively. Normality and
      homogeneity of data were tested. T-test was conducted to identify possible differences
      between OJ and control groups at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model was apply to
      determine the time effect within and between groups (post hoc), and P significance was set up
      ≤ 0.05. The assessment of body composition, metabolic biomarkers and food intake were
      analyzed over a 12-week intervention.
