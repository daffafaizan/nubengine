      without a predetermined study design, with up to 20 patients. A planned interim analysis of
      acute toxicities was conducted 3 months after the 14th non-ACC inclusion.

      ACC As the endpoint will be evaluated at 6 months after treatment start, a one-stage phase II
      study design was chosen. The unacceptable 6-month rate of progression free survival is 20%
      and the promising 6-month rate of progression free survival is 40%.

      43 patients are to be treated. If ≤12 patients alive without progression at 6 months will be
      observed, the drug will be declared ineffective.

      If ≥13 patients alive without progression at 6 months will be observed, the drug will be
      declared promising.

      The α error rate (accepting a poor treatment) is 0.07 and the β error rate (rejecting a
      promising treatment) is 0.07.

      Analysis of results will be separated between non ACC and ACC.
