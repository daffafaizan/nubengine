      resistance exercise (PRE) in the management of sarcopenia in older male Veterans at the DC
      VAMC. This proposed study is a randomized clinical trial using a single-arm, delayed
      cross-over design with repeated measures. This method is a patient-first approach to clinical
      research that permits all participants to receive the intervention while allowing the
      investigators to conduct both within subjects and between subjects comparisons with a modest
      study enrollment. During the "pre-treatment period" we will recruit, screen, and consent 30
      older men with sarcopenia. The participants will be randomized into two groups: active
      treatment and delayed treatment. The initial "active treatment" and "delayed treatment"
      periods will last 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the participants in the delayed treatment group
      will crossover (without a washout period) and start 12 weeks of intervention. All
      participants will detrain and be monitored for follow up during their respective 12-week
      "post treatment" period. Outcome measures include post-exercise changes in metabolic and
      inflammatory markers, muscle morphology, strength, and functional status.
