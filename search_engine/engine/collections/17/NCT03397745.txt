      general anesthesia. Several factors have been found to alter BIS readings without affecting
      the depth of anesthesia.Changing a patient's position (head up and head down) significantly
      affects the BIS values, which might affect the interpretation of anesthetic depth.

      During esophageal cancer surgery, there were several factors which could affect to BIS
      values.First, the surgical positions are consisted with supine and lateral decubitus position
      more than 1 h. Thus, the investigators compare the BIS value of both side on supine and
      lateral decubitus position by both side approach. Second, the one lung ventilation was
      applied for surgical filed. It alters the oxygenation and the cerebral flow. Because of these
      effects, the BIS monitoring can differ by the period of surgery. Thus, in this study, the BIS
      value of both side monitor throughout the surgery.
