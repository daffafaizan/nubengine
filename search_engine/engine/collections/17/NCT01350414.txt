      effectiveness (beyond one year) of the Alair System in patients with severe persistent
      asthma.

      Durability of treatment effect will be evaluated by comparison of the proportion of subjects
      experiencing severe exacerbations during the first year after the Alair treatment to
      subsequent 12-month periods out to 5 years.

      The 12-month periods will begin 6 weeks post-last Alair bronchoscopy.
