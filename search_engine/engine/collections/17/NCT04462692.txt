      standard of care slows motor degeneration, it is not known to treat the ocular manifestations
      of disease. This study is planned to document, through prospective data collection, ocular
      disease progression in children with a clinical presentation consistent with CLN2 Batten
      disease undergoing current standard of care for their condition. No investigational product
      is administered in this observational study.
