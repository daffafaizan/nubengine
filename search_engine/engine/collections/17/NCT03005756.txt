      needle-guiding robot arm with computed tomography (CT) guidance. The robot consists of robot
      base, 5-axis robot arm with guiding end-effector and path-planner. Optical tracking system
      with a custom-designed registration jig is used for the spatial registration and validation.
      Advantages of the robotic system would be accurate targeting with diverse angulation of the
      robot arm in CT-guided tumor ablation. Furthermore, robotic intervention might potentially
      decrease procedure time and radiation exposure to patients. The purpose of this clinical
      trial with patients with hepatocelluar carcinoma is to assess the safety and efficacy of our
      CT-guided needle-guiding robot.
