      total hip replacement (THR) as well as the position of the acetabular component. However,
      there is no radiological method of measuring stem anteversion described in the literature.
      Investigators propose a radiological method to measure stem version and have assessed its
      reliability and validity. In 40 patients who underwent THR, a hip radiograph and CT scan were
      taken to measure stem anteversion.
