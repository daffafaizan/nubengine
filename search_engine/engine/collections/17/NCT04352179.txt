      of the participant education simulation on changes in participants with chronic diseases'
      lifestyle behaviors as well as motivation and self-efficacy to change.

      The primary objective is to examine the acceptability (satisfaction, usability) of using
      virtual simulations to deliver participant education and counseling for adopting healthy
      lifestyle behaviors among a sample of four healthcare providers and 60 participants with
      chronic disease. The secondary objectives include examining changes in lifestyle behaviors
      (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity) one-month following the use of the participant
      education simulations in a sample of 60 participants with chronic disease (e.g. cancer,
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, arthritis) and to explore the potential mediators
      (e.g. motivation and self-efficacy) of the simulation effects on the changes in participants'
      lifestyle behaviors.

      Participants will communicate with a virtual human, Linda, by selecting from a dynamic menu
      of dialogue options. Once the learner chooses a dialogue option, they see the virtual human
      respond by providing personalized feedback and give users an opportunity to revise their
      choice. In this study, the simulations will be a bundle of four topic-based conversations
      with Linda, which include fitness and nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol use, distress and
      anxiety.
