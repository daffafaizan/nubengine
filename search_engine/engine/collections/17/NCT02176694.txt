      messaging intervention to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy among
      high risk adolescents with persistent asthma. Our second aim is to determine effect sizes of
      the intervention to improve adherence (As measured by electronic monitoring and self-report);
      clinical asthma control; and asthma related quality of life among adolescents with persistent
      asthma. Our third and final aim is to determine the temporal relationship between text
      message receipt and ICS canister actuation in order to understand mechanisms by which text
      messaging may increase ICS adherence.
