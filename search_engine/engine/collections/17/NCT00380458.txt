    
      This prospective clinical study is designed to assess whether tonsillectomy and UPPP
      performed using the study device to treat OSA symptoms in an adult population is associated
      with less postoperative pain during the 21-day postoperative recovery period compared to
      electrocautery dissection. The amount of post-operative pain will be assessed daily over the
      21-day post-operative recovery period using two general measures: 1) self-reported pain
      intensity and 2) self-reported pain medication administration, including frequency of use and
      dose. Further, timing of self-medication will be analyzed separately.
