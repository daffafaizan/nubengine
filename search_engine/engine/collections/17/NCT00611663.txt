      healthy subjects. This risk increases when patients are treated with corticosteroids and/or
      immunosuppressive drugs.Among serious infections which can happen in this context,
      respiratory infections are among the most frequent and Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the
      most often responsible germs.Although there are no specific study in SLE, these findings
      indicate that patients with SLE could benefit from a preventive vaccination against
      pneumococcal infections.Two pneumococcal vaccines are available: Pneumo23®, a Poly
      Saccharidic vaccine indicated for adults and children > 2 years at risk of pneumococcal
      infections; and Prevenar®, a conjugate vaccine, indicated for children < 2 years.Pneumo23®
      has been found to be safe in SLE but less immunogenic than in general population.Prevenar®
      has already been studied in immunocompromised patients (HIV-infected patients, patients after
      renal transplantation). It has been shown that immunological efficacy is better when
      Prevenar® is administrated prior to Pneumo23®, compared to Pneumo23® administrated alone.To
      our knowledge, this prime-boost strategy has not been assessed in patients with SLEThe
      primary objective of the study is to compare immunological efficacy of two pneumococcal
      vaccination strategies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with
      corticosteroids associated or not with other immunosuppressive drugs : 1) Vaccination with
      conjugate vaccine (Prevenar®) at week 0 and Poly Saccharidic vaccine (Pneumo23®) after 6
      months (W24)2) Vaccination with placebo at W0 and Poly Saccharidic vaccine (Pneumo23®) at
      W24Secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the clinical and biological tolerance of the two vaccinal strategies·

        -  To evaluate the durability of sero protection at 6 and 24 months after vaccination by
           Pneumo23®

        -  To search predictive factors determinant of the pneumococcal vaccine response
