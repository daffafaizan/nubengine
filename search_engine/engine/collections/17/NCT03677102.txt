      pressure, which is called septic shock. The main treatments for septic shock are intravenous
      antibiotics and intravenous fluid.

      There are many different intravenous fluids available for doctors to use. Each one of these
      fluids has potential advantages as well as potential disadvantages. Doctors will often look
      at many things when deciding which fluid to give including the results of bloodwork and the
      clinical characteristics of the patients themselves. There is limited direction from research
      studies that using one fluid type is better than another. Some preliminary research in the
      field has suggested that one specific electrolyte, call chloride, may be harmful when given
      to patients in high concentrations. Animal research has shown that the administration of high
      chloride fluids may be harmful to the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal and muscle cells. Some
      intravenous fluids have higher concentrations of chloride than others.

      The investigators plan to study the impact of giving patients with severe infection
      intravenous fluids with either a high chloride concentration (normal saline or high chloride
      albumin) or a low chloride concentration (Ringers Lactate or low chloride albumin). This
      trial will build on the earlier pilot, phase 1 study and will look at patient-important
      outcomes such as rate of death, kidney failure and length of stay in the ICU. This larger
      study has the potential to guide the care of critically ill patients with infection
      worldwide.
