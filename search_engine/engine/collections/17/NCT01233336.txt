      useful marker of acute myocardial injury. Results of the study confirmed efficacy of HGF as
      very early marker of myocardial necrosis and as a prognostic factor for cardiovascular events
      in long term follow up. Recent study is a continuation of previous study.

      The aim is to confirm that maximal values of the HGF in first examination performed in ACS
      (acute coronary syndrome) patients and to show predictive value of HGF for early and late
      outcome in patients with ACS.

      Materials and method: 100 patients with acute coronary syndrome will be included into the
      study. HGF will be examined four times i.e. just after admission, 1h and 24h latter and
      before discharge. In case of 10 patients will be performed 10 assessments during first day of
      ACS.

      The follow up visits will take place 3 and 6 months after ACS. During hospitalization and 6
      months later echocardiography examination will be performed and the extension of heart
      dysfunction will be assessed. Control group will consist of 10-15 health volunteers.

      The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint which will include following cardiovascular
      events observed during hospitalization and during 6-month follow up: death, reinfarction,
      coronary interventions (PCI and/or CABG) due to new ACS or exacerbation of angina, symptoms
      of heart failure, rehospitalization due to cardiovascular events and stroke in context of HGF
      concentration in acute stage of ACS.

      As a secondary endpoints will be considered: 1) death, 2) symptoms of heart failure
      3)rehospitalization due to cardiac events observed during hospitalization or in 6-month
      follow-up. All this endpoints will consider in context of HGF values and values of routinely
      measured markers of myocardial injury.
