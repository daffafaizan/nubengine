    
      Patient Population

      The population will consist of 900 women up to and including women ≥18 to ≤40 years years of
      age (at time of randomization) desirous of conceiving who will be recruited over
      approximately a two year period from the Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) clinical sites
      and possibly from the Specialized Cooperative Center Programs in Reproductive Research
      (SCCPIR) sites, through public notification programs.

      Study Design

      This will be a multi-center, prospective, partially blinded clinical trial of gonadotropins
      vs. clomiphene citrate vs. aromatase inhibitors. The randomization scheme will be coordinated
      through the data coordination center (DCC) and the randomization will be stratified by each
      participating site and within each site for ages 18-34 and 35-40.

      Treatment

      Patients will be randomized to receive either FSH, CC, or an AI according to randomization
      tables generated by a computer randomization program. Treatment assignments will be blocked
      by site and age group. Subjects randomized to pill treatment will receive medication in
      double blinded fashion, receiving one type of pill (overcoated CC or AI). Subjects randomized
      to injectable medication(FSH) will receive vials of medication.

      Primary efficacy parameter

      Multiple gestation rate following recruitment of multiple follicular development with an AI,
      as compared to CC and FSH.

      Secondary efficacy parameters

      Rate of pregnancy obtained, live birth rate, and time to pregnancy following administration
      of an aromatase inhibitor, as compared to CC and FSH as well as the live birth rate of
      multiple gestation pregnancies.
