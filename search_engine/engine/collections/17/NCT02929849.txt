      cross-over design on three different days (1 month wash out). Subjects consuming a capsule
      containing placebo or treatment(s) are examined before and after a fixed breakfast meal (50%
      carbohydrate; 30% fat; 20% protein).

      Subjective appetite sensations are rated using visual analog scales (VAS) for hunger,
      satiety, fullness, and prospective food intake. In addition, the desire for specific tastes
      is analyzed and measurements are taken twice before breakfast (fasting baseline). After
      baseline screening and blood draw, postprandial appetite and taste perception ratings and
      blood will be obtained at multiple time points during the 3 hour postprandial period (30, 60,
      90, 120,180 min). Blood will be analyzed for glucose/insulin, gut peptides, and other markers
      in response to the meal.
