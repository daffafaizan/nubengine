      weight dextran T500 is used to prevent corneal swelling during the administration of the
      drops and the UV treatment. However if riboflavin is applied to a cornea in a hypotonic
      solution (saline), then transient corneal oedema is created with thickening of the corneal
      stroma. In this way it is thought that the temporarily thickened cornea can be treated with
      UV whilst still providing a sufficient thickness to absorb the UV to an extent that
      endothelial cell damage is avoided.
