      central and peripheral bone density, geometry, micro-structure, and marrow adipose tissue
      (MAT) among patients treated with oral steroids. To do this, investigators will recruit 10
      non-smokers (defined as < 10 pack-year smoking history) age 25-45 years with a diagnosis of
      severe, persistent asthma who either chronically use oral steroids or do not use any oral
      steroids. Participants will undergo dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), dual-energy
      mid-tibia CT, high-resolution single-energy ankle CT, and low-radiation hip CT scans at
      baseline and 6-month follow-up visits. The images obtained will be used to analyze
      cross-sectional differences in central and peripheral bone density, geometry,
      micro-structure, and MAT between patients using oral steroids versus those who do not use any
      oral steroids. Differences in imaging at baseline and six-month follow visits will be used to
      analyze longitudinal bone changes among patients with oral steroid treatment.
