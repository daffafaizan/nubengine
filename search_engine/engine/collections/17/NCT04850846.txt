      higher-risk monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and low-risk smoldering
      multiple myeloma (SMM) to test the efficacy of metformin in reducing clinical indicators of
      disease progression in MGUS and SMM patients.

      Metformin is considered "investigational", which means it has not been approved for the study
      of cancer prevention by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It has been approved
      for other uses including for blood sugar control in some people with Type II diabetes.

      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which is an important part of the immune
      system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment. There are
      currently no approved therapies for MGUS and SMM patients.

      Metformin is a medication that is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes. Metformin works
      by decreasing glucose production in the liver, decreasing glucose absorption, and improving
      insulin sensitivity. This study is interested in studying this medication because several
      recent studies indicate that the drug may help prevent progression in patients with MGUS or
      SMM. This study is looking to learn more about whether metformin will benefit patients with
      MGUS or SMM who may not have diabetes.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      After enrollment participants will be randomized assigned to receive either the Placebo or
      Metformin pills and to take them for 6 months depending on participant tolerance to the drug.

      It is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study.

      The National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health is supporting this trial.
