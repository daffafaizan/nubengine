      the daily standard of care blood samples. When daily blood samples are not ordered as part of
      a study participants care after surgery, blood samples only for the study tests, may be done.

      Up to 60 study participants will be selected to be in one of two possible groups.

      After hospital discharge the study participants physical therapist will be contacted for
      copies of the notes and reports about the participants progress in physical therapy. This
      information will be used to evaluate if the different breathing gases have any impact on how
      quickly people recover after surgery.
