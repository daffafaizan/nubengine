      to the absence of a reliable imaging biomarker for hypoxia that could easily be implemented
      into a routine clinical workflow. A compelling study has found the presence of hypoxia in
      pancreatic tumors using FAZA-PET imaging. The data derived from this alternative dual-imaging
      approach can be used to establish a patient-specific perfusion-to-hypoxia mapping, accounting
      for differences in tumour metabolisms. This technique was recently validated in a
      pre-clinical FAZA-PET/CE-MRI study of mice with orthotopically-implanted pancreatic
      patient-derived tumour xenografts.

      The purpose of this study is to look for hypoxia in tumours using a PET scan in combination
      with MRI. The use of PET/MRI scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the
      approaches used previously. This study will assess whether or not PET/MRI scans can provide
      useful information about hypoxia in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, a recent study at the
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre found varying levels of hypoxia in patients with pancreatic
      tumors, providing a rationale for incorporating hypoxia imaging and patient-specific
      treatment adaptation into the clinical management of pancreatic cancer.
