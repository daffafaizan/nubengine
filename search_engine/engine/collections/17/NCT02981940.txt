      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the
      growth of tumors.

      In laboratory studies, Abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from
      making cells, and slow growth of mice Glioblastoma.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how safe and effect Abemaciclib
      is with the participant type of cancer. In the surgical participants, the investigators are
      looking to see if Abemaciclib reached the brain tumor.
