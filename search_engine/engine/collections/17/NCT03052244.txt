      neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) appears to modulate cortical
      excitability and can reduce pain levels following SCI, however its effects remaining for
      short-term and may not be useful for the rehabilitation progress in these patients.

      Recent findings suggest that M1 stimulation combined with visual illusion (VI) enhances the
      reduction in pain which maintain up to 3 month following treatment. The current study aims to
      reveal whether reduction of neuropathic pain in patients with SCI through tDCS have
      beneficial effect on functional ability during rehabilitation program.

      In the present study the investigators will use anodal stimulation of the M1 via neuroConn DC
      stimulator. Current intensity of 2mA or sham stimulation will be given during 20 min in
      parallel to a visual illusion of walking legs (or neutral video for sham stimuli).
