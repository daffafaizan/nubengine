      patient's maximal functional status following discharge from an acute hospitalization with
      the goal of restoring healthful aging. Approximately 40% of all hospitalized Medicare
      beneficiaries utilize PAC, accounting for 20% of all Medicare expenditures. PAC is a
      fast-growing segment of Medicare, and for some conditions, Medicare spending on PAC nearly
      equals that of the initial hospitalization, with skilled nursing facility (SNF) PAC
      accounting for most of these trends. The quality of SNF PAC is suspect, with substantial
      regional variation, insufficient physical therapy delivery, high readmission rates, poor
      attention to whole-person care, and poor patient experience. Given these concerns, some
      experts have called for national improvement.

      The investigators propose a home-based PAC model that substitutes for treatment in a
      traditional SNF PAC facility. We believe that rehabilitation following hospitalization in
      one's home has several benefits: support tailored to one's actual living circumstances, an
      environment that encourages earlier mobilization, support of and interaction with family and
      caregivers, and psychosocial benefits of being at home. To promote aging in place, the
      investigators plan to deploy an innovative and tailored set of SNF PAC services delivered in
      a patient's home that would allow for discharge from the hospital directly to home, despite
      the need for more intensive rehabilitative care not currently found in the home setting. The
      investigators plan to combine a high-touch and high-tech approach that combines novel uses of
      personnel practicing at the very top of their license (certified nursing assistants, nurses,
      home health aides) with novel uses of technology (virtual physical therapy with
      three-dimensional camera feedback, continuous monitoring, and video visits).
