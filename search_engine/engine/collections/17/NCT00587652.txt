      studies, its superiority in identifying dysplasia in the setting of Barrett's esophagus has
      been inconclusive. In all studies to date dysplastic yield was equivalent or better than
      protocol techniques while requiring fewer biopsies. Variations in study design, staining
      technique and inexperience in staining interpretation are some of the reasons. Our goal is to
      build on the techniques that have been shown to be effective, standardize them for the
      purposes of our study, and to objectively evaluate if MB directed biopsies are useful in
      screening Barrett's patients for dysplasia. At the time of EGD when length of Barrett's is
      determined, patients will be stratified into either intermediate (2-4cm) or long segment
      (>4cm) Barrett's. Short segment Barrett's esophagus patients will not be considered, as MB
      techniques have not proved beneficial in dysplasia detection as previously described 7.
