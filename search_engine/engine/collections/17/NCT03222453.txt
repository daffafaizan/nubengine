    
      1. On a Good Manufacturing Practice(GMP) condition, we establish non-exotic of different
           mutation types of beta-thalassemia -induced pluripotent stem cells（iPS） and make a
           comparisons of the stability and the differentiation of efficiency of these iPS cells
           inducing from different sources with foreign gene integration.

        2. Using the technique of artificial nuclease and in situ repairmen, we establish efficient
           system for different beta-thalassemia mutation site and in view of the security of these
           system.

        3. Establish a repaired beta-thalasemia gene mutated differentiation of iPS technology
           system.

        4. Build a functional gene therapy self-limiting slow viruses, optimizing the preparation
           system and to establish a virus preparation of infection of hematopoietic stem cell
           technology system under the GMP condition.

        5. Establish humanized beta-mice model, evaluate the safety of the iPS cell of gene therapy
           and efficiency before the clinical experiment.

        6. Improve the existing hematopoietic stem cell transplant(HSCT) clinical application
           solutions, detect rate of graft rejection, rate of transplantation and other indicators,
           finish the evaluation of application by clinical cases.
