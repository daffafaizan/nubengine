      asked to enroll in the study. Previous and current medical records will be reviewed to
      systematically catalogue their history of HS, including diagnosis, complications,
      hospitalizations, medications and laboratory data. Health-related quality of life
      questionnaires will be given to the patients and their parents at enrollment and periodically
      during the follow-up. Those who agree will have up to three small samples of blood collected
      and frozen for future laboratory studies of complications associated with HS and/or
      splenectomy.

      We anticipate enrolling approximately 200 children and young adults with HS in this study and
      following them until adulthood (age 18-21 years).
