    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (administered at 8 g or 17 g/day
      for six months) versus placebo on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on aberrant crypt foci (ACF) number and to compare the
      reduction in ACF number between the low dose (8 g PEG 3350/day) and higher dose (17 g PEG
      3350/day) groups.

      II. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on mucosal epithelial proliferation (marker of
      proliferation Ki-67 [Ki-67]).

      III. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on mucosal apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3).

      IV. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAIL) protein
      expression.

      V. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of
      SNAIL and EGFR.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive high-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative orally (PO) once
      daily (QD).

      ARM B: Patients receive low-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative PO QD.

      ARM C: Patients receive placebo (i.e., maltodextrose powder) PO QD.

      In all arms, treatment begins within 6-10 days after colonoscopy and continues for up to 6
      months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
