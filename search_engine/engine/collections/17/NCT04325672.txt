      recently-sick and currently-recovered COVID-19 patients. An open-label, phase 2A clinical
      trial will then be conducted to administer convalescent plasma to twenty individuals with
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 to investigate the novel application of convalescent plasma in
      the treatment strategy of SARS-CoV-2.
