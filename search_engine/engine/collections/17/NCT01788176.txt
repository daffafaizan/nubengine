    
      Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disorder of the extremities that is characterized
      by spontaneous unexplained disproportionate pain, hyperalgesia, swelling, limited range of
      motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization.The incidence
      of CRPS was estimated to be 5.46 per 100,000 person years at risk in Olmsted County,
      Minnesota (US), with a prevalence of 20.57 per 100,000, while its incidence in the general
      population of the Netherlands was estimated to be much higher, at 26.2 per 100,000
      person-years. The adverse effects were not serious and lasted just a few days. The beneficial
      effects of other bisphosphonates have been already documented in several placebo-controlled
      trials; however, there are no reports on the use of zoledronic acid to reduce pain in CRPS
      patients.
