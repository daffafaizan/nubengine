      benign esophageal pathology has been increasingly applied in recent years. Several studies
      have shown promising results with its application in esophageal perforation, fistula, or
      leak, and refractory benign strictures. However, the major limiting factor to successful
      treatment with FCSEMS in this setting is the substantial migration rates.

      Different strategies has been used to secure esophageal stents but to little success. Several
      tertiary institutions including investigators have adopted the use of endostitch (ES) with
      the OverStitchTM system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Texas) as the preferred method for stent
      fixation. Animal ex-vivo studies have confirmed the greater anchoring ability and tensile
      strength with this method when compared to esophageal stenting alone or with through the
      endoscope clip fixation while retrospective series have shown promising results with lower
      rates of stent migration when compared to conventional stent insertion. However, although the
      use of endostitch stent fixation has been used in several centers in the United-States with
      strong retrospective data (including investigators data), no prospective randomized
      controlled trial have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing stent migration.
