      kV cone beam for treatment replanning as compared to standard the treatment planning, to
      determine the need and feasibility of adaptive radiation therapy, to develop concept of
      establishing cumulative DVH (C-DVH) with daily updates and compare it to planned DVH (P-DVH),
      to identify tolerance margins, to evaluate local control, locoregional control, distant
      metastasis, and overall survival, to assess patient quality of life,and to develop predictors
      of patients which may benefit from ART.
