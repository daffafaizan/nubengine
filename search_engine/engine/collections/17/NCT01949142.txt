    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 study
      of OTO-201 administered intraoperatively in pediatric subjects with bilateral middle ear
      effusion requiring TT (tympanostomy tube) placement. One dose level (6 mg) of OTO-201 was
      evaluated relative to sham (empty syringe).

      Study subjects are required to have a clinical diagnosis of bilateral middle ear effusion
      requiring TT placement. On the day of surgery, prior to surgery, eligible subjects were
      examined via otoscope to confirm bilateral middle ear effusion. Subjects with bilateral
      middle ear effusion were randomized to either 6 mg OTO-201 or sham. Subjects without
      bilateral effusion on the day of surgery were not randomized and were considered screen
      failures.

      Approximately 264 subjects are planned to be randomized to OTO-201 or sham using a 2:1
      allocation ratio. Randomization to OTO-201 or sham was stratified by age: 6 months to 2 years
      or >2 years.

      Subjects are to visit the study site for safety assessments and otoscopic examination on Days
      4, 8, 15, and 29. The assessment of otorrhea by the blinded assessor for the primary efficacy
      endpoint occurred on Days 4, 8, and 15.
