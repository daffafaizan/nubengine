    
      We propose a prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial assessing the feasibility and
      safety of a study investigating mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) as an intervention
      in adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We are assessing safety and feasibility of
      this intervention, as well as using neuroimaging (fMRI) to assess improved connections in the
      default mode network. We will also be assessing the impact of this intervention on cognitive
      function and measures of well-being.
