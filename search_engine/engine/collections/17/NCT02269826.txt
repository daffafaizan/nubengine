      Moisturising Cream (VMC) in comparison to Gynomunal® vaginal gel (GVG) in 6 centres in 120
      women who suffered from "vaginal dryness". The main objective criterion was to compare the
      sum of 4 subjective symptoms of "vaginal dryness" measured daily over a period of 28 days.
      VMC should be applied daily, while GVG had to be administered daily during the first week and
      twice weekly thereafter.

      The main objective parameter for efficacy analysis was the sum of the subjective symptoms of
      vaginal dryness (feeling of dryness, itching, burning sensation and pain) before, during
      (patient diaries) and after the 28-day therapy period.

      The per-protocol analysis and of the intent-to-treat analysis should prove non-inferiority of
      VMC compared to GVG, despite a possible carry-over effect to the detriment of VMC. To avoid
      the problem of any possible carry-over effect the analysis of the first period was chosen for
      the primary comparison of both products.

      Furthermore, objective symptoms of vaginal dryness detected via colposcopy, the vaginal
      secretion's pH, the efficacy assessment by the patients and the treating doctor and patients'
      questionnaires with regard to the product characteristics of the medical devices should be
      evaluated.
