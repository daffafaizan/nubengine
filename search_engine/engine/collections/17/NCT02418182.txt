      as oxycodone. However, there exists little data of alternatives to narcotic medications for
      analgesic purposes in oocyte retrieval procedures. A retrospective study published in 2013
      showed potential for NSAID's, specifically ketorolac, to significantly improve pain scores in
      women undergoing oocyte retrieval. It was also shown that the use of these medications did
      not significantly alter pregnancy rate, live birth rate, or miscarriage rate in these
      patients. Few other studies have delved into the question of anesthetics for oocyte
      retrievals except a prospective study in 2006. This study shows that no significant
      difference in pregnancy rates of implantation occurs with the use of acetaminophen and
      diclofenac vs. acetaminophen alone if given post-operatively. However, pain was not measured
      in this study for either group. Therefore, it is clear that there exists limited data on the
      subject of analgesics used in oocyte retrievals for in vitro fertilization and that more
      exploration into alternative medications is required to find the most effective and least
      harmful option.
