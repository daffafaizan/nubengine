      measurement-based depression care into a specialty clinic setting and extend the concept to
      treat depression and/or anxiety. The neurologist/APP-administered medication intervention
      utilizes FDA-approved drugs with advantageous features for use in epilepsy (escitalopram and
      venlafaxine) and a telephone-based chronic care management plan for repeated symptom
      measurement and side effect surveillance. The proposed intervention may overcome barriers to
      implementing mental health treatment interventions in generalized clinical settings by using
      healthcare providers commonly present in specialty clinics (physicians and APPs) along with a
      billable, best practices chronic care management intervention package. To test this idea, the
      study team seeks to pilot a feasibility trial of an epileptologist-driven medication
      treatment intervention for anxiety and depression, carried out directly in the epilepsy
      clinic during a regularly scheduled visit and supported by advanced practice provider (APP),
      using epilepsy as a paradigm for chronic medical illness with high prevalence of psychiatric
      comorbidity. In this limited, intervention only pre-piloting trial, the team will streamline
      recruitment, intervention, and outcome assessment procedures to prepare for a randomized,
      controlled pilot of the intervention.
