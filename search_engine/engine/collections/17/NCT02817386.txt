      patients.It has been shown that postoperative delirium has independent adverse effects on
      short and long-term mortality and morbidity, including poor functional recovery,
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction, deterioration in quality of life, and increased costs.
      However, at the present time, postoperative delirium is a clinical phenomenon, and its
      neuropathogenesis remains unknown. This gap in knowledge has become a barrier that limits
      further studies, including the development of potential interventions for postoperative
      delirium.
