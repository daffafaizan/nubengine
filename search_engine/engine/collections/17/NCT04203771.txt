      parallel-group study to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation during 1 week after
      surgery reduced post-surgery complications compared to placebo.

      Healthy subjects of both genders aged between 14 and 25 years who required the surgical
      removal of both mandibular 3rd molars were recruited from the department of Oral and
      Maxillofacial Surgery at the Foundation of Hospital de Nens de Barcelona (Children's Hospital
      of Barcelona).

      Patients were randomly assigned to receive probiotic tablets containing a mixture of L.
      plantarum KABP-051 (CECT7481) and L. brevis KABP-052 (CECT7480) or to receive placebo, twice
      a day for 7 days post surgery.

      Patients were assessed by trained specialists for surgery-derived complications (fever, oral
      alveolitis, alveolar osteitis, trismus) in a follow-up visit 7 days after surgery. Patients
      also provided daily evaluations for pain, swelling and eating difficulties in a patient
      diary.
