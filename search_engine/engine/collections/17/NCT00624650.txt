      therapy designed to improve outcome in patients with acute lung injury (ALI). The
      investigators are comparing two algorithmic approaches in managing patients with ALI - one,
      the control arm, attempts to reduce the amount of fluid in the lung in patients with ALI by
      diuresis based on central venous pressure and urine output, the other the treatment arm
      attempting to reduce lung water by directing therapy to measured lung water and using more
      sensitive indicators of preload status than CVP. The protocol uses measured extravascular
      lung water (EVLW) to direct diuresis and appropriate fluid restriction in a goal directed
      fashion in order to lower EVLW towards the normal range.
