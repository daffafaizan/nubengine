      cavity, lifting the endometrial mucosa, and are a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding,
      dysmenorrhea, early miscarriage and they may be a cause of infertility.

      Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the surgical procedure of choice for the treatment of submucosal
      myomas, because it is minimally invasive and has the advantage of preserving the integrity of
      the uterine wall.

      The characteristics of the myomas (size, number and location) enables the surgeon to choose
      the surgical approach that will provide the best outcome for the patient, and may predict the
      chances of a complete hysteroscopic resection of myomas in one procedure.
