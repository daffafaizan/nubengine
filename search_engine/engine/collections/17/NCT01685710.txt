      access to their vascular system for dialysis. Arteriovenous fistulas (surgically created
      connections between the artery and vein) are critical for the majority of patients. Not all
      the fistulas that are created work, a proportion fail early on and need to be revised or an
      alternative fistula created. A recent multicentre study demonstrated a 40% primary failure
      rate(1). In an attempt to increase the numbers of fistulae that reach maturation sufficient
      for dialysis access cannulation some renal centres apply GTN patches to the fistula at the
      time of surgery. It is thought that this works by increasing the size of the blood vessels
      and promoting blood flow through them and some preliminary work seems to support this(2).

      The evidence for the use of GTN patches in arteriovenous fistula creation is theoretical or
      based on preliminary work rather than robust evidence. Similarly no evidence exists within
      the literature to determine the safety and definite efficacy of this procedure in this
      population. We propose to conduct a double-blinded randomised control trial to answer the
      study question: does the application of a GTN patch increase the venous outflow diameter post
      fistula formation and does this result in improved fistula patency.
