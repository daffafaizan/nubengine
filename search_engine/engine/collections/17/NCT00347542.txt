      prevalence of diabetes, to the concentration of glucose , insulin resistance and metabolic
      syndrome.These results have been replicated in patients at risk for diabetes with
      documentation of impairment in insulin secretion in Vitamin D deficient subjects. Therefore,
      vitamin D could be implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, by affecting either
      insulin sensitivity or ÃŸ cell function, or both. However, there is paucity of literature on
      the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance or glucose metabolism. As
      vitamin D has been reported to be associated with lipid levels, CRP and blood pressure , we
      will also be measuring the changes in these variables.
