      opportunity" is present. During this "window of opportunity" an intervention with little or
      no toxicity and the potential for extending the "symptom-free" period would be of great value
      to keep metastatic patients in an asymptomatic stage and thus delay the introduction of
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABR-215050
      as an interventional agent for this role.

      Overall survival for patients participating in study 07TASQ08 will be evaluated
      retrospectively using a separate study protocol 11TASQ11.
