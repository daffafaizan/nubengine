      challenge. Currently, drug-eluting stents are widely used in the management of these
      patients. Recently, the value of the paclitaxel-eluting balloon in this clinical setting has
      been suggested. However, there is only scarce observational data on the value of this new
      balloon in patients with bare metal stent restenosis.

      This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial will compare two different
      interventional strategies (namely, paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs everolimus-eluting stent) in
      the treatment of patients with bare metal stent restenosis.
