      take 1500mg (six 250mg tablets) of lapatinib once daily. Subjects must fast 1 hour prior to
      and 1 hour following dosing. If a subject is unable to swallow lapatinib tablets whole, the
      lapatinib may be crushed with a mortar and pestle to form a powder, and mix it in 4 oz (120
      ml) of water to take by mouth or through a feeding tube. Then the subject will then rinse the
      mortar with 2 oz (60ml) of water to suspend the left-over powder, and then swallow the rinse
      or flush it down the feeding tube. You will have to repeat this rinse one more time.

      Subjects will have a "MUGA" scan done at the very beginning to make sure that heart function
      is good. It will then be repeated every other month while on treatment. When the subjects
      have a MUGA scan, 3 cc's (less than one teaspoon) of blood will be drawn from your vein, and
      labeled with a radioactive substance. Then, subjects blood will be injected back into his/her
      arm through a catheter in your vein. The level of radiation you will be exposed to is very
      minimal. Then, a camera will take a "movie" of your heart. The entire procedure lasts about
      90 minutes.
