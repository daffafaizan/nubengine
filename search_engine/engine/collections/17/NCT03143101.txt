      to less than (<) 48 months of age. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive two doses of either FluMist quadrivalent 2017-2018, FluMist quadrivalent 2015-2016
      formulation, or FluMist trivalent 2015-2016 formulation.

      Participants will be screened within 30 days prior to randomization. Randomization will be
      stratified according to whether the participant ever received prior influenza vaccination.
      Approximately 50% of the participants will not have been previously vaccinated. All
      participants will receive two doses of investigational product on Study Days 1 and 28, and
      followed for a 28-day follow-up period after each dose. Blood and nasal samples will be
      collected and safety evaluations perfomed.

      The duration of participants participation is approximately 2 to 3 months. The study will be
      conducted during the influenza "off-season" in the US. After completion of the study all
      participants will be offered and strongly encouraged to receive an inactivated influenza
      vaccine approved for use in the US for the 2017-2018 influenza season.
