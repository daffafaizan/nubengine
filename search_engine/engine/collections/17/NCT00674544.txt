      randomized controlled trial including a total of 40 kindergarten classes in the French
      (canton Vaud) and in the German (canton St. Gallen) speaking part of Switzerland. Health
      promoters, trained in physical education, will receive further postgraduate training (in
      nutrition, education, psychology) and will then in reward teach several kindergarten teachers
      hands-on. These trained health promoters will intervene on the level of the kindergarten
      teacher, the parents, the local community and also on the level of the children following a
      professional pre-specified curriculum in the kindergarten that focuses primarily on physical
      activity, healthy nutrition, media use and sleep duration. The curriculum also includes
      information evenings, workshops and fun weekly homework packages. Special attention will be
      paid to establish a curriculum that reaches also socio-cultural high risk groups living in
      Switzerland. Measurements will be performed before and after the intervention.
