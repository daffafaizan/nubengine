      Process Decompression® (IPD) system implantation and conventional laminectomy in subjects
      requiring surgical intervention due to symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and a
      confirmed diagnosis on MRI, X-ray or CT. Patients with LSS meeting entry criteria will be
      randomized to either X-STOP® IPD or laminectomy treatment. Patients will remain blinded to
      the procedure received. The primary study outcome is group differences in the Zurich
      Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) at 12 months post-operative. In addition, each subject will
      undergo follow-up assessment at 2 weeks and 2, 12 and 24 months post-operative. The secondary
      objective is to compare safety profiles and the radiographic outcomes between groups using
      pre- and post-operative MRI and flexion/extension X-rays, to measure changes in canal and
      neuroforaminal cross sectional areas and spinal stability, respectively.
