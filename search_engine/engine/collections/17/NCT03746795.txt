      increased dead space, flow resistance, and change the respiratory pattern. All of these
      negative features and reduced patient co-operation affect the measured results and their
      interpretation. The aim of this study is to test spirometry measurement using EIT and
      evaluate such spirometry parameters as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume
      exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration (FEV1) and ratio of FEV1/FVC called
      Tiffeneau index (TI) based on recalculation using the calibration constant. The study will be
      conducted using Ergostik (Geratherm, Germany) spirometer and EIT system Pulmovista 500
      (Dr√§ger, Germany).
