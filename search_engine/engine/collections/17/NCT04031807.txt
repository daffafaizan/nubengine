      assessment included medical history and urogynecological examination. Patients were asked to
      answer validated questionnaires such as Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and Incontinence
      Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7). Objective cure of SUI was defined as the absence of
      demonstrable leakage of urine on the cough stress test. Subjective cure was based on negative
      response to UDI-6, question 3. Patients were divided according to objective cure rate into
      two groups: cured (Group A) and failed patients (Group B).
