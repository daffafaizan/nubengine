      cared for at the diabetic ward at Södersjukhuset will be asked to participate, n= 55.

      All pregnancies complicated with type 1 diabetes that are being cared for at the special
      maternity ward at Södersjukhuset, n=45.

      The expected to include is 100. Expected viable pregnancies: 50.

      The maternal vaginal, fecal and oral microbiome will be sampled by "self-sampling" at home
      before, during and after the pregnancy, by this schedule:

        1. Inclusion, before pregnancy after an appointment with the diabetic doctor or nurse. Or
           at the first visit at the special maternity care ward during pregnancy (around
           gestational week 8).

        2. When the pregnancy is first discovered if the inclusion were before pregnancy.

        3. Week 28.

        4. When attending delivery ward in labor

        5. 6-10 weeks postpartum from both the mother and the new-born. The tests will be sent to
           the obstetric research center at Södersjukhuset, where the tests will be saved in
           freezes. The analysis will be performed at CTMR at the Karolinska Institute.

      Background, pregnancy and delivery data will then be associated with the woman microbiome in
      the vagina, in feces and in saliva.
