      liver using 1H MRS. The accuracy of the method will be assessed from intra and
      inter-volunteer measurements. 1H MRS measurements will be performed with the Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3 Tesla system of the Hospital, twice for each volunteer.

      Prior to the measurements, volunteers will have a protein rich breakfast at home and a
      protein rich lunch at the Clinical Investigation Center.
