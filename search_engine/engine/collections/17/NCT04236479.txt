    
      This study is a prospective, open-label, single-center, safety and feasibility phase 1 trial
      of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) delivery though
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using a homogeneous population of infants with congenital heart
      disease (CHD) who will be undergoing a two-ventricle repair within the first six months of
      life. The dose-escalation methods with a modified continual reassessment at the five dose
      levels (1x10^6, 10x10^6, 20x10^6, 40x10^6, 80x10^6, cells/kg) will be performed to determine
      safety and feasibility of allogeneic BM-MSC infusion during pediatric cardiac surgery and the
      maximum tolerated dose in infants with CHD. In addition to the primary objective of assessing
      the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC delivery through CPB, our secondary objectives are
      designed to develop biological signature measures and clinical outcome measures feasible for
      use in larger efficacy and effectiveness trials with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental
      outcome and early postoperative course after BM-MSC treatment. We will determine actual
      magnitude of differences in neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental variables and postoperative
      inflammatory and pathophysiological variables after BM-MSC delivery in infants with CHD.
      Enrollment, follow-up, and analysis are planned to occur over 36 months for the treatment and
      initial follow-up portions of the study. Long-term follow-up until 18 months of age will be
      subsequently reported.
