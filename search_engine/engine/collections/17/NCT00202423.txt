      randomly assigned to two counterbalanced groups starting either with Sativex or with placebo
      as the first drug. They will be dispensed sufficient study medication for two weeks together
      with a diary. During the two-week treatment period all the patients will have to be reached
      the optimal, individualised dosage to subjectively relief spasticity.Patient will return
      after three weeks and they will undergo the fMRI and neurophysiological evaluations.Then
      patients will perform a two-week washout period and they will be requested to intake the
      alternative medicine. After two weeks patients will perform a second fMRI/neurophysiological
      study. Two weeks later, after a second washout period, a last visit will be performed to
      conclude the study.
