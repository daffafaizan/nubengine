      approximately 30 million people in the United States. New low-cost and accessible treatments
      for PTSD are desperately needed. Threat-related attention biases represent an important
      potential treatment target for PTSD. Such attention biases predict risk for PTSD following
      trauma exposure, and are thought to maintain symptoms of PTSD and other anxiety disorders.
      Research indicates that specific forms of computerized attention bias modification (ABM) are
      effective in reducing attention bias for threat as well as anxiety in patients with diverse
      anxiety disorders. The investigators have developed a mobile "app" called RePS (Resolving
      Psychological Stress) to administer threat-related ABM to patients with PTSD and Alcohol Use
      Disorder and have tested it in a laboratory-based pilot study of 19 people with PTSD.
      Preliminary data indicate that the app is highly acceptable to patients and that use of the
      app reduces attention bias for threat and PTSD symptom severity. The study aims are to
      examine the feasibility, acceptability and usability of app-based ABM; and determine the
      efficacy of app-based ABM in reducing attention bias and PTSD severity.
