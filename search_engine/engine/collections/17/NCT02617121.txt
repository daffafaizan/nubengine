      occurrence after general anesthesia. And laparoscopic gynecological surgery is associated
      with a high incidence of PONV. Several antiemetic agents such as dopaminergic, histaminic and
      5-HT3 antagonist (including ondansetron, ramosetron, granisetron) have been used to prevent
      PONV. Gabapentin, anti-convulsant, has been shown to decrease PONV, as well as chemotherapy
      induced nausea and vomiting in recent studies, although the exact mechanism against PONV is
      not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of gabapentin and ramosetron
      in preventing PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery.
