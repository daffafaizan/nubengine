      flipping a coin", to assign the patient and caregiver to one of two research study groups.
      The patient and the partnered caregiver will join the same group. The group will either
      receive: 1) three in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may
      experience and a mobile application that will send surveys to the caregiver in order to rate
      the presence, severity and stress caused by these symptoms and behaviors; or 2) three
      in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may experience and no mobile
      application. The outcomes of these surveys and assessments will then be shared with the
      patient's clinical team.

      If the caregiver is assigned to the group that receives the mobile application they will
      receive the surveys either weekly or monthly. After each month of completing the surveys, the
      frequency will change. Depending on feedback from the first 10 participants, the
      investigators may modify the survey rate to happen more than weekly.
