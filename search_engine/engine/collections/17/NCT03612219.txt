      Ⅰ.To determine if adjuvant apatinib after IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy is better to only
      obeservation after IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy for progression-free survival in
      High-risk metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Ⅰ.To explore the adjuvant medication regimen of local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma after
      IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy.

      Ⅱ.Provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence for the new individualized treatment
      strategy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms.

      ARM 1: treat with apatinib(the dose was 250 mg,orally,qd,28 days for an observation
      period,Six cycles) for adjuvant treatment of local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma after
      IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy.

      ARM 2:only obeservation after IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy. IMRT: GTVnx 69.69Gy, GTVnd
      60-68Gy, PTV1 59.4Gy and PTV2 54Gy in 33 fractions, 5 days/week.

      Concurrent chemotherapy:Cisplatin 80mg/m2(D1-3), 3-week chemotherapy for 3 cycles.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
