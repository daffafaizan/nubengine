    
      This single arm, open-label phase II study is designed with the primary objective of
      evaluating the efficacy of induction therapy comprised of 4 cycles of carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone and elotuzumab (KRd+elotuzumab) in terms of very good partial
      response or better (VGPR+) in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory MM, and comparing to
      relevant historical controls. Post induction, all subjects will undergo disease evaluation
      for assessment of the primary endpoint. Maintenance therapy comprised of elotuzumab and
      lenalidomide (R+elotuzumab) will start directly after induction and continue until relapse or
      progression.
