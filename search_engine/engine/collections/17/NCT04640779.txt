      I. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of choline salicylate (CS) that can be
      combined with selinexor twice weekly in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B
      cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the response (overall response rate [ORR], clinical benefit rate [CBR] and
      duration of response [DOR]) of selinexor and CS in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or
      MCL.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if CRM1 expression in malignant lymphoma cells from patients treated on this
      study have a predictive role.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice a week (BIW) on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, 17, 22,
      and 24, and choline salicylate PO three times daily (TID) on days 1-28. Patients undergoing
      pharmacokinetic analysis receive choline salicylate beginning on day 3 of cycle 1 (D3C1) and
      beginning on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patents who achieve >= stable
      disease continue treatment for an additional 6 cycles (maximum of 12 cycles) at the
      discretion of the treating physician and patient.
