      on cardiovascular health.

      Part one: Subjects will give a blood sample which will be processed and analyzed. Flow
      mediated dilation (FMD) and Pulse wave velocity (PWV/PWA) will be performed at baseline and 2
      hours following either a single dose oral antioxidant cocktail (1000 mg of Vitamin C, 600 IU
      of Vitamin E, and 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid) or placebo on two days separated by at least
      72 hours. Nitroglycerin mediated dilation (NMD, 0.4mg sub-lingual nitroglycerin spray), will
      be assessed at baseline.

      Part two: Subjects, if interested will undergo a subcutaneous gluteal/hip fat biopsy. Micro
      vessels will be isolated from the adipose tissue and analyzed by pressurized myography for
      endothelial function and nitric oxide bioavailability.
