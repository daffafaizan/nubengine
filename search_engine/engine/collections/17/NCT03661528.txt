    
      This is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial designed to determine the efficacy and
      safety of andexanet compared to usual care in patients presenting with acute intracranial
      hemorrhage within 6 hours of symptom onset and within 15 hours of taking an oral factor Xa
      inhibitor. The study will use a prospective, randomized, open label (PROBE) design. The
      primary efficacy outcome will be adjudicated by a blinded Endpoint Adjudication Committee. To
      support the adjudication of hemostatic efficacy, a blinded Imaging Core Laboratory will
      review all available scans. Approximately 900 patients are planned to be enrolled in the
      study.
