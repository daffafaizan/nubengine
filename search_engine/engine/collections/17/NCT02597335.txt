      mutated gliomas. It will evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of D-2HG detection by Brain
      Spectro MRI. This approach will be coupled with mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA
      and D-2HG dosage in urine samples.

      The primary end-point is the quantification of D-2HG by spectro-MRI, and the correlation with
      the dosage of D-2HG in the tumor fragment, and the mutational status (group 1: 25 patients).

      The secondary endpoints include:

        1. longitudinal analysis Spectro-MRI overtime (12 months) correlation with radiological
           evolution and the response to treatment (group 2: 15 patients)

        2. Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation induced changes

        3. Confrontation of Spectro-MRI, D-2HG dosages and IDH mutation detection from plasma DNA,
           and elaboration of a combined score of prediction
