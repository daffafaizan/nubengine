      descriptor, disregarding the type of cancer. It is also a predictive descriptor for
      treatment-related toxicity. Therefore it appears crucial to save muscle mass of patients,
      following an adequate physical training together with a personalised diet program. The latter
      point is of major importance as malnutrition concerns 45% patients having head and neck
      cancer cancer, who stop physical activity due to extreme tiredness and decrease of quality of
      life. In the present project, we plan a physical activity program that would be adapted to
      each patient, accompanied by the rethought diet over a 3-month period. The adapted physical
      activity (APA) is constituted of two aerobic stages and one resistance training stage per a
      week. The evaluation will then proceed at three different moments, namely (i) at T0 i.e.,
      beginning of the program, (ii) at 3 months i.e., when the program will be stopped, and (iii)
      at 6 months i.e., three months after the program stop. This evaluation will include the
      success rate, the level of satisfaction, the physiological parameters (VO2max, muscle mass
      and strength, BMI) and quality of life.
