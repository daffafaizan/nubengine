      mature cells typical of several tissues, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro
      experiments. There have been few clinical reports describing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
      cells for treatment of Hepatic Cirrhosis.

      To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for Hepatic Cirrhosis, 20 patients with
      Hepatic Cirrhosis will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.
