      incidence of post partum infectious morbidities without increasing the risks to the baby from
      the exposure to the antibiotics. Our investigation will validate these findings in a larger
      series of patients. We will be conducting a prospective controlled randomized trial that will
      compare both methods of antibiotic prophylaxis. All patients undergoing cesarean delivery
      will be eligible except for the patients with the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis. One group
      will receive Cefazolin 1gm intravenous + Azithromycin 500mg intravenous 30-60 minutes prior
      to incision. The second group will receive the same antibiotics immediately after cord clamp.
      The primary outcomes will be endometritis, wound infection, neonatal sepsis evaluations,
      proven cases of neonatal infection. Secondary outcomes will be patients that required post
      procedure antibiotics, the duration of treatment for mother and neonate and the pattern of
      antibiotic resistance in microorganisms isolated and characteristics of the neonatal bowel
      flora.
