      I. Evaluate the efficacy of combining RICE (rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide
      regimen [R-ICE regimen]), G-CSF, and plerixafor to collect autologous peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients by: the number of days of apheresis
      required to reach >= 5 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34 cells/kg and by the total
      number of CD34 cells/kg collected in a maximum of 4 days if >= 5 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg is not
      obtained.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1, etoposide IV on days 2-4, carboplatin
      IV on day 3, and ifosfamide IV on day 3 over 24 hours. Patients also receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until apheresis is completed
      and plerixafor SC once daily for up to 4 days beginning 24 hours after recovery from nadir
      and continuing until apheresis is completed. Patients may undergo up to 4 apheresis
      procedures until the optimal number of CD34+ cells are collected.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then
      periodically for up to 12 months.
