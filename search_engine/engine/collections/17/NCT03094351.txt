    
      Objective: This study aims to compare the oncological outcomes between robot-assisted
      esophagectomy and minimally invasive conventional thoracoscopic esophagectomy.

      Study design: Randomized controlled parallel-group superiority trial Study population:
      Patients (age >= 18 and <= 75 years) with histologically proven surgically resectable
      (cT1b-3, N0-2, M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus with European
      Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2.

      Intervention: 360 patients will be randomly allocated to either A) robot-assisted
      esophagectomy (n=180) or B) conventional thoracoscopic esophagectomy (n=180).

      Patients will receive the following interventions:

      Group A. robot assisted esophagectomy, with gastric conduit formation. Group B. conventional
      thoracoscopic esophagectomy, with gastric conduit formation.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is 5-year overall survival rate.

      Secondary outcomes are 5-year disease free survival, 3-year overall survival rate, 3-year
      disease free survival, (in hospital) mortality within 30 and 60 days, R0 resections,
      operation related events, postoperative recovery, lymph nodes status, quality of life.

      Follow-up: 60 months after discharge of the last randomized patient.
