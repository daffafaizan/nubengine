    
      Necrotizing enterocolitis(NEC) is characterized by vomit, abdominal distention, hypoactive
      bowel sounds and bloody stools, even shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) and
      sepsis. X-ray is shown Intestinal wall gas and/or portal vein pneumatosis and
      pneumoperitoneum.

      Two and more grades of NEC in newborn infant is a urgent condition, and whether or not
      operation is difficult to predict.

      Here, the investigators develop a score system including five parameters(abdominal
      circumference, base excess, heart rate, severities of respiratory distress, sepsis) in one
      retrospective cohort, and the score system is used and assessed to predict the need for
      surgery in another prospective cohort.
