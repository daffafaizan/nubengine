      recruitment for study A2171030 was placed on hold. Nektar, the company from which Pfizer
      licensed Exubera, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new
      marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of Exubera. As a
      result, study A2171030 was terminated on June 17, 2008. Neither safety nor efficacy reasons
      were the cause of the study termination.
