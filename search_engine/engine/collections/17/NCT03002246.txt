      this estimation is not always similar to what the baby actually weighs. In addition to the
      regular measurements taken at routine ultrasound exams, 3D ultrasound of the baby's arm and
      leg soft tissue may give us more precise information on how much the baby weighs. This
      measurement is called fractional limb volume. Fractional limb volume (FLV) is a soft tissue
      measurement of the arm or thigh that can be used to evaluate body composition. This
      measurement mostly reflects the fat and muscle development with a small amount of bone.

      The recent introduction of 5D Limb Volume software (Samsung, Seoul, Korea) now makes it
      possible to efficiently and reproducibly measure semi-automated FLV using a computer guided
      technique.

      Subjects will receive one ultrasound scan 4-7 days before their delivery. Both 2D and 3D
      measurements will be taken. These measurements will then be used to estimate fetal weight. We
      will compare estimated weight to actual birth weight in order to determine the accuracy and
      precision of the 5D Limb Volume technology. This data may also be used to develop new weight
      estimation models that could provide better accuracy and/or precision than what is currently
      provided using published methods.
