      of breast cancer. A modest but significant correlation was reported between tumor grading and
      FDG uptake. Few studies reported a positive correlation between SUV and the Ki-67 labeling
      index of malignant breast tumors. Others have correlated p53 expression in breast cancer and
      FDG uptake. F18-Fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (FLT) has been developed as a PET marker for
      cellular proliferation has been developed for imaging cell proliferation and findings
      correlate strongly with the Ki-67 labeling index in breast cancer. A 10-minute FLT-PET scan
      acquired two weeks after the end of the first course of chemotherapy, has been shown in two
      recent studies to be useful for predicting longer-term efficacy of chemotherapy regimens for
      women with breast cancer.

      In the current study FDG and FLT uptake and their ratios will be correlated with the risk
      score results of the Oncotype gene-expression assay in patients with clinically negative
      nodal disease planned for surgical removal of the tumor. It is our hypothesis that since high
      uptake of these tracers implies aggressive behavior and rapid tumor growth, it might well be
      that patients with high risk score on Oncotype will have high uptake of the PET tracers and
      those with low risk score will show low-intensity uptake values. If this will be the case, it
      might well be that in patients with non-conclusive oncotype results (intermediate score) FDG
      and FLT uptake measurement will allow further dichotomy to 1. Patients with intermediate
      score on Oncotype and high uptake of the PET tracers, suggestive of aggressive behavior and
      2. Patients with intermediate score on Oncotype and low uptake of the PET tracers suggesting
      a less aggressive behavior.
