      types of epilepsy, some common, some rare. Most epilepsies arise in childhood and have a
      genetic cause. Approximately 40% of patients have the common forms of Genetic Generalised
      Epilepsy (GGE), and the commonest GGE is "Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy" or JME.

      The goal of this study is to find the genetic cause for JME. The investigators will do this
      by comparing the genetic code in JME patients with that in people who do not have epilepsy.
      This study will use clues from their electroencephalograph or brainwave test that is used to
      help diagnose epilepsy. Participants will provide a single blood sample, along with
      permission to collect clinical data about their diagnosis and a copy of their clinical EEG.
      There is no direct benefit or risk to the research participants but the results from this
      study may help other people with epilepsy or brain impairments in the future.

      There is overwhelming evidence that JME is caused by changes in genetic code. These changes
      are likely to be found in more than just one gene and there may be more than one type of
      change. In order to find these changes, this study will look at a large number of people with
      JME and compare their genetic code with people who do not have epilepsy. Finding the causes
      of JME will lead to better understanding of its cause, new treatments, and tailoring of
      treatments according to a person's genetic make-up.
