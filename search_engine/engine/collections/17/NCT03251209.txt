      task. 4) Physical Practice: reproduce through the motor execution, the activities assisted in
      the video (5 minutes / task). The MP protocol 2 was the same, changing the order: first
      physical practice and after MP. For the protocol 3 without PM, step 3 was suppressed,
      remaining the remaining steps. There were 15 sessions, 2x / week, for 1 hour. The Fugl-Meyer
      (FM) Scales, Ashworth Modified Scale (EMA), Functional Independence Measurement (MIF), Action
