    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), parallel-arm (each group
      of participants will be treated at the same time), open-label (all people know the identity
      of the intervention), multicenter study. The study consists of screening phase of 21 days,
      treatment phase of 15 days, follow-up phase of 28 days. Approximately 110 participants
      undergoing elective major abdominal and/or pelvic surgery will be enrolled. During the
      Treatment Phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned (participants are assigned
      to a treatment group based on chance) in a 1:1 ratio to either PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) or the
      Standard of Care (SOC) group that will not receive any erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
      (ESAs). Participants will undergo surgery during the Treatment Phase. After surgery, all
      participants will stay in the study for 4 days (or until hospital discharge) and followed for
      an additional 28 days (Follow-up Phase). Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of the study for each
      participant will be approximately 64 days.
