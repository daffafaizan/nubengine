      quantitative assessment of the patient's pain. And shoulder pain and disability index-SPADI
      was used to objectively assess the functional changes of acupuncture treatment in patients
      with chronic shoulder pain. Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale - MASS
      was used to get objectively record of de-qi when needle manipulation for the the body
      (acupoints) reactions. Acusensor2 was used to get objective observation reaction during
      needling manipulation, the sensor provided measurement parameters such as the lift and
      thrust, twisting, strength and torque during needle manipulation. Investigators will study
      and analysis associated clinical outcome with needling process, the needle manipulation by
      lifting-thrusting or twisting-rotating during the process of reinforce method or reducing
      method to study its dynamics and kinematics.
