      during two years. The patients will be divided into 3 groups with different severity. Each
      group will be less compromised than the group that went before them. Their breathing
      measurements must be at least 60%. Subjects will receive injections of the human foetal
      neural stem cells into the spinal cord. A variety of tests and examinations will take place
      every month for the first year and every three months for the next two in order to monitor
      the course of the disease and the adverse events.
