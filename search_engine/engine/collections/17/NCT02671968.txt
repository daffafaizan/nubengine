    
      In a randomized controlled trial the primary hypothesis is tested if the usage of RT-CGM in
      the intervention group (CGM group) reduces the frequency of glucose values <55 mg/dl in
      patients with hypoglycemia problems (hypoglycemia unawareness or documented previous severe
      hypoglycemia) significantly more than in the control group receiving usual care (without
      CGM).

      Secondary is tested if patients in the CGM group showed a significantly more favorable change
      in the below defined secondary endpoint than patients in the control group after 26 weeks
      follow up.
