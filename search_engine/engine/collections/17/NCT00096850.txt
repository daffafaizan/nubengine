      risk for TB infection. The antituberculous drug RIF lowers plasma concentrations of PIs by
      increasing the activity of enzymes responsible for PI breakdown. RIF has been shown to reduce
      PI effectiveness, a particular concern for HIV infected patients who are also being treated
      for TB. RTV has been shown to delay the plasma clearance of ATV and increase the plasma
      half-life of ATV. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      interactions of RTV-boosted ATV, taken concurrently with RIF in HIV uninfected people.

      Medical and medication history, a complete physical exam, blood collection, and an
      electrocardiogram (ECG) will occur at screening. Participants will be enrolled in this study
      for 41 to 58 days; there will be 3 dosing periods. From Days 1 to 8, participants will
      receive 600 mg RIF every 24 hours. From Days 9 to 19, participants will receive 300 mg ATV
      and 100 mg RTV every 12 hours and 600 mg RIF every 24 hours. From Days 20 to 27, participants
      will receive 400 mg ATV and 100 mg RTV every 12 hours and 600 mg RIF every 24 hours. Study
      visits will occur at entry; at Days 5, 8, 11, 14, 19, 23, and 27; and at an additional visit
      between Days 41 and 48. Blood and urine collection will occur at all visits. A targeted
      physical exam, an ECG, and blood collection for PK analysis will occur at Days 8, 19, and 27.
