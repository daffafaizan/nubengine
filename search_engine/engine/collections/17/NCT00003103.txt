      administered alone or in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors
      expressing the bcl-2 oncogene. II. Determine the plasma concentration profiles, maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), and/or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of this treatment regimen in these
      patients. III. Determine the antitumor effects of G3139, at the MTD or OBD, in combination
      with docetaxel in patients with androgen-independent, refractory, or recurrent prostate
      cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oblimersen (G3139). Phase I: Patients receive
      G3139 IV on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of G3139 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive G3139 continuously over 21 days
      at one dose level below the MTD in combination with weekly docetaxel. Patients receive up to
      2 more courses of therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 57 patients (42 for phase I and 15 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
