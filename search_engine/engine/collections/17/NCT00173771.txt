      years.

      In the first year (an ongoing project: NSC 93-2314-B-002-284), we had established a CADL item
      bank of 50 items. The investigators will administer the 50 items on 300 patients with stroke
      living in the community. Then we will select 10 to 15 items from the item bank for the CADL
      scale based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF),
      the opinions of an expert panel, and Rasch analysis. It is anticipated that the CADL scale
      will have unidimensionality, an interval level of measurement, soundly psychometric
      characteristics, a reduced number of items, and ease of administration.

      In the second and third years, we will compare the psychometric properties of the CADL scale
      and the combined BI and FAI scale. The psychometric properties investigated will include
      reliability (e.g. inter-rater reliability, intra-rater reliability, and internal
      consistency), validity (e.g. concurrent validity, convergent validity, predictive validity
      and discriminant validity), and responsiveness. A total of 150 patients will be recruited.
      Both the CADL scale and the combined BI and FAI scale will be used on patients from the
      initial stage (within one month) to six months after hospital discharge. The results will be
      useful for researchers and clinicians to determine whether the CADL scale is better than the
      combined BI and FAI scale in stroke patients.
