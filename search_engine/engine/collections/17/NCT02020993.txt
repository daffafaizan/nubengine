      high level of intensive care. On the other hand, some minor difficulties in respiration can
      resolve within hours. Therefore, there is a need for a biochemical marker in addition to
      clinical condition which will help the physician to understand the clinical progress of the
      disease.

      Serum NT-ProBNP level has been evaluated in transient tachypnea of newborn and found
      compatible with the clinical progress. Urine NT-proBNP has recently been evaluated in patent
      ductus arterioses and found compatible with the cardiac progress. However, urine Nt-proBNP,
      which does not need any blood sampling and can be collected easily, has not been evaluated
      for respiratory distress in newborn.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the prognostic value of urine NT-proBNP in respiratory
      diseases in newborns by a controlled trial.
