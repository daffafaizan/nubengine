      Impedance Tomography (EIT) measurements whereby, evaluable data of 10 patients are needed, of
      about 1-2 minutes are performed directly before, directly after and 10, 30, and 60 minutes
      after bronchoscopy parallel to the following routine measurements: tidal volume, resistance,
      compliance, heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 and blood gas values. Prior to the examination a
      rubber belt with 16 integrated electrocardiographic electrodes is placed around the thorax
      connected with an EIT- device. EIT data are generated by application of a small alternating
      current of 5mA and 50kHz and are stored and analyzed offline on a personal computer. The EIT
      provides a mapping of the distribution of the lung´s electrical impedance and exhibits a far
      temporal resolution of up to 40 tomograms per second. Because of electrical impedance of the
      pulmonal tissue is dependant to the air content, the air distribution within the lung over a
      certain period can be monitored. Analyzing the EIT- data it might be possible to explain the
      distribution in regional ventilation and how the ventilation could be optimized right after
      the bronchoscopy to optimize the patient´s treatment.
