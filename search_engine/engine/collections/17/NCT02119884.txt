      Prevention of bleeding events, including primary and secondary prophylaxis, is very important
      for reducing the mortality of variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and octreotide can effectively
      control bleeding with few side effects, which has been recommended by Baveno V in treatment
      of acute variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and high dose octreotide will be administered to the
      patients with cirrhosis related esophageal varices when they undergo hepatic venous pressure
      gradient measurement. Changes from portal and systemic hemodynamics will be observed to
      evaluate the safety and effects of terlipressin and high dose octreotide as well as to
      determine wether patients respond to them. The results can be served as clinical evidence for
      preventing re-bleeding through long-acting terlipressin and octreotide in the future.
