      Instruments used were an interview asking for details of the hallucinations, a mental test
      and a scale concerning quality of life. Patients with CBS were randomized by minimization in
      two groups: in group 1, a patient-doctor interview by an ophthalmologist was performed and in
      group 2 an interview and if needed, a therapy by a psychiatrist. At the 3-months follow up,
      the psychological strain of patients was recorded again.
