    
      150 patients suffering from symptomatic knee OA will be randomized in 3 parallel groups (50
      patients per group). Each patient will be enrolled in the study for 6 months including 4
      visits: Inclusion visit (T0), follow-up visits after 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3) and 6 months
      (T6).

      A. Primary objective

      - Evaluate the efficacy of two different dosages of FLEXOFYTOL® versus PLACEBO on arthritis
      related biomarker coll2-1 and on patient assessment of disease activity in patients suffering
      from knee OA after a 3 months treatment

      B. Secondary objectives

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of two different dosages of FLEXOFYTOL® versus PLACEBO on
           arthritis-related and inflammatory biomarkers.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of two different dosages of FL EXOFYTOL® versus PLACEBO on pain
           and function.

        -  Evaluate the tolerance, the compliance and the patients' satisfaction.

        -  Evaluate the use of rescue treatments i.e. Paracetamol and oral non-steroidal
           antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the study.
