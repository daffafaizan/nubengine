      published (PMID 27543529; see the citations section). The aim of the study is to externally
      validate these models in a multicenter (11 centres in France) cohort of intensive care unit
      patients suffering from acute circulatory failure. For the peru pose of the study, patients
      will undergo concomitent central venous/arterial blood sampling from 1 to 4 times during
      their intensive cafe unit stay. Clinical characteristics of the patients and central venous
      blood gas and lactate values will be used to predicted arterial values according to
      previously published formula. Predicted and actual arterial values of each variable of
      interest (pH, PaCO2, SaO2, lactate) will then be compared.
