      long-term consequences, which can deplete financial, physical, and social capital, further
      exacerbating the cycle of undernutrition. Subsequently, undernutrition contributes to the
      difficulty in achieving sustainable development and alleviating people from poverty. Children
      are a particular focus of interest because of the formative impact that nutrition can have on
      development. This is particularly relevant for the 159 million children from low and
      middle-income countries (LMICs) who are already stunted and many more are at risk of
      stunting. Understanding how to prevent child undernutrition is imperative to the future
      development of these children from LMICs. There is no study done so far to understand the
      quantity, preference and quality of egg protein intake in young children living in LMICs with
      high burden of undernutrition. In this context, eggs can serve as a potential source of
      protein to meet the unmet need of protein especially children living in resource-poor
      environments. Eggs contain high concentrations of choline - an important precursor of
      phospholipids, which can prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, neural tube defects, changes in
      brain structure and function in offspring, and impaired language development during early
      childhood. Evidence is limited on the support of egg-related interventions for better
      nutrition outcomes in children from developing countries. Also there is very little evidence
      on the association between mother's breast milk composition with child's nutritional status.
