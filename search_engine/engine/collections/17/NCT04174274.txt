    
      In the first stage of the study, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital
      Anesthesia Reanimation 1-2-3-4, compliance with ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention
      rules in neurology, neurosurgery, and internal medicine intensive care units will be
      investigated. The researcher will visit the intensive care units included in the study twice
      a day (10:00 and 14:00) by Dr. GÃ¶khan Erdem for 1 week at the same time of day and monitor
      whether they work in accordance with VAP prevention rules.

      VAP prevention methods: Head angle 30-45 degrees, peptic ulcer prophylaxis, thromboembolism
      prophylaxis, daily wake up test, use of chlorhexidine in oral care, bacterial filter use in
      ventilator circuit, daily spontaneous breathing trials, silver-coated endotracheal tube use,
      cuff pressure adequacy, hand hygiene , VAP nurse training, avoiding excessive distension of
      the stomach, equipment contamination, mechanical tooth cleaning, daily assessment for patient
      separation from mechanical ventilation, sterile aspiration technique, use of sterile gloves
      before aspiration, aspiration of subglottic secretions will be recorded.

      In the second stage of the study, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital
      anesthesia reanimation 1-2-3-4, demographic characteristics of all hospitalized patients for
      neurological, neurosurgery, and internal medicine intensive care units, reason for
      hospitalization in intensive care unit, APACHE score, duration of mechanical ventilation,
      length of stay in ICU unit, blood transfusion, urinary infection, wound infection, presence
      of infection in at least one site, duration and type of surgery if operated, post-op
      prophylactic antibiotic use, history of CPR, history of difficult intubation, shape and
      duration of intubation, presence of tracheostomy , time from intubation to tracheostomy
      opening, residence time in ICU, change of filters in mechanical ventilator circuits,
      antibiotic use, low serum albumin value, sedative use, steroid use, feeding type, inotropic
      requirement, prokinetic agent use, number of bed personnel and nurses, reentubation history,
      transport history, glaskow coma score, frequency of endotracheal aspiration, peep need,
      smoking history, nasogastric use, chest tube, central venous catheter, presence of arterial
      catheter, history of dialysis, continuous infusion therapy, aerosol therapy, chronic diseases
      will be recorded. Patients under 18 years of age who had previously been diagnosed with
      pneumonia, lung expansion devices such as cpap, nasal peep, hypocpap were not applied via
      tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation, and patients due to high frequency ventilation or
      extracorporeal life support were excluded from VAP surveillance.
