      efficacy (viral load <50 copies/mL), safety, and immunologic response of STRIBILD
      administered for 48 weeks to HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users.

      Approximately 30 HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users (â‰¥19y.o.,<70y.o.) from
      Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre and Regina General Hospital, University of Saskatchewan
      will be taking an oral 1 STRIBILD tablet once a day for 48 weeks.

      Additionally, adherence to STRIBILD over 48 weeks and quality of life will be measured in
      this population.
