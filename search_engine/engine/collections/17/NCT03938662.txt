      Choline helps liver metabolise glucose and lipids and repair cell membrane. S-Adenosyl
      methionine is essential for the synthesis of glutathione, a main cellular antioxidant showing
      its protective effect against free radicals, among others in liver tissue. Furthermore
      S-Adenosyl methionine is involved in regulation of hepatocyte growth, differentiation, and
      death. It also enables endogenous production of small amount of choline. Although human
      organism has capacity for production of small amount of S-Adenosyl methionine, damaged liver
      can not produce it or produce it insufficient amounts.

      Having this in mind it can be hypothesised that administration of choline and S-Adenosyl
      methionine can be beneficial in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
