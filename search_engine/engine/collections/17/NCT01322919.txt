      correction. Typically, this procedure will only correct your long distance vision requiring
      the use of supplementary spectacles for reading and near vision.

      The Technolas 217z Excimer Laser used to deliver the treatment is approved for use in the
      European Community for both treatment versions to correct separately the near vision and the
      distance vision for cases which need one or the other correction.

      By using a new software two consecutive treatments have been combined to correct the distance
      vision and to provide a near vision component in addition to the first treatment.

      This study will help us to answer 2 questions:

        1. How accurately this combined technique corrects distance and near vision

        2. Whether the correction is adequate to remove the complete need for supplementary near
           spectacles
