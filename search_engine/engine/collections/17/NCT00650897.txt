      shown that patients with diabetic and major depression experience more severe diabetes
      symptoms, greater disability, more frequent medical complications, greater healthcare
      utilization costs, poorer glycemic control, and greater difficulties with diabetes self-care
      activities, compared with patients with diabetes without depression. Few specific features of
      Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), make it a promising medication
      for use in diabetes. These include a benign side effect profile; high tolerance in elderly
      patients; rapid action with efficacy often demonstrated in as little 1-2 weeks, which in turn
      could help improve compliance; its efficacy for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder,
      which may also be relatively common in patients with diabetes, and co-occurs frequently with
      depression. This study is designed to test the efficacy of Escitalopram for the treatment of
      major depression in patients with diabetes mellitus.
