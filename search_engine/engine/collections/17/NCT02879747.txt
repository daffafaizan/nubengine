      individualized GH dose maintaining normal growth velocity close to target height SDS and
      normal metabolism after fulfilled catch up growth in prepubertal children treated with
      individual doses of GH within the trial 98-0198-003 (1). The overall aim is to find for the
      individual the lowest effective GH dose during maintenance period, maintaining normal growth
      velocity and metabolism, i.e. a satisfactory biological active dose.
