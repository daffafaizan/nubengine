      the treatment of pain and other outcomes in this unfortunate group of patients with chronic
      persistent pain after TKA. Among marketed serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
      (SNRIs), milnacipran has a unique property in that it blocks serotonin and norepinephrine
      reuptake equally. It is plausible that equipotent reuptake inhibition may confer greater
      analgesic benefit compared to other agents, and in preclinical animal models milnacipran has
      shown superior effects of ameliorating hyperalgesia and allodynia compared to some other
      antidepressant drugs. Additionally, milnacipran does not have inhibitory effects on
      cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes, no binding affinity to neurotransmitter receptors liable to
      cause adverse events, and simple pharmacokinetics.
