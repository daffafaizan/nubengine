      improve and /or protect cognitive functioning and improve symptomatology in a cohort of 128
      first episode psychosis patients.This is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled add on
      standard therapy trial of Taurine 4g , in young patients between 18-25 presenting to ORYGEN
      Youth Health a sub program of Melbourne Health and RAPPS, a subprogram of Southern Health
      with a first psychotic episode . Taurine will be compared with placebo added to standard
      treatment for a period of 12 weeks in a double blind fashion.Primary outcome measures will be
      psychopathology and cognition (MATRICS.

      Secondary outcome measures will be tolerability and safety measures (drop-out rates, general
      side effect scale (UKU).

      Patients who give informed consent will be randomised to receive treatment with Taurine 4g
      daily or placebo for 12 weeks.

      Patients will be randomised by a dynamic randomisation method called minimization which
      allocates patients to treatment group by checking the allocation of similar patients already
      randomised, and allocating the next treatment group "live" to best balance the treatment
      groups across all stratification variables. The minimization will be carried out by the NHMRC
      clinical trials centre in Sydney , and the patient will be randomized to either placebo or
      vitamin.

      Each patient will collect their tablets from the clinical trials pharmacy. The Clinical
      Trials Pharmacy will dispense either vitamin or placebo. All study personnel and participants
      will be blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.
