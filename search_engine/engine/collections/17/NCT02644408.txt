      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and performed chemoradiotherapy from the Oct 2014. The
      patients will be divided into two groups.Experimental group：esophageal cancer patients with
      oral megestrol chemoradiation. Megestrol（Yining）：160mg/d，po,5 weeks in total，oen week before
      chemoradiotherapy and one week after chemoradiotherapy.

      chemoradiotherapy：chemotherapy and radiotherapy： 50Gy in total，2 Gy/d，5d/w.Control group:
      Esophageal cancer patients with chemoradiation without oral
      megestrol.chemoradiotherapy：chemotherapy and radiotherapy： 50Gy in total，2 Gy/d，5d/w.The
      primary end point is quality of life (will be evaluated by EORTC QLQ-C30); the secondary end
      point is the pathological response after treatment and adverse events.
