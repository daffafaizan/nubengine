      undergo tracheostomy. These patients usually undergo spontaneous breathing trials receiving
      oxygen via T-piece. While the high flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) respiratory support system,
      delivered through nasal cannulas, has demonstrated clinical benefits on respiratory function,
      limited data exist on whether such effects are also present in HFOT through tracheostomy.
      Therefore, we plan to perform a study to examine the short-term effects of HFOT on
      diaphragmatic function in tracheostomized patients with prolonged weaning from mechanical
      ventilation.

      After disconnection from the ventilator, patients will undergo a 30-minute spontaneous
      breathing trial receiving oxygen either conventionally via T-piece, or by HFOT delivered via
      tracheostomy, followed by a washout period of 15 min breathing through T-piece and 30 min
      receiving oxygen with the other modality in a randomized manner. At the start and end of each
      study period, patients will undergo an assessment through diaphragm ultrasonography, which
      includes excursion of diaphragmatic dome and thickness of diaphragmatic zone of apposition at
      end-inspiration and end-expiration. Subsequently, the diaphragmatic thickening fraction will
      be calculated as the difference between end-inspiratory and end-expiratory thickness divided
      by end-expiratory thickness. Also. arterial blood gases as well as respiratory rate (RR) and
      tidal volume (TV) (through a Wright's spirometer) will be measured.
