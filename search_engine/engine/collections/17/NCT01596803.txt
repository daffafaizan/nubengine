      supplementation on the functional deficits and the molecular muscle abnormalities into two
      groups of patients affected by FSHD, one treated with the antioxidant supplementation during
      17 weeks. The antioxidant by capsule consisted of:Vitamin E (400 mg /day), Selenium (200
      Âµg/day in the form of selenomethionine), Vitamin C (500 mg/day), Zinc (25 mg/day in the form
      of gluconate). The second one treated with a placebo during 17 weeks. Patients will be
      assigned to intervention groups by chance, and neither physician, nor patient, will know
      which product is administrated (study in "double blind").
