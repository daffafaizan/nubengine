    
      This study is a prospective, multi-centre, single-group target value clinical study. Taking
      the patency rate at 12 months after operation as the primary evaluation index and taking
      target vascular cavity loss rate at 6 months postoperatively, Rutherford Classification at 12
      months postoperatively, the ankle/brachial index (ABI), revascularization rate of target
      lesions, revascularization rate of target vessels, operating success rate and success rate of
      surgery as the secondary evaluation indexes to evaluate the efficacy of FemFlow Drug-Eluting
      Peripheral Balloon Catheter manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD. for
      lesions with femoropopliteal artery stenosis or occlusion. Taking the incidence of major
      adverse events (MAE), adverse events (AE) and instrument defects occurred through the entire
      trail as the evaluation indexes to evaluate the safety of FemFlow Drug-Eluting Peripheral
      Balloon Catheter manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Company for lesions with
      femoropopliteal artery stenosis or occlusion. According to statistical hypothesis and sample
      size calculation, the sample size of this clinical trial was 208 cases. All subjects were
      followed up 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after treatment with a FemFlow Drug-Eluting
      Peripheral Balloon Catheter, and data on efficacy and safety were collected. All relevant
      clinical data are managed and analyzed by the professional data management centre and the
      statistical centre. End-point events of clinical trials are determined by a specially
      established third party.
