    
      This is a randomized, un-blinded, phase III, multi-center clinical trial of an antimicrobial
      therapy strategy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Our overall hypothesis is that
      reducing harmful microbial impact with antimicrobial therapy will reduce the risk of
      non-elective, respiratory hospitalization or death in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF).

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either receive a prescription drug voucher for oral
      antimicrobial therapy in the form of one double strength 160 milligrams (mg)
      trimethoprim/800mg sulfamethoxazole (double strength co-trimoxazole) twice daily plus folic
      acid 5 mg daily OR doxycycline 100mg once daily if weight < 50 kilograms (kg) or 100mg twice
      daily if weight > 50 kg. Patients randomized to receive antimicrobial therapy will be given
      co-trimoxazole unless they have an allergy, contraindication to co-trimoxazole, renal
      insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 milliliters (ml)), are hyperkalemic
      (potassium > 5 milliequivalents(mEq)/liter(L)), or are concomitantly taking an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or potassium sparing
      diuretic in which case they will receive doxycycline.

      Participation in this study will be between 12 months and 36 months depending on time of
      enrollment.
