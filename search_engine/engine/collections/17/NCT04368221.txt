      the detection of respiratory fungal infections.

      Here, the protocol will be in two steps:

      First step

      COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU for ARDS will benefit for a systematic screening with a
      fungal respiratory syndromic panel once or twice a week from entry to discharge from ICU,
      with minimum 3 samples when discharge occurs after 15 days::

        -  Sample: tracheal aspiration, bronchial aspiration, BAL

        -  Fungal respiratory panel: samples will be processed in each lab for culture without
           direct examination nor stained smears, and real-time PCR will be performed for
           Aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and mucormycetes

        -  Results will be given to ICU in order to optimize the management of the patient Second
           step

      Complementary analysis will be performed in order to finalize the diagnostic and to
      differentiate between colonization and infection, with:

        -  Serum detection of galactomannan and serum Aspergillus PCR in case of positive
           respiratory sample for Aspergillus

        -  Serum/plasma beta-D-glucan detection in case of positive respiratory sample for
           Pneumocystis jirovecii

        -  Serum mucorales PCR in case of positive respiratory sample for mucorales This second
           step is possible in most of the labs, but when necessary a confirmation test can be
           externalized. A process of DNA transmission to a reference lab within each region will
           be implemented.

      This second step will allow to classify infections as probable or proven according to
      international recommendations.

      Case report form (CRF) A short but standardized CRF will be proposed to all centers in order
      to collect demographic data and the essential clinical and laboratory data during the survey.
