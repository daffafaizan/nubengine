    
      Consecutive eligible patients will be recruited into the study.

      Phase 1: Two outcome measures - PFIT-s and DEMMI will be performed within 24 hour period.
      Order of testing will be randomised to minimise testing bias. Time-points of assessment are:
      awakening, ICU discharge and hospital discharge. Weekly measures will also be performed if
      required in ICU and/or ward settings for up to a maximum of 30 days in each setting. The
      measurement properties of the individual tools PFIT-s and DEMMI will be examined (e.g.
      validity, responsiveness).

      Phase 2: Based on the findings in Phase 1 a new single outcome measure will be developed. In
      the second phase examination of the measurement properties of the tool will be undertaken
      including (reliability, validity, responsiveness).
