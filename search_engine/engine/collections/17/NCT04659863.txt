      inclisiran) multicenter study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      inclisiran in adolescents with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and elevated
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on stable standard of care background
      lipid-lowering therapy. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of inclisiran
      compared to placebo in reducing LDL-C (percent change) at Day 330.
