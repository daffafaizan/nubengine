      high mortality rate, but have received much less investigation than bleeding esophageal
      varices. Various therapeutic measures have been used to treat BGV, including endoscopic,
      radiographic, and surgical procedures, but there have been few prospective evaluations of
      therapy involving sizable groups of patients that have received acceptable follow-up.
      Management of this serious disorder has been uncertain and often unsuccessful. Herein is a
      prospective randomized controlled trial in unselected cirrhotic patients with BGV that
      compared the effectiveness of endoscopic therapy (ET) and portacaval shunt (PCS) during
      follow-up for more than 5 years or until death.

      STUDY DESIGN: 518 unselected patients with cirrhosis and BGV were randomized to ET or PCS
      performed as an emergency in 220 and electively in 298. All patients received the same
      diagnostic workup, initial therapy, post-treatment therapy, and rigorous follow-up. One-, 5-,
      10-, and 15-year follow-up rates were 100%, 97%, 97%, and 92%, respectively. ET consisted of
      repetitive sessions of intravariceal injection sclerotherapy and/or variceal band ligation
      aimed at variceal obliteration. PCS consisted of a direct anastomosis, side to side in 95%.
      ET and PCS were compared specifically with regard to control of bleeding, survival rate, and
      quality of life.
