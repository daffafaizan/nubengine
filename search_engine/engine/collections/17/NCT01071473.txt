      function of survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have
      cardiomyopathy.

      As a secondary objective, the study will document the effect of a 12-week exercise
      intervention on exercise tolerance, as determined by measurement of peak VO2 and peak
      exercise workload, shortening fraction, ejection fraction, and left ventricular wall
      thickness, and assess the impact of the intervention on neurocognitive functioning in
      survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have cardiomyopathy.
