      pulmonary nodule（SPN） is debatable. Options expressed in the literature vary from routine
      preoperative bronchoscopy having no role in obtaining tissue diagnosis in small SPNs to it
      begin very useful in determining underlying etiology and surgical strategy. The American
      College of Chest Physicians（ACCP）guidelines recommend bronchoscopy only if air-bronchogram is
      present or if operator has expertise with newer guided techniques. Previous study showed that
      bronchoscopy is not indicated in SPNs that present with ground-glass opacity on CT. The
      purpose of this analysis is to define that role by examining in GGO patients
      （1）intra-bronchial findings （2）impact of these findings on established surgical plan.
