    
      Randomized controlled clinical trial with intervention branch (management program
      cardiological-geriatric) and control branch (usual care) for fragile patients with
      decompensated heart failure. Follow-up period 1 month.

      This protocol aims through a multidisciplinary vision, to carry out during hospitalization a
      comprehensive geriatric evaluation that allows to know the medical and socio-environmental
      needs of the patient to plan the required care at home and achieve an effective transition.
