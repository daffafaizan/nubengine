    
      This is a retrospective multicenter registry including at least 40 European primary PCI
      centers with > 120 primary PCI/year (with expected average > 10/month), with the case load of
      STEMI not expected to be affected by a potential planned reorganization of the STEMI network.
      The inclusion period will be of 2 months (from March 1st until April 30th). The data will be
      compared with those retrospectively collected in the same time window of 2019.

      Inclusion criteria: STEMI treated by primary angioplasty. Primary study outcome: Number of
      STEMI patients undergoing primary angioplasty. Secondary study outcomes: Ischemia time and
      the number of late presenters (> 12 hours from symptoms onset); 3) Door-to-balloon time and
      the number of patients with a DTB > 30 minutes); 4) In-Hospital mortality.

      Data Collection: Data will be collected anonymized through a dedicated CRF. Each center will
      identify a local Principal Investigator. We will collect information on the study center,
      demographic, clinical, procedural data. Furthermore, we will collect data on total ischemia
      time, door-to-balloon time, type of access to the emergency system, COVID positivity, PCI
      procedure, data on in-hospital mortality.
