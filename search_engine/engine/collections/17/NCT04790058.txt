      growing crisis in North America and Europe, and leads to unsafe and rushed disposition
      decisions which compromise patient care. On the other hand, hospital admission is expensive,
      and an increasing awareness of nosocomial morbidity and the harms of unnecessary testing and
      hospitalization exert countervailing pressure on low-yield admissions from the ED. Therefore,
      improved accuracy in ED disposition decision-making is more important than ever, and syncope
      typifies a common, high stakes condition in which improvements in efficiency are badly
      needed.

      Identifying which patients will benefit from further cardiac rhythm monitoring and/or
      hospital admission is essential to reduce both adverse outcomes and high costs. A
      comprehensive literature review of risk-tools and international guidelines concede that
      previously published tools lack or have failed external validation, are excessively complex,
      include as outcomes obvious conditions readily identified during the index ED evaluation, or
      lacked power and specificity. These tools also do not offer specific clinical actions and are
      not supported by the guidelines. The CSRS addresses each of the above weaknesses and coupled
      with outpatient live cardiac monitoring is an innovative and standardized approach to ED
      syncope management to expedite ED care, improve patient safety and reduce healthcare costs.
      The investigators have identified the barriers and facilitators to effectively adapt
      knowledge into local contexts as per the Knowledge to Action cycle, and have selected
      implementation strategies accordingly. The proposed pilot study is a right step before
      widescale implementation.
