      strengthen internal bleeding, pain, avoidance of infection and promoting wound healing wound.
      With the changes in the social environment, people caring for hemostasis and wound healing
      have become increasingly demanding. Presently, studies generally aim to stop the bleeding
      using trauma care technology and functional capabilities combined with each other as well as
      inhibit lower infection and can also help assist healing wounds care strategy for the
      protection of human lives. Therefore, the goal of the plan is to establish new care
      strategies on open wounds infection to stop the bleeding and to improve the health and safety
      of the people. The researchers will choose the general biological hemostatic gauze to conduct
      clinical trials comparing the clinical hemostasis focusing on bleeding time, wound infection
      in the wound and the wound bacteria penetrating situations in the hope to build a better
      strategy in rapid hemostasis and wound infection care strategy.
