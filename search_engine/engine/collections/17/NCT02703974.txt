      analyze the handwashing behaviors of school-aged children.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess nudges as a viable method of promoting
      handwashing among school-aged children.

      The specific objectives of this quantitative exploration are to:

        1. Determine if nudges can prompt significant behavior change and result in higher rates of
           handwashing among school-aged children in Bangladesh

        2. Determine if behavior change resulting from nudging is sustainable over time
