    
      The objective of this study is to assess embryology outcomes after implementation of a
      laboratory protocol known as ROSI at a high-volume clinical infertility practice. All samples
      from enrolled male patients with azoospermia who proceed with surgical sperm extraction (TESE
      or microTESE) will be evaluated for the presence of round spermatids. These round spermatids
      will be used as research samples as opposed to being discarded.

      The investigators aim to identify whether the injection of round spermatids into donor
      oocytes can lead to successful fertilization, progression to the blastocyst stage, and
      euploid status. Performance of ROSI using donor oocytes not intended for implantation will
      allow the investigators to gain valuable insight regarding fertilization and development
      without any direct risk to patients or future offspring. These embryos are being generated
      for research purposes only and will ultimately be destroyed after the study has concluded.
      The investigators will measure rates of isolation of round spermatids from surgical samples,
      fertilization rates using donor oocytes, rates of progression to the blastocyst stage, and
      rates of aneuploidy using the previously described technique of ROSI.
