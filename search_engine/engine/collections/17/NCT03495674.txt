      I. To assess the feasibility of a 12-month exercise cycling intervention among Lynch syndrome
      (LS) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect size of exercise on circulating biomarkers as well as regulation of
      genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic biomarkers in normal intestinal mucosa of LS
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Starting on day 15, participants wear FITBIT and complete cycling classes over 45
      minutes 3 times a week for a total of 12 classes a month for up to 1 year.

      GROUP II: Starting on day 15, participants receive information about exercise guidelines and
      wear FITBIT to track heart rate and activities for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study interventions, participants are followed up at 30 days.
