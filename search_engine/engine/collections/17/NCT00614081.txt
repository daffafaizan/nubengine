      rate (GFR). However, this method requires several hours and several blood and urinary
      samplings. Therefore, the ability to get access to this parameter with a simple, valid and
      reliable method would be a significant progress in clinical follow-up of patients with renal
      disease. Contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI is now able to give this access to functional
      parameters as GFR, rapidly and non invasively, becoming an alternative to Cr51-EDTA method.
      If the acquisition method has been optimized, some problems remain unsolved: is the movement
      correction worthwhile for the accuracy of the measurement ? Which model provides the most
      accurate results ? What is the best way to calculate the total GFR (addition of all the
      voxels or the product of a mean value by the cortical volume)? These questions can be
      answered only by a comparison with a reference method.

      The reference method will be performed after standard hydration, with intravenous injection
      of 100 ÂµCi of Cr51- EDTA and urinary and blood samplings every 30 minutes during 3h. Dynamic
      MRI will be performed with fast 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences during 5 minutes after
      injection of a third of a clinical dose of gadolinium. Post-treatment of images will be done
      on an off-line program allowing movement correction, conversion of signal intensity into
      concentration and application of different models. 8 combinations of post-treatment will be
      tested and compared to the reference method.
