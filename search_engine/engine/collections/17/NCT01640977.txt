      morbidity of approach using traditional posterior-approach interbody fusion techniques and a
      less invasive exposure for the same procedure. Perioperative measures and early outcomes will
      be documented to demonstrate differences in procedural requirements, safety, and early
      recovery. A total of 100 subjects will be consecutively enrolled in this prospective study
      from as many as 8 centers. Patients who, in the surgeon investigator's opinion, require
      instrumented lumbar interbody fusion and have consented to PLIF surgery for their conditions
      will be included. The following eligibility criteria are designed to identify existing clinic
      patients for whom study under this protocol is considered appropriate. All subjects must meet
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to be considered for enrollment.
