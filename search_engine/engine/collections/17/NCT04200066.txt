      can be given safely in combination with temozolomide and tamoxifen. Temozolomide is approved
      to treat glioblastoma and the investigator wants to understand what doses are safe to use.
      Tamoxifen has been used for many years to treat breast cancer and there have also been
      studies combining it with temozolomide for the treatment of brain tumors that have shown the
      combination to be safe. In this study, the investigator will be adding maprotiline to
      temozolomide and tamoxifen, determining the highest possible dose that is safe, making sure
      there are no significant drug interactions and studying the safety of this combination.
