      shock, sepsis might have changes in status of microbiota. This is pilot study to get status
      of microbiota from normal control. Stable patient who are admitted to ICU for observation
      will be gathered. Samples will be collected via rectal swab at time of admission and analyzed
      via Next generation sequencing.
