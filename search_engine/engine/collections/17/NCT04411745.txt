      hypotheses such as 'functional progesterone withdrawal' and inflammatory signaling have been
      proposed. Researchers including our group have previously identified panels of genes which
      were differentially expressed between placentas obtained after spontaneous birth and those
      after elective cesarean delivery. However, such findings obtained after birth could only
      reflects the late changes in parturition. Similar findings in other gestational tissues, such
      as fetal membranes, amniotic fluids, myometrial biopsies are available, but these sample
      types cannot be readily collected until delivery.

      Thus, we propose to explore biomarkers in maternal blood with a view to developing any useful
      analytes for predicting labor.
