      each year. While mortality is relatively low, morbidity remains substantial with a
      significant risk of prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, prolonged length of hospital
      and intensive care unit stay and many other complications. CABG causes a profound stress
      response and significant metabolic alterations occur, including a shift from aerobic to
      anaerobic metabolism, causing increased levels of pyruvate and lactate. Elevated lactate, a
      marker of anaerobic metabolism, is a common and significant finding in patients after CABG
      and is correlated with increased mortality and morbidity.

      Aerobic metabolism occurs when pyruvate enters the mitochondria through pyruvate
      decarboxylation to acetyl-Coenzyme A, facilitated by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).
      Decreased PDH activity may cause a shift toward anaerobic metabolism and play a role in the
      changes seen in patients undergoing CABG. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a key co-factor for PDH
      function and will increase activity even in non-deficient states. The investigators
      hypothesize that thiamine administration will increase PDH activity in patients undergoing
      CABG, leading to increased cellular oxygen consumption, as represented by decreased lactate
      levels after surgery, and ultimately improved clinical outcomes.

      In order to test the investigators' hypothesis and to obtain data for a large-scale clinical
      trial evaluating relevant clinical endpoints, the investigators are conducting a randomized,
      double-blind, pilot trial of thiamine in high-risk patients undergoing CABG.
