      I. To evaluate the event free survival (EFS) following therapy with rituximab plus adriamycin
      (doxorubicin hydrochloride), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) or standard ABVD
      in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have poor prognosis defined
      as International prognostic score (IPS) of > 2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the effect of the two treatment arms on positron emission tomography (PET) scan
      results after 2 cycles of therapy.

      II. To compare the effect of the two treatment arms on the level of circulating malignant
      Hodgkin stem cells.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 7 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22 of course 1 and on days 1 and 8 of course 2. Participants also receive doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment with ABVD repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Participants receive doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
      dacarbazine as in Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for the
      first year, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then
      annually thereafter.
