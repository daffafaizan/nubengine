      to decrease aggression in perpetrators of domestic violence. Since serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRI) have been shown to decrease aggression in other patient populations, we
      will examine the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing aggression in perpetrators of domestic
      violence. In this protocol, perpetrators of domestic violence will be randomized according to
      a double-blind design to receive either the SSRI, fluoxetine, or placebo. All participants
      will receive psychotherapy. All participants will also be carefully monitored in the
      outpatient clinic on a regular basis for three months. Drug efficacy will be established
      using validated rating scales and provocative aggression inducing paradigms.
