    
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab SC).
      Vedolizumab SC is being tested to assess its long-term safety and effectiveness in treating
      participants with UC or CD. This study will look at the long-term side effects and
      response/remission of UC and CD in participants who received vedolizumab SC in a prior
      vedolizumab SC study.

      The study will enroll up to 692 patients. All participants enrolled in this study will have
      previously participated in the MLN0002SC-3027 or MLN0002SC-3031 study. Participants who
      completed the Maintenance Period (Week 52) in their previous study, or who did not achieve a
      clinical response at Week 6 but who did achieve a clinical response at Week 14 after having
      received a third vedolizumab IV infusion at Week 6 in their previous study, will receive
      open-label vedolizumab SC 108 mg, once every 2 weeks (Q2W). Participants who withdrew early
      from the Maintenance Period of their previous study due to disease worsening or need for
      rescue medications will receive open-label vedolizumab SC 108 mg, once every week (QW).
      Participants receiving SC 108 mg Q2W who experience treatment failure (disease worsening or
      need for rescue medications while in the current study will be dose escalated to vedolizumab
      SC 108 mg QW.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. Participation in this vedolizumab SC
      study will continue until vedolizumab SC becomes commercially available, the participant
      withdraws from the study, or the sponsor decides to close the study. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for
      a follow-up assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety follow-up,
      by phone, at 6 months after the last dose of study drug.
