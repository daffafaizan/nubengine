    
      Prospective, participant-masked, multiple arm, crossover dispensing clinical trial where
      participants will wear prototype (test) and commercial (control) lenses bilaterally.
      Participants will be stratified based on their refractive error into either presbyopic or
      non-presbyopic group. Each of the stratified group will have a maximum of 4 parallel arms. Up
      to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against the control/s in each parallel arm in a
      randomized cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types.
      Each lens assessment will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances - a fitting visit and an
      evaluation visit.
