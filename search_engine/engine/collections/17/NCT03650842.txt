      laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. There will be no change in the anesthetic or perioperative care
      of these patients. Tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be monitored using near infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS). Prior to anesthetic induction, the NIRS monitor will be placed on the
      forehead. The device is non-invasive like pulse oximetry using a non-painful adhesive
      sticker. The device can be applied to different sites on the body to measure cerebral, tissue
      or even organ oxygenation. For the purpose of the study, the investigators will place one
      monitor on the forehead to measure tissue oxygenation and a second over the lower back to
      measure tissue (muscle or renal) oxygenation. These devices are used routinely in the
      operating room and the cardiothoracic intensive care unit for cardiac patients. Although not
      used on every surgical procedure, NIRS monitoring can be used on all patients who are
      undergoing major surgical procedures. Tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be recorded
      continuously starting just prior to anesthetic induction until the completion of the
      procedure.
