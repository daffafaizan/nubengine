      authorized by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of all participating centers and
      informed written consent was obtained from all the patients included. The cutaneous anergy
      was defined by the absence of a reaction (0 mm) to skin reactivity tests with tuberculin,
      Candida albicans, and parotiditis antigens 72 hours after inoculation. The patients were
      randomzed into one of the following four groups: isoniazid for 6 months (6H), rifampin plus
      isoniazid for 3 months (3RH), rifampin plus pyrazinamide for 2 months (2RZ) or no treatment
      (NT). All of the participating subjects underwent a basal study that included clinical and
      epidemiological history, chest x-ray, hemogram, analysis of serum creatinine concentrations,
      uric acid, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, as well as a CD4+
      T-lymphocyte count.During prophylactic treatment, patients were evaluated every 15 days for
      the first two months and monthly thereafter. At each check-up it was determined whether or
      not the patient was following the treatment properly and whether there were any adverse
      effects. Therapeutic completion was defined as taking at least 80% of the total prescribed
      dosages.Chemoprophylaxis was discontinued whenever a patient requested to do so or for any of
      the following reasons: appearance of Grade 3 or 4 side effects that could be attributed to
      the drugs used in the study; increases in AST and/or ALT values of three times or more their
      basal values; development of TB; or diagnosis of any disease that made interruption of the
      treatment advisable.
