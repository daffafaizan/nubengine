      behavior problems for dementia caregivers. This study will test the intervention in a larger
      group of caregivers and have a more detailed analysis of outcomes.

      The caregiver of a person with dementia will receive telephone support calls. They will
      receive telephone calls from a trained member of the research team. These calls will occur
      over a six-month period and will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for the caregiver.
      They will receive a total of 16 calls over 6 months. During each call, the support person
      will discuss their current caregiving situation and provide various forms of support.
