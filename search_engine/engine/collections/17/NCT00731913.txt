      from ancient Egypt show that Egyptians used linen and animal sinew to close wounds. In
      ancient India, physicians used the pincers of beetles or ants to staple wounds shut. They
      then cut the insects' bodies off, leaving their jaws (staples) in place. Other natural
      materials used to close wounds include flax, hair, grass, cotton, silk, pig bristles, and
      animal gut.

      The fundamental principles of wound closure have changed little over 4,000 years. Successful
      closure of wound involves surgical techniques coupled with knowledge of the physical
      characteristics and handling of the suture and needle. The selection of proper suture
      material in closing any surgical defect is important in wound healing, minimizing infection,
      and achieving optimal cosmetic and functional results.

      A great deal of progress has been made since Egyptian times with regard to suture materials
      and manufacturing processes. Today, sutures are available with a wide variety of
      characteristics, configuration, manipulability, coefficient of friction, solubility,
      strength, and immunogenic properties. Yet, sutures are currently rather crudely classified
      based on a numeric scale according to diameter and tensile strength; descending from 10 to 1,
      and then descending again from 1-0 to 12-0. This study aims to explore the factors that are
      important to a surgeon when choosing sutures via evaluating surgeon preference for two types
      of synthetic, absorbable, monofilament sutures: Monosyn and Monocryl. We hope to initiate a
      more nuanced exploration of how suture characteristics influence surgeon preference, beyond
      filament type and size, and how makers of suture may better report and represent these
      factors.
