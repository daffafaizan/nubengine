      and it also has toxic effects in many patients. Therefore, it is necessary to test other
      drugs in HIV-infected patients. AL-721 is a mixture of lipids (fats) extracted from egg
      yolks. Laboratory tests suggest that it might inhibit the infectivity of the HIV. AL-721 has
      been tried so far in a few patients for short periods of time and has been found to be well
      tolerated.

      Patients receive AL-721 twice daily. The first dose is taken on an empty stomach 1 hour
      before a fat-free breakfast, with specific instructions given on foods that are allowed; the
      second dose is taken at least 3 hours after the evening meal. No snacks are permitted after
      the evening meal or after the evening dose of study medication. The study is scheduled to
      last for 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up. Throughout the study, frequent blood
      samples will be taken from an arm vein. The blood samples are studied to evaluate any changes
      in the patient's immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the blood, and
      any changes in the presence of the HIV in the blood.
