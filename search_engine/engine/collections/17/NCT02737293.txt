      responsible for ~1/3 of all deaths in the US. However, about 50% of those who experience
      heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is carried in lipoproteins (HDL,
      LDL, and VLDL) and the amount in circulation is used to evaluate CVD risk. However, the
      particle size and density of lipoprotein subfractions may be more predictive for
      atherogenesis than their total levels. Dietary fatty acids are well recognized modulators of
      lipoproteins, and ultimately CVD risk. Saturated and trans fatty acids have a negative effect
      on CVD risk while poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, MUFA) appear to be protective.
      The Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) decreases atherogenic lipoproteins and reduces systemic
      inflammation. It is unknown how high cholesterol intake within a Med Diet will affect these
      parameters, although recent evidence implies that the fatty acid content of the diet is more
      important than the cholesterol content. Therefore, this project will evaluate the daily
      inclusion of whole eggs, a high cholesterol food, in the Med Diet on lipid profiles,
      lipoprotein particle size and density and biomarkers of systemic inflammation.
