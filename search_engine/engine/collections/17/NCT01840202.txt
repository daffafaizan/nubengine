    
      1. Demographic and clinical ophthalmology-related examination data will be collected,
           including intraocular pressure measurement using dynamic contour tonometry

        2. Visual field testing will be performed.

        3. Structural damage will be documented by a retinal nerve fiber layer analysis (through
           Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph)

        4. High Definition Optical coherent tomograph imaging of the submacular and peripapillary
           choroidal thickness will be performed.

        5. Color Doppler Imaging of the retrobulbar vessels will be performed, with analysis of the
           Doppler waveform (peak systolic, end diastolic velocities and resistivity index)

        6. Retinal oximetry will be performed with the analysis of the arterial and venous
           saturations of retinal vessels
