      Since abemaciclib is already being studied in dedifferentiated liposarcoma patients, patients
      with this sarcoma subtype will not be enrolled in the current study. This exploratory study
      will enroll patients with all other types of soft tissue sarcoma, in addition to patients
      with several bone sarcomas. We are testing the hypothesis that biomarkers of Cyclin D1 -
      CDK4/6 - Rb pathway activation will identify patients with a rare, heterogeneous cancer who
      are most likely to benefit from cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibition with
      abemaciclib.

      There will be three cohorts of patients, intended to ensure representation of subjects with
      rare bone sarcomas - chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma - that have relatively frequent
      occurrence of abnormalities in the Cyclin D1 - CDK4/6 - Rb pathway, in addition to soft
      tissue sarcoma.

      Cohort 1 - Conventional chondrosarcoma, 9-12 patients; Cohort 2 - Osteosarcoma,
      Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, 9-12 patients; Cohort 3 - Soft tissue sarcoma (except WD/DD
      Liposarcoma), 22-26 patients
