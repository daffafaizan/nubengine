      services to children and their families in the comfort and privacy of their own home.
      Approximately 80 children (6-12 years of age)suffering from mild to moderate sleep onset
      latency and/or bedtime resistance will be randomized.

      The intervention is delivered from a distance, using an educational handbook and telephone
      consultation with a trained paraprofessional "coach" who is supervised by a licensed health
      care professional. The telephone coach delivers consistent care based on written protocols,
      with on-going evaluation by a professional team.
