    
      It will be conducted a randomized controlled double-blinded study in the Emergency service of
      the Naval General Hospital of High Specialty in the Mexico City. The period of patient
      inclusion in the study is November 2015 to November 2016.

      The selections of the patients are children between 1 and 5 years who come to the emergency
      room with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis with vomiting and intolerance of oral route.

      Treatments were randomly assigned eligible patients on admission in the emergency department

      The primary endpoint was evaluated at 15 minutes after treatment application:

        -  Treatment 1: Ondansetron was administered intravenous dose (0.15mg/kg/doses) Diluted in
           20 ml saline and administered intravenously 5 minutes

        -  Treatment 2: Metoclopramide was administered intravenous dose (0.15mg/kg/doses) Diluted
           in 20 ml saline and administered intravenously 5 minutes

      The administration of intravenous medications, will be held in the observation area of the
      emergency department of pediatrics under monitoring continuo vital signs during application
      and 15 minutes after treatment.

      At 15 minutes after administration, the mouth with oral electrolyte begins by assessing your
      tolerance, 30 minutes to progress to the astringent diet.

      It will follow up with patient assessment in the emergency department of pediatrics, 3 hours
      after having established the treatment, in order to corroborate the remission of vomiting, it

        -  Compare the number of vomiting episodes with the administration of ondansetron vs
           metoclopramide

        -  Compare time duration in which the oral route is restarted.

        -  Compare hospital admission rate

        -  Describe adverse effects in both groups
