      undergoing the universal hypercholesterolemia screening; those with elevated cholesterol at
      universal cholesterol screening at primary care level are referred to the lipidology
      specialist at the UMC Ljubljana (Slovenia) or Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult (Lower Saxony,
      Germany). For those with elevated cholesterol levels, the familial hypercholesterolemia
      genetic diagnostics is done centrally in UMC Ljubljana.

      Only those will be included from whom a signed informed consent by themselves or by their
      parents/guardians will be obtained prior to the genetic diagnosis of familial
      hypercholesterolemia.
