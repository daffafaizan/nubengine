      assessments collected at baseline, 3,6,12 and 18 months will be used. It is hypothesized that
      participants in the home-based peer-counseling intervention will have greater reductions and
      will better maintain their reductions in their HbA1c levels compared to participants in the
      standard of care hospital based program currently in place. Additional secondary hypotheses
      state the participants in the home-based peer-counseling intervention will have improved
      lipid profile values, cholesterol levels, and BMI compared to participants in the standard of
      care hospital based program.

      Participants in the home-based peer-counseling intervention will monitor their glucose more
      regularly (defined by the mean and variance in number of monitored days per month) than
      participants in the standard of care hospital based program. Lastly, participants in the
      home-based peer-counseling intervention will have a higher rate of program participation
      (defined by adherence to appointments and referrals) and completion than participants in the
      standard of care hospital based program.
