      who care for subjects in the study are already competent in the care and management of
      patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring as a
      requirement of their current employment at Duke University. Patients with confirmed diagnosis
      of subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring ICP and CSF management will be admitted to the 16 bed
      Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU) at Duke Hospital. After admission procedures and a baseline
      neurologic assessment are complete, the charge nurse or NCCU fellow will notify an
      investigator of subjects meeting inclusion criteria. The investigator or research coordinator
      for this project will complete a review preparatory to research (RPR) to ensure no exclusion
      criteria are present and once subject appropriateness has been confirmed patients and their
      families will be introduced to the investigator for the purpose of obtaining informed
      consent. The subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) will be informed of the
      study's purpose, risks and benefits, and the rights of research subjects.

      Data will be collected that reflects the duration of the patient's hospitalization at Duke
      University through chart abstraction. The study period will be defined as admission to
      discharge. The attending physician has, and will continue to, determine the appropriateness
      of the duration of ICP monitoring, NCCU discharge criteria and hospital discharge criteria.
      Chart abstraction will be completed daily to obtain the ICP values and CSF volumes during
      that period of time for which the patient has a ventriculostomy.
