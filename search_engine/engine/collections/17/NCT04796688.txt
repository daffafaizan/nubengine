           patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, including CD19+ B-cell acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia(B-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia(B-CLL), and B-cell
           lymphoma.

        -  However, multiple challenges exist for manufacturing CAR-T cells from patients with
           advanced disease including inability to manufacture a product, disease progression or
           death while waiting for the CAR-T product to be available, and heterogeneity among
           autologous CAR-T products that contributes to unpredictable and variable clinical
           activity.

        -  Healthy donor T cells can provide a source for production of universal CAR-T cells when
           combined with gene editing to prevent expression of endogenous TCRs and avoid generation
           of GvHD in HLA mismatched recipients.

        -  Cord blood derived T cells from healthy donor are the source for production of universal
           anti-CD19 CAR-modified AT19 cells. CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing technology has been used to
           knockout TCRs and HLA-I to avoid GvHD and transplant rejection.

        -  AT19 cells have exhibited potent cytotoxicity in CD19+ tumor cells and can effectively
           eradicate CD19+ tumor cells in xenograft mice models, without showing GvHD.

        -  This study aims to evaluate prelimary safety and efficacy of the universal AT19 cells in
           patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, B-CLL, and B-cell lymphoma.
