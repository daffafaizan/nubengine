      memory training on substance abuse. Secondary aims are to explore whether effects are
      mediated by changes in executive functions and/or moderated by personality. Also, effects on
      measures of psychosocial functioning, depression, anxiety and attention will be explored.
      Follow-up assessment will be conducted at 6 months post training.
