      defined as the primary physician or advanced care practitioner following a patient, as
      recorded in their respective Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and identified through
      CHORUS, a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) developed by Epividian. The CDSS will track
      patient case status as active or inactive (loss to follow-up, transferred medical care, or
      deceased). Providers will be informed of the study and sites will be contracted to
      participate in this collaborative research study. This study was approved by the Advarra
      Institutional Review Board.
