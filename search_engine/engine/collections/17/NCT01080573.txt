    
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young
      adults. It is characterised by multifocal, recurrent attacks of neurological symptoms and
      signs with variable recovery. Eventually the majority of subjects develop a progressive
      clinical course. It is important to carefully initiate and maintain subjects with MS on
      therapy. Information will be gathered in a structured way which will enable easier
      identification of any subgroups of subjects who may be at risk of poor compliance. These risk
      groups could possibly include groups with particular attributes such as poor information at
      the start of treatment, unrealistic expectations or a particular life style. This study will
      be conducted during the contact with the subject necessary to deliver the homecare service.
      Participants will be contacted by Bupa Home Healthcare Multiple Sclerosis subject
      coordinators by telephone to conduct specific questionnaires during the 4 stages of the
      subject's treatment i.e. pre-installation of treatment, post installation of treatment,
      monthly pre delivery of drug and at a subject's end treatment.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To collect subject centric information in line with routine care including subject's
           expectations of therapy, side effect management and lifestyle may influence adherence to
           therapy

        -  To determine whether such factors and/or others affect the successful initiation and
           maintenance of Rebif therapy
