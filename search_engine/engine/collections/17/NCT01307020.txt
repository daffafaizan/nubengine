    
      The aim of this study is to develop a combination of Dexketoprofen Trometamol (DKP.TRIS) and
      Tramadol Hydrochloride (TRAM.HCl) for the treatment of acute moderate to severe pain, based
      on the rationale that more than one drug is necessary in most patients suffering of acute and
      chronic pain, particularly of moderate to severe intensity.

      DKP.TRIS and TRAM.HCl have different mechanisms of action, therefore their combination is
      expect to result in an additive or synergistic analgesia, thus allowing a decrease in the
      required doses of the individual agents, and consequently a reduced risk of adverse events In
      this study, patients who present moderate to severe pain after impacted third mandibular
      molar tooth extraction will be randomised to a total of 10 treatment arms including 4
      combinations of DKP.TRIS + TRAM.HCl, the four corresponding single treatments, placebo and
      ibuprofen. Treatment administration will be followed by a 24-hour pain and analgesic effect
      assessment.
