      powerful drug abuse treatment modality for facilitating change in drug use behaviors. The
      utility of CM as a treatment for waterpipe smoking is logical, but needs to be evaluated as a
      tool in the treatment of waterpipe smoking. The primary objective of this research plan is to
      test the role of CM in promoting abstinence from waterpipe tobacco smoking. The specific aims
      of the research include: specific aim 1: Conduct a feasibility study to test if CM promotes
      abstinence from nicotine delivered through waterpipe; specific aim 2: Characterize
      self-reported nicotine withdrawal symptoms. A randomized clinical trial involving eligible
      participants who are randomly assigned with equal allocation to either Contingency Management
      (CM) or Fixed Rate Control (FRC) will be conducted. A 2-group (CM versus FRC) x 10 (repeated
      measures) mixed-model design will be used. Participants in this study will be followed for 5
      weeks during which smoking abstinence will be measured 10 times. Reinforcement in the form of
      monetary payment delivered contingent on the participant's salivary cotinine will be provided
