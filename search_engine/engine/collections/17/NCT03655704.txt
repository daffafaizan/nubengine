      open-label trial. A 4-week pre-treatment phase will allow ensuring that patients are on
      stable doses of medication. Patients will be given doses of apabetalone 100mg BID for 16
      weeks. Patients will be regularly followed. At baseline and week 16, a cardiac
      catheterization and MRI will assess changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and RV function.
