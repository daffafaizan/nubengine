    
      Objectives: To (1) reduce food insecurity among children; (2) increase enrollment in the
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and other
      nutrition assistance programs; and (3) improve nutrition and healthy shopping habits through
      nutrition education.

      Target Population: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households with children
      under age 5 and incomes below 75 percent of the Federal Poverty Level living in Clark County,
      Las Vegas, Nevada.

      Intervention: SNAP households were randomly assigned to receive either: (1) $40 extra in SNAP
      benefits per eligible child (<5 years) per month; (2) $40 extra in SNAP benefits per eligible
      child per month plus case management and nutrition education; or (3) only regular monthly
      SNAP benefit. The first two groups were the treatment arms and the third was the control
      group.

      The two treatment groups were ultimately combined because of the low uptake of case
      management and nutrition education.
