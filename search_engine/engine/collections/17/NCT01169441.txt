      information will be collected including the subjects demographics, medications, medical,
      cardiovascular and surgical history. During the lead extraction procedure specific data will
      be gathered which includes items such as: total lead length, lead length from insertion site
      to connector end of lead just prior to lead extraction, extraction tools used and the
      physician description of the extraction. The patients will undergo an assessment of
      extraction force up to 3 kilograms maximum to the ICD lead for a specified amount of time
      before the use of laser or extraction sheaths. Extraction forces and approximate times will
      be monitored and recorded throughout the procedure. Forces will be measured by using a force
      gauge. Xrays will be taken to show lead position during movement of the arm at the side,
      above the head and across the chest. Fluoroscopy images of the heart may be saved. The amount
      of extra time added to the case in order to perform this study and collect the data is
      estimated at 10 minutes. Participation in the study is complete following the procedure.
      There is a 30-day follow-up phone call to capture any adverse events which require a clinic
      visit, ER visit or hospitalization.
