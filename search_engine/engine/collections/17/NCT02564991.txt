      The purpose of this protocol is to characterize cerebellar volumes and function in alcoholics
      and recovery of cerebellar volume and function during early abstinence. This study also
      investigates how cerebrocerebellar circuits contribute to cognitive and motor impairment in
      alcoholism.

      Study Population

      Healthy volunteers and Inpatient participants with alcohol use disorders.

      Design

      Participants will receive whole-brain structural imaging and assessment of cerebellar
      function at the time of admission and again at the time of discharge.

      Outcome

      The Primary outcome of this study is to assess recovery of cerebellar structure and function
      at the end of treatment compared to treatment entry measures.
