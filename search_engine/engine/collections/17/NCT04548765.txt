      immunochemical (FIT) kits to at-risk patients is an effective way of increasing CRC testing
      uptake, as this test can be done at home and is less intrusive compared to colonoscopies. As
      part of an existing program, the health system mails FIT kits to eligible patients each year.
      Although this test needs to be conducted annually, not everyone who receives the test kit
      returns the kits for processing. In this study, the researchers aim to test different letters
      with the goal of encouraging the use of FIT kits or scheduling a colonoscopy.

      As part of this study, the kits are mailed with everything the patient will need to conduct
      the test at home and mail a sample back to the hospital. It also includes an introductory
      letter informing the patient about the program and inviting them to use the kit. The
      researchers are comparing a standard version of the introductory letter against 3 versions
      that include different combinations of behavioral nudges, specifically framing effects (loss,
      default, decoy) and fear appeals.
