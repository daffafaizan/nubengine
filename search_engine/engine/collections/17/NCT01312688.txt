    
      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial, approved (now submitted for approval) by the
      Institutional Review Board. Over a period of 2 years, 300 patients with severe sepsis or
      septic shock will be randomized to either the currently accepted standard hemodynamic
      treatment in our ICU or to the standard plus goal-directed therapy according to the Rivers
      protocol and the SSC guidelines, i.e. including the addition of ScvO2 measurements and
      consequently derived treatments to achieve ScvO2 â‰¥70% for the first 6 hours after appearance
      of sepsis or septic shock in the ICU (Fig. 2).

      After the first 6 hours all patients in septic shock (62% of the patients according to our
      preliminary data) will be monitored by continuous cardiac output monitoring. Additionally,
      all patients will be followed daily by transthoracic echocardiography for up 19 to 5 days
      (Fig 3). Since the patients themselves will not be able to sign an informed consent, the
      inclusion to the study will be approved by the attending physician in charge of the ICU who
      will also be able to decide on stopping the study protocol at any time according to his
      clinical judgment as to the best interest of the patient.
