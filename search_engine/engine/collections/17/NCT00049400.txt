        -  Determine the levels of hepatic impairment at which dose modifications of ixabepilone
           are required in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas and varying levels of
           liver dysfunction.

        -  Determine the effect of hepatic dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug at varying levels of hepatic dysfunction in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      liver function (normal vs mild dysfunction vs moderate dysfunction vs severe dysfunction).

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at
      least 6 but no more than 12 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-84 patients (6-12 for stratum 1; 2-18 for stratum 2; 2-24
      for stratum 3; and 2-30 for stratum 4) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
