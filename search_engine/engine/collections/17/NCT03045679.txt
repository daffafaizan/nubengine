    
      OAGB/MGB is gaining popularity as a primary surgical treatment for morbid obesity due to
      reduced operation time, a shorter learning curve, better weight loss, higher metabolic impact
      and fewer major complications compared to RYGB.

      In this prospective randomized controlled trial we want to compare OAGB/MGB and RYGB with a
      FU of up to 24 month.

      Patients with indication for gastric bypass get randomized in group A (RYGB, n = 50) or B
      (OAGB/MGB, n = 50). FU is performed 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month after surgery.
