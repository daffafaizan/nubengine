      strawberries, elderberry juice and whortleberry extracts, and purified anthocyanins from a
      mixture of blackcurrant and bilberry have been shown to beneficially alter biological markers
      for CVD risk, with beneficial effects on lipid profiles common across these studies.

      In a randomized 3 phase crossover study we aim to recruit 50 participants (men and women)
      aged 45 years or more with a higher than optimal blood cholesterol level to consume capsules
      containing (i) 320 mg anthocyanins derived from bilberry fruit (delphinidin type), (ii) 320
      mg anthocyanins derived from black rice (cyanidin type) and (iii) a placebo control. Each
      treatment will be ingested for 28 days with a wash-out period of 4 weeks in-between. Blood
      samples will be collected at the start and end of each 28-day treatment period to assess
      lipid status. In a subset of participants we will also investigate the relationship between
      bilberry and black rice anthocyanin ingestion on RNA expression profiles that are known to be
      involved in atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and reverse cholesterol
      transport as well as faecal excretion of bile acids and lipids.
