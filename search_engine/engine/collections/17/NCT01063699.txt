      A prospective observational study to compare survival with own liver in laparoscopic versus
      conventional Kasai portoenterostomy in patients with biliary atresia.

      Summary Background Data:

      Available studies on laparoscopic versus conventional Kasai portoenterostomy focus on
      short-term results, include limited numbers of patients and have design limitations.

      Methods:

      A consecutive series of patients underwent laparoscopic Kasai procedure from 2006 to 2007.
      Conventionally operated control patients consisted of a consecutive series of infants with
      biliary atresia operated from August 2003 to 2006. All data were ascertained prospectively
      using the European Biliary Atresia Registry / EBAR registration forms. Primary outcome
      measure was survival with own liver 6 months after Kasai without being listed for liver
      transplantation. An interim analysis was planned after data became available for the first 12
      patients who underwent laparoscopic Kasai procedure. In case of a significantly different
      interim outcome the follow-up period should be extended to 24 months until a final decision
      should be drawn.
