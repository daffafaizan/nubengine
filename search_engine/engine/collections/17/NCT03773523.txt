      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) input to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; Gruber, Hussain, and
      O'Donnell 2009). DLPFC stimulation may increase input to NAcc to facilitate proper selection
      of goal-directed behavior and may also decrease craving in individuals with substance use
      disorder (Boggio et al. 2008).

      We will use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the DLPFC. TDCS is a
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate brain connectivity. TDCS involves
      applying a weak electrical current (2mA or less) to the scalp via anodal and cathodal
      electrode sponges, causing either increases or decreases in cortical excitability,
      respectively. Research has shown in both healthy subjects and patients (e.g. Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression) that tDCS has the potential to modulate
      synaptic strengthening and neurotransmitter-dependent plasticity underlying changes in
      behavior and learning (Lang et al. 2005).

      We are anticipating enrollment of 30 participants. Fifteen participants will be randomly
      assigned to the interventional tDCS condition, while 15 participants will be randomly
      assigned to sham tDCS. Both conditions will undergo five sessions of tDCS across five days.
      Participants will undergo pre- and post-tDCS MRI scans, in addition to clinical interviews
      and questionnaires. Follow-up interviews will be conducted in person 1 and 2 months after
      intervention completion to inquire about relapse status.
