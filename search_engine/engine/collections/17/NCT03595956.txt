      gender affirmation delivered in primary care improves HIV-related outcomes for transgender
      patients. Medical gender affirmation therapies-hormones and surgical interventions-are
      medically necessary treatments shown to improve psychological functioning and quality of life
      for transgender patients. It is not yet known whether these treatments improve HIV-related
      outcomes over time because studies providing the best evidence of medical gender
      affirmation's clinical effectiveness do not examine HIV-related outcomes in transgender adult
      patients. To fill this gap, the proposed study will prospectively evaluate the effects of
      medical gender affirmation delivered in primary care on HIV-related outcomes in a multi-site
      clinic-based cohort of 4,500 diverse transgender patients from two urban U.S. health centers
      who are leaders in transgender healthcare. Transgender adult primary care patients at Fenway
      Health in Boston, MA and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, NY will be
      enrolled over 12 months and followed prospectively for 12 months. Bio-behavioral data will be
      linked, including electronic patient-reported outcomes (baseline, 6-month, 12-month
      assessments), and electronic health record (EHR) data.
