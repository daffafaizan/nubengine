      aneurysms embolization" was sponsored by Zhuhai Tongqiao Medical Technology Co., Ltd. The
      team leader is Shanghai Changhai Hospital and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang
      University School of Medicine. The trial design is: prospective, multi-center, randomized,
      open, parallel positive control, and non-inferiority test. Purpose: To compare the data
      obtained by using the coil system produced by Zhuhai Tongqiao Medical Technology Co., Ltd.
      and the Axium Detachable Coil produced by Medtronic for the embolization of intracranial
      aneurysms to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of coil system for intracranial aneurysms
      embolization. Sample: 228 cases. The subjects will be randomly assigned to the test group or
      the control group, with 114 cases in each group.
