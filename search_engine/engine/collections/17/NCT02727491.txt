      assent, pediatric patients (ages 3-12) undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (under
      standardized anesthesia) will be randomized to receive dextromethorphan hydrobromide (1mg/kg
      orally) 30 min preoperatively and again 8 hours postoperatively OR placebo (syrup identical
      in taste, appearance and volume) at the same time points. The primary outcome is an
      integrated assessment of perioperative pain scores and opioid use for 24 hours
      postoperatively. Pain scores were collected preoperatively at rest and then at 1,2,3,8,9,10
      and 24 hours postoperatively using the validated Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain
      Scale (CHEOPS). Secondary outcomes include nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and
      bleeding recorded by blinded observers for 24 hours postoperatively.

      Our hypothesis is that dextromethorphan will decrease the incidence/severity of
      post-tonsillectomy pain. The improved pain control will be apparent through reduced opioid
      consumption and integrated pain scores. This will result in a reduced incidence of
      opioid-related side effects and adverse events.
