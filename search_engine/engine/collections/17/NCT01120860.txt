      understand individual differences in performance of a complex attention-demanding task, such
      as flying a plane or driving a car. Other predictors of change in performance of a complex
      task may include simple tests of processing speed and working memory, past training and
      recent practice of the task, and genetic risk factors for degenerative brain disease. In this
      project, we will examine whether baseline MR measures are as useful as longitudinal MR
      measures in predicting amount of change over time in task performance.

      This research is part of a long-term effort to achieve earlier identification of individuals
      at risk of decline and ultimately minimize loss of function.
