    
      A randomized controlled trial with four to five weeks of moderate/high intensity aerobic
      exercise program compared with no intervention for 32 prostate cancer patients waiting for
      radical prostatectomy at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN). 16 patients will
      undergo the intervention. The expression of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole in the prostate
      specimens of intervention groups and the control groups will be assessed. This method is
      considered a reliable tissue oxygenation measurement technique. These patients will also have
      their and blood flow and hypoxia measured in prostate cancers through magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRIs).
