    
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of a new
      ablation catheter called the Durablateâ„¢ Saline Enhanced Radiofrequency (SERF) catheter. This
      catheter is being studied to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients who have already
      been treated with medicine, have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and had an
      ablation procedure to treat their VT but continue to experience VT despite these treatments.
      A VT ablation procedure is done by finding the abnormal heart tissue that's causing the VT
      and applying energy with the tip of an ablation catheter to the area to create a scar or
      destroy the tissue that causes the VT. The SERF catheter being used in this study uses a
      needle to deliver heated saline (salt water) and radiofrequency energy deeper into the heart
      tissue that is causing the VT than a standard ablation catheter.
