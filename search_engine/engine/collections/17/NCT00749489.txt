      nerve blocks (FNB) and fascia iliaca blocks (FIB), on the treatment of peri-operative acute
      hip (femoral neck, intertrochanteric) fracture pain. Patients age 60 years and over
      presenting to two New York City emergency departments with hip fracture will be randomized to
      receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention includes single injection FNB in the
      ED followed by insertion of a continuous FIB catheter within 24 hours of the single injection
      FNB plus "as needed" non-opioid/opioid analgesia. Usual care patients will receive
      conventional therapy with regularly scheduled intravenous or oral opioids plus "as needed"
      non/opioids/opioids. We will examine the impact of the intervention on patients' self
      reported pain intensity; systemic opioid requirements; post-operative function; incidence of
      delirium, treatment related side effects; and hospital length of stay and participation in
      physical therapy.
