      clinical diabetes care, and diabetes distress is found to be associated with decreased
      glycemic control. Therefore, regular assessment of diabetes distress is recommended. The
      integration of assessments with Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in clinical
      practice has the potential to enhance care for people with diabetes by identifying problems
      and improving patient-clinician communication. The overall aim of the DiaPROM trial is to
      develop, test and evaluate the effectiveness of a structured empowerment-based intervention
      with the use of a PROM regarding diabetes distress as a tool for needs assessment and
      dialogue support in clinical diabetes consultations among adults with Type 1 Diabetes. The
      investigator's hypothesis is that the intervention primarily will reduce diabetes distress
      and secondarily improve overall well-being, improve the perceived competence for diabetes
      management, improve glycemic control, and improve satisfaction with the diabetes follow-up.
