      following significant blood loss, or for maintenance fluid requirements. Severe blood loss
      can lead to anemia, reduced oxygen carrying capacity, and organ failure. Options for fluid
      replacement include red blood cell transfusion, colloids such as hydroxyethyl starches (HES),
      albumin, and gelatin as well as crystalloids such as normal saline and Ringer's lactate.
      Until recently, use of HES at the London hospitals and other major health sciences centers
      was concentrated in cardiac surgery patients and non-critically ill perioperative patients.
      In April 2013, the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) opted to discontinue the use of HES
      altogether, based on evidence suggesting that HES may be harmful compared to alternative
      fluid therapies.

      The decision to disinvest in HES became effective on April 2, 2013. The hospitals no longer
      purchased HES, and clinicians used alternative fluids for volume resuscitation. Alternatives
      available at the hospitals included Ringer's lactate, normal saline, and albumin. All HES
      product was removed from patient care areas.

      The investigators will perform a before/after analysis of the impact of HES disinvestment
      using a retrospective observational cohort study design, employing data obtained from
      administrative and clinical databases. Exposure to HES before disinvestment will be assumed
      to be 100% of cardiac surgical patients, and, after a washout period surrounding the time of
      disinvestment, exposure to HES will be assumed to be 0% after disinvestment.

      The study population will be defined retrospectively in terms of the intervention received
      and the time period of the intervention.
