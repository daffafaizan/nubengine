      self-confidence, greater optimism, and better regulation of our decision-making. The goal is
      to test whether positive emotional induction could improve decision-making in Parkinson's
      disease.

      Listening to music would decrease anxiety levels and increase self-esteem levels. Who says
      Parkinson says dopamine deficiency and so the investigators can think that the investigators
      can help patients by inducing a positive emotion through musical stimulation.

      All participants will be subject to emotional induction. They will be divided into two
      different conditions: either they will be induced in a positive state, or they will be
      maintained in a neutral state. For this, video clips (positive or neutral) containing music
      will be presented. Immediately after the presentation of the video, participants will have to
      perform the Iowa Gambling Task test. This is a sequential task to evaluate decision-making
      capabilities.
