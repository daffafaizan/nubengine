      transfusion, while others may not. The main purpose of this survey study is to determine
      whether it is possible to use quality of life changes - as measured by a validated
      questionnaire - experienced by individual patients to help physicians and patients with MDS
      make decisions regarding future blood transfusions. This research is being done because the
      investigators hope to help doctors better understand the impact of blood transfusions on the
      quality of life of each patient.

      The study uses a standardized MDS-specific quality of life questionnaire that participants
      will fill out before and after an upcoming transfusion. The investigators will compare the
      scores of these questionnaires and notify both the participant and provider if the
      participant has experienced any changes (positive or negative) in his/her quality of life
      before and after transfusion. The investigators' hope is that doctor-patient teams will use
      this quality of life information to determine whether the participant should continue
      receiving transfusions, decrease the frequency of transfusions, or stop receiving
      transfusions altogether if not needed.
