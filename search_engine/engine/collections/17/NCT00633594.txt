      but feasibility and tolerability has been demonstrated in patients with multiple myeloma.
      Thus, almost every 2-drug combination of rituximab, lenalidomide, and bortezomib has been
      tested, or is being tested. We hypothesize that all three drugs are important in MCL, and
      therefore propose to combine all 3 agents (rituximab, bortezomib, and lenalidomide) in a
      schedule that is convenient to lymphoma patients.

      Approximately 18 patients may be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study. Approximately
      45 patients are planned for enrollment in Phase II.
