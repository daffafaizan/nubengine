    
      Volleyball attackers with clinically identified scapular dyskinesis and with/without shoulder
      symptoms will be compared with respect to performance outcomes and scapular kinematics.

      Performance will be assessed by means of the unilateral seated shot put test (USSPT), the
      upper quarter Y balance test (UQYBT), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, sports
      module (DASH). Pain measurements after completing physical performance measures will be
      assessed and rated. Relationships between physical (USSPT, UQYBT) and self-perceived (DASH)
      measures of performance, and with impairment-based measures (clinical measures and 3D
      shoulder kinematics) will be assessed.
