      life. Nowadays there are several researches on vitamin D functions. Recently review article
      of vitamin D deficiency by Holick MF., stated that vitamin D can play a role in decreasing
      the risk of osteoporosis and other chronic diseases such as malignancy, autoimmune disease,
      infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, and psoriasis. Moreover, vitamin D effects on
      keratinocyte by decreasing abnormal cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
      controlling immunological process via the suppression of T-cell activation, regulation of
      cytokine secretion patterns, induction of regulatory T-cell, modulation of T-cell
      proliferation and interference with T-cell apoptosis.

      Thus, our objective is to look for other alternative treatment, which may have less side
      effects and acceptable clinical outcomes.
