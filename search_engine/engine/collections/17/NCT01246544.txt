      a shared European opinion of what currently is both worth doing and practical to improve
      patient safety in anaesthesiology in 2010. The Declaration recommends practical steps that
      all anaesthesiologists who are not already using them should include in their own practice.
      These are relatively straightforward and where they are currently being used have a track
      record of improving patient safety. All European anaesthesiology institutions are expected to
      support the World Health Organization(WHO) 'Safe Surgery Saves Lives' initiative including
      the "Safe Surgery Checklist". The Declaration was endorsed by European Board of
      Anaesthesiology (EBA) and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA). It was officially
      launched at the Euroanaesthesia congress in Helsinki in June 2010 and was subsequently signed
      by several representatives of European anaesthesiology and different additional stakeholders
      (WHO, World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA), European Patients
      Federation (EPF)).

      In cooperation with INABBRA (Innovation Alliance Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany) the
      investigators would like to ask medical colleagues in the region to participate in an
      anonymous German online survey on patient safety.

      The investigators want to investigate the implementation and establishment of measures on
      patient safety, that anaesthesiologists utilize to fulfill their obligations under the
      perspective of the Declaration.
