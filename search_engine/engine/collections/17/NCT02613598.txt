      improve upon current efficacy rates new treatment modalities are needed. Currently modalities
      based upon targeting specific pathway and molecular receptors have made the greatest impact
      in the outcomes of refractory patients.

      The JAK-Stat pathway and NF-κB are two such targets that have been shown to fuel the
      malignant transformation and growth of both myeloma and lymphoma. Blockade of key points in
      these molecular pathways has the potential of halting the pro-survival machinery. Combined
      inhibition of JAK/Stat and NF-κB may lead to synergistic effects as well as possibly
      mitigating some of the mechanisms of resistance to either agent. In this proposal, the
      investigators aim to utilize the JAK/Stat inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi) and proteasome
      inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) to target two major pathways of malignant transformation in
      hematologic malignancies.

      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) in combination with standard dose Bortezomib (Velcade) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

      The University of Michigan will enroll 24 subjects. Eligible subjects will have
      histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin and Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma excluding
      Burkitt, CLL and lymphoblastic lymphoma that is considered to have relapsed or to be
      refractory to primary chemotherapy. Any prior exposure to Jakafi is excluded.
