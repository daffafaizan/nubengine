      limited at best in the fetus and newborn but increases over the first year of life to levels
      in toddlers and young children that generally exceed adult capacity. There are several
      situations where examination of clinical PK data has revealed discernable patterns of drug
      clearance that can be attributed to developmental differences in drug biotransformation. It
      has become apparent that there are developmental differences in expression among drug
      metabolizing enzyme families (cytochromes P450 or "CYPs", etc.) Furthermore, individual drug
      metabolizing enzymes with in a family may have unique developmental profiles that influence
      the therapeutic response, desired or undesired, to a given agent.

      All subjects will have a single 5 ml venous blood sample taken upon admission to the study.
      All subjects will be given a single oral dose of caffeine and dextromethorphan. Patients will
      be allowed to consume their normal age appropriate diet around the time of study drug
      administration and through the sample collection periods. All spontaneously voided urine will
      be collected for a period of 12 hours following the caffeine and dextromethorphan
      administration

      The specific aim of this proposal is to extend the current longitudinal investigation into
      the preschool age group (1 to 5 years of age). The developmental profile of CYPs, 1A2, 2D6,
      and 3A4 will be determined by caffeine and dextromethorphan phenotyping procedures. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the age/developmental stage at which the CYP2 1A2, 2D6
      and 3A4 activities exceed adult activities.
