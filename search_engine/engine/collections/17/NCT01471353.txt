    
      The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is an important mediator of responses to growth factors, and a strong
      inducer of genes involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis in
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Inhibition of this pathway has been previously proven to
      be highly clinically beneficial for patients with this disease. It has also been clearly
      demonstrated that the inhibition of VEGF, when coupled with cytotoxic therapy and/or
      continued beyond initial response, can improve clinical outcomes and survival in this same
      cohort of patients. Safety and pharmacokinetic data have already been established for this
      novel doublet oral chemotherapy. This study is intended to determine the activity of a
      combination of oral fluoropyrimidine plus sorafenib in an advanced mCRC patient population
      for whom limited treatment options remain.
