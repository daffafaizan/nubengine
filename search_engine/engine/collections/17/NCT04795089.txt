      neurosurgical departments of University Hospital of Linköping, are included. Before operation
      and 3 months postoperatively, the patient´s gait pattern are analyzed with RehaGait analysis
      system. The patients also fill in a questionnaire about SOC, QoL and symptoms of depression
      and anxiety at these assessment sessions. Additionally at the follow up, the patients are
      grading their overall experienced change and specified changes in gait, balance, continence
      and neuropsychology with the global Rating of Change Scale (GRC-scale). At baseline and at
      follow up, the patients also perform the ordinary clinical assessments with measurements
      covering the domains gait, balance, continence and neuropsychology in the iNPH-scale. A
      convenience sample of Healthy individuals aged > 60 years, conduct the same questionnaires:
      SOC, QoL and symptoms of depression and anxiety and perform the RehaGait analysis system
