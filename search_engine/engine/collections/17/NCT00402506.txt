      survival, and a better quality of life in specific subgroups of patients with obstructive
      coronary artery disease. Due to the high incidence of coronary artery disease worldwide, as
      well as the effectiveness of the surgical procedure, CABG surgery makes up one of the top ten
      most frequently performed procedures in North America and Europe. In the United States it is
      estimated that approximately 467,000 CABG procedures were performed in 2003.

      Despite the benefits of CABG surgery, patients undergoing these procedures may also suffer
      serious adverse outcomes including operative mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable
      angina, ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, and stroke.
      Some of the proposed causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG include
      perioperative ischemia, inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury. The impact
      of these serious complications is significant. Incidence rates of death and MI following CABG
      surgery range from 5% to 12% depending on risk status. Results from large clinical trials
      have recently demonstrated the importance of neurologic deficits as a problematic outcome of
      CABG. These deficits include memory impairment, psychomotor, visuospatial, attention and
      language abilities as measured by neuropsychological testing as well as sensorimotor
      abnormalities associated with stroke.

      MC-1 is a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin B6. Evidence from pre-clinical and
      clinical studies suggests that MC-1 protects the heart from ischemic damage and
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. This trial will assess the cardioprotective effects of MC-1
      compared to placebo in patients undergoing high-risk CABG surgery.
