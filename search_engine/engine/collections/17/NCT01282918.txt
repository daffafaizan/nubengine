      patients that did receive defibrillation (DF) testing and those who did not receive DF
      testing during ICD implantation. The NORDIC ICD study will evaluate the impact of
      intra-operative DF testing on the long-term ICD first shock efficacy for true ventricular
      tachyarrhythmias in the observational period. Therefore, the primary analysis of this study
      will consider all ventricular tachyarrhythmia episodes treated by ICD shock(s) during the
      trial follow-up period.

      Moreover, the Home MonitoringTM system of BIOTRONIK will be used in order to monitor the
      technical system integrity, device programming and cardiac performance continuously. It
      supports early information about the occurrence of VT/VF (Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular
      Fibrillation) episodes and corresponding therapies such as ICD shocks. The Home MonitoringTM
      capability offered by active implants has the potential to detect some of these trends early
      and thus to offer the possibility to intervene in time for prevention of fatal worsening of
      cardiac performance.

      1077 patients were enrolled and randomized (1:1) in 48 centers in five European countries
      (Germany, Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden and Latvia).
