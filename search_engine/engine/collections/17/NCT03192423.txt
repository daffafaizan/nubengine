      decreased psychomotor performance, and impaired performance. Although some levels of
      increased stress response might be beneficial, there seems to be an upper-limit when
      performance is reduced.

      According to the Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress (CATS), the stress sensation arises
      when the requirements exceed the resources for a given task. For the LP procedure, a stress
      sensation among novice residents might arise due to the combination of the LP being a complex
      procedure depending on both technical as non-technical aspects combined with residents
      uncertainties for procedural performance and a fear of doing harm.

      Despite a growing recognition of stress among residents, the acute mental stress of residents
      performing invasive procedures has been unacknowledged. Within neurology, internal medicine,
      and emergency medicine a particular subject for this stress might pertain to residents' first
      performance of the lumbar puncture.

      However, for non-surgical invasive procedures as the LP, there is a lack of evidence for
      measurements of AMS across experience levels and how this potential stress might influence
      the performance and patient related outcomes.

      Hence, the aim of this study is to explore stress levels across lumbar puncture experience
      levels and how this potential stress might affect procedural performance and the patients'
      experience of stress and outcomes of the procedure. Additionally, the study will explore a
      potential correlation between patient stress and the risk of developing post-dural puncture
      headache.
