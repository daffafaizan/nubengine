    
      The team plan to conduct research to look at the effectiveness and safety of mesenchymal stem
      cell implantation therapy in intervertebral disc degeneration patients.

      The use of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells from the umbilical cord was chosen because
      patients with degeneration of the intervertebral disc are elderly (over 50 years old) so that
      autologous mesenchymal stem cell administration is not possible in terms of taking the source
      of cells (bone marrow) nor the quality of mesenchymal stem cells obtained.

      This study will assess the improvement of clinical symptoms (VAS to assess pain scale, ASIA
      and Frankel scale, as well as assessment of the widening of the lumbar region using the
      Schober Test), changes in the structure of the intervertebral discs (through MRI examination
      and grading the degree of intervertebral disc degeneration), conduction function spinal cord
      nerve (somatosensory evoked potential / SSEP), myelography / EMG, and assessment of the
      quality of life status of patients using the Oswestry Disability Index.
