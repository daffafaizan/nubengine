      smokers with mental health conditions (MHC) by integrating the Quit and Stay Quit Monday
      Model into smoking cessation services for this vulnerable population.

      The investigator will conduct a two-group, parallel-randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      target population will be generated by the NYU Langone electronic medical record (EMR). The
      investigator will proactively contact patients to offer enrollment and randomize participants
      1:1 to one of two groups (n=50/group): (1) Quit and Stay Quit Monday Model or (2) Usual Care.
      For evaluation, phone surveys will be conducted at baseline and 3-months to assess quit
      attempts, intervention satisfaction, and smoking cessation.
