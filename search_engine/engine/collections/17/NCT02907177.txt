      20 mg vs placebo in adult participants with active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) who are
      treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Approximately 600 participants who have been receiving
      DMF for at least 6 months will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ponesimod 20 mg or placebo.
      The study consists of the following study periods: Pre-randomization period; Treatment
      period; Post-treatment observation period. The study includes one ponesimod treatment arm at
      the maintenance dose of 20 mg o.d. corresponding to the optimal dose when used as monotherapy
      based on the Phase 2 dose-finding trial and its ongoing extension. The study includes a
      placebo comparator arm, but all patients will remain on DMF background therapy throughout the
      study. Moreover, participants who experience a confirmed relapse or an event of 24-week
      confirmed disability accumulation (DMF) while on study drug will have the option to switch to
      an alternative treatment. The treatment period has a variable duration from a minimum of 60
      weeks (for the last subject randomized) to a maximum of 156 weeks for the first subjects
      randomized in the trial and includes a gradual up-titration of ponesimod from a 2 mg starting
      dose to a 20 mg maintenance dose over a period of 14 days. The total duration of the study
      will be approximately up to 167 weeks.
