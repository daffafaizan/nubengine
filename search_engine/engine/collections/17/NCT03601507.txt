      I. To assess the preliminary efficacy of neoadjuvant Alpelisib (BYL719) in patients with
      transorally-resectable, HPV+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as measured by
      quantitative change in tumor size (change in T) following 14-21 days of treatment.

      II. To evaluate the relationship between genomic PIK3CA activation to change in T.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the tolerability of brief neoadjuvant exposure to BYL719. II. To assess the
      effect of BYL719 on the tumoral Ki-67 proliferation index. III. To evaluate viral and
      molecular mediators of response and resistance to BYL719, including viral messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA), E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and phosphorylated (p)HER3.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive Alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-21 days in the absence of
      disease progression of unacceptable toxicity and then undergo surgery. Participants may
      receive Alpelisib for up to 28 days if surgery is delayed.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 12 weeks.
