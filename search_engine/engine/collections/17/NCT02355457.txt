    
      The primary aim of the study is to detect and evaluate new cardiac biomarkers, evaluate and
      improve acute coronary syndrome (ACS) risk scores, which takes into account clinical, gender
      specific, psycho-social and lifestyle-risk factors, protein patterns and genetic variability
      in addition to the classical risk factors with respect to the primary endpoint of acute
      myocardial infarction.

      Secondary study aims are :

        -  To provide estimates for the incidence of ACS in patients presenting with recent onset
           chest pain;

        -  To provide accurate, quantifiable measures of precursors of ACS;

        -  DNA, RNA, cells, and serum/plasma for comprehensive genetic, gene expression and
           proteomic studies

        -  To explore the impact of ACS candidate genes on cardiovascular risk stratification by
           using genome-wide analyses and a biological systems approach;

        -  To explore proteins relevant for ACS;

        -  To allow the identification of new therapeutic targets;

        -  To evaluate the impact of socio-economic factors on ACS and CAD risk.

      Patients will be followed up during the hospital stay. Afterwards a telephone follow-up will
      take place after 30 days, 6, 24 and 48 months.
