      the palliative care process. It is emphasized that from the very start of palliative care
      process until grievance stage, patient relatives require a myriad of physical, psychological,
      social and spiritual needs. It has been widely reported that among relatives of palliative
      care patients, there is a high incidence of mental distress, depression, anxiety, sleep
      disturbance, fear and despair. The maintain of hope and spiritual well-being are important in
      dealing with this difficult process. Accordingly, nursing care is important, which supports
      the hope and spiritual well-being of patients' relatives. Nursing care that supports hope and
      focuses on spiritual dimensions is important in Watson's Human Care Theory.
