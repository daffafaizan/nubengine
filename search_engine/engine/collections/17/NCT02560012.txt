      of algorithm-based allocation (based on genomic/proteomic profile) of first-line therapy in
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      After eligibility review, patients will receive one of the four first-line therapy agents
      based on their tumor's molecular profile as determined using fresh biopsy tissue from an
      accessible metastatic site. Upon disease progression, patients will then receive one of two
      second-line agents based on their tumor's molecular profile.

      Because this is a proof-of-concept study, the sample size is based on feasibility of accrual.
      The clinic should be able to recruit 100 patients within a reasonable timeframe for the
      study. The number of patients receiving each drug will vary based on the frequency of
      molecular alterations in the population. Therefore, groups will not be compared with one
      another - the research goal is to determine whether the progression-free survival (PFS) for
      each drug is improved over the PFS reported in FDA approval trials for each drug when they
      are assigned based on molecular analysis.
