    
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and multicenter clinical trial.
      Three hundred sixty postoperative patients with colon cancer stage IIa-IIIc will be randomly
      assigned into treatment group I, treatment group II and placebo-control group, taking Huangqi
      Guizhi Wuwu granules, Danggui Sini granules and the mimetic granules of Yiqi Wenjing granules
      respectively. All subjects will receive mFOLFOX6 or FOLFOX4 or XELOX chemotherapy regimen
      along with traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) or placebo treatment per day for at least three
      months and one year follow up. EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 will be used to assess the degree of
      peripheral neuropathy as the primary outcome measure. Grades of OIPN evaluated by NCI-CTCAE
      5.0, quality of life evaluated by EORTC QLQ-C30, chemotherapeutic efficacy evaluated by
      RESIST 1.1, and the number of completed chemotherapy cycles are selected as the secondary
      outcome measures.
