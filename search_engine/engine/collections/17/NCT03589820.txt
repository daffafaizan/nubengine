      leads to its accumulation, particularly in liver and brain. Presenting symptoms of liver
      disease can be highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic, with only biochemical
      abnormalities, to overt cirrhosis with all its complications. Acute liver failure (ALF)
      presentation is the most dramatic and may arise with catastrophic suddenness. It is
      considered rare, constituting only 3% of ALF cases in the pediatric ALF series in USA and
      associated with a high mortality reaching 95%. Patients with acute liver failure due to WD
      require liver transplantation, which is lifesaving. Kido J et al reported clinical outcomes
      of patients with liver failure were improved by artificial liver support system using
      combination of plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration. So the investigators design
      this protocol: 30 patients will receive treatment of plasma exchange and continuous
      hemodiafiltration and internal medicine, 30 patients will receive treatment of internal
      medicine.
