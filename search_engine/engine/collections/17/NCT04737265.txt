    
      This is a randomized, open-label pilot trial of a biomarker-guided strategy using NT-proBNP
      to identify and treat patients with a high risk of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity.
      Patients will be enrolled and randomized prior to initiation of anthracycline-based therapy
      and followed for 12 months with blood samples, echocardiography, and patient reported
      outcomes surveys. The overall hypothesis is that a biomarker guided treatment strategy that
      initiates neurohormonal antagonists in breast cancer or lymphoma patients who have increases
      in NT-proBNP prior to, during, or after anthracyclines will be feasible, well-tolerated, and
      result in attenuation of cardiotoxicity, compared to standard care.
