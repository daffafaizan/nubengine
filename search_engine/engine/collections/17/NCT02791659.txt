      ERCP procedure. The real-time effective doses were displayed at a monitoring screen. A
      dosimeter was attached outside thyroid collar of each ERCP team member included of 1st
      endoscopist, 2nd endoscopist, and nurse anesthetist.

      Patients' age, gender, BMI, body thickness, and indications for ERCP were recorded. The
      patients were randomized into 2 groups by block-of-four. The patients' position was assigned
      to prone or left lateral decubitus. Each ERCP personnel wore a lead apron and the dosimeter
      was attached outside the thyroid collar. The ERCP procedure was performed according to the
      indication in a standard technique. After ERCP procedure, the total fluoroscopic time
      (minute), fluoroscopy tube voltage (kV), fluoroscopy tube current (mA), patient entrance skin
      dose (mGy) and personnel effective dose (Sv) from each dosimeter were recorded.

      Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test or Man Whitney U-test, where
      appropriate. Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square or the Fisher exact test.
      Statistical analysis was calculated by using SPSS statistical software (version17 for Window,
      Chicago, USA) and two sided p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistical significant.
