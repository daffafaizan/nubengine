      the creation of bacterial biofilms around the device, host characteristics (comorbidities,
      surgery, antibiotic exposure) and, finally, immunological factors (including modulation of
      cytokine expression). In this study, patients mechanically ventilated for non-pulmonary
      reasons, will be followed up to 15 days of ventilation, estubation or death (whichever comes
      first). For microbiota analysis, all patients who develop VAP in the first 15 days of MV will
      be selected and matched (1:1; by center, gender, age (+/- 10 years), reason for intubation,
      duration of intubation), with a patient who do not developed VAP during MV. The optimal
      matching algorithm will be used to identify the control group that minimizes the total
      intra-pair dissimilarity.

      The investigators plan to enroll about 700 MV patients for non-pulmonary conditions in order
      to describe VAP and non-VAP patients' characteristics identify. The investigators estimate
      that at least 70 patients will develop VAP in the first 15 days of MV. Microbiota and
      immunological analysis will be longitudinally performed on tracheal aspirate samples and
      oro-pharyngeal swab. The investigators will performe microbiota analyses on tracheal aspirate
      and oropharyngeal swab according to the following time schedule:

        -  VAP patient, 3 times: intubation (T0), the 24h before VAP development (T pre-VAP) and at
           VAP development (T-VAP).

        -  non-VAP patient, 2 times: intubation (T0) and a second sample, selected at the time
           point (day), corresponding to T-VAP of his/her matched VAP-patient (T no-VAP).

      The investigators will perform immunological analysis on tracheal aspirate for all patients
      at intubation and at T-VAP or T no-VAP time.
