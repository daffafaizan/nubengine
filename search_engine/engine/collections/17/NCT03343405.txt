      infertile if conception has not occurred after 12 months of having regular, unprotected
      intercourse. Over six million couples in the United States are affected by infertility.
      Research suggests that there is a relationship between psychological distress and
      infertility, but the relationship is complex. The information from this study will be used to
      better understand the relationship between psychological distress and infertility among
      couples. Furthermore, the investigators are interested in testing Dr. Alice Domar's Mind/Body
      Fertility Program that was designed to help individuals regain control of their life and
      learn new lifestyle habits that can increase their chances of conceiving. There is evidence
      that individuals that participated in the group format of this treatment protocol showed
      statistically significant decreases in physical and psychological symptoms of stress and
      increases in conception rates. Our primary goals are to evaluate patients willingness to be
      recruited and randomized as well as their adherence and attrition to the program. Our
      secondary goals are to evaluate reductions in emotional distress (i.e., anxiety, depression,
      and stress) and enhance emotion regulation skills as well as pregnancy rates.
