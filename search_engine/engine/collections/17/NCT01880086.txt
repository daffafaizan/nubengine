      patients with chronic pain are responsive to first-line combination of physical modalities
      and non-opioid analgesics. Up to 20% of these patients, however, require opioid therapy for
      adequate pain relief. The use of long-acting opioids, including morphine sulfate, oxycodone,
      fentanyl, and methadone, although effective for pain control, carries risks of addiction,
      tolerance, and systemic side effects including nausea, itching, constipation, and
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with consequent testosterone depletion (in up to 86% of
      patients taking chronic pain medication) leading to the multiple adverse effects.
      Opioid-induced androgen deficiency (OPIAD), occurs with high frequency and persistence, and
      commonly remains undiagnosed in the pain clinic. Low testosterone may be treated using
      exogenous testosterone (topical or gel) or other medications such as selective estrogen
      receptor modulators (i.e. clomiphene citrate). While both medication types increase serum
      testosterone levels, clomiphene citrate is known to benefit sperm parameters in hypogonadal
      men while exogenous testosterone is known to inhibit sperm production. Few studies have
      examined the hormonal changes caused by long-term opioid usage in men, and no studies have
      formally studied clomiphene citrate for this patient population.
