      In a world of sports where the speed of recovery means a lot, ways are sought first and
      foremost to minimize the frequency of non-contact injuries. To prevent certain things, it is
      important to know the initial state, therefore, to see if certain factors at the outset
      indicate to us that there is a certain imbalance that can result in the injury. Since we live
      in a country where sports clubs are unable to spend large amounts of money on rehabilitation,
      it would be of great benefit to find reliable tests that can help to prevent an injury.
      Studies have shown that tests of balance, flexibility, and agility can help to prevent injury
      to football players in other countries. The same tests will be applied to Premier League
      footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and their effectiveness in assessing the degree of risk
      of lower limb injuries will be tested. If they prove reliable, they can become a standard in
      the prevention of these injuries, that is, they will help in the development of injury
      prevention programs, which would be of great benefit to both clubs and football players.

      The study aims to determine whether dynamic balance and flexibility tests can be used as
      reliable predictors of lower limb injuries in football players and whether reduced agility
      influences the increased risk of injury.
