      in the treatment of an acute migraine attack. Data will be collected on the efficacy of IVIb
      in subjects who are treated with study medication between 2 and 72 hours from time of onset
      of headache.

      Periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be performed prior to and after study drug
      administration.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the proportion of subjects in the 2 treatment
      groups (active treatment and placebo) who have pain relief at 2 hours after the completion of
      the double-blind treatment infusion. Pain relief is defined as a reduction in headache pain
      level from severe or moderate decreased to mild or headache-free, respectively.
