      exhaustion disorder, are a major cause of sick leave and work disability. Compared to other
      disorders, work-related problems associated with CMD is sparsely explored. While recommended
      treatments, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy have effects on
      psychiatric symptoms, the effect on work capacity is unclear, suggesting a need for
      alternative interventions.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an add-on work-directed intervention in
      primary care rehabilitation, compared to a physical activity control, for persons with CMD.

      The goal of the experimental condition is to enhance the participant's ability to work by
      creating an individually tailored plan for self-management, supported by occupational and
      physical therapy techniques, such as structuring daily activities, stress management or body
      awareness techniques. Enhancing self-management is the core of this intervention and also a
      new approach compared to earlier efforts to promote work capacity.
