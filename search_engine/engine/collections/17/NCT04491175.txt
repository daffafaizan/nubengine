    
      60 patients with acute back pain presenting for chiropractic and rehabilitation care will be
      stratified by gender and randomized to one of two conditions: a pain relief belt device
      incorporating multiple speeds of vibration and optional heat, cold, and pressure delivered
      through a sculpted metal plate; or a sham "posture plate" with a sculpted metal plate on a
      belt but no active heat, cold, pressure, or vibration. Patients will be prompted by a
      Qualtrics text link to a secure data recording site collecting pain and medication use.
