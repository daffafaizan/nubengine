      PTCL have an especially poor outcome with a 5-year overall survival rate of only 26%
      following treatment with standard doxorubicin containing regimens. There is general agreement
      that results with conventional chemotherapy are so poor in patients with most PTCL that new
      approaches are warranted.The nucleoside analogs are Fludarabine being combined with other
      agents in PTCL (excluding ALK positive ALCL and primary cutaneous ALCL) is reported by
      others.We conduct a II stage clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of Orally Fludarabine,
      Adriamycin and Dexamethasone (FAD) as first line therapy in patients with in Newly Diagnosed
      PTCL.
