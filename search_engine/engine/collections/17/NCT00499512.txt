      study consists of a series of questionnaires that ask questions about religion, spirituality,
      and decisions about treatment.

      All patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who
      come to the Department of Gynecologic Oncology at M. D. Anderson and affiliated clinics for
      care will be offered study participation.

      Patients will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires at specific times: at the time
      of diagnosis (before their second cycle of therapy begins), at the end of primary
      chemotherapy, and one year later. The questionnaires should take a total of about 65 minutes
      to complete, and patients can choose not to answer any question they do not want to answer.

      Patients who agree to participate but do not have time to fill out the questionnaires during
      their visits may return the questionnaire by mail in a pre-stamped envelope.

      All participants will be asked to provide the following information: their age, religious
      preference, race, marital status, date of diagnosis, stage of disease, and their current
      treatment. This information will be on a data sheet and should take about 5 minutes to
      complete.

      Any collected information will be confidential. Each participant will be given a specific
      identification number so that confidentiality can be maintained.

      This study is partially funded by a research grant from the Blanton Davis Ovarian Cancer
      Research Program, in Department of Gynecologic Oncology at M. D. Anderson.

      This is an investigational study. About 115 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter
      study.

      About 60 participants will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up to 31 will be enrolled at the
      Harris Health System.
