      (MMAE), that can kill cancer cells. The fully human antibody is designed to deliver the drug
      to cancer cells by attaching to a protein called glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) that is expressed
      on the cancer cell. The MMAE is then released inside of the cell, where it interferes with
      cell growth and can lead to cell death of the targeted cell, as well as neighboring cells.
      Varlilumab is a fully human antibody that binds to CD27. This antibody allows the body's
      immune system to work against cancer cells. Nivolumab is a fully human antibody and
      pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody. Both bind to PD-1. CDX-301 is a fully human protein
      that helps boost production of certain white blood cells. This protein allows the body's
      immune system to work against tumor cells.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the study will receive treatment with one of the following:
      glembatumumab vedotin, glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, glembatumumab vedotin and
      CDX-301 or glembatumumab vedotin and either nivolumab OR pembrolizumab.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is
      responding to treatment and for any side effects that may occur.
