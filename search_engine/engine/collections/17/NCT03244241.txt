      insulin therapy using the insulin analogue, insulin degludec once daily and insulin aspart
      before meals versus standard therapy with sliding scale insulin in non-critical ill
      hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The design of the trial is an open, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms
      (treatment arm and control arm). Randomization is 1:1.
