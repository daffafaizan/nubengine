      interventions. Unfractionated heparin has been traditionally used during invasive coronary
      procedures to reduce the risk of thrombotic occlusion. Bivalirudin, a direct antithrombin
      inhibitor, has several advantages over unfractionated heparin: it acts independently of
      antithrombin and inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin; it is not neutralized by
      circulating inhibitors; exhibits consistent dose-response characteristics, and does not cause
      thrombocytopenia. Previous studies have shown that use of bivalirudin among patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions is associated with better outcomes (death,
      myocardial infarction, urgent repeat revascularization or in-hospital major bleeding) as
      compared with unfractionated heparin and adjunctive use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet
      receptor inhibitors. However, previous studies have included patients treated with plain
      balloon angioplasty or stenting after inadequate pre-treatment with thienopyridines
      (ticlopidine or clopidogrel). Recent guidelines recommend that all patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary interventions must receive a loading dose of 300 -600 mg of
      clopidogrel. A 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel eliminates the need for glycoprotein
      IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitors in adjunct to heparin. According to existing evidence
      antithrombotic regimens based on either bivalirudin or pre-treatment with 600 mg of
      clopidogrel in addition to UFH intraprocedurally, are effective strategies to reduce ischemic
      and hemorrhagic complications in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI. At
      present, it is not known whether bivalirudin is superior to UHF in patients who have been
      optimally pre-treated with a loading dose of clopidogrel.
