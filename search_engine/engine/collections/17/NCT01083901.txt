      adaptations to progressive resistance exercise training by inhibiting exercise-induced muscle
      protein synthesis.

      To test the hypothesis that acetaminophen and ibuprofen would diminish training-induced
      increases in fat-free mass, untrained men (n=26) aged â‰¥ 50 years participated in 16 weeks of
      high-intensity progressive resistance exercise training and bone-loading exercises and were
      randomly assigned to take ACET (1000 mg), ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo 2 hours before each
      exercise session.

      The primary outcome was the change in total body fat-free mass measured by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and week 16. Our primary interest was in the comparison of
      the acetaminophen and placebo groups.
