      years of age has been derived from pharmacokinetic modelling. Results from population
      pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation in these children predict similar DRV plasma
      exposures compared to treatment-na√Øve adults, but has not been formally studied in the target
      population. Although no clinical trial was conducted to collect exposure-safety data, the
      predicted exposures from the once daily dosing is supported by exposures observed in a
      paediatric clinical trial where twice-daily dosing was administered. To validate the weight
      band based dosing recommendations, we want to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DRV/r
      administered once daily, using DRV tablets, in HIV-infected children.

      Darunavir/ritonavir is one of the preferred antiretroviral agents as part of combination
      antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV-infected adults according to international
      guidelines. For children 3-12 years old, FDA has approved once daily dosing of
      darunavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for children 6-12 years old have been approved
      based on a modelling and simulation procedure by the company.

      This pharmacokinetic study is designed to validate the proposed dosing recommendation for
      once daily darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-infected children aged 6-12 years old.
