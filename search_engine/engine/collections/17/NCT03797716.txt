    
      This is a phase III multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of
      the Little Journey app: a pre-hospital psychological preparation tool designed for children
      undergoing ambulatory surgery.

      Children presenting to the Preoperative assessment clinic before their operation will be
      screened for recruitment to the trial. Those meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited
      to participate in the trial before randomisation into either a standard practice arm or
      intervention arm. Consent will be provided by parents / guardians and assent by children aged
      7-12 years old.

      Children assigned to the intervention arm will be provided with a virtual reality google
      cardboard headset and access code for the Little Journey app which they can use as many times
      as they wish before their operation. They will also receive the standard pre-operative
      preparation and care as per the recruiting site. In comparison, the standard care arm will
      receive a google cardboard virtual reality headset with suggestions of free virtual apps to
      use and standard pre-operative preparation and care - as defined by each participating site.

      Children's anxiety will be assessed at multiple time points along the surgical journey,
      ranging from the preoperative assessment clinic, ward and finally in the anaesthetic room
      during the induction of anaesthesia. Secondary outcome measures such as parent anxiety
      levels, post-hospital behavioural changes, need for rescue analgesia and antiemetics in the
      recovery room will be recorded.

      Children's anxiety scores in those assigned to the intervention arm will undergo a further
      analysis assessing the impact of frequency and timing of Little Journey app use before
      surgery.
