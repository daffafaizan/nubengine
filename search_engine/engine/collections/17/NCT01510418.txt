      hemophilia A or B who qualify for the study. The other group is their spouse or significant
      other (SSO) who are voluntarily identified by the person with congenital bleeding disorder
      for recruitment into the study.

      For the adult men with congenital hemophilia A or B, the study involves a minimum of 2 visits
      and includes screening, medical history and physical exam review, completing confidential
      questionnaires and interview.

      Eligible men with congenital hemophilia A or B (person with congenital bleeding disorder,
      PWCBD) are given the option to permit the investigator to contact their spouse or significant
      other (SSO) for participation in the study. If PWCBD has an SSO, the SSO is not required to
      participate in the study.

      Spouse/significant other(SSO)of men with congenital hemophilia A or B may enter the study
      only if they have been voluntarily identified by their partner (PWCBD) and their partner has
      opted to allow investigator to contact them. For the SSO who chooses to participate in the
      study, the study will involve a minimum of one visit and includes completing confidential
      questionnaires and interview.

      All participation including questionnaires and interview information collected is
      confidential and protected by health privacy information laws and records are de-identified.

      The study is sponsored by a grant from The National Hemophilia Foundation.
