      in shorter time.Recent evidence has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord
      milking for both term and preterm infants.A newer evidence comparing delayed cord clamping to
      umbilical cord milking in preterm infants demonstrated a higher initial hemoglobin, blood
      pressure and systemic blood flow in preterm infants allocated to the umbilical cord milking
      arm.However, concerns have been raised with regard to rapid infusion of large volume of blood
      in relatively shorter time predisposing to hyperperfusion injury including intraventricular
      hemorrhage. This is particularly problematic for preterm neonates as they are at higher risk
      of neurological injury. It has, though, advantage of shorter timeframe allowing for effective
      resuscitation of preterm neonates to start as soon as possible. Thus, with countering
      advantages and disadvantages, the practice has not been adopted at most places. The authors
      planned to conduct a randomized clinical trail to compare the efficacy and safety of
      umbilical cord milking to deferred cord clamping in preterm infants less than 32 weeks
      gestation.
