      independent examiners performed gonioscopy using Spaeth Gonioscopic Grading System. Findings
      were recorded independently along with risk assessment of angle being closed as: high,
      medium, and low or no risk. Patient information was not available to doctor during
      gonioscopy. One eye of each patient was imaged using both Visante and Cirrus OCT. Imaging was
      performed under scotopic and photopic conditions and obtained from horizontal (3:00 and 9:00
      o'clock) and vertical (6:00 and 12:00 o'clock) meridians. The same experienced independent
      examiner performed all Cirrus measurements. Visante was performed by 3 trained technicians
      using same protocol.

      OCT images were exported and masked to be evaluated for presence of open or closed anterior
      chamber angle. Masked images were presented with no other patient information available to
      two examiners with glaucoma training working together to score on basis of iridocorneal angle
      as, closed (0 degree), high possibility (10 degree), medium risk (20 degree), and low or no
      risk (> 30 degree).
