      for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. It is currently unclear how such an
      effect could be mediated in vivo and studies are limited. We performed this study as a pilot
      experiment to assess the effects of camel milk on Insulin, Glucose, GLP-1, C-peptide and
      Lipid profile.
