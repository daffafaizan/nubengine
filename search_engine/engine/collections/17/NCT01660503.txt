      to the identification of other fermentable carbohydrates which may improve bone balance and
      bone health parameters. One such carbohydrate is the corn derivative, soluble corn fiber
      (SCF). Already known for its association with improved intestinal health and influence on
      colonic microflora content, we have been studying the effects of SCF on calcium absorption
      and bone health. First we found that soluble corn fiber (SCF) greatly enhanced calcium
      utilization and bone properties in a growing rat model. Results from this study demonstrated
      that SCF was capable of increasing bone mineral content, density and bone strength parameters
      in 4-week old, male rats. Our study in adolescent boys and girls showed a 12% increase in
      calcium absorption after consuming 12 g SCF for 21 days compared to a control period in a
      crossover design using a controlled feeding metabolic balance approach. Given these profound
      changes on calcium absorption and in bone, a logical next step is to study a dose-response
      effect of SCF on calcium absorption, bone turnover, and gut microflora in free-living
      adolescents.
