      syndrome and pulmonary embolism will be recorded. The primary endpoint will be the rate of
      postoperative respiratory complications within 30 days of oesophagectomy. Technical
      complications related to nasal high flow administration will be recorded and reasons for
      discontinuing nasal high flow documented. Other outcome including mortality, hospital stay,
      surgical complications and respiratory complications within 90 days of surgery will be
      considered as secondary endpoints. These data will assess the feasibility and safety of using
      nasal high flow in patients undergoing oesophagectomy. The rate of respiratory complications
      will be determined in a cohort of consecutive surgical patients together with other measures
      of outcome to form the basis of a series worthy of reporting. This may help gain insight into
      whether using nasal high flow could benefit patients, and whether further research to compare
      nasal high flow to conventional respiratory support would be of value.
