      by a statistician at Kings College Dental Institute. Group 1 will receive a conventional root
      canal therapy. While in group 2,clinician will follow sterile protocol. This will be carried
      out at KCL Dental Institute at Guy's Hospital as a part of the routine dental treatment at
      the endodontic postgraduate unit. Potential participants will be given a written information
      sheet and sufficient time to consider participation. Fully informed written consent will be
      obtained if they are interested in participation.

      After providing consent, all participants will receive dental periapical (PA) radiograph and
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans which are part of standard care in root canal
      treatment. Then, a clinical assessment will be carried out for the tooth needing treatment
      which is routinely done before treatment.

      Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of treatment groups. Treatment will be
      carried out by MclinDent postgraduate students (PG) supervised by their assigned clinical
      supervisor. It is a standard of care for PG students to undertake this type of treatment.
      During the treatment, clinical samples will be taken from tooth decay and from the root
      canal. These samples will undergo microbiological analysis by the research team.

      After one year, all patients will be contacted for follow up appointment. Paired clinical and
      radiographic examination (PA and CBCT) will be carried out, matching the baseline measures.
      Healing will be evaluated radiographically and clinically. The tooth of interest will be
      examined for any pain or discomfort, the restoration will be evaluated, and the scans will be
      checked for radiographic healing. This follow up procedure is a standard of care.
