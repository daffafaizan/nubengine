      processes. One automatic and not conscious, which is an attraction toward food and manifests
      itself in the motivational attitudes of approach, and the other controlled and conscious,
      which prevents attraction to this type of stimuli and is manifested by motivational attitudes
      avoidance. These processes of attraction and avoidance are observed in embodied cognition
      paradigms because the answers induce movement of approach or avoidance of stimuli. The
      validation of these assumptions could lead to reconsideration of the respective roles of
      automatic and controlled processes in food behaviors of anorexics patients and to complete or
      refocus psychological techniques of care.
