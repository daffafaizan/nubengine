      sample of PDD and DLB subjects whose diagnostic follow-up is available for at least 3 years
      after the baseline assessment. A restricted set of information regarding clinico- demographic
      characteristics, 6 neuropsychological tests (mini mental, PD Cognitive Rating Scale, Brief
      Visuospatial Memory test, Symbol digit written, Wechsler adult intelligence scale, trail
      making A and B) was used as predictors. Two classification algorithms, logistic regression
      and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NNs), will be investigated for their ability to predict
      successfully whether patients suffered from PDD or DLB.
