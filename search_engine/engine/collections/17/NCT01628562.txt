      early postoperative period are the time lines in which cerebral autoregulation can be
      impaired by changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Several anesthetic regimens have been
      implied to overcome this problem. Remifentanil is used in neurosurgery since it allows early
      recovery and neurologic evaluation. Esmolol on the other hand is also very short acting,
      effective to blunt cardiovascular responses during surgery and has no significant effect on
      intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow. In addition esmolol is addressed to reduce
      perioperative ischemia during noncardiac surgery.

      It was hypothesized that the use of esmolol as an alternative to remifentanil with
      sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia during intracranial surgery, could provide better
      hemodynamic conditions and cause lesser side effects in the perioperative period. It was the
      main objective of this study to compare the effect of esmolol and remifentanil on the
      incidence of tachycardia and hypertension and the intraoperative fentanyl consumption. The
      comparison of postoperative troponine I and creatine phosphokinase levels and EKG changes
      were the secondary objectives.
