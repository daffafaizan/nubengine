      within Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine.

      Standard anesthesia monitoring (NIBP, SPO2(oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry), ECG) will be
      applied to the patients taken to the operation room. Routine anesthesia induction and
      maintenance will be performed by the anesthetist responsible for the patients. After
      anesthesia induction, invasive arterial monitoring will be performed.

      Our data collection and recording will be as follows: preoperative, intraoperative,
      postoperative.

      In the preoperative section;

        -  Age, gender, height, weight, BMI of the patient

        -  ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification, additional diseases and
           functional capacity

        -  Drugs used (ACE-Ä°, ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), Statin, B-blocker, NSAID)

        -  Entry creatinine and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) calculated with CKD-EPI
           (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration)

        -  Entry hemoglobin, lymphocyte, CRP (C reactive protein)

        -  The presence of ascites in the abdomen

      In the intraoperative section;

        -  Surgery (gynecological oncology surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, genitourinary
           surgery) and its duration

        -  Applied form of anesthesia (general-regional)

        -  Liquids given during the operation (Crystalloid (isotonic, isolyte, lactated ringer),
           colloid, albumin) and their amounts oNoradrenaline requirement

        -  Use of diuretic, NSAID

        -  Blood transfusion

        -  Total amount of bleeding during the operation

        -  First arterial blood gas electrolytes taken due to routine major surgery

        -  The lowest amount of hemoglobin seen during the operation

        -  Routine invasive artery monitorization due to major surgery, and mean arterial pressure
           In the postoperative section;

        -  Requirement of intensive care

        -  Blood transfusion requirement

        -  Noradrenaline requirement

        -  Use of diuretic and NSAID

        -  Electrolyte values in the first blood gas taken routinely

        -  Creatinine value immediately after the surgery and at 24th and 48th hours

        -  First 48-hour urine output The diagnosis of acute renal injury is based on KDIGO's
           definition of acute renal damage. By analyzing from this information, significant risk
           factors for acute renal damage are identified and measures are taken against them.
