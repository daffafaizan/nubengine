      paralytic and sedative first administered is 86 s, and 93 s, respectively, with a standard
      deviation of approximately 25-30 s. Using these assumptions, 470 patients (235 per group)
      will need to be enrolled to detect an 7 s absolute difference between groups with 80% power.

      Because a greater difference is anticipated in those who receive rocuronium rather than
      succinylcholine (because succinylcholine takes action faster), goal enrollment is 470
      patients who receive rocuronium as the paralytic who are intubated successfully on the first
      attempt. The total enrollment will be higher, accounting for those who receive
      succinylcholine and those who are not successful on the first attempt. The data for those who
      receive succinylcholine first will be reported and is planned to be used to determine the
      feasibility of a future trial.

      The primary group of analysis will be those receiving rocuronium, because this medication
      acts somewhat slower than succinylcholine. Patients who receive either drug will be analyzed,
      but it is pre-specified that the group of interest are those receiving rocuronium.

      The primary outcome, first intubation attempt duration, and apnea duration will be measured
      only in those with a successful first attempt because these timing events will be confounded
      by attempt failure; in these cases the altered duration will have more to do with device or
      patient characteristics than with drug order.

      The remainder of the outcomes will be measured in all enrolled subjects in an intention to
      treat analysis.

      An analysis for patients by RSI drug order actually received, regardless of treatment
      allocation, will also be presented.
