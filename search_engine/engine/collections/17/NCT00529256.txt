      smoking cessation services and quitline counseling are enhanced by comparative feedback
      profiles to individual providers and provider groups (Study 1) and 2) Whether health plan
      members who receive pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation have higher participation rates in
      smoking cessation services if they receive proactive, invitational phone calls (Study 2).
