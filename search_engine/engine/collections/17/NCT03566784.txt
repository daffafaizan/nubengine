      Laparoscopic hernia repair presents a minimally invasive surgical procedure, which tends to
      be a gold standard for inguinal hernia repair. In comparison with open techniques of hernia
      repair, TAPP approach requires a totally different anatomic point of view. The operating
      surgeon must understand the basic principles and technical key points of TAPP in order to
      ensure satisfactory surgical outcomes and to prevent the occurrence of complications.

      Postoperative neuralgia presents a troublesome complication following TAPP, which occurs in
      0.2-7% of patients. Neuralgia is caused by intraoperative injury of genitofemoral,
      ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric or cutaneous femoris lateralis nerves (genitofemoral nerve
      being is the most often damaged). During TAPP, the most frequent causes of neural injury
      include clip application, inappropriate use of electrocoagulation or dangerous tissue
      dissection. At present, the employment of modern self-gripping meshes and tissue glues leave
      the use of electrocoagulation the main risk factor for potential nerve injury.

      The aim of the proposed project is to evaluate postoperative pain (postoperative neuralgia)
      in patients undergoing TAPP inguinal hernia repair with/without the use of
      electrocoagulation. The assessment of the pain in the groin region will be performed on the
      2nd and 7th postoperative day by means of clinical examination and by fulfilling the visual
      scale of pain. In patients showing clinical signs of postoperative neuralgia on the 7th
      postoperative day, clinical examination by an experienced neurologist will be performed.
