      Motor stereotypy is a common movement disorder observed in children and adolescents but whose
      pathophysiology is unknown. Therefore, our overall objective is to study cerebral activity
      related to stereotypies. First, we want to define whether motor stereotypies are preceded by
      a cortical potential, as it is observed before voluntary movements. We hypothesize that no
      pre-movement potentials will precede the stereotypies. However, if a pre-movement potential
      is observed, our secondary objective is to compare this potential to cortical potentials that
      precede voluntary movements. We also aim to study cortical potentials preceding voluntary
      movements in healthy children and to compare them with the potentials observed in children
      with stereotypies.

      Study population

      12 children presenting with primary motor stereotypies and 12 healthy children.

      Design

      Using 19 scalp electrodes, we will record the patients electroencephalographic (EEG) activity
      for up to 8 hours during one day. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the muscles
      involved in the stereotypies will be recorded with surface EMG electrodes. Healthy children
      will undergo an EEG for 2 hours. During this EEG recording, they will be asked to perform
      arms movements.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcomes: latency and amplitude of both evoked and induced activity (cortical
      potentials) related to motor stereotypies will be measured.

      Secondary outcomes: latency and amplitude of evoked and induced activity related to voluntary
      movements will be measured.
