    
      Male and female subjects (aged between 18-85 years) with one or more benign head & neck naevi
      will be invited to participate in the study.

      Each patient will be randomised to a particular dose group, depending on the number of naevi
      suitable for excision. For example, patients with one excised naevi will receive either a
      dose of one of the concentrations of RN1001, or placebo. A patient with 2 excised naevi will
      receive an active dose, and placebo. Patients with 3 excised naevi will receive 2 active
      doses, plus placebo, and patient with four excised naevi will receive 3 active doses plus
      placebo.

      Naevi will be excised using punch biopsy, and then closed with standard sutures. Following
      wound closure, the study drug (active RN1001 or placebo) will be administered via intradermal
      injection at a rate of 100ul per linear cm of wound margin.

      Digital and film photography will be taken pre-dose and post dose (Day 0, day 14, day 28,
      Month 2, 3, 6 & 12, and thereafter at M24, M36, M48 & M60). Additionally, scar assessments
      (completed by Investigator, Research Nurse & Medical photographer) will be completed at
      follow up visits from Day 20 onwards. Silicone moulds of the scars will be taken at M6, M12
      and then annually to M60.

      Patients will be requested to complete a questionnaire to rate their scar
      expectations/assessment on a total of 5 occasions (screening, Day 0, Month 3, Month 6 & Month
      12)
