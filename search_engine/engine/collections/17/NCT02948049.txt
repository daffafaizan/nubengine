      subjects are defined as subjects that complete the End of Study visit. Each subject will be
      assigned an accelerometer and have data recorded for a seven-day period pre-implant trial to
      collect baseline data. The accelerometer will also be worn during the trial for a period of
      up to seven (7) days. If the trial is successful and the subject is implanted, the subject
      will wear the accelerometer for a seven-day period at least six (6) weeks post-permanent
      implant. The following assessments will be administered to subjects at the baseline
      (pre-implant trial) visit, the end of implant trial visit and the end of study visit (8 weeks
      post-permanent implant): the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 11-point scale for pain; the SF-36
      Health Survey; the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Subjects treated for neck pain will also
      complete the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Additionally, the subjects will be asked to
      complete a subject diary to record average daily NRS scores for days the accelerometer is
      worn.
