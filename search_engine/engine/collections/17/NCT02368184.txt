      remotely monitors thoracic fluid, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, skin
      temperature, posture, and, using transmitted waveforms, stroke volume and cardiac output to
      evaluate the system's monitoring capabilities in individuals recently hospitalized for
      congestive heart failure. The data acquired through this study will play a critical roll in
      developing future interventional studies that will allow patients with HF to potentially
      receive better and more timely treatment in the home setting, decreasing hospitalizations and
      improving quality of life.
