      eligible for cataract surgery with implantation of an intraocular lens. Patients should be
      otherwise healthy with no other eye diseases.

      The study will take place in 3 centers in Europe, including Oxford Eye Hospital, a part of
      Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and will include 70 patients in total.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a new Intraocular Lens
      (IOL): the Monofocal Extended Depth of Focus (Mono-EDoF ME4) IOL and to compare it to a
      standard Monofocal IOL (TECNIS ZBC00). Patients participating will be randomised to either
      receive the Mono-EDoF ME4 IOL in both eyes or the TECNIS ZCB00 IOL in both eyes. Twice as
      many subjects will receive the Mono-EDoF ME4 IOL compared to the TECNIS ZCB00 IOL.

      Both IOLs have received the CE marked. The aim with both IOLs is to provide patients good
      vision at distance with no glasses. The Mono-eDoF ME4 might offer the additional benefit of
      achieving good vision at intermediate distance without glasses.

      Total duration of clinical investigation is 12 months and the total expected duration for
      each patient is 8 months.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility preoperatively obtaining a medical history and to
      establish a baseline ocular condition. Surgeries will be performed on different dates for
      both eyes but not more than one month apart. The patient will need to return to for seven
      follow-up visits after eye surgery where vision and health of the eye will be assessed.
