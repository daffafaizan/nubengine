    
      This is a 1-site, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose
      study in which solriamfetol 37.5-150 mg/day will be administered for 12 weeks to 64
      outpatient adults with BED by DSM-5 criteria. The study will have 3 phases: a 1-2 week
      Screening phase to evaluate participant eligibility; a 12-week blinded Treatment phase during
      which participants will receive solriamfetol or matching placebo; and a 1-week Treatment
      Discontinuation phase. During the Treatment phase, participants will be evaluated weekly for
      the first 4 weeks and then biweekly for the next 8 weeks. Solriamfetol will be started at
      37.5 mg/day. After 1 week, study drug will be increased to 75 mg/day. If a participant
      continues to have BED symptoms, study drug may be increased to a maximum of 150 mg/d by
      Treatment week 6; after that, study drug dose will be held constant. Efficacy will be
      assessed by measuring the weekly frequency of binge-eating episode days with patient
      take-home diaries. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), adverse events, and suicidality will assess safety
