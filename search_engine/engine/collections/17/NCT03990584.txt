      with chronic apical periodontitis following root-canal treatment performed using different
      methods of irrigation activation.

      Methodology: In this prospective clinical trial, root-canal treatment was performed on 162
      posterior teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. After routine canal preparation, patients
      were assigned to either a control group treated using conventional needle irrigation (CNI)
      without activation or to one of 3 treatment groups, each of which was treated using a
      different activation protocol during the final irrigation [manual dynamic irrigation (MDI),
      passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), sonic irrigation (SI)]. All treatment was completed in a
      single visit. Patients provided self-assessments of the severity of postoperative pain at
      24h, 48h and 7 days using a modified 4-step visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients were
      recalled at 12 months for clinical and radiographic examinations. Periodontal healing was
      evaluated using a periapical index (PAI), with scores of 1 or 2 considered to represent
      treatment success and scores of 3, 4, or 5 to represent treatment failure. Data were analyzed
      using one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with differences of P < 0.05 considered
      statistically significant.
