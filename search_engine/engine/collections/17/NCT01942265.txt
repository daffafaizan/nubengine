      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria is designed to provide data on an A/H7N9 vaccine made with HA antigen
      derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. The study aims to address several
      critical questions, including the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent
      influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur: 1) two doses administered at
      different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with AS03 adjuvant
      manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals or without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and
      45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose); and 2) a combination of two doses of the A/H7N9 vaccine (15 mcg
      of HA/0.5 mL dose) each administered with a different adjuvant (AS03 or MF59 manufactured by
      Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics); and 3) two doses administered at 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose
      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.
