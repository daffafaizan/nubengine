      the survival of CLL cells.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take dasatinib by mouth
      twice a day. You will be instructed to take dasatinib in the morning and in the evening.

      You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG-a test of the electrical activity of your heart) and
      a physical exam once every 3 months while on study. Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine tests once a week for 1 month and then once a month for the rest of your
      treatment on this study. A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be performed, as needed, to
      check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, an area of the
      hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is
      withdrawn through a large needle.

      Dasatinib will be given for as long as you are responding. You will be taken off study if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is not FDA-approved for CLL, and it has been
      authorized for use in research only. Up to 25 patients will take part in this multicenter
      study. Up to 25 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      Optional Procedures: If you agree, blood samples (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be
      collected before therapy starts, at 3-4 hours after the first dose, and at 3 months on
      therapy. These blood draws will be done when other routine tests are done. No additional
      needle sticks will be needed. The blood will be used to see how the disease is responding to
      the drug.

      You do not have to agree to take part in the optional procedures in order to receive
      treatment on this study.
