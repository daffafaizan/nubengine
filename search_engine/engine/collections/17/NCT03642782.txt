      reflects the activity of retinal ganglion cells. It presents itself as an objective field of
      vision that does not require the active collaboration of the patient. It consists in
      recording the electrical activity of functional retinal ganglion cells following a light
      stimulation. Simple (30 minutes maximum), it could improve the detection of early forms of
      glaucoma. A significant ERGP is also thought to be correlated with peripapillary and macular
      CNP structural involvement of the ganglionic complex in early forms of glaucoma (MD> -6 dB).

      Some results even suggest that ganglion dysfunction could be detected by the ERGP eight years
      on average before the occurrence of detectable alterations on the RNFL OCT. ERGP is already
      recognized as a routine examination for monitoring glaucomatous patients (review side in
      nomenclature and reimbursed by Social Security) but it could therefore be used as a
      diagnostic tool in very early forms of intraocular hypertonia glaucoma so to objectify signs
      of preperimetric functional impairment in order to establish a suitable hypotonizing
      treatment and to improve the prognosis of this disease.
