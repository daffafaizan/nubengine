      defects. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a new generation platelet concentrate with a
      simplified technique. Although there are some studies on the use of PRF in the treatment of
      intrabony defects, to date none of them evaluate its additive effects with ABBM. Therefore, a
      randomized, split mouth clinical trial was conducted to compare the healing of intrabony
      defects treated with a PRF/ABBM combination and to those obtained with ABBM alone. Using a
      split mouth design, 15 paired intrabony defects were randomly treated with either ABBM alone
      (control group) or with ABBM- PRF combination (test group). The following clinical parameters
      and radiographic measurements were recorded at baseline and six months postoperatively:
      plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical
      attachment level (CAL), vertical bone loss, the depth of the defect and defect angle
