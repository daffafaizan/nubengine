      12-week exercise program. The participants will either participate in: Group 1-participating
      in an exercise program with biometric evaluations or Group 2-biometric evaluations but not
      participating in the exercise program. At the end of the 12-week exercise program,
      participants in Group 1 will be randomized to either: a) continuing with exercise group
      classes or b) continuing with exercise individual classes. Both Group 1a and 1b participants
      will be followed for the remainder of the year and be evaluated for continued physical
      activity. All Group study participants' biometrics will be assessed at baseline and at the
      end of 12-weeks, with continued annual medical review follow-up for a total of 5 years.
