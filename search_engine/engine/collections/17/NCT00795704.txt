      double-blind randomization into 2 groups: (1) mulberry leaf extract and (2) matching placebo.
      Evaluations of hemoglobin A1C (A1C) -- A measurement of blood glucose over the past 3 months
      -- will be done at baseline [before placebo run-in period] and 3 months. Evaluations of
      safety laboratories and adverse effect questionnaire will be done at 4 weeks and at 3 months
      following the randomization visit. Subjects will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in phase, and
      then will be divided into two groups: (1) mulberry leaf extract and (2) matching placebo. The
      subjects will ingest 1000 mg (#2 500 mg capsules) of standardized mulberry leaf extract
      (Nature-Gen, San Diego, CA) or matching placebo three times daily with meals for 3 months.
      Patients will be asked to monitor fasting morning blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial
      dinner blood glucose daily during the 2-week placebo run-in. To ensure compliance, only
      subjects compliant with both medication and monitoring instructions will be issued a 30-day
      supply of study medication at enrollment and the remainder at the 4-week safety visit. Each
      visit will consist of clinical examination, completed questionnaires, evaluation of
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG), and donated blood for clinical laboratory tests.
      Standard recommendations for therapeutic lifestyle intervention will be given to both groups.
      All the clinical laboratory tests will be performed at the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center. All patients will receive identical 2-week placebo phase capsules, and then be
      randomized to each group using similar lookin
