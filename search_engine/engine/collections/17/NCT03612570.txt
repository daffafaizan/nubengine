      75 subjects with 2-5 qualifying SH lesions will be enrolled and treated with either a 1.5-mm
      x 1.5-mm or 2.5-mm x 2.5-mm tip. One lesion will be randomized as a untreated control and no
      NPS energy will be delivered. All treated lesions will receive at least one NPS treatment and
      evaluated at 30 days for lesion clearance. Initial lesions scored as Not Clear or Partially
      Clear may undergo a second NPS treatment. All subjects will have their lesions evaluated at
      60 days post-primary or secondary treatment.
