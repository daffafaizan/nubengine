    
      This is an open-label, single-center Phase I dose-escalation study designed to determine the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination of
      177Lu-J591 and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a two-week dose-fractionation regimen. 177Lu-J591 will be
      given at a moderate dose previously demonstrated to be safe x2 infusions two weeks apart. For
      177Lu-PSMA-617 the dose escalation will start at 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) and escalate in increments
      of 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) for each dose to a planned maximum of 9.25 GBq (250 mCi) x2 doses, 2
      weeks apart. Should there be unacceptable toxicity at the initial dose level, we will
      de-escalate to dose level -1 (1.85 GBq / 50 mCi per dose). After the phase I study has
      established a MTD, the Phase II, single-arm trial will start.

      Patients must have documented progressive metastatic CRPC disease based on Prostate Cancer
      Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria in order to be eligible for enrollment. Upon meeting the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and signing the informed consent and HIPPA form, subjects
      will undergo the screening. As part of the screening, subjects will get a single dose of
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and will have a PET/CT. Nuclear Medicine physician(s) will review the
      PET/CT scans to document PSMA expression at tumor site(s).

      Subjects will have Lutetium-177 Planar/SPECT Imaging on Day 8 (±1 day) after the first dose
      of 177Lu-J591 + 177Lu-PSMA-617. Optimal images will be performed on selected consenting
      subjects between the initial treatment visit #1 on Day 1 and Day 4 and prior to treatment
      visit #2 on D15 ±1. Subjects will be closely monitored for AEs (weekly x2 weeks, then every 2
      weeks for one month, at 8 and 12 weeks, and then every 4 weeks for next 3 months).

      Upon completion of investigational treatment with dose-fractionation regimen of the
      combination of 177Lu-J591 + 177Lu-PSMA-617, subjects will undergo 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC injection
      and same day PET/CT at the end of study visit to document treatment response. Subsequently
      survival data and additional treatment(s) information will be captured from their routine
      Standard of care (SOC) visits.
