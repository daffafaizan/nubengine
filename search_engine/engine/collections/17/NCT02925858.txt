      intraoperative Ketamine administration on pain after coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients
      will be randomized to receive ketamine or saline prior to incision, with a continuous
      infusion throughout surgery. Opioid dose administered in the first 48 hours will then be
      documented as the primary outcome
