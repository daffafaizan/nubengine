      severe pain can occur at the first day after inguinal hernia repair in 25% of patients at
      rest and in 60% during activity. On day 6 after the operation the incidence can be as high as
      11% at rest and 33% during activity.

      Ultrasound imaging for regional anesthesia techniques have improved the success and safety
      rate of nerve blocks. We hypothesized that a procedure consisting of an ultrasound-guided
      inguinal field block (genitofemoral, iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerve block and
      incision line infiltration) could effectively control postoperative pain compared to
      selective unilateral subarachnoid anesthesia.
