      intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery.

      Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting
      uterine contraction, with a similar side effect profile. In addition, patients receiving
      carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when
      compared with oxytocin. Two dose response studies conducted at our institution (by Cordovani
      et al, and Anandakrishnan et al) suggested no difference in efficacy of uterine contraction
      for doses of carbetocin between 20-120mcg. Hypotension was noted for all dose groups studied.

      This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, up-down sequential allocation
      trial. The success or fail of a patient in the study will determine the dose given to future
      patients. Dosage will be increased for patients following a failed case, and kept the same
      for patients following successful cases. Following a successful case, there is also a 1 in 9
      chance that the dose will be decreased for the next patient.

      The results of this follow-up study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for
      uterine contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety
      of patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to
      oxytocin for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.
