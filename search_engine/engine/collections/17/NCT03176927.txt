      activity that detect with serosal and mucosal electrodes. The upgraded magnetometer will
      improve the spatial resolution resulting in increased sensitivity for detecting and
      characterizing both abnormal frequency dynamics and abnormal spatiotemporal patterns. The
      spatiotemporal data collected with multichannel Superconducting QUantum Interference Device
      (SQUID) biomagnetometer has allowed , for the first time, to characterize propagation of the
      gastric slow wave noninvasively. In addition to frequency dynamic changes, which are the only
      reliable parameters from cutaneous electrogastrogram (EGG), and which still do not
      necessarily correlate well with disease, the MGG reflects normal and abnormal gastric slow
      wave activity. Furthermore, for the first time, investigators have demonstrated that
      propagation characteristics determined magnetically distinguish normal subjects from patients
      with gastroparesis. Also for the first time, investigators have been able to detect the
      gradient in gastric propagation velocity noninvasively in animal subjects. However,
      investigators still have unresolved questions about how MGG propagation rhythm and pattern
      disturbances may specify functional disorders.
