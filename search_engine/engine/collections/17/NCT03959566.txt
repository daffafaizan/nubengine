    
      This open-label Phase IIB dose-finding, randomized, controlled study with a duration of three
      months of experimental therapy in adult patients with newly diagnosed, smear positive,
      uncomplicated, drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) will be carried out to evaluate the
      safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exposure/response-relationship of
      different doses of sutezolid in combination with bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin
      (BDM).

      Participants will be randomized to one of five arms containing bedaquiline, delamanid and
      moxifloxacin with different doses of STZ (0mg, 600mg OD, 1200mg OD, 600 mg BD, 800 mg BD).
      Study treatment duration will be three month, followed by a follow-up period of 2 weeks.

      A total of 75 male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed,
      drug sensitive, uncomplicated, smear-positive, pulmonary TB will be included and randomized
      to one of five arms containing BDM with different doses of STZ:

        -  Arm 1 (U0): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin

        -  Arm 2 (U600): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg OD

        -  Arm 3 (U1200): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 1200 mg OD

        -  Arm 4 (U600BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg BD

        -  Arm 5 (U800BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 800 mg BD

      A sub-study will assess CYP P450 3A4 enzyme induction potential using the probe drug
      midazolam, given to participants in arm 5.

      Using PK data and data from primary efficacy and safety objectives, we will develop an
      exposure-response and a population PK-model for sutezolid and its main metabolite to support
      the main objective, selection of a dose for subsequent studies.
