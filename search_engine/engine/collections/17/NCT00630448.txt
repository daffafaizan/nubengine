    
      Aim: The purpose of this protocol is to obtain blood samples from normal research subjects
      and patients with Von Willebrand disease in order to isolate blood outgrowth endothelial
      cells (BOEC) from peripheral blood, and develop a ex vivo gene transfer for Von Willebrand
      disease.

      Experimental procedure. This protocol is designed to gather approximately 90 ml (6
      tablespoons) of blood from normal individuals without Von Willebrand disease and individuals
      with known Von Willebrand disease. A total of 20 normal individuals and 20 Von Willebrand
      disease patients will be enrolled into the study.

      Studies to be performed on the blood samples:

      Each blood draw will require 10 large blue/black capped (Na Citrate) vacutainer (16x125mm,
      BD# 362761, Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT) to be filled from each volunteer. All the blood will
      be used for cell processing.

      In initial proof-of-concept experiments, BOEC lines will be established from the peripheral
      blood of normal individuals and research subjects with Von Willebrand disease. Following
      culture and phenotypic characterization, they will be transduced with a lentivirus gene
      transfer vector expressing a reporter gene or wild-type Von Willebrand factor. After
      demonstrating successful transduction, the next step will be to write an animal protocol that
      will introduce the modified cells into immunocompromised mice and monitor the mice for stable
      implantation.
