      Although high-risk fetal populations are identified between 11 and 13 SA on clinical and
      biological criteria and by screening ultrasound (Echo T1), cardiac morphology analysis is
      routinely performed only during 2nd trimester fetal morphology ultrasound between 18 and 22
      SA (EchoMorpho-T2) inducing a difficult wait for the couple.

      The development of increasingly efficient ultrasound probes has made it possible to explore
      the foetal heart at an earlier stage. International learned societies recommend an early
      morphological examination with heart-centered slices before 14 weeks in high-risk situations.
      This practice is not systematic in France and no study has evaluated its feasibility and
      impact in a French care network.
