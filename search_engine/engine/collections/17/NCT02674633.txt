      (iPad-based) digital therapies. The study will consist of 3 primary phases: Screening,
      Washout/Baseline, and Treatment. During the Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -7), participants
      will undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Screening may take place up to
      28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). For those children currently on medication for
      ADHD the Washout period will begin 7 days prior to Baseline where treatment will be
      discontinued. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional eligibility criteria
      will be established. The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 27) will involve using the digital
      therapy at home for each participant followed by an In-Clinic assessment on Day 28 to assess
      key outcomes. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored remotely during
      this phase.
