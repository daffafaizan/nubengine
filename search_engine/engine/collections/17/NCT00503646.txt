      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized clinical trial
           evaluating communication and intimacy-enhancing intervention (CI) vs usual care (UC).

        -  To collect descriptive information and basic psychometrics on proposed study measures.

        -  To gather preliminary data regarding the impact of CI on couples' psychosocial
           adaptation, relationship closeness, and sexual intimacy in order to calculate power for
           a larger full scale trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients and their partners receive communication and intimacy-enhancing
           intervention (CI) once a week comprising the following five 90-minute sessions:
           Rationale and Overview; Basic Communication; Intimacy and Sexuality; Improving Intimacy;
           and Reflecting on Changes and Cancer Survivorship.

        -  Arm II: Patients and their partners receive standard psychological and emotional care
           (usual care [UC]) (i.e., social work consultations and referral to a psychiatrist or
           psychologist, if requested or deemed necessary by the attending physician).

      Physical impairment, psychological adjustment, relationship closeness, relationship
      communication, sexual function and satisfaction, male self-esteem, relationship satisfaction,
      intervention evaluation, and erectile dysfunction treatment utilization, and referral are
      assessed at 1 week post-intervention or at 6-8 weeks post baseline and then at 3 months (for
      patients and their partners in arm I) and at 8 weeks post-baseline and then at 3 months (for
      patients and their partners in arm II).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients and 50 partners will be accrued for this study.
