      dose study. The patient is to receive general anesthesia. WST11-mediated VTP will consist of
      the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/Kg,4mg/Kg or 6 mg/kg,
      using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through
      transperineal interstitial optical fibers. If deemed necessary and in consideration of the
      results of the patients treated with 200 J/cm, alternate power (200mW/cm) and alternate
      energy (300 J/cm) might be applied after Sponsor, Steering Committee and DSMB approval.The
      fibers are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the prostate under
      ultra sound image guidance (using a brachytherapy like template). The tumor location is
      established using transrectal biopsy and MR imaging. The number of fibers and the total light
      energy will be adapted to each patient, taking into account the tumor localization and the
      volume of the prostate.
