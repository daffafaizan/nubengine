      testing period. Forty-five reflective markers will be attached to subjects skin and clothing
      via a double sided adhesive electrode collar. The cameras work on an infrared spectrum and
      the markers are passive reflective spheres. Relations between marker positions and anatomical
      / known positions on the body are used to calculate the positions of body segments.This
      analysis will provide information on movement strategies, compensatory motion, and socket
      movement associated with the selected tasks for transradial and transhumeral prostheses.
      Differences in the range of motion of the prostheses users and control subjects will be
      calculated to determine compensatory motion. The movement of the prosthesis's socket as a
      function of task and other factors will also be measured. Measured data will be used to
      minimize error in the simulation of the upper body movement. Knowledge of human motor
      function given in the recorded data can be extended to give insight to movement parameters
      when designing new prosthetics. Simulations will be optimized to the collected data using a
      regressive best fit method.
