      laparoscopic gastrectomy, and analyze the relevant factors, so as to guide the operation of
      preoperative indocyanine green submucosal injection better.

      This study is prospective and observational. In order to analyze the related factors that
      affect the imaging effect, we enrolled patients who were to undergo indocyanine green
      fluorescence imaging for laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.
