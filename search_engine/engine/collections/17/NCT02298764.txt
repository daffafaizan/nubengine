      Trauma Questionnaire Scale (HTQ). It has been found that PTSD and pain may maintain each
      other.

      Methods Thousand consecutive patients with Low Back Pain (LBP) referred to the Spine Center
      are screened for PTSD. It is expected that 100 patients will meet the inclusion criteria and
      be randomized to SMP or to SMP plus 10 psychotherapeutic sessions, that will include the
      shock-trauma method 'Somatic Experiencing'.

      Conclusion The project started in 2013, so there have not yet been any results. Currently
      total reached 65 back pain patients; 34 patients in the SMP + sessions intervention arm.

      Effect parameters are: Pain, daily function, EuroQOL and (HTQ), anxiety and depression, fear
      avoidance (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) on entry, and at 6/12 months.

      This "Nested Randomized Trial in a Cohort Design" is one of the very first studies targeting
      both PTSD and chronic pain-related symptomatology.
