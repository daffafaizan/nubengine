      widely applied to both scientific research and clinical trial(2-6). This clinical trial aims
      to study the effectiveness of sitagliptin treatment in T2D patients and related change of gut
      microbiome. 50 Patients newly diagnosed with T2D will be recruited. With patient's informed
      consent, patient-related vital signs (such as age, height, weight, body mass index),
      laboratory indicators (including glycated hemoglobin, glycated albumin, low-density
      lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides), fasting blood glucose, insulin levels and
      Insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR)(7) will be recorded and analyzed. The feces of the
      patients will be collected to analyze the gut microbiome. All of the patients will receive
      the sitagliptin treatment for 3 months. The gut microbiome of the patients and the
      effectiveness of sitagliptin treatment on diabetes will be evaluated at indicated times
      during follow-up.
