      total knee replacement. The study includes 5 visits, 1 before surgery and 4 after surgery.

      older, will soon be undergoing knee replacement surgery, do not have a serious heart
      condition or certain other medical conditions, and are not taking certain types of
      medications. The study includes evaluation of peoples' pain, physical functioning, medication
      use, and physiological responses to sensory stimuli such as heat and cold. The research takes
      place at the Brigham & Women's Pain Management Center, 850 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill. For
