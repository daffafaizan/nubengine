      Hip and Knee Institute - a facility that performs 800 TKA's per year. Participants will be
      divided into two groups: the pre-operative MBSR group (30 participants, divided into two MBSR
      groups), and the treatment-as-usual (TAU;15 participants). The individuals in the
      pre-operative MBSR group will receive a pre-operative 8-week community-based MBSR course
      taught by a certified instructor, which includes group classes lasting 2.5 hours a week,
      45-minutes of home practice 6 days per week, a 1-hour orientation session at the beginning,
      and a full-day silent retreat at the end. During the orientation, participants will complete
      the study measures for this study. Two weeks prior to the surgery at the pre-anesthesia
      clinic, all patients will receive another set of short self-reported questionnaires. All
      patients will subsequently receive post-operative questionnaires at the following regularly
      scheduled post-operative appointments: 6-8 weeks after surgery, and at 6 month and 1 year
      follow-ups. Clinic personnel, who are blinded to assignment, will administer these measures
      with all other regularly distributed clinical measures. Clinic personnel will also review the
      chart to inform researchers as to what physical condition contributed to the need for a TKA.
      The TAU group will have the opportunity to enroll in an MBSR course following the completion
      of the study (after approximately 1 year), at no cost.
