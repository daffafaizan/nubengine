    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study in Hepatitis C (HCV)
      infected patients undergoing liver transplantation. Chronically infected patients with HCV
      genotype 1a scheduled to receive a liver transplant from either a deceased or living donor
      who satisfy all study inclusion or exclusion criteria will be approached to participate. The
      study will be conducted in two parts to test a human monoclonal antibody against Hepatitis C
      (MBL-HCV1). In Part 1, sixteen eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 50 mg/kg
      MBL-HCV1 or 0.9% sodium chloride placebo intravenously. Eleven doses will be given during the
      first 14 days post transplantation. Patients will be evaluated through day 56 for safety and
      clinical outcomes that include measurement of anti-HCV antibodies, anti-drug antibody and HCV
      viral load. On study visit day 42, a liver biopsy will be performed for evaluation of
      hepatitis. Physical examination, vital sign measurements, emergence of adverse events and
      concomitant medication usage will be assessed at scheduled visits and as needed during the 56
      day study period.

      The Data Safety and Monitoring Board will perform a futility analysis after the first 16
      patients have been enrolled and completed study follow-up through study visit day 42 post
      transplant. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the dose of MBL-HCV1 for part 2 of
      the study will be determined. Part 2 of the study will be conducted in the same manner as
      Part 1.
