      alteration in movement patterns that restrict lumbar spine motion. This restriction of lumbar
      motion is particularly evident in patients with kinesiophobia; that is, a fear of movement
      due to possible injury or reinjury. For chronic back pain patients with kinesiophobia it is
      critical to develop an effective intervention to increase spine motion while minimizing
      concerns of pain and harm. Accordingly, we have developed a innovative video games that track
      whole-body motion and are designed to encourage spinal flexion while reducing concerns of
      pain and harm among individuals with low back pain. Our games have two distinct advantages.
      First, within this video game environment, visual feedback can be altered by changing the
      feedback gain of a given movement (e.g., the magnitude of a given joint movement could appear
      on screen as either larger or smaller than the actual movement). Thus, gain manipulation will
      result in progressively larger amounts of lumbar spine flexion during game play. Second,
      video games are potent distractors that can reduce attention to pain.
