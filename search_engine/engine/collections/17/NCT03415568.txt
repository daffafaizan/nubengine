      effects of MCDGs. Twenty-eight healthy male and female subjects aged 21-29 years with normal
      body weight [18.5 kg/m^2 â‰¤ body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m^2] were recruited. The subjects
      visited the research site twice over with a seven-day interval after an overnight fast at
      least 12 hr. On the first visit, the participants were randomly assigned to consume a test or
      placebo product [test product: muffins containing MCDG oil (MCDG muffin); placebo product:
      muffins containing LCT oil (LCT muffin)] and ingested the assigned product. On the second
      visit, the participants consumed the other product that they did not eat on the first visit.
      On both visit day, the 6-hr meal tolerance test was conducted and started at 8:00 in the
      morning; venous blood samples were collected before (0 hr) and after ingestion (2, 3, 4, and
      6 hr) of the products.
