    
      This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label, multicenter phase II trial. Our primary purpose is
      to compare that PFS rate at 6-month of patients with apatinib plus POF and POF for
      advanced/metastatic gastric cancer.

      Eligible patients will randomized to a ratio of 1:1 to apatinib+POF (experimental group) or
      POF (control group). Stratification factors were 1) gender (male;female);2) previous surgical
      history (yes;no);3) metastatic sites (measurable; Immeasurable).

      In treatment period, patients will be administrated POF, with or without apatinib, every 14
      days for 1 cycle, total 9-12 cycles.After the above treatment finished,parients will received
      with S-1,with or without apatinib,every 21days for 1 cycle,until disease progression,
      toxicity intolerance, withdrawal of informed consent, patients judged must be terminated
      study termination.

      The imaging evaluation was performed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria every 6 weeks.
