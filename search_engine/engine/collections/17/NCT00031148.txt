      the conditioning of the recipient for transplant when the host tissues are damaged. Research
      has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a critical organ in GVHD
      pathophysiology. Agents that protect the GI tract may provide prophylaxis against the
      cytokine cascade and can lead to a reduced incidence and severity of GVHD. KGF is a protein
      that stimulates the growth of epithelial cells including those of the GI tract. KGF can
      protect the GI tract, prevent GVHD, and preserve donor T-cell function.

      Patients will receive standard GVHD prophylaxis in addition to the study drug. Overall GVHD
      will be graded weekly during the first 2 months after transplant, then every other week to
      Day 100. Response to therapy will be measured through the use of severity indices, physical
      exam, and laboratory serum values.
