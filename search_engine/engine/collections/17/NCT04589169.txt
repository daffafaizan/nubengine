      especially intensive care. The current diagnosis of delirium is through the use of the
      Confusional Assessment Method in Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) task based questionnaire. The
      core prinicipal to CAM-ICU is inattentionÍ¾ this is tested through asking the patient to
      remember a task and execute it on demand, e.g. squeezing the operator's hand everytime the
      letter A is said and then spelling CASABLANCA.

      The aim of this study is to find correlates to inattention. Eye-gaze data is ideally suited
      for this task as eyes move to pay attention to the environment.

      A video camera based eye-tracker has been developed that sits at the end of the bed
      (head-camera) and another behind the patient (scene-camera). The head-camera uses machine
      learning to measure the gaze of the patient's eyes while the scene-camera finds what the
      patient is looking at. Simulations are then run from the scene camera and the patient's gaze
      is then compared to find whether the patient is paying attention to what is simulated.

      Once per day, a member of the local research team will fill in a non-validated questionnaire
      based on work by MacMurchy et al.
