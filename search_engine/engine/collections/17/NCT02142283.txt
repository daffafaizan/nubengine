    
      The study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, Phase II/III (feasibility/pivotal),
      adaptive, controlled trial, designed to demonstrate that mechanical thrombectomy using the
      Trevo Retriever with medical management is superior to medical management alone in improving
      clinical outcomes at 90 days in appropriately selected wake up and late presenting acute
      ischemic stroke subjects.

      The intent of this study is to support the use of the Trevo Retriever beyond the currently
      labeled 8 hour indicated time limit in wake up, unclear onset, and late presenting ischemic
      stroke subjects, who currently have no other option besides medical management of their
      symptoms.

      Patients with wake-up strokes, strokes with unclear onset time, and witnessed late presenting
      strokes may potentially benefit from intra-arterial reperfusion therapy. However, an
      important indicator of whether subjects will benefit or not during this later time window is
      the confirmation of a large vessel occlusion (LVO), and assessment of the core infarct volume
      relative to the volume of salvageable penumbra. Therefore, standardized imaging selection of
      subjects is required for inclusion into the study.

      This trial has been designed with subject safety in mind, as a seamless Phase II
      (feasibility) / Phase III (pivotal) adaptive design, in order to address the concerns around
      potential unknown harms to enrolled subjects. This study will help to answer the question of
      whether carefully selecting subjects by using Clinical Imaging Mismatch will allow acute
      ischemic stroke patients who present at or beyond 6 hours from Time Last Seen Well (TLSW) to
      be considered for intra-arterial intervention. If Trevo thrombectomy plus medical management
      leads to better clinical outcomes over medical management alone, more patients in the future
      could receive endovascular treatment (either in addition to or in lieu of IV tPA).
