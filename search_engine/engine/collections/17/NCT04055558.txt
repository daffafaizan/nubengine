      immunodeficient patients. These disorders have been extensively described in the
      post-transplant setting, ie after hematopoietic stem cell (SCT) or solid organ (SOT)
      transplant. However, since the 1980's, there have been isolated case reports of patients with
      childhood ALL, who developed LPD after diagnosis of ALL, without undergoing SCT.
      Comprehensive information is unavailable regarding the prevalence, clinical manifestations,
      treatment, outcome and pathogenesis of such disorders in this setting. We propose here an
      international collaboration, to form a comprehensive database of children who developed LPD
      during the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL).

      Information will be collected in a de-identified fashion regarding patient characteristics,
      leukemia and LPD characteristics, treatment and outcome. The aims of this retrospective study
      are:

        1. To build a database of children who developed LPD after diagnosis of ALL/LBL

        2. To investigate the characteristics and outcome of this disorder
