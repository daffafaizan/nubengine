      education level and health condition, a pre-moistened sterile cotton swab was taken from
      dorsal surface of tongue and mid-plate. The swabs were cultured in agar plate containing
      sabourauds dextrose agar medium with chloramphenicol, and kept in 37 C for 48 hours. The
      number of candida colonies was counted and germ tube test performed to separate candida
      albicans from other types. The data was collected and analyzed by SPSS software and
      chi-square, logistic regression and mann-whitney test. Study hypothesis: feeding by mothers
      milk reduces oral candida colonization.
