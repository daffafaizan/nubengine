      standard of care, but they must be randomized within 6 weeks from completion of
      chemoradiotherapy. Participants should receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy dose
      of 56-64 Gy (once daily) before randomization, and those participants who have not progressed
      during/after CRT will be stratified by response to CRT, radiotherapy timing, and be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Atezolizumab+Tiragolumab arm or Atezolizumab+placebo arm.
