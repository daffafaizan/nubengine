    
      BACKGROUND:

      Computer processing, biostatistical, and epidemiological services at the Collaborative
      Studies Coordinating Center (CSCC) had been funded previously as part of the NHLBI Lipid
      Research Clinics (LRC) contracts. In FY 1990, contract N01HV08112 was awarded separately from
      the LRC for the first time and provided services for collaborative studies carried out under
      NHLBI international bilateral agreements with the USSR, Poland, and the People's Republic of
      China. The assistance has provided important contributions to large-scale, international
      epidemiological studies resulting from bilateral agreements between the United States and
      other countries. The results of these efforts have provided insights into different disease
      patterns and trends throughout the world.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The CSCC coordinated data collection and data file transfer, coordinated scientific meetings,
      visited the collaborating countries, hosted collaborative scientists, and directed data
      analysis, combining data from all countries.
