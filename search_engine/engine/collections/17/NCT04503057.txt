      done on daily bases from the time the patient is treated as" in patients" until discharge or
      to the transition to ICU care and initiation of mechanical ventilation to follow the EBP
      pattern over time course of the disease. EBP measurements will also be done on 100 patients
      without COVID19 infection with normal lung function as a control cohort.

      Measurements on patients with mechanical ventilation in the ICU. To reduce the need of
      invasive diagnostics and in hospital transportation for diagnostics with a high risk of
      infecting other patients and staff in the environment, but also to measure the extent of lung
      injury over time, EBP will be measured at daily bases to follow the EBP pattern on patients
      in mechanical ventilation. Preclinical studies have shown that EBP can measure the extent of
      lung injury over time (onset of ARDS and recovery (unpublished data)) Method: EBP will be
      measured on 100 patients in mechanical ventilation at the intensive care on daily bases to
      follow the EBP pattern over time.

      Measurements will be done on patients in mechanical ventilation on ECMO (extra corporal
      membrane oxygenation) support.
