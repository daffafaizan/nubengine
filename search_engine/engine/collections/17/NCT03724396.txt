      be enrolled in a 12-week open-label treatment group of NEXT. These participants will then
      provide qualitative feedback to help with treatment development. After the two pilot groups,
      a randomized control trial will evaluate NEXT compared to standard BWL to assess feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Treatment will be 6 months long and assessments will
      occur at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 6-months after treatment.
