      has been increasing gradually. As an important biological feature of soft tissue sarcoma is
      local recurrence and distant metastasis, most patients die of distant metastasis. Despite the
      improvement of local control rate, more than 50% of patients died of unresectable or distant
      metastasis due to tumor progression. Doxorubicin and ifosfamide based chemotherapy is the
      standard first-line treatment for patients with relapsed / distant metastasis / unresectable
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. For patients who fail or cannot tolerate first-line treatment,
      the choice of treatment is still limited. At present, some clinical patients who failed to
      receive standard treatment have tried to use the albumin-bound paclitaxel and liposomal
      doxorubicin regimen, with the ORR of 33% and PFS of about 8 months. As a new combination of
      chemotherapy drugs, more targeted phase II clinical studies are needed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the new chemotherapy drugs in a variety of cancer species. In view of
      the above problems, this study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of albumin-bound paclitaxel (keaili) and liposomal doxorubicin (duomeisu) in the
      treatment of advanced angiogenic sarcoma patients, and to provide better treatment options
      for patients with advanced sarcoma.
