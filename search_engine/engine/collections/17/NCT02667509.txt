      prevalence in the past few decades (now 80-90% in school-leavers), and because of the
      sight-threatening pathologies associated with high myopia, which now aff ects 10-20% of those
      completing secondary schooling in this part of the world. Similar, but less marked, changes
      are occurring in other parts of the world. The higher prevalence of myopia in east Asian
      cities seems to be associated with increasing educational pressures, combined with life-style
      changes, which have reduced the time children spend outside.

      In this trial, the investigators aim to study the evolutionary model of myopia in China,
      which could provide new insight into the social development and human adaptation.
