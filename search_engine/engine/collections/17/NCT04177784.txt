      in a nationally representative sample of dietitians. The "intervention" group (I) watched a
      video about the etiology of obesity, reasons for weight regain, and how to talk to patients
      about weight. The first "control" group (C1) received information about the role of the
      environment and individual behavior in weight gain, and tools to help patients control their
      weight. The second control group (C2) received a weight neutral video about the role of
      dieticians in society. Bias measures were taken before and just after watching the video, and
      again one month later.
