      randomized to either the therapy or control at a rate of 2:1. Whether the participant
      receives the on-site therapist or the remote therapist will depend on day of week or shift.
      Over the course of the study, the proportion of shifts covered by on-site verses remote
      therapists will be balanced for seasonality and time of day (evening vs. day time).
