    
      The MRI examination to evaluate the response to routine Radio-Chemotherapy Neoadjuvant (RCT)
      will be replaced by an MRI-PET scan in all patients included. Firstly, only the MRI portion
      of the examination will be interpreted (sequences identical to that performed in conventional
      MRI), without the PET part of the examination. An evaluation of the answer will be done. The
      results of the MRI will be transmitted to the surgeon in accordance with the conventional
      attitude of treatment of rectal cancer treated with RCT.

      In a second step the complete examination associating the merged MRI and PET sequences will
      be reinterpreted. A new evaluation of the response will be done. The results of the MRI and
      PET MRI will be read without the gold standard, which will be available after the
      intervention. The results of this second analysis will not be transmitted to the
      Multidisciplinary Concertation Meeting and will not influence the management. The patients
      will then be operated. The histological stage ypTN will be established on the operative
      specimen.

      Thus all patients will have the 2 tests under study (MRI and [18F] -FDG-PET / MRI, as well as
      the gold standard (pathological analysis) .These results will meet the main objective
      evaluation of the diagnostic performances by comparing them with the results of the gold
      standard (anatomopathological analysis of the operative specimen)
