    
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic joint disease. Platelet Rich Plasma
      (PRP) is an injection therapy used to treat chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions,
      including knee OA. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, interventional
      study, a total of 75 patients with stage 2-3 knee osteoarthritis according to the kellgren
      lawrence classification who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study.
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups using
      computer-generated random numbers.The patients to be included in the study will be randomized
      into three groups and the first group will be given platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared with
      T-LAB / PRP KIT, the second group will be given PRP prepared with T-LAB PRP INJECTION
      SYRINGA, and the third group will be given saline injection. Home exercise program for knee
      osteoarthritis will be given to all three groups and the exercise program will be followed by
      weekly phone calls. During the follow-up period, patients will be asked to continue their
      current medical treatments, not to make changes in their activities of daily living.
      Participants are going to evaluate before injection, and at the 1-month follow-up and 6-month
      follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain during activity, at rest, and
      at night, with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
      change in pain, stiffness and physical function score, the change in the Timed Up and Go Test
      (TUG) time, change in femoral cartilage thickness measurement by ultrasound and the change in
      the patient's daily activities with the numerical global patient assessment scale.
