      is of paramount importance for the clinicians in order to inform the patients on the
      potential surgical or medical treatments. It is well established that transvaginal
      ultrasonography is the first-line investigation in patients with suspicion of deep
      infiltrating endometriosis. An improvement in the performance of transvaginal ultrasonography
      in diagnosing rectosigmoid endometriosis may be obtained by using rectal water contrast
      during transvaginal ultrasonographic scan. In the last years, three-dimensional (3D)
      rendering has been employed during transvaginal ultrasound for benign gynecological diseases.
