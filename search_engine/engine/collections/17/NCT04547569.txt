      addresses the involvement of somatosensory cortical networks in motor learning of speech.
      Previous studies in the literature have highlighted the plasticity of cortical sensory
      networks, notably the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and the ventral premotor
      cortex, during motor learning tasks. The present project focuses on the somatosensory region
      with connections to the sensorimotor regions of the frontal and parietal cortex. We propose
      to use neuroimaging (fMRI), in order to verify which areas in the prefrontal cortex are part
      of the sensorimotor network used in the learning of speech motor tasks in humans. Subjects
      will be tested in the fMRI scanner while performing either a behavioral task in which the
      auditory feedback of their own speech is altered or while performing a vibrotactile
      discrimination task.
