      refuse or are not eligible for surgery and who suffers from moderate-severe lower urinary
      tract symptoms or indwelling catheter secondary to benign prostatic obstruction due to benign
      prostatic hyperplasia. It may form the grounding for further research in the shape of a
      larger randomised clinical trial.

      Our hypothesis is that PAE will eliminate the need for indwelling catheter and improve IPSS 6
      months post-procedure.

      1, and 6 months follow-up.

      Main outcome Ability to void after removal of indwelling catheter

      Secondary outcomes International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Quality of Life (QoL)
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Prostate volume Peak void flow (Qmax)
      Post-void residual (PVR) Classify complications according to Society of Interventional
      Radiology (SIR) guidelines for reporting Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
