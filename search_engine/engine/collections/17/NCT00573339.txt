        1. fill out baseline demographic and health history questionnaires;

        2. have an exercise treadmill test (ETT) To rule out any underlying ischemic heart disease;

        3. undergo rest-stress CMR testing (up to 3 scans);

        4. peripheral arterial tonometry; and

        5. have blood drawn for hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine, and research
           protein quantitation with mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
           (ELISA) for sensitive quantitation of cardiovascular biomarkers.

        6. measure central arterial stiffness by noninvasive pulse wave analysis (PWA) using
           SphygmoCor (done up to 3 times-once at each MRI visit).
