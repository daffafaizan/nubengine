      commonly used in healthcare. Health questionnaires are often used as intake logs, discerning
      and recording the symptoms and severity of a problem at the time of presentation. Health
      diaries, in contrast, are ongoing logs which allow for mindful attention to symptoms and
      monitoring of response to therapy. Unfortunately, both types of PRO forms are often
      under-utilized or uninterpretable because they are collected on paper. Within urogynecology,
      PRO scales such as the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), Pelvic Floor Impact
      Questionnaire (PFIQ), Bristol Stool Chart, Bladder Diaries and others are used ubiquitously.
      Their impact, however, is diminished by poor compliance and recall bias. The move towards
      electronic PRO measures would be endorsed by patients (who can track and interact with their
      data), physicians (who can track progress and study group outcomes) and by regulators (who
      want to ensure accurate and reproducible data collection). Electronic PRO tools, particularly
      on the patient's own device, would allow for increased rate of reporting through mobile
      availability, time stamping of data to prevent recall bias and reduction in data entry
      mistakes and costs.

      Study Procedures After informed consent is obtained, demographic data will be collected.
      Subjects will be administered the questionnaires either in paper or web-based or smartphone
      form based on a random number block scheme. At least two weeks later but prior to treatment
      they will complete the other form of the questionnaire. This can occur at their next office
      visit or can be completed at home. Subjects will be emailed and/or called by research staff
      to remind them to complete the second set of questionnaires.
