    
      An adaptive pilot trial of RoboHearâ„¢ hardware and software to test the feasibility of
      learning to understand language using a haptic (touch) device installed in the stem of a pair
      of glasses. These tests are not meant to be exhaustive but will validate the hardware and
      software and provide an informal test platform for learning to 'hear' or interpret sounds and
      words using haptic technology.
