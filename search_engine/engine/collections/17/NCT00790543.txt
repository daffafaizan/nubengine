      complications that can require surgery within the first three years of diagnosis. The purpose
      of this study for children with a new diagnosis of Crohn's disease is to identify biomarkers
      found in the blood or stool to help predict which children are at risk of developing
      complications.

      A total of 2000 children with newly-diagnosed Crohn's disease will be enrolled within 30 days
      of diagnosis. Up to 28 medical sites in the United States and Canada will participate in the
      study.
