      hemodynamic monitoring and blood sampling. However, insertion of radial artery catheter with
      traditional palpation may be technically challenging, particularly in pediatric patients.
      There are few published studies on the use of ultrasound guidance for radial-artery catheter
      placement and mostly they were elective surgery children which received inhalation or deep
      sedative medication. Recently no setting published in pediatric intensive care unit.
