      Therapy Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE) on bimanual performance in pre-school
      children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) and on gross motor function in those with
      bilateral CP, compared with two weeks of usual motor activity including usual rehabilitation
      (control group). We will assess further changes in unilateral performance tests, daily life
      activities questionnaires and executive function tests. Neuroplastic changes will be assessed
      using brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and biomechanical changes will be
      assessed by using optoelectronic motion capture system with electromyography (EMG), to
      determine the effect of HABIT-ILE on movement pattern and quality.
