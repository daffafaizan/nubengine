        -  To determine if adoptive immunotherapy with donor-derived CD4+ and CD8+ CMV- specific
           cytotoxic lymphocyte cell lines can augment T-cell immunity and treat CMV infection post
           transplant in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome.

      OUTLINE: The patient will undergo HLA-matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation
      from a CMV-seropositive donor after undergoing conditioning with 200cGy total-body
      irradiation per protocol FHCRC Protocol 1227.

      CD8-positive and CD4-positive CMV-specific T cells are collected from the donor and used to
      generate T-cell lines.

      If the patient has progressive or persistent CMV infection, then she will receive donor T
      cells IV over 30 minutes. Infusions may be repeated after at least 14 days if the previous
      infusion was well tolerated and if the CMV infection is persistent or increasing.

      The patient undergoes blood sample collection at baseline and 7 days after T-cell infusion to
      assess CMV-specific T-cell response.
