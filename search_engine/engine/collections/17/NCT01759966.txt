      the number is approximately 30/year, and all transplants are carried out at one single
      hospital (Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet).

      Normally, the heart function is intimately controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS),
      but all nervous connections are lost during the surgical transplantation procedure, and the
      transplanted heart thus becomes denervated. In time, regrowth of nerves may cause partial
      reinnervation of the new heart.

      Some evidence suggests that reinnervation improves exercise capacity and reduces episodes of
      acute rejections and the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The purpose of this
      study is further to investigate the changes over time with respect to all parts of the
      autonomic nervous system (the sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensoric part), and the
      associated physiological and pathological consequences.

      The study may provide knowledge which ultimately could help us improve health and quality of
      live for heart transplant recipients.
