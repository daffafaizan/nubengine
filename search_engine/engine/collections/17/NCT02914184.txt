    
      -  Experimental design: Phase IIIA, observer-blind, randomised (1:1:1:1), controlled,
           multi-centric, with four parallel groups and a staggered enrolment (Part A and Part B).

        -  Duration of the study: The intended duration of the study, per subject, will be
           approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of extended safety follow-up period
           after the last dose of HRV vaccine.

             -  Epoch 001: Primary starting at Visit 1 (Day 0) and ending at the safety follow-up
                contact (Month 7-8).

        -  Primary completion Date (PCD): Visit 3 (Month 2-4).

        -  End of Study (EoS): Last testing results released of samples collected at Visit 3 or
           Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV) (Follow up contact at month 7-8).

        -  Study Groups:

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot A (also referred to as Liq_A Group)

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot B (also referred to as Liq_B Group)

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot C (also referred to as Liq_C Group)

             -  GSK Biologicals' currently licensed lyophilised HRV formulation (also referred to
                as Lyo Group)

        -  Control:active control-GSK Biologicals' currently licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine

        -  Vaccination schedule: Two doses of HRV vaccine to be administered according to a 0, 1-2
           month schedule according to the immunisation schedule for RV vaccine.

      Note that as a result of internal change in data standards terminology, the study data
      collected was converted to cDISC and the statistical analysis plan was amended accordingly.
      "Day 0" in the study design was replaced by "Day 1"; consequently, "Day n" was replaced by
      "Day n+1". Thus, the time frames (Day 0, Day n) of Outcome Measures described in this study
      record are different to that denoted in the full protocol document posted.
