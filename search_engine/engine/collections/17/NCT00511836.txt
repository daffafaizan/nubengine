      telephone contacts and 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.

      The optional open-label extension included 2 visits approximately 1 month apart. Subjects who
      completed both phases participated in a total of 8 scheduled visits (including 2 fMRI scans
      and 2 telephone contacts) over a period of up to 14 weeks.

      At screening, eligible, consenting subjects were given an Actiwatch®-Score device. They were
      instructed to record their alcohol craving using this device throughout the double-blind
      phase. The Actiwatch was programmed to beep every 3 hours ±20 minutes, thereby signaling the
      subjects to enter their craving or desire to use alcohol, at that exact moment, on a scale of
      0 to 10 (with 0 being no craving at all and 10 being extreme craving). In addition, subjects
      entered any drug and/or alcohol use at the time of occurrence. The Actiwatch was not utilized
      in the open-label portion of the study.
