      Carotid artery is the most frequent site of atherosclerosis. Recent research in carotid
      artery covers not only morphology of lumen but also direct visualization of carotid plaque or
      vessel wall. Vulnerable carotid plaques share pathologic features of intra-plaque
      inflammation and hemorrhage. There have been reports about post-contrast SWI in the field of
      vascular imaging. We hypothesized SWI is so sensitive to gadolinium based contrast agent and
      hemorrhage that contrast-enhanced SWI can visualize vulnerable carotid plaque. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate gadolinium-enhanced SWI in detection of vulnerable carotid
      plaque and compare it with MP-RAGE and DANTE T1-SPACE. This can be used to guide proper
      treatment for stroke.
