      phenotype of early OA, and often prompts patients who have failed physical therapy to elect
      APM to improve their symptoms. This arthroscopic surgery presents a unique opportunity to
      evaluate the intraarticular status of the joint including joint fluid biomarkers and synovial
      tissue for signs of inflammation in patients with mild to moderate OA. Since no post-op
      tissue repair is desired after APM, in contrast to other post-traumatic OA (PTOA) models such
      as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the APM cohort can be used to test novel
      interventions to slow down PTOA development by suppressing synovitis and inflammation.
      Results from this trial in this patient population could be applied to the broader population
      of many millions of patients with mild to moderate OA who never undergo arthroscopy.

      There are currently approximately 1,000,000 APMs performed in the United States each year,
      and about 70 percent of patients have a clinically significant improvement in symptoms after
      surgery. Much of this variation in outcome is unexplained but is hypothesized to be related
      to synovitis and joint inflammation that is currently unmeasured and untreated in usual
      clinical care.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of extended release triamcinolone for efficacy to
      improve patient reported outcome measures after APM. The investigators will evaluate joint
      fluid and synovial tissue biomarkers to assess joint inflammation as a predictor of treatment
      response, use quantitative 3T MRI to evaluate cartilage and meniscus composition and 3D bone
      shape, which are sensitive imaging markers for early joint degeneration, and use a
      prospective surgical episode data collection system to capture patient reported outcomes and
      surgeon reported operative data.
