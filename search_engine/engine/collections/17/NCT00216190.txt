      ill patients. Unfortunately, these agents have serious disadvantages that may have a negative
      impact on patient outcomes. These disadvantages include respiratory depression, prolonged
      mechanical ventilation, paradoxical agitation, myocardial depression, hypotension,
      tachyphylaxis, physical dependence, and an unpredictable duration of action following long
      term infusions. Additionally, concomitant use of an opioid or other analgesic is often
      required for ICU patients to achieve adequate levels of pain relief, which may also prolong
      awakening and possibly increase respiratory depression.

      Dexmedetomidine may offer a new treatment option that remedies many of the deficiencies of
      traditional sedatives. This agent would provide for accurate, titratable sedation and
      analgesia without the concurrent respiratory depression and accumulation common to other
      agents. It may permit greater patient interaction due to reduced impairment of cognition and
      may reduce risks associated with opioids due to its analgesia sparing property. Although such
      a drug may have important benefits for ICU patients requiring sedation for greater than 24
      hours, dexmedetomidine is not currently approved for such long-term usage.
