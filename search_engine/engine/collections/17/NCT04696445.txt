      postoperative complications. Opioids play an important role in treatment of postoperative
      pain after cardiac surgery. In frail elderly after cardiac surgery however dosing schemes for
      opioids are still unknown, potentially leading to inadequate treatment of pain and/or safety
      issues.

        -  Single center observational cohort study

        -  The study population includes frail patients â‰¥70 years undergoing elective cardiac
           surgery.

        -  Primary endpoints of this study is the concentration of morphine, oxycodone and
           metabolites in blood over time on behalf of pharmacokinetic modelling.

        -  Secondary endpoints of this study are the pharmacodynamic parameters of morphine,
           oxycodone and metabolites (M3G, M6G, noroxycodone and oxymorphone) in blood in frail
           patients; such as pain scores, postoperative opioid consumption, vital signs, side
           effects of opioids and the influence of covariates such as frailty, serum creatinine,
           Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
           morphine and oxycodone.
