      I. To determine if prophylactic administration of Lacosamide reduces the risk of seizures in
      patients with high-grade glioma (HGG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the one-year risk of first seizure in this patient population. II. To
      evaluate patient reported symptoms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate clinical and electroencephalographic predictors of seizures in this patient
      population.

      II. To evaluate the occurrence of symptoms and correlate to seizure activity as well as
      tolerance to treatment using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT)
      self-reporting tool.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (LACOSAMIDE): Participants receive lacosamide orally (PO) twice a day (BID) for up to 1
      year. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (PLACEBO): Participants receive a placebo PO BID for up to 1 year. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.
