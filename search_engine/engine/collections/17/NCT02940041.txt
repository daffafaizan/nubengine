    
      The hypothesis that will be evaluated with this study is the concordance between the
      sonographic assessment following the terms and definitions to describe uterine pathology
      proposed by MUSA (Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment) and the pelvic MRI for the
      pre-surgical diagnosis of malignant mesenquimal uterine tumors in patients affected of
      symptomatic leiomyomas with clinical or sonographic risk factors for atypical fibroids.

      If both explorations have the same efficiency for the diagnosis, one of those should be
      avoided, diminishing the costs and surgery delay for these patients.

      Those women with uterine leiomyoma who present >2 risk factors for uterine malignant
      mesenchimal tumors OR with sonographic criteria for atypical leiomyoma will be invited to
      participate in the study and will sign the informed consent.

      After this first visit, the patient will undergo a gynecological sonography, serum LDH
      determination and a pelvic MRI, as it is done in our regular clinical practice.

      All explorations will be performed in the same study center and will be done by independent
      phisicians.

      Then patients included will be adressed to a second visit to explain the results and surgery
      planning if it's needed.

      One month after the surgery, one last visit will be conducted to perform a post-surgery
      control and give the final anatomo-patological report of the surgery specimen. All data will
      be entered in the database for futher analysis.
