    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the confirmed tumor response of the combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride), and capecitabine in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the
      small bowel when dosed according to UGT1A1 genotype.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these groups of patients.

        2. To gain preliminary data on whether microsatellite instability influences outcome within
           this arm.

        3. To gain preliminary data on whether evidence of celiac disease may affect toxicity and
           outcome.

        4. To gain preliminary data on whether site of tumor origin (duodenal, jejunal, or ileal)
           affects response or survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on UGT1A1 genotype.

      GROUP 1 (6/6 UGT1A1 genotype): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 2-15.

      GROUP 2 (6/7 UGT1A1 genotype): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride as in group 1. They
      also receive oxaliplatin and capecitabine as in group 1 but at lower doses.

      GROUP 3 (7/7 UGT1A1 genotype): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and
      capecitabine as in group 1 but at lower doses.

      In all groups, treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks for 2 years and
      then periodically thereafter.
