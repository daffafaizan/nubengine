      I. To describe the correlation, if any, of specific heavy metals with high grade symptoms of
      peripheral neuropathy, defined as grade >= 3 peripheral neuropathy, (utilizing the Common
      Terminology Criterial for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 4.0) in a cohort of breast
      cancer patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the range of specific heavy metals in a cohort of breast cancer patients
      undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.

      II. To evaluate the reproducibility of sera and urine testing of heavy metal levels by
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) testing in a cohort of breast cancer
      patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo serum and urine sample collection for heavy metal analysis by ICP-MS at
      baseline and at the completion of treatment. Patients also complete neurotoxicity assessment
      questionnaire at baseline and at the completion of treatment.
