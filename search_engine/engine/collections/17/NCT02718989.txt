      electric nerve stimulation (TENS) in peripheric application can cause a decrease of
      spasticity and modulation of H-reflexes.

      But if the application is in the central nervous system the results are different. So the
      purpose of this study is quantify the modulation of the excitability of alpha moto neurone
      when the application of the current is in the central nervous system compared with a sham
      group.
