    
      This is a randomized controlled study to compare the effectiveness of a breast nerve block
      performed with bupivacaine as compared to liposomal bupivacaine in providing postsurgical
      analgesia in patients undergoing unilateral abdominally-based breast reconstruction at time
      of mastectomy.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. Compare the amount of postoperative narcotic use in patients receiving a bupivacaine or
           liposomal bupivacaine pectoralis and serratus anterior nerve block. Compare these groups
           to a retrospective control cohort who received local anesthetic infusion but did not
           receive any nerve block.

        2. Examine the incidence of narcotic-related side effects in the experimental groups by
           documenting incidents of nausea and vomiting, time to first ambulation, liquid and solid
           oral intake.

        3. Survey patient satisfaction with pain management using a visual analog scale during
           their hospital stay.
