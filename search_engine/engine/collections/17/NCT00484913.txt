      This study investigated the effect of abdominal hot compresses on hepatic blood flow measured
      by elimination of indocyanine green (ICG), a non-toxic green dye. It was presumed, that
      abdominal hot compresses increase hepatic blood flow either by local vasomotor-reflex or by
      decreasing the tone of the sympathetic nerve system.

      In healthy volunteers ICG elimination was measured with and without hot compress at two
      investigations in a weekly interval. At each investigation ICG was injected as bolus after a
      rest period of 10 minutes. After the injection blood was taken in regular intervals for
      analysis of ICG concentration over a period of 40 minutes and half life was calculated.

      The time interval between the investigations was 8 days, the sequence was randomly assigned.
