      The vaccine will be made from your AML cells which will be killed, frozen, and stored away
      when you start the study. When you go into remission, researchers will take your normal blood
      cells and culture them in the laboratory until they become "dendritic cells." Researchers
      will then thaw your tumor cells and load parts of them into the dendritic cells and inject
      the mixture. This type of vaccine will hopefully encourage your immune system to prevent
      later relapse of your disease.

      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called "screening
      tests." These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this
      study. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to make sure you do not have an infection
      with HIV/AIDS. If you do, you will not be eligible for this study.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, AML cells will be collected from
      your blood through a vein in your arm. A blood separator device called an apheresis machine
      will be used. Each apheresis procedure takes about 3-5 hours. It is similar to donating
      platelets to a blood bank. During the procedure the blood with tumor cells will be removed
      and then returned through a second line in the other arm. You may have bone marrow
      aspirations instead with general anesthesia, usually lasting up to 3 hours. To collect a bone
      marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small
      amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. The AML cells collected by either
      the apheresis or bone marrow collection procedure will be used later to make the vaccine in
      the M. D. Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory where they will be frozen and stored until it is
      time to make the vaccine.

      After the AML cells are collected, you will start receiving your induction and consolidation
      chemotherapy treatment. This treatment is standard of care and is not directly related to
      your participation in this study. After your first cycle of consolidation treatment, a bone
      marrow biopsy will be done to find out if you are in complete remission. To collect a bone
      marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount
      of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. If you are in complete remission
      then you will have your normal blood stem cells collected, which will be used to make the
      vaccine. All of the normal stem cells will be collected with the same apheresis machine used
      to collect tumor cells. Beginning 5 days before the first collection, you will receive daily
      injections under the skin of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). These are given
      to increase the number of normal stem cells available for collection. On Days 5 and 6 of
      G-CSF treatment, your normal stem cells will be collected. They will be taken to the M. D.
      Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory where they will be frozen and stored until it is time to
      make the vaccine.

      After you complete the apheresis procedure to collect normal cells, you will continue
      consolidation therapy (typically 3-5 cycles). The vaccine will be made with your previously
      frozen cells. Once thawed, a machine called the CliniMACS will be used to isolate the cells
      from your blood that will be grown into the vaccine during an 8-day procedure.

      After the last consolidation cycle, you will begin to receive 4 monthly injections of the
      vaccine. The first vaccination will be given once your blood counts have recovered from the
      final dose of chemotherapy. The remaining 3 vaccinations will be given every 28 days (+/- 7
      days). Once it is ready, each vaccine will be injected into a lymph node in your groin. A
      special machine called a sonogram (typically used to look at babies in the womb) will be used
      to painlessly locate exactly where the injection should go.

      About 3-7 days after each vaccine, about 4 tablespoons of your blood will be drawn to measure
      the immune reaction to the vaccine. At that time you will also have a skin test performed to
      look for the presence or absence of an immune reaction to the vaccine. This will be done with
      a small injection under the skin on your forearm. About 48 hours later, researchers will
      measure the area around the injection for redness, which would be a sign that your immune
      system is reacting to the vaccine.

      After you have received all 4 vaccines, you will be seen in the clinic yearly to evaluate how
      you tolerated the vaccines.

      Routine long-term follow-up exams will be performed by your leukemia doctor as per standard
      of care.

      This is an investigational study. The vaccines are not commercially available and only
      authorized for use in research. A total of 40 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      After you complete the apheresis procedure to collect normal cells, you will continue
      consolidation therapy with high-dose standard busulfan and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. You
      will also have an autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant. The chemotherapy
      and transplant are standard of care.
