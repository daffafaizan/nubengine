      audiology best practices, to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative over-the-counter (OTC)
      intervention, and to examine the influence of purchase price on outcomes for both
      service-delivery models. The design of this study was a single-site, prospective,
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial with three parallel branches: (a) audiology
      best practices (AB), (b) consumer decides OTC model (CD), and (c) placebo devices (P).
      Outcome measures were obtained after a typical 6-week trial period with follow-up 4-week
      AB-based trial for those initially assigned to CD and P groups.

      Older adults from the general community were recruited via newspaper and community flyers to
      participate at a university research clinic. Participants were adults, ages 55-79 years,with
      mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Intervention(s): All participants received the same
      highenddigital mini-behind-the-ear hearing aids fitted bilaterally.AB and P groups received
      best-practice services from audiologists; differing mainly in use of appropriate (AB) or
      placebo (P) hearing aid settings. CD participants self-selected their own pre-programmed
      hearing aids via an OTC model. Primary outcome measure was a 66-item self-report, Profile of
      Hearing Aid Performance/Benefit. Secondary outcome measure was the Connected Speech Test
      benefit.
