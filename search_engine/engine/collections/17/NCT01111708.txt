      mucosal layer of the colon. The surgery rate after 10 years is 30%. After (sub)total
      colectomy with end ileostoma patients have a choice for restorative surgery. The conventional
      ileo pouch anal anastomosis (C-IPAA) is the gold standard of reconstructive surgery. This is
      al well established technique, but still carries a significant morbidity-rate. The recent
      studied ileo neo rectal anastomosis (INRA) has shown to reduce reservoir-related
      complications with a similar functional outcome, but is a very laborious technique.
      Therefore, we want to investigate an alternative technique: the Close Rectal Ileo Pouch Anal
      Anastomosis (CR-IPAA). The CR-IPAA is conducted in the nonanatomic perimuscular plane,
      resulting in a reduction of reservoir-related complications. After the close rectal
      dissection an ileo-anal pouch anastomosis will be constructed in a similar way. The close
      rectal dissection (CRD) is very laborious and has therefore never been developed extensively.
      But recent technical development of electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (EBVS ) and
      ultrasound dissection have enhanced the CRD technique enormously. This brought along new
      interest in the CRD and justifies the research of its application.
