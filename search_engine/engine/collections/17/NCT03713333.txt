    
      Objective #1: Determine the effectiveness of handheld imaging and digital health devices on
      long term health and patient-reported outcomes through pragmatic and randomized clinical
      trial designs.

      Objective #2: Assess the impact of digital health devices on measures of healthcare
      efficiency.

      Handheld imaging and digital technologies provide a rapid diagnostic assessment at the time
      of a healthcare encounter. As such, the potential of such devices to improve healthcare
      efficiency is significant. Measures of healthcare efficiency directly related to digital
      health technologies include: identify which interventions can improve care; define the
      variations in care and; demonstrate within which patient populations digital health
      technologies are most effective.

      Objective #3: Apply integration methods for handheld imaging and digital health devices used
      for clinical decisions at the point-of-care.

      Achieving integration and interoperability-the ability of different information technology
      systems and software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other-requires
      identiÔ¨Åcation for precisely how new innovations merge into systems of care and are applied to
      various practice settings.
