    
      This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study. The study
      will take place in the EU, US and Canada.

      To allow all subjects to profit from treatment and to obtain adequate data for BoNT/A DP
      treatment, the study will be comprised of a double-blinded treatment comparing BoNT/A-DP with
      Botox Cosmetic (ratio 1:1). Primary and secondary endpoints will compare efficacy, safety and
      subject satisfaction after a single treatment of the investigational BoNT/A DP to an existing
      commercially available product (Botox Cosmetic).

      Two hundred subjects will be enrolled, which should allow for a precise estimate of response
      rate and for post-hoc sensitivity analyses.

      The duration of study participation for each subject will be up to 18 weeks, to include
      screening (maximum of 2 weeks; re-screening will not be permitted), and a single treatment
      (comprised of one injection at five injection points) of BoNT/A-DP (Group A) or Botox
      Cosmetic (Group B) followed by six efficacy and safety follow-up visits. A total of 200
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Group A or Group B at Baseline. Both investigators and
      subjects will be blinded to treatment. Investigators and subjects will evaluate the severity
      of glabellar lines independently.
