      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with olaparib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor
      activating genetic alterations in the deleterious genetic alterations in the DNA damage
      repair (DDR) pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with olaparib with
      advanced solid tumors including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, CNS tumors, and histiocytosis that
      harbor deleterious genetic alterations in the DDR pathway.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of olaparib in children and adolescents with
      relapsed or refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of olaparib in children and
      adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through the
      evaluation of circulating tumor DNA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
