      the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI). Patients with stable HF referred to cardiac
      rehabilitation will undergo baseline assessment and then be randomly assigned (1:1) to either
      standard exercise therapy (consisting of regular walking and a resistance exercise program)
      or Nordic walking. Follow-up measures will be taken at the end of intervention (12 weeks) and
      after a 14-week no-intervention observation period (26 weeks). After initial randomization to
      treatment group, participants will be stratified by treatment group and randomly assigned to
      one of three follow-up measurement conditions at 12 weeks: echocardiograph and
      cardiopulmonary test (N=80); cardiopulmonary test only (N=60); or no follow-up
      echocardiograph or cardiopulmonary test (N=76). The primary outcomes will be: a) changes in
      exercise capacity measured by 6MWT; and b) changes in disease-specific HRQL measured by the
      MLHFQ. Additional measures will examine the effects of the exercise interventions on: cardiac
      performance; leisure time activity; cardio-respiratory fitness; body composition;
      neurohormonal activation; and generic HRQL
