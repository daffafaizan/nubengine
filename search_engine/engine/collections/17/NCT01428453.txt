    
      The study is in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and evidence of cerebrovascular disease
      (CVD) who are currently treated with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or
      memantine. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group,
      repeat dose design, in which subjects (up to 60 randomized subjects per arm) will receive
      oral placebo or rilapladib (250 mg), once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their stable
      background AD therapy consisting of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or
      memantine. Subjects will take 250mg of rilapladib or placebo once daily for a period of 24
      weeks. The total duration of participation for each subject will be approximately 30 weeks
      comprising approximately 4 weeks screening, 24 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow-up. From
      the time of randomization and throughout the treatment period subjects will attend visits
      after 1 week, 4 weeks and thereafter every 4 weeks until Week 24. A follow-up visit will
      occur approximately 2 weeks after the final dose of study medication. Cognitive assessments
      will be performed at the screening visit, at the randomization (baseline) visit and at weeks
      12 and 24 of the treatment period. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be taken via lumbar
      puncture at baseline and Week 24 for biomarker analyses related to Alzheimer's disease. Blood
      samples will be collected throughout the study for pharmacokinetics and a range of biomarker
      analyses. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed (including
      vital signs, laboratory tests, eye examinations and ECGs).
