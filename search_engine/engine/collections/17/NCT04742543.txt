    
      A prospective, open-label, randomized control trial in a tertiary university affiliated
      medical center between March 2021 to March 2023. Overall, 100 women referred for conization
      of cervix due to cervical dysplasia will be randomly allocated to undergo conization either
      with the use of virtual reality glasses (study group) or with standard treatment (control
      group). The primary outcome measures will include self-reported pain, anxiety scores, and
      vital signs as an indirect measurement of pain and anxiety, including pulse rate (PR) and
      respiratory rate (RR). Pain and anxiety outcomes will be measured as numeric rating scores.
