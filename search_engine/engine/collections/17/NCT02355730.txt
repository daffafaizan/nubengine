      antagonists has been rising in recent years. Increasing life expectancy is increasing the
      proportion of the population having conditions such as Atrial Fibrillation and venous
      thrombosis, where primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic complications are best
      achieved with anticoagulation.

      Unpredictable pharmacokinetics, widespread interactions with drugs and food and the narrow
      therapeutic window make closely monitoring Vitamin K antagonists a necessity. Portable point
      of care (POC) coagulometers which measure PT from capillary whole blood and provide an INR
      reading within a few minutes are already widely available throughout North American and
      Europe. They give comparable results when compared to laboratory based systems are popular
      with patients and significantly shorten the duration of clinics. In addition, the United
      Kingdom Department of Health has been encouraging the use of anticoagulation services in
      Primary Care Trusts the aim being to provide INR monitoring in community clinics and General
      Practice surgeries relieving pressure on hospital services and reducing inconvenience for
      patients.

      Although coagulometers are now commercially available the Microvisk INR Testing System has
      been designed to have advantages, particularly in terms of test robustness, user comfort,
      ease of use and reduction of user error. The present trial has been designed to develop the
      second generation Microvisk INR Test System; blood samples will also be used to optimise
      manufacturing processes and verify the quality of Test Strip Lots.
