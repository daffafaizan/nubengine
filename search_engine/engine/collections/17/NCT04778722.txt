      was the case before, there is still lack of information, about its composition, how and when
      it changes and how that can affect processes in the female body.

      During pregnancy, the microbiome physiologically gets increasingly stable. Diversity of
      bacteria decreases, which is the sign of a healthy microbiome, and Lactobacillus species
      increase their already pre-existing dominance. Acidic metabolites of those bacteria maintain
      the low pH and low diversity in vagina.

      If the dominance of lactobacilli is not as large as it should be, the risk of preterm birth
      increases significantly. Low relative abundance of Lactobacillus species, especially
      Lactobacillus crispatus (marker of the healthy microbiome) and lactobacillus metabolites as
      well as high vaginal microbial diversity are most significantly connected with preterm birth.

      Despite such a high relevance of vaginal microbiome for a healthy pregnancy, and for women's
      health in general, there's an insufficient proof that the intake of oral probiotics can
      change it. The aim of our study is to see if the intake of patented dietary supplement,
      containing four Lactobacillus strains can change the relative abundance of different bacteria
      in the vaginal microbiome. This could lay ground for further research in this area and even
      create new therapeutic approaches in the future.
