      induction of labor. A direct comparison of efficacy and time to delivery in multiparas has
      not been specifically investigated. Additionally, the study will look at costs of the two
      drugs.Oxytocin is administered through an IV so requires more direct patient care time from
      the Registered Nurse, IV pump, and tubing, whereas misoprostol is a tablet, administered only
      once, per vagina or orally, every 4 hours. Misoprostol is also very inexpensive
      comparatively; if equally or more efficacious than oxytocin, this could demonstrate quite a
      cost and time savings to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and other institutions. Safety
      of either drug is not in question.
