      fish oil. It will be used in an open label compassionate use treatment protocol, as an
      alternative to soybean oil (omega-6), as the sole IFE source of parenteral nutrition in an
      effort to reduce and/or reverse parenteral nutrition associated liver disease. The study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Omegaven use in pediatric patients with PN dependence and
      PNALD.
