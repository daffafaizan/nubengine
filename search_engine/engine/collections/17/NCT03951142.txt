      Medicinal Product (IMP). The focus of the study is to assess the dose-response relationship
      of losartan on imaging-based measures of tissue perfusion and mechanical forces in patients
      with brain tumors. We hypothesize that losartan improves the effect of traditional cancer
      treatment by alleviating mechanical forces (solid stress) of the tumor microenvironment to
      improve tissue perfusion, while administration of losartan alone has little effect on cancer
      patients.

      This is an open-label study and no active comparator or placebo will be used. Study
      participants include adult patients with newly diagnosed- and recurrent glioblastoma, as well
      as adult patients with metastatic brain tumors from non-small cell lung cancer. The study
      will assess the safety of losartan treatment and its dose-response relationship on
      conventional and experimental radiographic characteristics when used alone or as an add-on to
      standard cancer treatment.
