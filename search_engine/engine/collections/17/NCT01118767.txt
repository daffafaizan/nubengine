      onset of resistant strains of HIV. In Peru, where ART has recently been introduced, adherence
      to HIV treatment has not yet been addressed properly. Innovative approaches using information
      technologies such as cell phones are needed to increase adherence to ART for people with
      HIV/AIDS. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) Conduct formative research to assess
      culturally-specific behavioral messages to be included in the computer-based system; 2)
      Develop and test an interactive computer-based system using cell phones to enhance adherence
      to ART and to deliver HIV transmission risk reduction messages; 3) Evaluate the impact of the
      system on antiretroviral adherence and sexual risk behaviors.
