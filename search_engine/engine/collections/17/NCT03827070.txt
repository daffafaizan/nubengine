      Talc is introduced into the pleural cavity in several ways:

        -  Drainage - a tube is inserted into the pleural cavity through a puncture in the chest,
           and then a pasty talcum is delivered into the cavity, which spreads through the cavity
           during the change of the patient's body position.

        -  Talcum powder - under the control of thoracoscopy, dry talc is blown into the pleural
           cavity of the patient, which allows him to evenly distribute and significantly increases
           the effectiveness of the procedure.

      In this Clinical Trial investigators will use the method of thoracoscopy - the blow in of
      talcum powder and therapeutic dose of Afatinib. Before injection, a suspension of talc and
      afatinib is subjected to the procedure of pharmaceutical mixing.

      The operation is well tolerated by participants and lasts no more than 30 minutes. The
      effectiveness of the method is 90%.
