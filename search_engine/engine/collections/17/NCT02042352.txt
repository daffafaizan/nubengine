      seeking fertility treatment in Denmark. Secondly we want to establish whether there are
      correlations between altered vaginal microbiotas and self-measurements of both the vaginal pH
      performed with the Saling pH glove™ and a self-collected swab with Copan Eswab™ because these
      would be useful for an easy-access longitudinal screening option. Finally, the third aim was
      to explore how the species composition of vaginal microbiotas measured by a multiplex qPCR
      assay was reflected in Nugent scores.

      A possible 4th aim is to identify patterns in the relative abundances of different species
      with 16sRNA primers among fertile women compared with infertile women because these
      differences could be indicative of a vaginal microbiota associated with bad fertility
      outcome.
