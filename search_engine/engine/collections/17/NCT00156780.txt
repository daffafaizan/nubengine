      enhanced echocardiography to detect CAD. The patient population is comprised of those
      patients who have chest pain and are being evaluated for inducible ischemia. This population
      may include patients with compromised pulmonary function due to COPD or CHF. This study was
      to evaluate the safety of AI-700 in these patients.
