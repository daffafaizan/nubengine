      low-dose oral cyclophosphamide in combination with fixed dose everolimus in patients with
      mRCC not amenable to or progressive after a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      containing treatment regimen. Phase I part: Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 5 per
      dose level. The first 5 patients enrolled will be assigned to dose level 0 in order to assess
      immune and angiogenic effects caused by everolimus monotherapy. The second 5 patients
      enrolled will be assigned to dose level 1. If there are ≤1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
      experienced by the first 5 patients in a cohort during the first 28 days after the first
      study treatment, further patients will be entered in the next dose level. Entry of patients
      into the expansion cohort will not occur until at least 28 days after the last patient in the
      escalation phase received his/her first study treatment. At the final dose level recommended
      for the phase II study a minimum of 10 patients will be treated. Phase II part: In the phase
      2 part of the study up to 56 patients will be treated at the dose level that has been
      selected based on its capacity to most selectively deplete circulating Treg levels in the
      phase 1 part of the study. Based on data of patients with mRCC treated with everolimus
      monotherapy after previous treatment with sunitinib ± sorafenib, the investigators aim to
      increase the number of patients who are alive and cancer progression free at 4 months from
      50% to 70% by adding metronomic cyclophosphamide. In addition, the investigators consider
      this increase meaningful as long as the combination treatment does not cause combination
      treatment related toxicity ≥ grade 3 in ≥ 30% of patients.
