    
      -  Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a graft-versus-host disease of respiratory organs.

        -  Prognosis of BO is very poor, and the overall outcome of patients who are involved in BO
           is very dismal.

        -  The mechanism of BO has been known to be associated with immune / non-immune response.

        -  Corticosteroid and immunosuppressants are recommended as a best current treatment
           options for BO, which have been not satisfactory.

        -  Many treatment options have been tried to improve the outcome of BO.

        -  Azithromycin, as an immune modulating agent, has been tried for the treatment of BO, and
           has been reported to show hopeful results.

        -  N-acetylcystein, as an antioxidative agent, has been tried for BO.

        -  Inhaled corticosteroid may help to improve airway inflammation and decrease the amount
           of systemic corticosteroid.

        -  These 3 drugs are widely used for other respiratory disease, have been proven to be
           safe, and have shown some efficacy for BO in various depth of evidence.

        -  In these rationale, we'd like to try the 3-drug combination for BO, to assess the
           efficacy and safety of these drug combination.
