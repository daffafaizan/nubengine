    
      Primary Objective: To determine the detection rate of bilateral sentinel lymph nodes with the
      concurrent use of Lymphoseek and Indocyanine Green.

      Secondary Objective: (1) To determine the overall detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes with
      concurrent use of Lymphoseek and Indocyanine Green (2) To determine location and number of
      Lymphoseek-positive sentinel lymph nodes preoperatively by single-photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT/CT imaging) and intraoperatively by a laparoscopic handheld gamma detection
      device and near- infrared fluorescent imaging (3) To determine the concordance of
      Lymphoseek-positive sentinel lymph nodes with intraoperatively detected Indocyanine
      Green-positive sentinel lymph nodes.
