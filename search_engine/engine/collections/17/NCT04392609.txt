    
      This study was designed as a retrospective case-control study. All 116 patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancer who started neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and underwent radical
      surgery in West of China Hospital and completed the required MR examination before and after
      neoadjuvant treatment were included from March 2016 to December 2019. MRI imaging indicators
      of patients before and after neoadjuvant therapy, including tumor location, longitudinal
      diameter, circumferential Angle, DWI signal, mrTRG and texture feature data, were
      retrospectively collected to analyze the changes before and after treatment, and compared
      with patients receiving NCT in PART1. At the same time, indicators with statistical
      differences will be included in the construction of models predicting different pathological
      outcomes after NCT and NCRT, and the efficacy of the models was evaluated through c-index
      values and ROC analysis of bootstrap resampling 500 times.
