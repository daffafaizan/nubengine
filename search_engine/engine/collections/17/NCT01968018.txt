    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study. A total of 35
      participants will be enrolled in this study. Participants will receive tablet of combination
      of tramadol HCI (37.5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg) on Day 1. Participants may increase their
      daily dosage of study medication as 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain
      relief, up to maximum of 8 tablets per day. Rescue medication consisting of Extra Strength
      Tylenol (500 mg) 2 tablets daily for the first six days of the Open-label Phase will be
      allowed so that the total daily dose of acetaminophen will not exceed 4,000 mg. The total
      duration of the study treatment for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks. Safety
      will be evaluated by assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, skin site
      assessments, vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the
      study.
