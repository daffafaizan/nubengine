    
      This is an observational multi-centered study that will be conducted in the government
      subsidized tri-partite CM out-patient clinics (Chinese Medicine Clinic cum Training and
      Research Centres, "CMCTRs").

      The study contains two parts as follows:

        1. Retrospective Syndrome Survey: Retrospective information will be collected from
           participants using semi-structured interview and measuring the baseline body
           constitution before the rehabilitation treatment under the Programme, with the
           self-developed Body Constitutions Questionnaire.

        2. TCM therapeutic assessment: The improvement of clinical symptoms and the status of body
           constitutions will be periodically evaluated.

      Clinical CM Diagnostic Pattern & clinical characteristics assessments, lung function tests,
      quality of life and no. of western medical consultations will be assessed at each visit for 9
      months. Both retrospective and prospective assessments will be done for those participants
      who have already joined the Rehabilitation Program in CMCTRs.

      Sample Size: Estimated at 150 participants.

      Treatment of the Rehabilitation Program in CMCTRs:

      The treatment is based on individual Chinese Medicine syndrome and clinical symptoms based on
      the Chinese Medicine practice guideline for COVID-19 patients. Two main Chinese medicine
      syndromes for patients recovered from COVID-19 with the recommended prescriptions will be
      included in the Rehabilitation Program.

      the participants will receive three months individualized-Chinese herbal medicine treatment
      in CMCTRs. After the three months treatment, they are free to either continue another
      three-month treatment or enter into the follow-up period. Each participant will be assessed
      every month during the treatment and three months after treatment as follow-up.
