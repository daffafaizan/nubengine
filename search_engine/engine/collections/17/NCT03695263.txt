      estimating treatment effects in the individual. N-of-1 trials have been offered to hundreds
      or perhaps thousands of patients worldwide, but never at scale. HackYourHealth is a tool that
      supports the conduct of simple N-of-1 self-experiments to test if healthy activities that
      work in general (i.e., mindfulness meditation, physical activity, gratitude journaling,
      random acts of kindness, and laughter therapy), improve psychological well-being (stress,
      focus, happiness) in specific individuals. The tool supplies the experimental design,
      facilitates data analysis, and channels feedback to participants. The tool is flexible enough
      to support Massive Individualized N-of-1 Experiments (MINEs) at scale. Working with WNYC
      Radio in New York City, we will recruit and run 18-day N-of-1 trials up to 10,000
      individuals. The purpose of this study is to conduct a formative evaluation of HackYourHealth
      in terms of its perceived usefulness and to explore heterogeneity in intervention response
      across the sample. We anticipate that the results will: 1) identify useful behavioral
      interventions for individual participants; 2) help to estimate generalizable treatment
      effects for the interventions of interest; 3) assess heterogeneity of treatment effects
      across subgroups; and 4) elucidate the user experience with N-of-1 trials. When complete, the
      study will support additional proposals designed to assess the utility of MINEs as applied to
      additional conditions and treatments.
