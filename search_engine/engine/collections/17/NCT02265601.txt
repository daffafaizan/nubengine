    
      Background: Despite widespread agreement that individuals ought to plan for their medical
      futures, few people (even seriously ill patients with cancer) actually complete advance
      directives, fewer yet understand key elements, and even when advance directives do exist,
      there are often barriers to their being implemented.

      Objectives: The investigators innovative, multimedia, interactive, computer-based decision
      aid, "Making Your Wishes Known: Planning Your Medical Future," offers tailored education,
      values clarification exercises, and a sophisticated decision aid that translates an
      individual's goals and preferences into a specific medical plan that can be implemented by a
      health care team. This project aims to evaluate its impact on decision-making and health care
      received by individuals at the end of life in a randomized clinical trial among a population
      of patients with advanced cancer who have life expectancies of < 12 months.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of a computer-based advance care planning intervention on
      end-of-life decision-making by cancer patients with estimated life expectancies < 12 months.
      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to standard care (paper/pencil living will
      form), use of the computer-based intervention will:

      H1: Improve individuals' decision-making about end-of-life health care

      H2: Improve individuals' experience with the process of advance care planning

      H3: Not increase individuals' hopelessness or anxiety, nor harm the doctor-patient
      relationship

      Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of the investigators intervention on end-of-life health care
      received by cancer patients with estimated life expectancies < 12 months. The investigators
      hypothesize that, compared to standard care, use of the computer intervention will:

      H4: Increase physician awareness of individuals' health care wishes

      H5: Increase physician adherence to individuals' health care wishes

      Study Design: Randomized, controlled pre-intervention/post-intervention trial comparing a
      computer-based educational intervention with standard care

      Cancer Relevance: Patients with advanced cancer face many medical decisions, some of which
      must be made when the patient cannot speak for him or herself. Helping these individuals to
      effectively articulate and communicate their wishes, in advance, can help assure that
      treatment they receive is consistent with their values, goals and wishes. This study aims to
      test the effectiveness of the investigators' computer-based intervention. If successful, this
      intervention can help improve the quality of health care received by cancer patients at the
      end of life.
