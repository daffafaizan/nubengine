      old) diagnosed with HIV / AIDS from the Pediatric Infectious Disease Outpatient Clinic - zone
      4, from a tertiary care university hospital in the South Region in Brazil, along with their
      caregivers. Present Dyslipidemia, characterized by Total Cholesterol> 200mg / dL associated
      with:Triglycerides ≥ 150mg HDL cholesterol (male <40 mg / dL and female <50 mg / dL) LDL
      cholesterol ≥ 160 mg / dL. The clinical profile, immunological, virological, the biochemical
      parameters will be accessed by the patient's chart and the dietary parameters will be
      evaluated by means of 24-hour reminder instrument. The sample was calculated, using a
      software, from an alpha error of 5%, reliability power of 80%, to obtain detection difference
      and standard deviation for each of the group of 40, totaling 36 patients.

      The randomization will be performed through simple randomization in blocks of 2 patients
      generated by computer program, available at www.randomization.com.
