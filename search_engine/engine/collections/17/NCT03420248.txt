      hysterectomy and myomectomy in symptomatic fibroids. However, post-procedural pain after UAE
      remains a major problem. The non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol particle and tri-acryl gelatin
      microsphere are two embolic materials used for UAE.Therefore, the aim of study is to compare
      pain intensity and inflammation after uterine artery embolization using non-spherical
      polyvinyl alcohol particles or tris-acryl gelatin microsphere in patients with symptomatic
      fibroids
