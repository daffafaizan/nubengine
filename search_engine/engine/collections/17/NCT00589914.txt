    
      This is a randomized (patients assigned to treatment groups by chance), double-blind (patient
      and study staff will not know the treatment assignment) study of paliperidone palmitate
      compared with RISPERDAL CONSTA (Risperidone Long-Acting Intramuscular Injection) in adult
      patients with schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 14 weeks.
      For those patients without source documentation of tolerability to oral (by mouth)
      risperidone or paliperidone Extended Release (ER) tablets, injectable RISPERDAL CONSTA or
      paliperidone palmitate, or those patients who were not currently taking another
      antipsychotic, a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 6 days of oral paliperidone ER treatment
      at a dosage of 6 mg/day will be administered for tolerability testing before the first
      injection of double-blind (DB) study drug (paliperidone palmitate or RISPERDAL CONSTA).
      During the DB period, study drug will be administered to patients as an intramuscular (i.m.)
      injection. Paliperidone palmitate (PP) 150mg equivalent (eq) (and RISPERDAL CONSTA placebo)
      at Baseline (BL) (Day 1), 100mg eq at Visit (V) 4 (Day 8), 50 or 100mg eq at V7 (Day 36), and
      50,100,or 150mg eq at V9 (Day 64) or RISPERDAL CONSTA (RC) 25mg at V4 and V6 (Day 22), 25 or
      37.5mg at V7, and 25, 37.5, or 50mg at V9 will be given as i.m. injections. Patients in the
      RC group will also take risperidone tablets (1-6 mg/day) at BL for 28 days and be given an
      injection of PP placebo at BL, V1, V7, and V9.
