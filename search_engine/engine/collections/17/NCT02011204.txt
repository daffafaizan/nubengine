      myography (EIM) as a diagnostic and disease-tracking tool. In addition, the following will be
      studied:

        1. Determine EIM device's ability to discriminate between ALS and "look-alike" non-fatal,
           motor-predominant syndromes;

        2. Track EIM progression over time and determine the best summary EIM measure that could
           serve as an endpoint in future clinical trials and individual patient care; and,

        3. Determine whether EIM progression is predictive of a combined outcome of survival and
           progression as measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale, Revised (ALSFRS-R), Hand-held
           Dynamometry (HHD) and Vital Capacity (VC) measures.
