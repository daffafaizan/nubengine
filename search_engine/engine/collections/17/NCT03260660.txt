      patients with chronic liver diseases. While numerous tissue abnormalities can affect liver
      stiffness, liver stiffness measured by MR elastography is most often used to predict and
      quantify liver fibrosis. Conventional MR elastography techniques require multiple
      breath-holds that are 12-20 seconds in length. In the pediatric population, reliable
      breath-holding >10 seconds can be challenging. Recently, compressed sensing has become
      available as a method for accelerating image data acquisition, and thus shortening
      breath-holds.
