      hyperactivation, leading to alveolar inflammation, is the main mechanism in determining lung
      damage. Evidence are accumulating about the pivotal role played by IL-6 in this disease.
      Preliminary evidence, indeed, point out the efficacy of an IL-6 receptor inhibitor in
      improving clinical conditions in a proportion of rapidly deteriorating patients. Our
      hypotesis is that a precocious inhibition of IL-6 signal, by the administration of
      tofacitinib (JAK 1/3 Inhibitor), could hinder the progression to more severe grades of lung
      inflammation leading to pulmonary function deterioration. In a prospective single cohort open
      study, 50 patients admitted in Hospital due to SARS-CoV 2 symptomatic interstitial pneumonia,
      but not requiring mechanical ventilation, will be enrolled. Tofacitinb will be administered
      every day for 14 days, starting within 24 h from the admission. The primary outcome is to
      evaluate the effect of this drug on the rate of patients who will need mechanical
      ventilation. Safety in this population will also be actively monitored.
