      situ hybridization (FISH), digital image analysis (DIA), and quantifiable morphometric
      results in biliary stricture brushings. Recently, polysomy FISH has been studied as a
      promising marker in predicting cancer in a pancreato-biliary stricture. Many genetic,
      epigenetic, and protein alterations arise during pancreaticobiliary tumor process. The types
      of markers that have been commonly evaluated as diagnostic assays are mutations, chromosomal
      gains and losses, and DNA methylation alterations. However there are only a few studies in
      this area. Testing for these markers can help determine whether the narrowing or stricture in
      your bile duct is cancer or not.
