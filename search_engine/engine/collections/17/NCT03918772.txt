    
      The main objectives of this study are to: i) characterize the clinical and paraclinical
      determinants of IgE-mediated allergy that could be correlated to the ultimate diagnosis; and
      ii) elaborate a decision-making algorithm for clinical patterns identification of
      perioperative allergic reactions to guide acute management, thus potentially decreasing the
      related morbidity and mortality.

      The secondary objectives are to: i) suggest a modification of the Ring and Messmer scale
      according to the phenotypes involved; ii) identify the clinical characteristics of isolated
      non-allergic bronchospasm; iii) compare the most frequent agents involved in perioperative
      IgE-mediated allergy to those reported in the international studies; iv) identify the
      negative predictive values of skin tests in allergic and non-allergic patients; v) compare
      the therapeutic modalities used to those recommended in the literature; vi) describe the
      cases of morbidity and mortality and identify the potential risk factors.

      The Ring and Messmer scale is used to quote the clinical features occurring in drug- or
      latex-induced immediate hypersensitivity and has been adapted to the perioperative setting as
      follows:

      Grade I: Muco-cutaneous signs only (generalized erythema and/or extensive urticaria and/or
      angioedema) Grade II: Mucocutaneous signs, hypotension, tachycardia and/or moderate
      bronchospasm Grade III: Mucocutaneous signs, cardiovascular collapse, tachycardia or
      bradycardia, bronchospasm, digestive signs Grade IV: Cardiac arrest Grade V: Death

      Perioperative immediate hypersensitivity reaction requires further allergologic assessment.

      The allergologic assessment is performed a few weeks after the reaction to confirm or
      disprove an allergic mechanism behind the reaction (i.e. allergy versus non-allergy), and to
      identify culprit agent(s) and safe drugs, including suitable alternatives. It is based on the
      review of the details of the reaction along with histamine and/or tryptase levels and
      specific Immunoglobulin E levels (when available) and skin tests results.

      Plasma histamine and/or tryptase levels and Immunoglobulin E levels are measured at the time
      of the reaction. Acute tryptase levels are compared to baseline tryptase measured at least 24
      hours after the reaction or when the patient is referred for allergological investigation.
      Skin tests, including prick-tests and intradermal tests, are performed during the
      allergological assessment.
