      treatment of geriatric depression. The investigators are interested in assessing the efficacy
      of levomilnacipran (LMIL) to placebo (PBO), and exploring the effects of antidepressant
      response on brain connectivity and neuroplasticity. This pilot study is designed to determine
      any differences in the efficacy, safety and tolerability of levomilnacipran compared to
      placebo, and to perform dose finding (20-120 mg per day) in 40 older depressed adults. The
      investigators anticipate that the LMIL will be superior to PBO in improving levels of
      depressive symptoms and rates of remission, as well as improving cognition, apathy, and
      quality of life. This proposal expands the investigator's focus on the biomarkers of
      neuroplasticity that have been used in several prior studies and demonstrated responsivity to
      antidepressant treatment. The purpose is to examine this directly in 40 older adults with
      major depression. This proposed trial will also serve as a pilot study to estimate the
      efficacy and tolerability of the drug in older depressed adults, and the dose-finding in this
      population.
