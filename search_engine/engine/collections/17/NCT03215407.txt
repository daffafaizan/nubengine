    
      Aim: Comparing the efficacy and safety of intra-articular injection of tocilizumab and
      compound betamethasone.

      Study design: A randomized, single-blind, parallel controlled and one center trial design,
      the study period is 4 weeks.

      Sample size: 60 cases. Study content: Patients who meet inclusive criteria will be randomly
      divided into tocilizumab group and compound betamethasone group according to the random
      number table. In the baseline period, the investigators will collect patients' general
      information, disease information, disease activity score, laboratory results and images of
      articular ultrasound. After 4 weeks of injection, patients will be asked to come back, and
      their disease information, disease activity score, laboratory results as well as images of
      articular ultrasound will be collected. Finally, these data will be sorted and analyzed.

      Index of effect evaluation: 1) Articular ultrasound, OMERACT-EULAR composite PDUS synovitis
      score will be used to evaluate the condition of articulation; 2) Disease activity score,
      DAS28-CRP, DAS28-ESR; 3) Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ; 4) Rheumatoid and arthritis
      outcome score, RAOS; 5) composite change index, CCI score; 6) diameter of knee joint; 7) knee
      flexion range.

      Hypothesis: The efficacy and safety of intra-articular injection of tocilizumab is better
      than that of compound betamethasone.
