    
      We include 300 road traffic accident victims hospitalized in surgical department (less than 2
      weeks). Patients are hospitalized in 5 different hospitals (3 in Lille, 1 in Douai, 1 in
      Paris). Patients will be evaluated by a short screening questionnaire (DEPITAC's 10 item
      screen). Patients will be evaluated by phone with a experimented psychologist (Minimal
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM IV, PTSD Check List symptoms) at 6 weeks, 6
      months and 1 year after the accident.

      Purposes :

        -  To evaluate DEPITAC's 10-item screen for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for use in
           surgical or emergency department.

        -  To measure prognosis value of DEPITAC's 10 item screen on acute PTSD (PTSD Check List
           symptoms (PCLs) 6th week) and late PTSD (PTSD Check List symptoms (PCLs) 6 months and 1
           year) or other psychiatric disorder (anxiety, depression or addictive disorder) (Minimal
           International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI DSM IV at 6 months and 1 year).

        -  To compare DEPITAC to Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) given a the same time.

        -  To calculate DEPITAC's total score and correlate to the onset of a PTSD at 6 week, 6
           months and 1 year.
