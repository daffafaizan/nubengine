    
      Part 1 of the study is an exploratory comparison of the relative oral bioavailability of the
      two dispersible tablets versus risdiplam powder for oral solution as the reference. The
      effect of food on the bioavailability of the two dispersible tablets will be assessed by
      comparing fed and fasted states in a five-way crossover manner. It will also be assessed
      whether antacids (omeprazole) have an impact on the bioavailability of the dispersible
      tablets in a two-way crossover manner. The food effect on the risdiplam oral solution will
      also be assessed by comparing fed and fasted states in a two-way crossover manner.

      In Part 2, based on the data obtained in Part 1 and provided data support further evaluation,
      a bioequivalence assessment and a food-effect evaluation will be conducted in two groups with
      the selected dispersible tablet formulation. Each group will randomly receive, in a three-way
      crossover, a single dose of risdiplam oral solution 5 mg in fasted state, and a single dose
      of the selected dispersible tablet in both fed and fasted states.

      In Part 3, provided Part 1 data support further evaluation of the second formulation, the
      second formulation may be assessed for bioequivalence in the same way as described in Part 2.
