    
      This study is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to be conducted
      at approximately 100 study sites. Approximately 252 subjects (172 AChR-Ab+ and 80 MuSK-Ab+)
      will be enrolled. Patients with MG who are positive for anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies
      will be enrolled and analyzed separately as 2 populations: (1) AChR-Ab+ and (2) MuSK-Ab+.
      Patients who do not have anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies will not be enrolled. Patients
      with MGFA classification II, III, or IV disease, MG-ADL score ≥ 6, QMG score ≥ 11, and use of
      a corticosteroid and/or non-steroidal immunosuppressant will be included in the study.

      All subjects who complete the randomized controlled period will have the option to enroll in
      a 1.5-year open-label period.
