    
      This is a randomized controlled multicenter trial. Patients after in-hospital cardiac arrest
      are randomized either to standard therapy or to standard therapy in addition to mild
      therapeutic hypothermia. Mild therapeutic hypothermia is performed for 24 hours with a target
      temperature of 32-34Â°C. Inclusion criteria are: Adult patients which have been resuscitated
      after cardiac arrest in-hospital and who remain unconscious after restoration of spontanous
      circulation. Exclusion criteria are: severe cardiogenic shock, severe rhythm disorders, major
      surgery within the last 10 days, planned surgery within the next 24 hours afer resuscitation,
      active bleeding, suspicion od intracranial bleeding, severe infection, such as pneumonia or
      sepsis, a severe neurological deficit before cardiac arrest, an aquired immun deficency,
      pregnacy. The primary endpoint is mortality for all causes after six months. Secondary
      endpoints are neurological outcome after six months measured by the Glasgow-Pittsburgh
      Cerebral Performance scale, and in-hospital-mortality.
