      for prevention of venous thromboembolism after KA.

      A bilateral whole-leg colour-coded Doppler ultrasonography (CCDU) is scheduled for all
      patients at 7 (+1) days of follow-up; additionally, CCDU was due if the patients developed
      symptoms or signs suggestive of venous thromboembolism earlier.

      Statistical & Analytical Plan and Methodology: In the absence of prophylaxis the incidence of
      venous thromboembolism (primary efficacy end-point) after KA, as assessed by CCDU, is about
      8.0% (combining weighted results of various paper). Prophylaxis with low-molecular weight
      heparins assures approximately a 60-70% relative risk reduction in this setting. Based on the
      findings of published trials investigating the efficacy of Rivaroxaban for prevention of
      venous thromboembolism after elective hip and knee surgery, when using a low-molecular-weight
      heparin as comparator, investigators can speculate that Rivaroxaban will further reduce this
      incidence (at least 1.2%).
