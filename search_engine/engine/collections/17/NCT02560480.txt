      and 10 %. Common causes include adductor tendonitis, musculus rectus abdominis tendopathy,
      osteitis pubis (edema on MRI scans at pubic symphysis) or disruption of the posterior wall of
      inguinal canal or iliopsoas muscle. This observational case-control study follows three
      contact sports team (male soccer, ice-hockey and bandy) for two years to find out prevalence
      of acute and chronic groin pain. Adult (>18 years old) male athletes with acute or chronic
      groin pain during the study pediod are included. Outcome measures are clinical examination,
      pain scores, exact diagnosis and repeated pelvic MRI (two times) are performed in each
      patients and three control atheletes in each team. Hip and groin questionnaire (HAGOS) is
      used to determine the severity of groin injuries. The end-points of study are prevalence of
      groin injuries and exact diagnosis.
