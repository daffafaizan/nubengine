      for improving medication adherence in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
      Participants in this study will complete assessment sessions, as well as intervention
      sessions over a 15 week period. During this time, medication adherence will be monitored
      using a MEMS cap. The investigators hypothesize that, following the cognitive intervention,
      there will be improvements in participants' medication adherence, as well as in facets of
      memory.
