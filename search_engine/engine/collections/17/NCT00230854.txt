      treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin will be treated. The study treatment will
      consist of the same type and doses of pegylated interferon and ribavirin to which the patient
      failed to respond plus EMZ702. EMZ702 will be administered intravenously twice a week during
      the first 12 weeks of treatment. Thereafter and according to viral response, patients will
      continue to receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin only for up to 36 weeks.
