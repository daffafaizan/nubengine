    
      A multi-center, open-label, phase II clinical study of metformin in up to 49 patients with
      low-grade NMIBC with the aim to determine the overall response to administration of oral
      metformin for 3 months in a marker tumour deliberately left following transurethral resection
      of multiple, papillary NMIBC tumours. All patients will receive metformin orally at doses up
      to 1500 mg twice daily. Metformin treatment will start within 2 weeks following transurethral
      resection, in which all but the marker lesion will be resected. After 3 months of metformin
      treatment, the effect of metformin on the marker lesion is evaluated by cystoscopy and biopsy
      under anaesthesia. Residual tumour, if present at this evaluation, will be resected. In case
      of complete disappearance of the marker lesion the former tumour area will be biopsied.
