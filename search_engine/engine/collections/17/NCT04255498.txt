      oxygen consumption oxygen uptake, and 7 follow-up sampling points) to measure the mediators
      of relapse in the context of their interactive homeostatic networks. The investigator
      surveyed the response of genes and blood-borne biomarkers in order to interrogate and map the
      regulation of neuro-endocrine-autonomic-immune function in these subjects as compared to GW
      era sedentary healthy controls. This study is the first to test in the GWI human system of
      the impact of interventions that hope to permanently re-set the key pathway(s) involved in
      maintaining a "sick" homeostatic network in Gulf War Illness, discovered in our prior CDMRP
      and VA funded projects. An open-label Phase I study will be performed with Etanercept (once a
      week for 4 weeks) followed by mifepristone (once a day for 7 days), followed by a 10-week
      observation to assess safety, efficacy and biomarker response to maximal exercise. The impact
      of the interventions will be measured on current computational modeling of dynamic response
      GWI illness mediators at onset, at 6 weeks (on completion of the medication regimen) and 4
      months after baseline; using 20 GWI patients. The response during and after an exercise
      challenge will be assessed followed by map the homeostatic networks in play over the 24 hours
      post-exercise in subjects before treatment, after completing the second treatment (week 6)
      and 4 months after initiating treatment (week 16).
