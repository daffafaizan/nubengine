      inclusion in the study and for providing an adequate washout period. The following study will
      be conducted in two parts. Part I is an open-label study, multiple center and dose escalation
      evaluation in twelve patients. Six subjects each will be evaluated for safety and efficacy
      assessments at 1 or 2 capsules TID dose for 28 days, sequentially. Each of them will be
      assessed twice in the first week after administration of PDC-1421 Capsules and once a week in
      the following treatment.

      Part II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 60 subjects
      will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three arms (1 PDC-1421 Capsule plus
      1 placebo TID, 2 PDC-1421 Capsules TID, 2 placebo TID) for 6 weeks and evaluated the safety
      and efficacy every two weeks during the treatment period.
