      difficulties can contribute to daytime problems with irritability, learning, and behavior.
      Parents are often stressed about their child's sleep difficulties and as a result, their
      sleep can suffer as well. Treatment that focuses on establishing behaviors and routines that
      help reduce arousal and support good sleep are helpful for improving the sleep of children
      without autism, but have not yet been tested in children with autism.

      Previous studies have indicated that distance can make it difficult for families to
      participate in treatment. As such, we will conduct treatment remotely for two of treatment
      arms. Having remote versions of the treatment can expand the number of children and families
      that are able to receive these promising treatments. This may be particularly important for
      children with ASD living in rural and underserved areas as well as those in military families
      that may not have access to a healthcare provider with training in behavioral sleep
      treatments.
