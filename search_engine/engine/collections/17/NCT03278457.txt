    
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that utilizes
      radioactive tracers to gain information on physiological or pathophysiological processes in
      vivo. Different tracers can provide information on different processes of interest. In
      cardiology, metabolic processes consuming oxygen (aerobic) can be studied with
      11-Carbon-Acetate, sympathetic innervation can be studied with 11-Carbon-hydroxyephedrine and
      using 15-Oxygen-water the myocardial blood flow. Structural information of the heart such as
      left ventricular mass, left ventricular volumes and wall thickness can also be calculated
      with PET.

      The aim is to correlate PET parameters and burden of ventricular arrhythmias in order to
      improve risk stratification in HCM.
