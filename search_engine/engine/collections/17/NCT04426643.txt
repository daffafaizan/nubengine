      of men urinary incontinence caused by prostatectomy using injection of autologous
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells mixed with collagen. The positive outlook for the
      effectiveness of MSCs is due to the following:

        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration

        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of urinary
           incontinence in animals.

      In study planing to include 5 patients. MSCs will be isolated from adipose tissue, cultured
      and then transplanted back to the periurethral area by five point injection in
      rhabdosphincter and submucosal space of urethra using the cystourethroscope. For injection in
      submucosal space MSCs (20*10^6 cells) will be mixed with collagen solution (3,5% w|w). Follow
      up patients monitoring will occur at 1，3，6 and 12 months after injection.
