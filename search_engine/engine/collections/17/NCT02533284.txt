    
      After approval of local ethical committee, consent will be obtained from 90 patients
      scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in GEC center, Mansoura University, Egypt.
      Patients will be of either ASA I and II, with Age ranging from 18-40 years, and BMI less than
      35. Patients will be randomized into 3 groups (using closed envelope technique in blocks of
      18); Controlled group (C group), Bupivacaine group (B group), Bupivacaine Magnesium group (M
      group).

      Anesthesia induction will be the same in the three groups (Propofol 1-1.5mglkg, Fentanyl 1
      mic/kg, Atracrium 0.5 mg/kg) then Sevoflorane inhalational anesthesia for maintainace in 0.4
      oxygen/air mixtures.

      In both M group and B group, preemptive US guided Subcostal TAP block (Toshiba Xario, Japan)
      was performed on both sides using 20 ml volume (0.25 Bupivacaine in B group or 0.25
      Bupivacaine plus 0.5 gm MgSo4 in M group). Surgical sterilization will be started 5 minutes
      after the block and surgery started5 minutes later. Hemodynamic data (HR, MAP) will be
      collected immediately after induction, at start of surgery, and each 10 minutes later.

      At the end of surgery, and after closure of surgical ports, anesthesia was terminated and
      extubation done when patients fulfilled the required criteria. Postoperative hemodynamic data
      (HR, MAP), VAS, and PONV will berecorded at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 hours after surgery, Ramsay
      sedation was recorded at 0, 1, 2, 6 hours postoperatively. Boluses of Morphine (0.02 mg/kg)
      will be given whenever VAS â‰¥4.
