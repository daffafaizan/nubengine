        -  Determine the biodistribution of fluorine F 18 FEQA in patients with stage III or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in healthy participants.

        -  Determine whether fluorine F 18 FEQA can be used as an imaging agent with positron
           emission tomography in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients and healthy participants receive fluorine F 18 FEQA IV and then undergo whole-body
      dynamic scans comprising positron emission tomography.

      Blood is collected during and after imaging to measure radioactivity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
