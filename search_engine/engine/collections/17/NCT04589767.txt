      translation and cultural adaptation was developed within the Pediatric Cardiac Surgery
      Intensive Care Unit of the Federico II Polyclinic.

      In this study we aim to perform the psychometric validation. 160 children (based on the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria described above) admitted in PICU will be daily assessed by
      two nurses (inter-evaluator agreement) using the Italian version of CAPD scale administered
      twice at a distance of 2 minutes (intra-evaluator agreement).

      The score will be recorded in a data collection card, all the cards will be collected and
      then analyzed.
