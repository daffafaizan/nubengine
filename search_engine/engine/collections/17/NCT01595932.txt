      which can negatively affect quality of life, even in pediatric age.

      Dietary and life-style changes, administration of simethicone, activated charcoal and
      probiotics may reduce intestinal gas but often results are unsatisfactory.

      Literature shows that Î±-galactosidase is effective to reduce gas production and related
      symptoms in adults.
