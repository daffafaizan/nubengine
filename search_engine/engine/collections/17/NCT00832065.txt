      affecting at least 4% of males and to a lesser extent females, yet it is currently under
      diagnosed. OSAS is associated with various disorders including cardiovascular disease,
      insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, fatigue and erectile dysfunction. Currently the
      standard treatment for OSAS is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP).

      Low testosterone levels are present in some patients with OSAS leading to erectile
      dysfunction. However, the true prevalence of low testosterone levels and its correlation with
      sexual health is poorly understood and undefined. Prior data suggest treating these patients
      with CPAP therapy, usually increases testosterone levels, but unclear if this makes any
      meaningful difference in patient outcome, that is improvement in libido and sexual function.

      There are several postulations to the pathophysiology of low testosterone levels in patients
      with OSAS. CRP(C-reactive protein), a strong marker of inflammation was shown to be elevated
      in patients with OSAS. The association between elevated CRP and low testosterone level would
      support the notion that inflammation plays a primary role in sexual dysfunction in patients
      with OSAS.

      The objective of this study is to identify correlation between low free testosterone levels,
      sexual dysfunction and Obstructive Sleep Apnea before and after treatment with CPAP. Evaluate
      the role of CRP and inflammation secondary to OSAS in the pathogenesis of sexual dysfunction.
