    
      This protocol includes studies of genetic defects of the immune system that cause failure of
      host defenses against infections, immune dysregulation and autoimmune diseases. Numerous rare
      disorders result from inherited or newly arising mutations in genes involved in the
      development and function of innate and adaptive immune systems or both. As specific disease
      syndromes are defined and the responsible genes identified, mutations in individual families
      can be sought. Correlation of mutation sites with clinical information helps to determine how
      specific gene segments encode important functional domains of the proteins of the immune
      system within the same genetic defect. Rare, single gene disorders identify immunologic
      pathways that might contribute to more common conditions, such as failure to respond to
      vaccines, susceptibility to allergies, or autoimmune diseases like arthritis or lupus.

      Members of families with immune disorders that are known or suspected to have a genetic basis
      may be eligible. Immunologic tests and DNA sequence analysis appropriate to each clinical
      condition will be performed as needed on affected individuals and at risk family members.
      Healthy family members may serve as controls. Probands, parents of deceased affected
      individuals, or entire families, may be referred to the Investigators Initially, clinical and
      family history as well as laboratory data will be reviewed by the investigators to determine
      eligibility. Subjects considered appropriate will be invited through their referring
      physician to participate by signing our consent form and sending appropriate blood, DNA or
      other samples to our PI. Should a genetic basis for an individual s immune disorder be
      identified or if clinical eligibility for other protocols is met, they may be invited to
      visit NIH.
