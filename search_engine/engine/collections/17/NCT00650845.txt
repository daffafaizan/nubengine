    
      Patients with renal insufficiency not requiring hemodialysis and scheduled to undergo a
      contrast enhanced MRI or unenhanced MRI examination to specify a diagnosis, were selected for
      inclusion. Two groups of patients were defined on the basis of the planned imaging procedure
      selected to obtain a diagnosis: those undergoing a DotaremÂ®-enhanced MRI and those undergoing
      an unenhanced MRI.

      A clinically significant increase in serum creatinine levels after the contrast-enhanced MRI
      exam was used as an indication of contrast induced nephrotoxicity. A blood test was performed
      24h before the MRI in order to evaluate baseline creatinine values. 72h after the exam, a
      second blood test was performed. An increase in creatinemia above 25% from baseline levels
      was defined as a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction. The primary endpoint of the study
      assessed the percentage of patients presenting a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction in
      order to show a non inferiority of enhanced as compared to non-enhanced MRI exams.
