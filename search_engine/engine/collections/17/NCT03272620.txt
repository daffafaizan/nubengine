      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with stroke being an especially important and
      potentially devastating complication. The number of patients with atrial fibrillation is
      likely to increase 2.5-fold during the next 50 years, reflecting the growing proportion of
      elderly individuals. Emergency departments play a central role in diagnosis and treatment
      (rhythm and rate control, initiation of anticoagulatory therapy for stroke prevention) of
      atrial fibrillation. Additionally, embolic (e.g. stroke, mesenteric ischemia) complications
      of atrial fibrillation and bleeding complications (e.g. gastrointestinal and intracranial) of
      anticoagulatory therapy are likewise treated at emergency departments.

      Therefor the investigators hypothesis implies that the atrial fibrillation registry could
      serve as a tool for structured diagnosis and therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and
      therefore may improve patient care. Additionally, diagnostic and therapeutic shortcomings by
      analyzing registry data may be detected.
