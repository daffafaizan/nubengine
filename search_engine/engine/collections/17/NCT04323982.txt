      patients still have obvious postoperative inflammatory response, which might cause visual
      axial opacification, posterior synechiae and secondary glaucoma. Triamcinolone is used in
      intraocular injection for its anti-inflammatory effect However, the application of
      Triamcinolone was reported to be associated with high intraocular pressure. It is necessary
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using triamcinolone in congenital cataract
      surgery.

      In this randomized clinical trial, children with equal degree of congenital cataract in both
      eyesare enrolled. Patients receive cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day. For each
      patient, one eye is randomly assigned to undergo traditional surgical procedure, while the
      fellow eye is undergoing new surgical procedure. The traditional surgical procedure include
      anterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (ACCC), irrigation/aspiration (I/A), posterior
      continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PCCC), and anterior vitrectomy(A-VIT). Primary
      intraocular lens implantation (IOL) is performed in children older than age of two. The new
      surgical procedure is to combine triamcinolone staining of the anterior vitreous on the basis
      of the traditional surgical procedure. Investigators then compare the incidence of high
      intraocular pressure, visual axis opacification, uveitis, iris/pupil abnormality, and macular
      edema between two groups
