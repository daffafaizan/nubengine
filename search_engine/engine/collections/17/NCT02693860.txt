      trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response manifested by a peri-tumoral
      inflammatory response with or without apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in patients
      diagnosed with either high or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. To participate the patients
      will be required to meet all eligibility criteria. Patients may not participate in other
      clinical trials while undergoing therapeutic treatment.

      The initial screening period (up to 28 days prior to start of treatment under this clinical
      trial) consists of visit to confirm eligibility, discuss the risks / benefits of
      participating in the trial and radical prostatectomy (with or without lymph node dissection),
      and obtain patient prostate biopsy samples for anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
      expression review. An enrolled subject's participation in the study entails approximately 6
      to 7 weeks of therapy along with the additional 2 weeks time involved in recovery from a
      radical prostatectomy. Adverse events will be collected throughout the entirety of the study.
      The total duration of the patient being in the study can be around 9 to 11 weeks. Medical
      information/Survival information will be collected from the routine followup visits (standard
      of care) for up to 3 years after the surgery.
