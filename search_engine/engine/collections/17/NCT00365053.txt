      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with unresectable malignant pleural
      mesothelioma (MPM) treated with PXD101.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall survival and time to progression in these patients. II. Assess the
      toxicities associated with this drug in these patients. III. Perform molecular correlative
      studies on tumor tissue (optional) and peripheral blood (required) and identify potential
      predictive markers for response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection during course 1 of treatment for biomarker correlative
      studies. Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) levels are measured via reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as a potential predictive marker for response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
