      in vitro blood clot from the patient's own blood at the point of care, in a safe and
      effective manner.

      While many advanced modalities of treatment have been developed to heal chronic DFUs (as well
      as other types of chronic wounds), the vast majority have been approved for relatively
      non-severe wounds (e.g., Texas 1a/2a grades) and relatively healthy subjects in controlled
      clinical trials and typically exclude 25-75% of subjects who have several comorbidities and
      severe wounds. Moreover, when the results of such trials (and other trials of advanced
      modalities) have been subject to a systematic review, the strength of the evidence for their
      efficacy has been rated low or even insufficient to judge. Consequently, there is an urgent
      need for new technologies to be tested that can improve healing rates in all classes of
      chronic DFUs.

      The study is a multi-center, prospective, single group safety study, consisting of 20
      subjects who will complete the study (note: if any patients are lost to follow-up or
      withdrawn, enrollment will increase to compensate for loss of these subjects). The subjects
      will receive 12 weekly RD1 applications. Subject data will be kept in each site's records.
