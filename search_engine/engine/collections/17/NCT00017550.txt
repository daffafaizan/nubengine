        -  Compare the clinical response rate of patients with early myelodysplastic syndrome
           treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin vs standard supportive care.

        -  Evaluate the safety of anti-thymocyte globulin in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to and duration of clinical response, rates of partial response and
           therapy failure, and rate of disease progression in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the ECOG performance score, number of transfusions and/or growth factor use, and
           maximum time between transfusions in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the infection risk, use of medical resources, and quality of clinical response
           in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtype (refractory anemia (RA) vs RA with excess
      blasts or hypocellular MDS). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over at least 8-12 hours
           on days 1-4.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive therapy for 6 months. At the end of 6
           months, patients may receive ATG as in arm I.

      Patients are followed for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 in arm I and 24 in arm II) will be accrued
      within a minimum of 6 months.
