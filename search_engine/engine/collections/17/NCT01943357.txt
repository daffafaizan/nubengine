      baseline (prior to the intervention), six-months and twelve-months. Differences between
      baseline and followup scores will be used to determine if participants have benefited from
      the intervention, using intent-to-treat methodology. Subgroups and delivery method
      (small-group or on-line) will be compared using repeated measures and analyses of covariance.
