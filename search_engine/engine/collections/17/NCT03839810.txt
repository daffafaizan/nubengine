      stroke rehabilitation is to induce cortical plasticity for motor re-learning.

      It has been demonstrated that electrical stimulation applied to the periphery can elicit
      abundant sensory afferent inputs to enhance excitability and activation area in the
      sensorimotor cortex. Recent evidence suggested that a new type of electrical stimulation
      pattern, stochastic resonance stimulation, is capable of efficiently enhancing the activation
      of peripheral and central nervous system. Therefore, the purpose of this study are to
      identify the effects of stochastic resonance electrical stimulation on neuromuscular control
      and proprioception, and to investigate the effectiveness of combining stochastic resonance
      electrical stimulation with rehabilitation program on post stroke motor function recovery.
