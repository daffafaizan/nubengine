      via text messages. The early studies on text messaging interventions indicate this approach
      is enjoyable for participants and has positive effects across a range of domains and
      treatment types. Hence, this study will test whether text messages containing reminders of
      the content of sessions will improve treatment outcomes. Two text messaging methods will also
      be tested. One is to send text messages to remind participants of their goals (PUSH
      condition) and the second is to send text messages to remind participants to recall their
      goals (PULL condition). This study will be conducted within the context of an NICHD-funded
      Randomized Controlled Trial (grant number R01-HD071065; protocol registration ID
      NCT01828320). In R01-HD071065 adolescents ages 10-18 (n = 176) will receive either the
      Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C) or a Psychoeducation (PE). At the
      6-month follow-up assessment for R01-HD071065, participants will be randomized using 3 (PUSH
      text messages, PULL text messages, or no text messages) x 2 (TranS-C or PE) design. At the
      6-month follow-up assessment, a questionnaire will also be administered to establish baseline
      memory for treatment. Participants will be sent text messages once per week until they return
      for the 12 month follow-up assessment for R01-HD071065. At the 12 month follow-up assessment,
      participants will be asked to complete the same memory for treatment questionnaire completed
      at the 6 month follow-up assessment as well as a questionnaire evaluating the acceptability
      of the text message reminders. This research is a first step toward identifying whether an
      inexpensive and ubiquitous technology (i.e., text messaging) can improve memory for
      treatment.
