      thousand new injuries each year. Most recovery, following SCI, occurs in the six months
      following surgery. Further recovery after 12 months is unusual.

      In this study 13 subjects, more than 1 year post injury, were enrolled to test the safety and
      efficacy of a new type of robotic therapy device known as the AMES device. The aim of this
      Phase I/II study is to investigate the use of assisted movement and enhanced sensation (AMES)
      technology in hand rehabilitation of incomplete SCI subjects.
