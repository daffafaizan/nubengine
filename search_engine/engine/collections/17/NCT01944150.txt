    
      In the pain management centers, patients with chronic pain are supported by a
      multidisciplinary team. To optimize and reduce drug intake of analgesics, additional
      techniques (hypnosis, relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy) and non-drug practices
      (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) are offered to patients.

      These techniques are most frequently performed by nurses and are used either separately or
      successively. The time interval during what the patient could expect pain relief is not
      known.

      The hypothesis of the study is that simultaneous practice of two complementary therapies
      (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) + hypnosis) decreases the intensity of
      pain in patients with chronic no cancer pain, nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain compared to
      practice of only one complementary therapy (TENS).

      This study is an open randomized trial, comparative in two parallel groups (TENS versus TENS
      and hypnosis).

      Trial design will be explained by the pain management center doctor. Inclusion and
      randomization performed by the nurse: group with TENS/group with TENS and hypnosis.

      The patients will be followed up 8 times between day 0 and day180. Patients benefit from
      eight visits from day 0th to day 180th. Evaluations are EVA at each visit, SF36
      questionnaires and score PGIC at one month, three and six months after the beginning of the
      strategy.
