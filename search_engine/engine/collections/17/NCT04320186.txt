      behaviors (e.g. condom use, substance use before sex, regular Sexually Transmitted Infection
      (STI) testing) via population-sensitive and population-specific HIV prevention videos that
      are appealing, evidence-based, scalable, and sustainable to the target population. Formative
      research was conducted in Phase I (Year 1-2), to pre-test the questionnaire and gather
      in-depth data (via focus groups, intercept interviews, and individual structured interviews)
      to inform intervention development. Phase 2 of the project involved developing, delivering,
      and subsequently evaluating the efficacy of peer-driven EE HIV prevention messaging to
      broader social networks via a social media platform, with the platform contingent on
      formative data. An HIV education video series, "The Beat HIVe", was produced and served as
      intervention materials for the quasi-experimental research project. Respondent Driven
      Sampling (RDS) was used to access and use the social networks of high-risk youths as channel
      and agents for change. RDS is a recent innovative adaptation of chain-referral network
      sampling that provides peer-driven access to hard-to-reach subpopulations while reducing
      sampling biases associated with conventional snowball sampling.
