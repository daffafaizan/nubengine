      physical and mental health complications and community implications.

      The "Alerta Alcohol" program is based on the I-Change Model. Focus and Delphi groups are used
      to obtain further information on items included in the program. A pilot study is conducted to
      identify strengths and weaknesses. A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial is carried out. The
      schools from Andalusia are randomized either to the experimental or the control condition (EC
      and CC). The EC receives the Alerta Alcohol intervention, which consists of four sessions at
      school: baseline questionnaire and two sessions where adolescents are provided with answers
      related to their views to provide highly specific feedback regarding their knowledge, risk
      perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy. In addition, two
      booster sessions are given at home to reinforce the contents. The CC just completes the
      baseline and the evaluation questionnaires and then they are allowed to receive the
      intervention as well (as a waiting list control condition). Evaluation takes place after four
      months. The primary endpoint is binge drinking within 30 days prior to evaluation and alcohol
      use in the previous week. It is expected that Alerta Alcohol reduces the prevalence of binge
      drinking by 10%. Follow up analyses are carried out to determine the differences in
      effectiveness according to the compliance of the program (quality of the implementation).
