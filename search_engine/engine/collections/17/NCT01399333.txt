      Health Organization (WHO) and is currently recognized as the standard method to evaluate
      protein quality. This study will also examine patient tolerability, satiety, and satisfaction
      while using meal replacements versus protein supplements. This research study looks to gain
      knowledge on the varying qualities of protein and find the most effective protein supplement
      and/or meal replacement that provides increased patient compliance and promotes a healthy
      recovery.
