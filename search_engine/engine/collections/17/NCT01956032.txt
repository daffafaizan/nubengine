      infusion at home. The study evaluated the use of resources, measured as the number of
      contacts and time spent by health care professionals (Duodopa nurse specialists and the study
      Investigators) and the TM technician, during Duodopa infusion at home. Data was collected
      from four (4) clinical centers in Sweden. Data collection period for each participant started
      at the decision to administer Duodopa treatment (Baseline) and ended when the Duodopa
      titration period was complete. Post-titration, the participants and caregiver were
      interviewed and the investigators and nurses answered a web based questionnaire on their
      experiences.
