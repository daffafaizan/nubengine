      stimulation of the innate immune response and its role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
      diseases has been deepened. Several clinical studies, in fact, support the existence of a
      connection between changes in the commensal intestinal microbiota ("dysbiosis") and
      autoimmune diseases. It has been seen that also ocular conditions like chalaziosis and
      uveitis are tied to dysbiosis. In addition, in a recent study probiotics were found to be
      safe and effective in the treatment of chalaziosis in children. Other eye conditions that may
      be affected by changes in the gut microbiome are dry eye syndrome and blepharitis. Under
      these conditions, a reduction in globet cells has often been noted. These cells produce the
      mucins present on the ocular surface, and therefore, their reduction involves the production
      of a thin and ineffective tear film. Therefore, the study will cover patients with
      blepharitis (both adults and children), treated with specific probiotics to be taken daily.
      Patients will then undergo a full ophthalmological examination each week for the first month,
      and then monthly until complete recovery for at least 6 months. In addition, at the time of
      enlistment and complete recovery, after venous sampling, the following biomarkers will be
      analyzed with cytometer and ELISA: TNFÎ± and lymphocyte subpopulations. With this study,
      therefore, the aim is to define the possible positive impact of probiotics on patients with
      blepharitis.
