    
      2400 subjects will be screened for breast cancer in seven enrolling sites across the country
      to ensure diverse ethnicity.

      "Positive" subjects should be confirmed breast cancer positive by Mammography and/or biopsy.
      Breast cancer positive samples will be compared to the control group of samples obtained from
      women attending clinics for non-cancerous related pathology.

      Both Positive and Negative Predictive Values will be evaluated to determine accuracy and
      sensitivity of the screening test.

      Subjects whose known cancer positive or negative status do not match the test report will be
      followed up as appropriate, on case by case basis to identify false positive and false
      negative results.
