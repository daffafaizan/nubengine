      immunosuppression modified according to ImmuKnow values. Immunosuppression was decreased by
      25% if ImmuKnow values were less than 130 ng/mL ATP. Similarly, immunosuppression was
      increased by 25% if ImmuKnow values were greater than 450 ng/mL ATP. Immunosuppression of the
      Control group was managed by the Standard of Care at our institution. ImmuKnow was performed
      before liver transplant, after surgery and at each clinic visit with the approximate
      schedule: day 1; weekly, weeks 1-4; week 6; week 8; monthly, months 3-6; and months 9 and 12.
      ImmuKnow testing was repeated within 7 days of a suspected/confirmed rejection or infection
      and again within 1 week of resolution.
