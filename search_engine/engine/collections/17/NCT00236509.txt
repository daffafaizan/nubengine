    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of three different doses of topiramate (50mg, 100mg,
      and 200mg daily) in migraine prophylaxis. The study consists of five phases: baseline
      (determination of whether patients meet the eligibility criteria and tapering of any migraine
      medication patients are already taking); initial titration and double-blind phase (8 weeks)
      which begins with 25 mg/daily increasing to the assigned (50, 100, 200 mg/day topiramate);
      followed by a maintenance period at the target dose (18 weeks); tapering transition phase (up
      to 7 weeks); and open-label extension up to 6 months (to a maximum topiramate dose of 1600
      mg/day); doses are adjusted to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects. The primary
      study hypothesis is that one or more of the three doses of topiramate (50, 100, 200 mg/day)
      will be superior to placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine based on the change in monthly (28
      day) migraine period rate from the prospective baseline period to the double-blind phase and
      that topiramate treatment is well tolerated. During the titration period (8 weeks), doses are
      increased to target dose of daily topiramate (50 milligrams[mg], 100, or 200mg) or placebo,
      taken twice daily by mouth. Doses are continued for 18 weeks, adjusted over 7 weeks, and
      continued for up to 6 months during the Open-Label Extension.
