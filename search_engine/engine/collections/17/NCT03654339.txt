      comprehensive periodontal examination and complete plaque control program including oral
      hygiene to eliminate habits related to the aetiology of recession. Scaling, root planning and
      occlusal adjustments were done The patients were randomly assigned and divided into two
      groups. Group A and Group B. Patients with miller class II were treated with a laterally
      repositioned flap to obtain root coverage using conventional macrosurgical approach
      (15patients) and microsurgical approach(15patients)

      The clinical parameters evaluated were height of gingival recession relative clinical
      attachment level which was measured as the distance from a fixed point in a stent to the
      bottom of the pocket and gingival biotype at baseline, 3 months and 6 months period
