      30 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients will be treated with very low dose
      Pazopanib [25mg-similar] for between 16 and 24 weeks.. The primary endpoint is a reduction in
      bleeding duration of 50% or more, along with multiple secondary related endpoints, including
      bleed frequency, blood counts and quality of life; as compared to 6-12 weeks of baseline
      characteristics. If after the first 8 weeks of therapy benefit is suboptimal, dose advance to
      50mg-similar daily can be considered.
