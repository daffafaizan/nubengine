      and the criteria of Health Promotion Administration, Taiwan. Five indices are used to define
      metabolic syndrome（MetS): including waist circumference （WC), high blood pressure（H/P）,
      fasting plasma glucose（FPG）, triglyceride（TG）, and high-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol（HDL-C）. The recent researches showed us, there was no research
      applying the five criteria into their decision model. This study proposal will be the first
      study which evaluated the importance of the criteria related to apply these indices and
      decision model into the clinic for risk factors assessment.

      This study was divided into 2 stages: (1) to analyze the big database of health examination
      to find out the major decision-making analysis module of MetS, including the level of
      importance and decision-making weight of 5 indicators, which can be provided as reference for
      suggestions on clinical medical treatments or health education focuses of health management
      of sub-health population; (2) to analyze other demographic variables of the database
      (educational background, residence, occupation, etc.) and the variables affecting health
      patterns (including smoking, drinking, long-term sitting work pattern) to find out the
      important variables affecting high risk group for MetS among populations of all ages, in
      order to investigate the improvement strategies for early prevention or intervention of
      important variables. As aging society is coming, it is estimated that the elderly people over
      the age of 65 in Taiwan will reach 20% by 2025. According to the estimation of Executive
      Yuan, the growth rate of healthcare service industry will reach at least 17%, and the annual
      output value will reach USD 18 billion. Therefore, this study intends to develop strategies
      for preventing chronic illness in the middle-aged and elderly people and find out the
      characteristic variables of high risk group according to different age groups to further
      reduce the incidence of MetS or CVD.
