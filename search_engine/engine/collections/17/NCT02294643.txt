      introduction of the drug eluting stent (DES). However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or
      diabetes mellitus (DM) still remains a strong clinical predictor of poor prognosis with DES.
      Sarpogrelate, a selective 5-HT2a receptor antagonist, has antiproliferative effects as shown
      by its reduction of neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell proliferation as well as a
      potent antiplatelet agent inhibiting of 5-HT-induced platelet aggregation. However, the
      efficacy and safety data for sarpogrelate in patients with CKD or DM are limited. We aimed to
      test whether sarpogrelate has beneficial effects in patients with CDK or DM treated with DES.

      The SERENADE trial is a multicenter, off-label, prospective, placebo-controlled randomized
      study to test the superiority of triple anti-platelet therapy (TAT; aspirin, clopidogrel and
      sarpogrelate) to the conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT; aspirin and clopidogrel) in
      preventing late lumen loss 9 months after the index procedure in patients with CKD or DM. A
      total of 220 patients exhibiting coronary artery disease (CAD) with DM or CKD will be
      randomized to TAT or DAT (1:1 ratio) after DES implantation. Primary endpoint is late lumen
      loss at 9 months assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Secondary efficacy
      endpoints are composites of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac
      death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization. Secondary
      safety endpoints are major bleeding event and hepatic or renal impairments.

      The SERENADE trial will give insight whether adjunctive therapy with sarpogrelate is helpful
      for patients with high risk profiles such as CKD or DM after DES implantation.
