      Intervention Mapping (IM) to adapt and test PREVAIL (a non VA, peer specialist based suicide
      prevention program) as a Peer Specialist (PS)-delivered intervention to reduce suicide
      ideation in VA patients who are at high risk of suicide. Building on the investigators' work
      with PSs, suicide research, and participatory methods, the investigators will begin the IM
      process with a needs assessment that includes interviews with PSs, VHA patients, providers,
      and directors (n=12) to assess attitudes and perceptions of current clinical practices for
      high risk Veterans, PSs, and areas of possible improvement in suicide prevention. This
      information will be shared with a steering committee to begin adapting PREVAIL to patients
      with high suicide risk in VHA. Following best practices for pilot investigations and
      intervention adaptation, the investigators will recruit 12 VHA patients with unipolar or
      bipolar depression flagged for high suicide risk to participate in a "pre-pilot" and provide
      feedback on how the adapted intervention may be revised. After making any necessary
      modifications to the intervention, the investigators will recruit a second group of 12 high
      risk Veterans for a "formal pilot" to further evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      recruitment, retention, and assessment procedures for a large randomized trial. Outcome
      variables will include health care visits for suicide-related reasons and self-reported
      suicidal ideation/acts as well as several outcomes that are rehabilitative in nature, such as
      self-rated community integration; sense of hope, meaning, and purpose; and self-esteem and
      social support. The investigators aim to: Aim 1: Use Intervention Mapping to identify which
      components of PREVAIL require adaptation to reduce suicidal ideation in high risk VHA
      patients and to identify implementation strategies in the VHA system; Aim 2: Pilot test the
      feasibility and acceptability of the adapted PREVAIL, rehabilitative measures, and
      suicide-related outcomes for use in a rigorous prospective study.
