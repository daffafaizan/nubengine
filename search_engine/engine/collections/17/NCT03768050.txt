      includes patients acutely admitted to the medical and/or surgical hospital wards and promptly
      discharged to receive home-based post-acute care and/or rehabilitation; (ii) Home-based Case
      Management group includes complex chronic patients or patients receiving long-term care by a
      case management nurse; and (iii) Geriatric residences group will include patients receiving
      acute support, post-acute or continued care for elderly people living in geriatric
      residences.

      It will be conducted by Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA), an integrated care service
      provider located in the city of Badalona (420K inhabitants) in the North-Eastern part of the
      Barcelona Metropolitan Area.

      The current study protocol aims to assess cost-effectiveness of the three types of
      interventions for frail patients, as well as to generate a roadmap for regional scalability
      of the service. The study design will consist of a prospective quasi-experimental
      case-control design wherein each intervention group will be compared with the corresponding
      usual care group (controls, 1:1 ratio), using propensity score matching. Age, sex, GMA
      (adjusted morbidity groups), socioeconomic status, number of hospitalisations during the
      previous year and polypharmacy will be used as matching variables.
