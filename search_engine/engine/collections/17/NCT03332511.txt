      imatinib. However, there are still many patients for whom the therapeutic response is
      inadequate, or toxicity is limiting the treatment. Serum concentration of nilotinib was shown
      to affect time to response and progression in previous studies. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesized that the optimal plasma level of nilotinib that is sufficient to achieve
      adequate clinical response while not generating major adverse events could be elucidated by
      the analysis of combined clinical and pharmacokinetic data.

      ENESTKorea is a phase 4, multi-institutional, single-arm, open-label study investigating the
      efficacy and safety of nilotinib at the currently approved dose (300 mg twice daily), in
      adult patients diagnosed as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in
      chronic phase (CML-CP). Plasma samples are collected every three months, for up to 12 months,
      to determine plasma nilotinib concentrations (PNCs). The primary endpoint is the cumulative
      rate of molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5; BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.0032%) by 24 months. Secondary
      endpoints include the cumulative rates of MR3 (BCR-ABLIS ≤ 0.1%) and MR4 (BCR-ABLIS ≤ 0.01%)
      by 12 and 24 months; time to MR3, MR4, and MR4.5; progression-free survival (PFS); overall
      survival (OS). Correlations between PNCs and clinical outcomes are also analyzed.
