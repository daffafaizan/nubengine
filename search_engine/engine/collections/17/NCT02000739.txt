      time to disease progression (TTP) compared to standard therapies.

      By comparing A) a patient's TTP on targeted therapy vs. B) their TTP on their most recent
      prior therapy, investigators will minimize the variability in TTP observed across cancer
      subtypes, and be able to enroll patients with any type of solid tumor in a statistically
      unbiased manner. Based on the literature, investigators expect at least 35% of patients
      treated with a genetically-informed targeted therapy to exhibit a longer progression-free
      interval than would be expected with standard therapies. This "TTP ratio" for each patient is
      calculated using the formula:

      TTP ratio: (TTP on targeted therapy) / (TTP on most recent non-targeted therapy)

      An individual patient's benefit from genetically-informed targeted therapy is defined as a
      TTP ratio â‰¥ 1.3
