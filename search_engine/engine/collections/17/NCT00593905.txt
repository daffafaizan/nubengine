      Arterial Hypertension who were enrolled in Encysive Pharmaceutical's STRIDE clinical trials
      or who have received bosentan or ambrisentan for 4 months or longer. This international study
      constitutes the largest clinical study of this deadly disease and in such has great potential
      to alter the clinical practice by revealing novel gene-drug interactions. This study tests
      the hypothesis by executing the following aims:

      Aim 1: Determine in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (the relationship between known
      disease-specific polymorphisms (Serotonin transporter gene and PAI HindIII) and variants in
      BMPR2 and SMAD4 with several well-defined clinical efficacy endpoints of sitaxsentan,
      bosentan, and ambrisentan therapy.

      Aim 2: Determine in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension the relationship between existing
      potentially "therapy-specific" polymorphisms in the ET-1, ETAR, ETBR, NPR-C, prostacyclin
      receptor and prostacyclin synthase with several well-defined clinical efficacy endpoints of
      sitaxsentan, bosentan, and ambrisentan therapy.

      Aim 3: Characterize the relationship between any treatment effect, these polymorphisms and
      PAH severity, using either clinical data or clinical surrogates for disease activity.

      ***This study was funded by the NIH from 2005 - 2009. In August 2009 a no-cost extension was
      granted and this study continued until the end of July 2010. Currently the study is still
      active and does still have several active sites participating; however, the study is funded
      by the internal institution and there is no contributing federal funding.***
