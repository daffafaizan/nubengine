      upper stratum corneum layer to the basal layer. This fact probably reflects the necessity for
      zinc as co-factor in numerous enzymes involved in skin homeostasis and wound healing.
      Theoretically, showering with surfactants increases the loss of zinc by the shedding of the
      zinc-rich corneocytes. Thus there is a concern that this forced exfoliation will result in
      suboptimal zinc levels for the maintenance of physiological processes involved in epidermal
      homeostasis and repair. A logical development would thus be to supplement shower gel with
      zinc to compensate for this loss.

      In 30 healthy volunteers one epidermal wound (10 mm in diameter) is induced by suction and
      heat on each buttock. The wounds are washed with shower gel containing zinc, placebo shower
      gel or water (reference). The treatments are allocated by randomization ensuring that 20
      wounds are washed with shower gel containing zinc, 20 wounds are washed with placebo shower
      gel and 20 wounds are washed with water.
