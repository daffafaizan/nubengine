      by Esoterix Genetic Laboratories, LLC using blood specimens and diagnosed as fragile X
      intermediates, premutations (carriers) or full mutations (affected). Results from fragile X
      testing with saliva will be compared to results from the blood sample that was previously
      submitted to Esoterix Genetic Laboratories for testing.

      Data from this study will be used for regulatory submissions.
