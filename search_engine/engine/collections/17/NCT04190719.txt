      postoperative complications after major surgery. We hypothesize that a multimodal program
      based on physical activity, nutritional support and mental preparation may not only improve
      postoperative recovery and reduce costs but also improve health status beyond postoperative
      period.

      Non-randomized monocentric open cohort study vs historical comparative group testing the
      efficacy of a multimodal prehabilitation program for unfit patients based on nutrition,
      physical activity and mental preparation in reducing postoperative complications in elective
      major surgery.

      Other outcomes will be measured : length of hospital stay, hospital readmissions, direct
      costs, health status at 1 and 6 months.

      Moreover, the feasibility and adherence of Paprika program will be evaluated. Inter-data
      centres relating to the implementation of the same prehabilitation program will be compared
      with the consortium Paprika (Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Cologne, University
      of Gdansk)
