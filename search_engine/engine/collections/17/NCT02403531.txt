      before definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients with inoperable thoracic esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma. Patients assigned to Arm B first received two cycles of 3-weekly schedule of
      IC, consisting of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1. The prescribed
      dose of radiotherapy is generally 50-60 Gy/25-28fr. The concomitant chemotherapy is docetaxel
      20 mg/m2 on day 1, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on day 1, repeated weekly during radiation.
