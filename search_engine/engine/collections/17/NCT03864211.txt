      ablation (RFA)/microwave ablation (MWA) followed by toripalimab for advanced HCC by
      establishing the rates of toxicity that occur within 6 months after ablation. Hypothesis:
      Thermal ablation followed by toripalimab will have similar toxicity to toripalimab
      monotherapy. Thermal ablation enhances antitumor immune response and improves the best
      overall response rate compared to historical controls with toripalimab alone.

      1.2 Secondary Objectives and Hypotheses Estimate the progression-free survival, and overall
      survival. Hypothesis: Disease control and survival will be better than that observed with
      toripalimab monotherapy.

      1.3 Exploratory Objectives Explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers (including, but not
      limited to CD8+/Treg ratio, total CD4+ counts, total lymphocyte count) in pretreatment and
      on-treatment serially collected peripheral blood samples. Hypothesis: Changes in inflammatory
      biomarkers after thermal ablation may correlate with a more favorable response to
      immunotherapy.
