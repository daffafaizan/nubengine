    
      This is an open, prospective, dose-escalating study, designed to elucidate the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of pentoxifylline in children of
      the ages greater than/equal to 9 months and less than/equal to 96 months with cerebral
      malaria. The study is designed to evaluate pentoxifylline as adjunct therapy in severe
      pediatric malaria by evaluating its toxicity and associated adverse events, and by
      establishing both an acceptable dose and the associated pharmacokinetic profile. The
      pharmacodynamic effects of four different dose levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg/24 hours)
      will be accessed on the following biological, immunological, and parasitological parameters:
      cerebral blood flow velocity, tumor necrosis factor concentration, rosetting, coma resolution
      time, parasite clearance time, and fever clearance time. Due to the variability observed in
      the biological, immunological, and parasitological parameters under scrutiny, a control group
      of ten patients will be intercalated in the study (4 patients prior to enrollment of the
      first pentoxifylline recipient, 2 patients in-between each of the 3 dose escalations). As
      there is no information about the relationship of treatment duration to biological,
      immunological, and parasitological effects, treatment will continue for 72 hours, by which
      time peripheral parasitemia will have cleared in the majority of patients. The selection of
      the pentoxifylline dosage regimen for the larger, multi center Phase II and Phase III studies
      will be made on the basis of the maximum tolerated dose (based on clinical and laboratory
      observations) which minimizes the dose-related side-effects and adverse events (based on
      pharmacokinetics) while permitting maximum biological, immunological, and/or parasitological
      effects (pharmacodynamics).
