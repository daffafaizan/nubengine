      Treating the graft locally with an antiresorptive substance such as a bisphosphonate has
      decreased the graft resorption in animal studies and led to a remained bone density in a
      human series of 16 patients. In the present study we investigate if this increased bone
      density of the graft also causes a decreased micromotion of the implant relative the femur.
      36 patients are planned to participate in a 1:1 randomized and prospective study comparing
      the bisphosphonate Clodronate to saline. Primary outcome will be micromotion over the first
      year but also secondary parameters such as late micromotion (between 12 and 24 months),
      re-loosening subjective outcome and safety.

      We hypothesize that rinsing the graft in a bisphosphonate solution prevents its resorption
      and therefore may reduce the risk of mechanical failure. Patients are followed with
      radiograms, RSA (radiostereography) preop, postop, at 6 weeks, at 12 and 24 months and
      subjective months and subjective parameters including Womac and SF 12. The treatment is
      simple, cheap and appears virtually risk-free.
