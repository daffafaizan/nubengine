      clinically create ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and chronic anemia. Multiple blood
      transfusions and iron overload cause cellular oxidative damage. However, α-tocopherol, an
      antioxidant, has been known as a potent scavenger of lipid radicals in the red cell membrane
      of β-thalassemia major patients.

      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of α-tocopherol in hemolysis and oxidative stress on the red
      cell membrane of β-thalassemia major.

      Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators allocated subjects in the
      placebo and α-tocopherol groups. Doses of α-tocopherol were based on the recommendation of
      Institute of Medicine: 4-8 years old 200 mg/day; 9-13 years old 400 mg/day; 14-18 years old
      600 mg/day. Hemolysis, oxidative stress, and antioxidant variables were evaluated before and
      after 4 weeks of consuming either α-tocopherol or placebo, performed prior to blood
      transfusions.
