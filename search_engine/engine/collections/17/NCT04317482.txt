    
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an ED-relevant stressor task as
      compared to a standard social stressor task. The investigators hypothesize that an
      ED-relevant stressor task will be feasible, as measured by the ability to
      recruit/randomize/retain participants, and as acceptable to participants as a standard social
      stressor task.

      Aim 2: Measure the stress response (alpha-amylase, cortisol, vital signs) in participants who
      undergo an ED-relevant stress task compared to a standard social stress task. The
      investigators hypothesize that norepinephrine release will be adequately assessed by salivary
      alpha-amylase and that an ED-relevant stressor task will elicit similar or greater
      physiological responses as a standard social stress task.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the ED-representativeness of an ED-relevant stressor task compared to a
      standard social stressor task. Although both tasks will be performed in a simulated ED room
      in the UAMS Simulation Center, the investigators hypothesize that an ED-relevant task will be
      rated as more representative of an actual ED visit.

      Aim 4: Evaluate ethological ratings of non-verbal behavior thought to indicate assertion and
      ratings of agitation using rating scales commonly employed in the clinical environment for
      this purpose. Participants undergoing stress sometimes display symptoms of assertion or
      agitation, but it is unknown when or how often this occurs. The investigators hypothesize
      that ethological ratings will be correlated with agitation scale scores and physiological
      changes.
