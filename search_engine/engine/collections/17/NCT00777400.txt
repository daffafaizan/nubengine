    
      The objective of this pilot trial is to determine whether the conversion from calcineurin
      inhibitors (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to efalizumab and sirolimus is associated
      with an increase in T regulatory cells and does not result in an increase in acute rejection
      following conversion. CNIs are associated with progressive nephrotoxicity, increased
      cardiovascular risk factor as well as an inhibitory effect on T regulatory cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine if the combination of efalizumab and sirolimus results in a significant increase
      in T regulatory cells. A hundred percent increase in T regulatory cells will be determined to
      be an important biologic effect of the combination of efalizumab and sirolimus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the feasibility of the conversion from CNI/MMF to efalizumab/sirolimus and to
      determine that this combination is safe and effective

      To determine if there is an increase in FoxP3 mRNA in the urine of converted patients. Urine
      FoxP3 is believed to correlate with T regs in the kidney.
