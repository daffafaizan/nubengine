      participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared
      with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), randomized
      (study medication assigned to participants by chance), prospective (study following patients
      forward in time) study. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately
      48 days. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (5 days) and double-blind
      treatment Phase (from Day 1 to 21, consists of Phase-1 and Phase-2) and follow-up Phase (from
      Day 21 to 43). Participants will receive mebendazole (600 milligram [mg]) and quinfamide (200
      mg) tablets orally once starting on Day 1 and mebendazole 600 mg and quinfamide (200 mg) or
      placebo tablets orally once starting on Day 21. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by
      percentage of participants with eradication of helminthic and/or protozoa. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
