      patients.

      Patients will receive 6 cycles of DCF regimen (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day, CDDP 75 mg/m2 and 5FU
      at 750 mg/m2/day for 5 days) every 3 weeks or 8 cycles of modified-DCF regimen (docetaxel 40
      mg/m2 day, CDDP 40 mg/m2 day and 5-FU at 1200 mg/m2/day for 2 days) every 2 weeks, according
      to their clinical status.

      CT scan will be planned at baseline, after 3 and after 6 cycles of DCF regimen (or after 4
      and 8 cycles of modified-DCF regimen) and then every three months until disease progression
      or death. A Pet-scan will be performed before and after 6 cycles of DCF. Tumor assessment
      will be carried out according to RECIST V1.1 criteria.
