      3-hour infusion to patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). II. Determine
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of PZA administered on this schedule. III.
      Determine the response and survival durations of NSCLC patients treated with PZA.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Pyrazoloacridine, PZA, NSC-366140.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 2 or 3 responses are observed in the first 18 evaluable patients, 12
      additional patients will be entered. Accrual is expected to take 5-12 months.
