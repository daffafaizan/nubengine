      in the United States and has been found to increase with age. OAB has a negative impact on
      health related quality of life (QoL), Per American Urological Association (AUA) / Society of
      Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) guidelines, PTNS is
      a third line recommendation for OAB along with onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injection and sacral
      neuromodulation. In the single sham-controlled trial (SUmiT: n=220), Peters et al reported
      that 54.5% of PTNS subjects had moderately or markedly improved bladder symptoms on global
      response assessments (GRA) compared to 20.9% of sham subjects (p <0.001). PTNS subjects also
      had statistically significant improvements in frequency, nighttime voids, voids with moderate
      to severe urgency and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes compared to sham. There is
      also early data from an implanted chronic tibial nerve stimulation lead study that shows a
      minimum of 8 hours of tibial nerve stimulation a day results in significant improvement in
      incontinence episodes per day at one week. Our study will test the concept of whether the
      PTNS effect is dose (total time of treatment) sensitive, and whether expanding the dosage of
      each treatment, i.e. from 30 minutes to 2 hours, will provide significant clinical
      improvement after a one week induction course.
