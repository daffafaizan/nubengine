      of HCC is one of the major factors leading to poor prognosis of HCC patients. Most studies
      have shown that the risk factors of recurrence include tumor size, tumor number and
      intrahepatic spread, etc.

      Besides, the carcinogenic effects of inflammatory activity and fibrosis in liver background
      caused by chronic hepatitis also be related to the recurrence. In the study,
      combi-elastography imaging technology , not only the F index which is related to liver
      fibrosis stage can be obtained, but also the A index which is related to inflammation
      activity can be measured, this may provide a more valuable method for tumor recurrence of
      early prediction.
