      adequate glycemic control can reduce the devastating complications of diabetes. Unfortunately
      a large percentage of veterans with type 2 diabetes continue to have poorly controlled blood
      sugars. Insulin is the most potent medication for reducing glycemia, but is not used often
      enough due to barriers that are both patient and provider driven.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of establishing an insulin
      education group that would serve to educate patients about insulin, to initiate insulin in a
      group setting, and to provide appropriate follow-up of those who start insulin. If the
      intervention is successful, we plan to develop a multicenter study to test rigorously the
      effect of this approach.

      Specific Aims:

      To determine if psychological barriers to insulin initiation in patients with uncontrolled
      type 2 diabetes are favorably affected by a group insulin education and insulin initiation
      visit, as measured by the Barriers to Insulin Treatment (BIT) Questionaire before and after
      the intervention.

      To evaluate the feasibility of the intervention as measured by the percent of patients who
      are referred to the class, but either cancel without rescheduling or fail to report and the
      percent of patients who begin insulin.

      To evaluate the safety of the intervention as measured by the proportion of patients
      experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms; proportion of patients requiring sugar intake to manage
      hypoglycemia; and the proportion of patients requiring assistance to manage hypoglycemia.
