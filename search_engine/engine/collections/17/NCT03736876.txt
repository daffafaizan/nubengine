      SBHC staff, and those participants meeting the screening eligibility requirements (previous
      exposure to violence and/or previous or current involvement in a romantic relationship) will
      be offered a parental consent form and informational packet. Consent forms will be available
      in English and Spanish. Pending parental consent and youth assent, students will be
      randomized into either the intervention or control group.
