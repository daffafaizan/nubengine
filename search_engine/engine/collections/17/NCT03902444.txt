    
      ASSISTENT is subdivided into two components. The first part only requires recording of data
      acquired in routine clinical practice during the treatment of patients with intracranial
      stenosis with the self-expandable CredoÂ® stent until discharge. This comprises demographic
      data, data concerning the qualifying clinical event, limited data on medical history and
      medication, information about the intervention including technical success and periprocedural
      complications or events, and information about events and clinical status during the
      in-hospital treatment until hospital discharge.

      The second part of the registry consists of a follow-up visit 30 days after the
      interventional procedure which will be conducted outside of clinical practice.
