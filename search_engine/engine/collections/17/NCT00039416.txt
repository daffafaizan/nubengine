      I. To determine the response rate (complete and partial) to STI-571 in patients with
      myelofibrosis.

      II. To determine the safety of STI-571 in patients with myelofibrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of STI-571 on bone marrow morphology (including effects on marrow
      fibrosis, osteosclerosis and cellularity) in patients with myelofibrosis.

      II. To assess the effects of STI-571 on surrogate biologic endpoints including PDGFR
      expression (by immunohistochemistry), PDGFR signaling, and circulating progenitor (CD34
      positive) cells.

      III. To determine the effects of STI-571 on bone marrow cytogenetics in patients with an
      abnormal karyotype.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Dupriez risk score
      (low vs intermediate vs high).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
