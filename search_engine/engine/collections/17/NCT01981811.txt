      barrier to achieving optimal health. The MIND1 System is being developed to objectively and
      precisely monitor and measure real-time medication adherence; and to potentially enhance
      adherence. The MIND1 System includes oral aripiprazole with an embedded ingestible event
      marker (IEM), a Wearable Sensor, and a computerized device and accessories. This is a trial
      designed to evaluate adherence to treatment with, and safety and tolerability of, the medical
      information device #1 (MIND1) system in subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.
      This 12-week, single-arm trial will include male and female subjects 18 to 65years
      (inclusive) with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder who are currently
      treated with oral aripiprazole.
