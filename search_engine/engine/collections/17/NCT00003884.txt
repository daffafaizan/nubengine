      cancer with bone metastases other than breast or prostate cancer. II. Assess the efficacy of
      zoledronate in preventing skeletal-related events including tumor induced hypercalcemia
      (TIH), time to first occurrence of skeletal-related event or TIH, skeletal morbidity rate,
      time to progression of bone metastases, overall survival, and time to overall disease
      progression in these patients. III. Assess the quality of life and pain in these patients on
      these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified into two groups: patients with lung cancer and patients with all other solid
      tumor cancers. Patients are randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following treatments: Arm
      I: Patients receive intravenous zoledronate over 5 minutes every 3 weeks for 9 months. Arm
      II: Patients receive intravenous zoledronate at a higher dose over 5 minutes every 3 weeks
      for 9 months. Arm III: Patients receive intravenous placebo over 5 minutes every 3 weeks for
      9 months. All patients receive oral calcium daily, and an oral multivitamin supplement.
      Quality of life is assessed prior to therapy, then at months 3, 6, and 9. Patients are
      followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
