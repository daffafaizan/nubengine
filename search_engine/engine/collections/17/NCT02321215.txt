      strongly suggests that all patients should be discharged with an action plan, consisting of
      identified patient responsibilities for their ongoing care and advice on recognizing and
      seeking help in the event of future acute exacerbations. Despite these recommendations,
      structured chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) specific education is rarely offered
      within acute hospital settings and, in addition, research in this area is limited. This study
      aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of an introductory education program
      delivered during and shortly after an AECOPD hospitalization.
