      Primary

        -  Evaluate the tolerance to concurrent neoadjuvant docetaxel and cyberknife
           hypofractionated radiotherapy followed by standard treatment in women with breast cancer
           in order to find the maximum-tolerated dose of radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the combination chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Evaluate breast-conserving surgery.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cyberknife hypofractionated radiotherapy.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning during
      the first or second course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo hypofractionated
      radiotherapy. Patients then receive standard chemotherapy comprising epirubicin hydrochloride
      IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and fluorouracil IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up
      to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      surgery 4-8 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy, and then undergo standard
      radiotherapy.
