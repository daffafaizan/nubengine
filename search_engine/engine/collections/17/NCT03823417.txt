    
      This prospective randomized placebo controlled double blind trial will enroll 80 adolescents
      and young adults undergoing elective peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO). The primary aim is to
      determine if intravenous infusion of TXA during surgery is effective compared to standard
      care (no TXA) in decreasing blood loss (measured; and calculated) and blood transfusion
      (autologous and allogenic) perioperatively in adolescents and young adults presenting for PAO
      surgery. The rate of blood loss over time will be measured and compared between groups with
      adjustment for length of surgery (time; hours) and body weight (kg).
