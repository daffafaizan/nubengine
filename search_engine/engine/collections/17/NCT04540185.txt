      vaccine (OPV) reduced the number of other viruses that could be isolated from immunized
      children, compared with placebo recipients.

      Both poliovirus and coronavirus are positive-strand RNA viruses; therefore, it is likely that
      they may induce and be affected by common innate immunity mechanisms. Recent reports indicate
      that COVID-19 may result in suppressed innate immune responses. Stimulation by live
      attenuated oral polio vaccines could increase resistance to infection by the causal virus,
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS-CoV-2.

      It has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Covid-19) can directly invade the nervous
      system of patients, instead of injuring the nervous system through the immune response.
      Increasing evidence suggests that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological deficits in a
      substantial proportion of affected patients. It was observed that patients surviving COVID-19
      are at high risk for subsequent development of neurological disease and in particular
      Alzheimer's disease.

      NA-831 is a new neuroprotective and neurogenesis drug that has been demonstrated its
      promising safety and efficacy in Phase 2A for the treatment of early onset ofAlzheimer's
      disease. NA-831 in oral formulation is well tolerated NA-831 with no adverse effects.

      The Phase 3 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of OPV with and without
      NA-831 versus placebo.
