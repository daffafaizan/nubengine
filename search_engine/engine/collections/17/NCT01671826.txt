      Bortezomib (VelcadeÂ®) based induction treatment (either Velcade Dexamethasone, Velcade
      Thalidomide Dexamethasone (VTD) or Velcade Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone (VCD)). After the
      induction phase, for patients at least in partial remission, a collection of peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) is done according to each center practice. High dose melphalan (140 mg/m2)
      followed by PBSC autologous transplantation is then performed. Three months post transplant,
      2-3 cycles (similar to the initial induction phase) of consolidation are allowed.
