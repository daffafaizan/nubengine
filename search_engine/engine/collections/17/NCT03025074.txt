      samples from patients with various types of liver disease. The objectives of this
      biorepository are to stimulate collaboration between clinicians and researchers, to bolster
      training of junior investigators and to promote multidisciplinary integration to advance
      translational medicine and to improve the health of patients all over the country. The
      purpose of this biorepository is to support investigators and to provide them with high
      quality specimens to promote their efforts in new discoveries or perfecting treatment of
      patients with liver diseases caused by Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),
      Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The goal is to obtain samples that represent patients
      seen in the clinics of medical centers in Western NY and from some of the rarer diseases
      encountered in these clinics. The ultimate goal is to develop the biorepository as Western
      New York's resource for clinically annotated human samples that can be used to conduct
      research that could lead to significant advances in patient care.
