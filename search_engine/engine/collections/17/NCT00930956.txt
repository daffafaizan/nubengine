      a three-week period, up to two visits/wk, with at least 48 hours between visits. Volunteers
      will be asked to refrain from vigorous physical activity and the consumption of alcohol the
      day before each testing visit. Randomization using a Latin Square design was applied to
      minimize confounding issues associated with the order of administration.

      In the morning of each test, a finger-prick capillary blood samples will be collected to
      determine fasting (baseline) blood glucose levels. The volunteers will then consume the test
      solution assigned for that trial. Ten minutes will be allowed for the test solution to be
      consumed. Over the two hours following the start of each test, finger-prick capillary blood
      samples were collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Blood glucose levels will be immediately
      measured in duplicate using an automated blood glucose analyzer (YSI 2300, Yellow Springs,
      OH). Analysis of the collected sample was repeated if the difference between duplicate
      samples was greater than 0.1 mmol/L. Once the samples were analyzed, the data was entered and
      the incremental area under the curve was calculated using the trapezoidal model (GraphPad
      v5.0, La Jolla, CA).
