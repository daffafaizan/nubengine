      recommended dosage of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) and/or protease inhibitor (PI) is 600mg orally, once daily.

      In Thai populations, many ARV levels are very high. We believe that 600 mg efavirenz is too
      high for Thai people and would like to see the pharmacokinetic data and safety and efficacy
      of efavirenz at 400 mg.
