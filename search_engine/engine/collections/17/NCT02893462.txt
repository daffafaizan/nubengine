      of these situations is burdened with a poor prognosis in the medium term and a source of
      prolonged hospitalizations, generating significant health costs. Early detection and
      prediction of organ failure could reduce health costs and risks for the patient, offering a
      reaction early and appropriate medical technology. The proposed approach aims to optimize the
      knowledge of a complex physiological domain and multi-system, while promoting the automatic
      transfer of knowledge. The approach proposed data-mining and development of algorithms for
      detecting and / or predicting a strong potential for disruption because it proposes to apply
      innovative automated analysis procedures to a fragile patient population, and then a transfer
      to the medical device industry.

      From communicating tools of recording of the signals, the investigator envisage in a global
      way:

        1. the constitution of a warehouse of physiological data of grown-up patients in acute
           situation (intensive care unit);

        2. the development by data mining of a system of detection of organs failures or adverse
           events basing itself on the application of innovative algorithms, allowing the
           decision-making operational, from the fusion of arisen ill-assorted events;

        3. the use of intelligent tools of auto-learning and elaboration of complex multimodal
           models for purposes of prediction of events;
