    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lutetium Lu
      177 dotatate in combination with M3814 (peposertib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 4, 8, and 12 months
      post-therapy.

      III. To measure duration of response (DOR) associated with the combination. IV. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the somatostatin receptor uptake on gallium 68 dotatate at baseline. II. Perform
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dosimetry. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      M3814 (peposertib). IV. Describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing
      (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq) and correlate it with treatment outcome.

      V. Collect plasma for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) assessment.

      VI. Collect blood for biobanking and future correlative studies. VII. Measure association of
      overall response rate with gallium 68 dotatate-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) measurements and Krenning score.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib.

      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      56 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 24 months.
