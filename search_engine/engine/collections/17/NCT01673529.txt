    
      This study is a two part, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate
      the effects of topical doses of SB705498 on capsaicin, histamine, and cowhage responses in
      healthy volunteers. Part A has been designed to establish whether the topical formulation is
      capable of delivering SB705498 to the proposed site of action, and to select an appropriate
      dose for Part B. Part B will examine the effects of SB705498 on pruritus initiated by a
      histaminergic and a non-histaminergic pathway, using two different challenge agents;
      histamine and cowhage. This may provide important information about the role of TRPV1 in
      pruritus and the therapeutic potential of SB705498.
