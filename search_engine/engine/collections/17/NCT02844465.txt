      laser ablation system for necrotization or coagulation of epileptogenic foci in patients with
      intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

      The study will include approximately 150 adult patients with drug-resistant MTLE treated at
      selected epilepsy centers across the United States. After the Visualase procedure, patients
      will be followed for 12 months and evaluated for freedom from seizures, quality of life,
      adverse events, and neuropsychological outcomes.
