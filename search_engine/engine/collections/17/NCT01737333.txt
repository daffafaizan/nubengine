      with contrast administration using a tailored contrast injection and radiation dose protocol.
      The hypotheses are that the tailored protocols lead to a lower applied mean radiation dose
      compared to the use of standard protocols and will provide a more standardized contrast dose
      per patient size without impairing diagnostic quality.
