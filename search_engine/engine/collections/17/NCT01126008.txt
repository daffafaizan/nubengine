      only in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with high dose
      cisplatin has been universally used regimen. In a large-scaled phase II trial, however,
      conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),
      docetaxel (100mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75mg/ m2) every three weeks regimen produced improved
      survival, nonetheless there was significant limitation to deliver full doses of treatment due
      to significant hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Previously, we showed the safety
      of the combination regimen of weekly docetaxel and cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiation
      treatment in a phase I study. We determined the MTD of docetaxel to be 20mg/m2 weekly when
      concurrently administered with conventional fractionation RT and weekly 20mg/m2 of cisplatin.
