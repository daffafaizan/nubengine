    
      Measurement of the biomarker for heart failure N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide
      (NT-proBNP):

      In patients randomized to the strategy with supplementary measurement of NT-proBNP, a blood
      sample will be drawn from the peripheral venous catheter that is routinely inserted. This
      will be analyzed point-of-care in the ambulance.

      Interpretation of NT-proBNP:

      Cut-off values based on bootstrap-validated optimal cut-points for heart failure on will be
      used.

      Confirmatory ('rule in') cut point

      < 50 years: 450 pg/mL

      50-75 years: 900 pg/mL

      > 75 years: 1800 pg/mL

      Exclusionary ('rule out') cut point

      All patients: 300 pg/mL

      The emergency physicians will be thoroughly informed about these cut-points, but told not to
      triage to department of cardiology or other department strictly according to NT-proBNP, but
      according to clinical assessment AND NT-proBNP.
