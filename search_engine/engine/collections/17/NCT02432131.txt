      in the left atrium within three cardiac cycles after their appearance in the right atrium, at
      rest or during Valsalva release. If TEE finding will not be conclusive, we will decide the
      presence or absence of PFO with supplementary transcranial doppler. It will be blinded to
      participants, physicians and research persons to perform clinical follow-up. It will be not
      officially recorded, and will be preserved by another research person, who will not contact
      study participants.
