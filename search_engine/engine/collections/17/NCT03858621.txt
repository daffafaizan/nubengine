      50 years admitted for elective surgery that is planned to require general anesthesia, with
      fentanyl as the opioid of choice for intraoperative analgesia.

      Each patient will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: the intervention group will be
      provided intraoperative analgesia guided by NOL values (n=50), and the control group will be
      provided standard intraoperative analgesia (n=50). To account for inter-personal variability,
      the NOL threshold value associated with nociceptive stimulation will be assessed on each
      patient at baseline condition with the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and
      neuroinflammatory mediators MCP-1, IL-1, IL-1b, and IL-10 will be measured pre- and
      post-surgery in both groups. Opioid consumption and AVS will be assessed during the stay at
      the post-surgical care unit as a measurement of post-operative pain and will follow them
      until three months after surgery.

      Statistical Analysis: Results will be expressed as means (±SD) or numbers (%). When
      indicated, 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. A p-value < 0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant.

      Differences between groups on post-surgical opioid consumption, Δz-score of QST measurements,
      and serum biomarkers level will be analyzed with Student's T-test for unpaired samples. For
      analysis purposes, VAS scores will be grouped into three distinct categories: Mild (0-3),
      Moderate (4-6) and Severe (7-10) pain. Differences between groups will be analyzed with
      Chi-square test.
