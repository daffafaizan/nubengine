      Glypican-3. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled, and GPC3-CAR-T cells
      will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of 1×106, 3×106, 10×106 GPC3-CAR-T cells.
      Tumor markers and GPC3-CAR-T cell proliferation will be monitored in the scheduled time (day
      0, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14, day 28). The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of GPC3-CAR-T cells therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
      The primary endpoint is the safety of CAR-T cells including the effect ratio of CRS and
      ICANS, ORR. The secondary endpoint is the CAR-T ratio and CAR gene copied number in PB, PFS,
      OS and DOR.
