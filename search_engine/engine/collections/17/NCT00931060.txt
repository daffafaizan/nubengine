      encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients. The main effect of BCAAs is believed to take place in
      muscles where BCAAs provide carbon-skeletons for the TCA-cycle. This enhances the conversion
      of alfa-ketoglutarate to ammonia via glutamine.

      We intend to study the effect of oral administered BCAA on the metabolism of ammonia and
      amino acids across the leg-muscles by means of catheters inserted into the femoral artery (A)
      and vein (V). Muscle blood flow (F; L/min) will be determined by constant infusion of
      indocyanine green and indicator dilution principle. Arterial blood flow and A and V
      concentrations of ammonia and amino acids will be measured before an oral load of BCAA (0.45
      g BCAA/kg body weight) and after 1 and 3 hours. The metabolism of ammonia will also be
      estimated by means of 13N-NH3 PET scans.

      Hypothesis: BCAA increases the uptake of ammonia in muscle tissue and lowers arterial
      ammonia.
