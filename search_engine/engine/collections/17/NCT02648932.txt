      To compare time from formal search to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients
      18 years and older, randomized between haplo-cord search and matched unrelated donor (MUD)
      search for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS)

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare the percentage of patients who undergo HCT in each study cohort

        -  To evaluate overall survival from time to randomization by study cohort
