      The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the need to vaccinate worldwide as soon as a safe and
      efficacious vaccine becomes available. However preliminary data show that, on average, only
      50% to 66% of US adults would be willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination when it becomes
      available, a percentage lower than what is required for herd immunity to control the
      pandemic. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to vaccinate children to reopen schools and
      keeping them safe, as well as to immunize pregnant women through vaccination programs since
      they constitute a vulnerable population. Vaccine confidence among pregnant women and mothers
      of school-aged children during the period of COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, leading to an
      important gap of knowledge that may hinder the upcoming global COVID-19 vaccination scale-up
      effort. It is therefore of critical importance to assess the level of vaccine confidence and
      influencers among pregnant women and mothers of school-aged children during the COVID-19
      pandemic.

      The international nature of the proposed survey will allow the evaluation of vaccine
      confidence and its influencers among pregnant women and mothers of school-aged children on a
      global level. Therefore, social and geographic characteristics from different countries and
      cultures will be available for comparison. The resulting knowledge will be relevant to a
      large percentage of the world's population. Any country in the world can participate.
