    
      Patients will be enrolled after hepatic ultrasonography control and they will be submitted to
      hepatic vein pressure gradient and liver biopsy.

      The study have four research lines:

      Task # 1: transcriptomic characterization of liver tissue. During hepatic vein pressure
      gradient , liver tissue will be extracted with transjugular catheter equipped with a biopsy
      device. Tissue will be used to extract microRNA to define molecular signature.

      Task # 2: Proteomic characterization of liver tissue. Protein expression changes will be
      analyze with MALDI-TOF

      Task # 3: Metabolomic features on serum of patient with cirrhosis. Metabolomics is defined as
      the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric response of living systems to
      pathophysiological stimulus or genetic modification. Principal objective of this activity
      will be identify metabolites deregulated with metabolomic approach and clarify any new
      pathways involved in the evolution of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The metabolomic analysis will be performed on sera collected in patients with cirrhosis at
      baseline.

      Task # 4: Transcriptomic characteristics of newly diagnosed HCC. New diagnosis of
      hepatocellular carcinoma will undergo an eco-assisted liver biopsy. A tissue sample will be
      dedicated to the extraction of 'RNA. Patients will then undergo elective treatment according
      to international guidelines. The course of the disease and the results of therapeutic
      interventions will be recorded and correlated with the molecular data. Molecular signature
      will be obtain.
