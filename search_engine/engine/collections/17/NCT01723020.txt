      with advanced p53WT solid tumors or multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      Part 1 - Dose Exploration (parts 1a, 1b and 1c) and Part 2 - Dose Expansion. Part 1a is aimed
      at evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of AMG 232 and determining the MTD of a
      7-day once daily (QD) dosing schedule in subjects with advanced solid tumors using a
      practical continuous reassessment method (CRM). Part 1b will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of 3-day QD dosing schedule (or alternate dosing schedule based upon emerging
      data) with a particular emphasis on evaluating the tolerability of daily doses equal to or
      higher than the part 1a MTD in subjects with solid tumors or multiple myeloma. Part 1c will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of 7-day twice daily (BID) dosing schedule with daily
      cumulative doses equal to or higher than the part 1a MTD in subjects with solid tumors. The
      dose expansion part of the study (Part 2) can open once the MTD has been determined in Part
      1a. Part 2, part 1b and part 1c can be explored in parallel. The dose expansion part will
      consist of up to 85 additional subjects with specific tumors harboring MDM2 amplification
      (liposarcoma [LPS], gliobastoma [ GBM ] and all other solid tumors) or potentially harboring
      MDM2 overexpression (ER+ metastatic breast cancer) and a group of subjects with multiple
      myeloma.
