      the treatment of GERD. The system enables the operator to staple the fundus of the stomach to
      the esophagus approximately 3cm superior to the Z-line in 2 or more locations. The procedure
      is performed transorally under general anesthesia. The procedural result is anatomically and
      functionally similar to standard anterior fundoplication (Dor-Thal operation). The staples
      are standard, 4.8mm titanium surgical staples. Each application of the device fires a
      quintuplet of staples (5) in three staggered rows. Anti-retching medications at the time of
      the procedure are essential.

      The study population will be primarily adults aged 18-70 years selected by the investigators
      based on SAGES guidelines for fundoplication and consideration of the indications and
      contraindications listed in the device Instructions for Use (IFU).

      Follow-up data will be collected at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years post procedure.
