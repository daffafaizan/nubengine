    
      In response to a mandated requirement from the Belgium Medicines Agency - rising from the
      perforce switch of Sinutab® to a 2 active ingredients Pseudoephedrine+Paracetamol combination
      - we have made a commitment to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Sinutab®.

      In agreement with the Medicines Agency, an in-use Pharmacy-based study has been designed to
      demonstrate efficacy and safety of Sinutab® for the approved indications (symptomatic relief
      in the common cold).

      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, comparative phase 4,
      multi-centre study in parallel groups between Sinutab and placebo. To study the drug in it's
      'natural environment', community pharmacists will function as local investigators.
      Approximately 25 community pharmacists will be carefully selected, and only be taken into
      consideration if appropriate software programs are used in their pharmacy.

      This implicates that the pharmacist has a medication record of his patients at his disposal
      which he will use to check the exclusion criteria. They will include subjects with early (≤
      48 hours) cold symptoms of blocked nose with headache. Subjects fulfilling the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups, according
      to a computer-generated randomization list. A sufficient number of subjects will be
      randomized in the order of their enrolment, targeting at 300 evaluable subjects at the
      conclusion of study.

      The following information will be collected every evening from subjects during 7 days:
      symptom assessment, compliance, adverse events and the ability to go to work or school.
