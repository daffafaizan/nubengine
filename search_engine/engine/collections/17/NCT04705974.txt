      required for spinal anesthesia. Providing analgesia before positioning not only increases
      patient comfort but also improves positioning and successful spinal block. Peripheral nerve
      block is an effective strategy for relieving pain during postures change for spinal
      anesthesia in patients with hip fractures. Three types of peripheral nerve block, including
      fascia iliaca block, femoral nerve block and Pericapsular nerve group block (PENG block), has
      been successfully used for analgesia for spinal anesthesia positioning in patients with hip
      fractures. However, the minimum effective dose of local anesthetics for these three types of
      peripheral nerve block is not known. This study aims to determine the minimum effective dose
      of ropovacaine in the three types of peripheral nerve block using a biased coin design
      up-and-down sequential method. Successful block is defined as NRS score â‰¤3 by positional
      changes for spinal anesthesia, achieved at 20min after the block. MED90 of ropivacaine for
      fascia iliaca block, femoral nerve block and PENG block be assessed respectively. Patients
      will receive ultrasound guided peripheral nerve block. The initial dose is chosen as 80 mg on
      the basis of clinical experience. Subsequently, if a patient has an inadequate block, the
      ropivacaine dose is increased by 8 mg in the next subject. If a patient has a successful
      block, the next subject is randomized to receive either a lower dose (with a decrement of 8
      mg), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same dose, with a probability of 1 - b = 0.89.
      Forty five successful blocks for each type of nerve block will be accomplished. MED90 of each
      type of nerve block will be calculated by isotonic regression.
