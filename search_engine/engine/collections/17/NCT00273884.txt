    
      This is a two-stage, open-label, phase 2, multicenter study of amonafide L-malate in
      combination with standard-dose cytarabine in subjects with secondary AML.

      Amonafide is a DNA intercalating agent and inhibitor of topoisomerase II that has been
      extensively studied in patients with malignant solid tumors. Amonafide has also been studied
      in patients with AML. In three phase I clinical trials, amonafide demonstrated anti-leukemic
      activity, both as monotherapy and in combination with cytarabine. This protocol is designed
      to further assess the safety and efficacy of amonafide in combination with cytarabine in
      subjects with previously untreated secondary AML.

      The duration of the study is approximately 42 months: enrollment approximately 18 months and
      subject duration up to 24 months
