      Subjects will receive either a single dose of 30 million autologous culture-expanded
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs), or two doses of AMSCs (with one month
      interval between doses) via ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection. Patients will be
      followed for 24 months past their last injection to determine the local and systemic safety
      of single and two-dose injections of AMSCs in the treatment of symptomatic hip OA.
