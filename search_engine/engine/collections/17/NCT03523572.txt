    
      The purpose of this phase 1b (Part 1, Part 2) study is to assess the combination of a test
      drug (trastuzumab deruxtecan) with nivolumab in participants with HER2-expressing breast and
      urothelial cancer who had disease progression during or after prior therapies, did not
      respond to standard therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is available.

      The study will be performed in 2 parts.

        -  Part 1 is to test different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan when given along with a
           fixed dose of nivolumab, and establish the most effective and the maximum/recommended
           tolerated dose, when used in combination with nivolumab

        -  Part 2 is to assess the efficacy and safety of this dose combination.
