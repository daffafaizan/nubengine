           investigation performed with the investigational radioactive substance FMISO can show
           areas of tumor with lower oxygen levels. There is evidence that tumor with low oxygen
           levels are more resistant to radiation therapy. CT and MRI scans are not able to detect
           these oxygen levels in tumors.

        -  Participants will be asked to have the FMISO-PET/CT scan at 2 different times. It will
           be performed 2 weeks before and 3 weeks after the participants first proton radiation
           treatment.
