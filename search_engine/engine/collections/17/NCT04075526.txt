      involving the use of povidone iodine and vancomycin powder on the incidence of PJI in high
      risk TJA patients. The potential benefits of these interventions are significant both from
      the perspective of reducing morbidity and mortality for the patient, and from a
      cost-effectiveness and value-based perspective. To this end, our study seeks to assess the
      direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment and control groups. We anticipate
      that the administration of a VPIP protocol will both reduce the incidence of PJI in high risk
      groups relative to the control arm and will demonstrate added value from a cost-effectiveness
      perspective.

      This study looks to examine off-label use of Vancomycin Powder and Povidone Iodine 10%
      solution. Both products are lawfully marketed in the United States. This study is not
      intended to be reported to the FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication
      and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling or
      advertising of either drug.

      This study does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other
      factor that significantly increased the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk)
      associated with the use of the drug product. The routes and dosages being tested in this
      protocol are part of standard clinical care in most total joint arthroplasty surgeries.
