      and devastating disorder, especially in critical illnesses, affecting 5-8% of all
      hospitalized patients and up to 30% of those in intensive care units, with high mortality.
      About 50-80% critical patients with AKI needed dialysis treatment. Intermittent hemodialysis
      (IHD) might be the most-commonly modalities applied in AKI patients requiring dialysis.
      However, no data of randomized study concerning renal recovery and treatment efficiency of
      AKI patients treated with APD is available in Chinese adult patients. This study is a 2-armed
      randomized controlled non-blind non-inferior trial to explore the feasibility, efficacy, and
      safety of APD in AKI patients as compared with intermittent hemodialysis. Base on the sample
      size estimation, 100 subjects (n=50 in each arm) should be enrolled in this study. The
      primary outcome is the rate of renal recovery (independence of dialysis) in the first 21days
      after initiation of renal replacement.
