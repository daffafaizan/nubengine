      costs. Research is focused on development of new techniques to prevent incisional hernia.
      Little is known about application of this evidence in daily practice. Therefore, a survey was
      performed among Dutch surgeons.

      All members of the Dutch Surgical Society were invited to participate in a 24-question online
      survey on techniques and materials used for abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy.
      Subgroup analysis based on surgical subspecialty, hospital and experience was performed.
