    
      DTA-H19, is a doubled stranded DNA plasmid that carries the gene for the diphtheria toxin A
      (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the H19 promoter sequence. This is a Patient-Oriented,
      Targeted Therapy as DT-A chain expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription
      factors that are upregulated in tumor cells. The selective initiation of toxin expression
      results in selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition of protein synthesis in the tumor
      cell, enabling highly targeted cancer treatment.
