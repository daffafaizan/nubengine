      enrolled. Group 1 will include obese chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing
      lifestyle modifications, Group 2 will include obese CKD patients undergoing bariatric surgery
      and Group 3 will include obese CKD patients undergoing no specific weight loss interventions
      (control group).

      The lifestyle group will undergo supervised exercise training 5 days per week and follow
      hypocaloric diet based on the recommendations by a dietitian for 12 weeks. The exercise
      training will consist of walking, running on a treadmill and stationary cycling on a cycle
      ergometer. Patients will undergo adipokines, markers of inflammation,insulin resistance,
      renal function, bioimpedance analysis,DEXA measurement at baseline, 3- and 6-month intervals.
      CKD patients who undergo bariatric surgery and the control group will also undergo same blood
      tests, renal function studies and body composition studies at baseline, 3- and 6-month
      intervals.
