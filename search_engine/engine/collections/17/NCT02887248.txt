    
      This open-label, non-randomized phase II trial evaluates the efficacy and toxicity of
      first-line treatment with a combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, followed by
      maintenance therapy with nab-paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic or locally advanced
      unresectable urothelial cancer. Two groups of patients are eligible: (1) patients who are
      poor candidates for treatment with cisplatin, and (2) patients with visceral metastases who
      are incurable and unlikely to derive long-term benefit from treatment with cisplatin-based
      regimens. Eligible patients will receive a minimum of 3 cycles and up to 6 cycles of
      treatment with the gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel combination. Patients having an objective
      response or stable disease will continue maintenance treatment with single-agent
      nab-paclitaxel until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient decision to
      discontinue treatment. Up to 55 patients are planned for enrollment.
