      study evaluating the Recombinant Humanized Anti-PD-1 mAb for Injection in combination with
      Axitinib in patients with advanced kidney cancer and melanoma who have failed in routine
      systemic treatment.The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and cohort
      expansion.

      18 to 24 patients will be enrolled in dose escalation part.This part is to analyze safety and
      efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with axitinib and to confirm
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). After
      finishing the dose escalation part, we will enroll other patients for each tumor types of
      recommended dose group to ensure each group have 10 patients. This part is to further analyze
      safety and efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody.
