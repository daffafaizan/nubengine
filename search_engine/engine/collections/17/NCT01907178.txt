      hospital and factors such as preoperative anxiety, depression, and preoperative pain affect
      the level of postoperative pain experienced by patients. A total of 200 patients undergoing
      total knee surgery will be enrolled in this observational study. They will be asked to fill a
      baseline questionnaire including demographic information, medical problems, anxiety,
      depression, preoperative pain level, etc. Following routine standard anesthesia and surgery,
      patient's pain will be assessed every 4 hours when they are in the hospital after surgery,
      then daily assessment for 1 week after they are discharged home followed at 2 months, and 6
      months after surgery.
