      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In locally advanced HNSCC it has been
      proved to be superior to radiotherapy alone. On the other side accelerated fractionation
      radiotherapy (AFRT) is a proven practice to improve cure rate in head and neck cancers. Yet
      it has not been compared with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced HNSCC
      and hence this study is aiming to compare CRT versus AFRT.
