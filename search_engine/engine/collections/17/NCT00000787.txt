      behavior, drug and alcohol-related behaviors, and recent medical history, and are given a
      psychosocial assessment. They also undergo a physical exam, including pelvic exam and
      colposcopy, and have blood and urine specimens collected for HIV testing, drug screening, and
      STD evaluation. Additionally, participants are given pre- and post-test counseling and
      education, including information about social services. They are provided with basic
      gynecological care and either treatment or referral for medical problems.
