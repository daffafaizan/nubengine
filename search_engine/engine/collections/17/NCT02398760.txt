      specific chronic low back pain. However, in this population, these changes vary widely,
      characterizing them as an heterogenous group. Motor Control Exercises (MCE) aims to improve
      the impaired coordination of deep and superficial muscles of the trunk, to reestablish the
      stability of the lumbar spine reducing the common alterations in this population, and are
      associated with reduction of pain and disability of patients with non specific chronic low
      back pain. To specific assessment of the changes found in this population, clinical tests are
      often used: in the assessment to identify motor control alterations; during intervention as
      parameter for treatment progress (e.g. to increase exercises difficulty); and after
      intervention, to ensure that there was normalization of the motor control. There are several
      clinical tests to assess changes relative to clinical instability, such as: Clinical
      Classification Scale (CCS) to assess abdominal muscles and the coordination between
      superficial and deep trunk muscles; Clinical Test of Thoracolumbar Dissociation (CTTD) to
      assess anterior/posterior tilt while maintain a constant position of thoracolumbar junction;
      and the Prone Instability Test (PIT) and Passive Lumbar Extension Test (PLET) used to detect
      structural lumbar instability.

      Therefore, primary objectives of this study are: to investigate the ability of clinical tests
      in predict clinical outcomes, pain and disability, in motor control exercises program, and to
      investigate the association of two or more tests to predict clinical outcomes.
