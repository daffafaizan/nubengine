      marketed by Monica Healthcare) and the new device (Novii, being investigated in this clinical
      trial) will be placed on the patient's abdomen. After delivery of the patient's infant, the
      data will be abstracted from the second device. This data will be compared to the data from
      the first device for accuracy.
