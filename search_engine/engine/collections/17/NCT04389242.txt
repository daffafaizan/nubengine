      behavioral intervention in improving mental health, but most studies were done in Western
      countries. This study is intended to design a culturally appropriate online program
      especially for Chinese university students in Hong Kong. The program will include 8 weekly
      sessions and one face-to-face session and one telephone follow-up with a with certified CBT
      therapist. The effects on psychological distress, anxiety/depression, emotions, and automatic
      thoughts will be tested.
