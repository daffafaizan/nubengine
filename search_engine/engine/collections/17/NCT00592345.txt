    
      -  In this study three types of radiation will be used: standard radiation (called photon);
           alternative form of radiation called proton beam therapy; and a localized radiation
           applicator plaque that can be applied to the surface of the dura (the fibrous outer
           envelope that surrounds the spinal cord and fluid surrounding the spinal cord) at time
           of surgical removal of the tumor.

        -  Radiation treatments (photon and proton) and possibly surgical removal of portions of
           the tumor with intraoperative radiation delivery to the surface dura with intraoperative
           radiation delivery will be performed over a period of 12 weeks. As part of the treatment
           planning process, participants will need two treatment planning CT scans and 2-3
           treatment planning sessions.

        -  Participants will receive, in total, 39-43 photon/proton treatments.
