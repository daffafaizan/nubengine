      severe postoperative pain due to dilatation of the renal capsule and parenchymal duct and
      peritubal distension of the nephrostomy tube. PNL-related pain has a limited response to oral
      and intravenous treatments. The primary aim of our study is to investigate the effectiveness
      of the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in pain management of patients undergoing PNL.

      Our secondary aim is determining if any possible clinical effect of ESPB in terms of serial
      peak expiratory flow measurements, postoperative agitation score of the patient (Riker
      Score), ambulation time, length of hospital stay.
