    
      This study represents a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing two different systems
      of volar plate osteosynthesis in patients with distal radius fractures.

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the present study provided they
      give their consent. Informed written consent will be obtained. Envelopes will be prepared
      containing equal number of cards representing either the conventional or the novel plating
      syste. On the morning of the surgery a randomly picked envelope decides allocation one of the
      study groups. Patients will be blinded to treatment until completion of the study. Patients
      allocated to the control group receive Aptus 2.5® volar plate for distal radius fractures
      (Medartis AG, Basel, Switzerland), while patients in the study group will receive the plating
      system INTEOS 2.5® (Hofer GmbH and Co KG, Austria). In the control group, the pronator
      quadratus muscle will be cut prior mounting of the plate, while in the treatment group the
      plate will be inserted underneath the pronator quadratus leaving the muscle intact.
