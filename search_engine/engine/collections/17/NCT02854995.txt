      (i) circumcision: this will be a standard surgical circumcision whereby the prepuce (foreskin
      of the penis) is excised and the cut edge of the outer prepuce sutured to the cut edge of the
      inner prepuce. The two study team members performing the surgery in this trial (HC and SK)
      will be free to choose the method of circumcision (e.g. guillotine vs. sleeve) as this is not
      thought to influence outcome. The foreskin will be sent for histological analysis.

      (ii) preputioplasty with intralesional injection of triamcinolone. Briefly, longitudinal
      incisions will be placed in the area of phimosis, and these will be sutured transversely to
      allow the prepuce to become retractile. A biopsy of an area of affected foreskin will be sent
      for histological analysis. The intention will be to perform three incisions (tri-radiate) but
      the final decision on how many will be made by the operating surgeon and based on the
      appearance of the prepuce and result of initial incision(s). Once the prepuce is felt to be
      freely retractile, 1 - 3 mL of triamcinolone (Adcortyl Bristol-Myers Squibb 10 mg/mL) will be
      injected intradermally around the circumference of the affected foreskin using a 25-gauge
      needle.

      These procedures are established treatments for BXO and currently in use by the trial
      surgeons in the same setting as the trial.The preputioplasty with injection of triamcinolone
      procedure has previously been approved by the Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Trust
      Clinical Development Evaluation Group (CDEG).
