      the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, while both ultimately decrease central
      nervous system (CNS) inflammation, they do so by very different mechanisms. Therefore, use of
      1.5T MRI, triple dose of Gd, delay of scanning time for 20-30 min after Gd injection, and
      application of off-resonance saturated MT pulse may increase the ability to detect Gd lesions
      by approximately 120% when compared to 1.5T single dose MRI protocol. The 3T standard
      protocol may increase the ability to detect Gd enhancing lesions by 40-50% when compared to
      the 1.5T standard protocol. This may indicate that the 3T optimized protocol may increase the
      ability for Gd lesion detection by approximately 150-180%, when compared to the 1.5T standard
      protocol.
