      gauge its efficacy in a study population. Utilizing an experimental microbicide (tenofovir
      gel) and anti-HIV drugs (TDF, FTC/TDF), this study will measure the effectiveness and safety
      to and blood levels of the three interventions in three regimens given to HIV uninfected
      women.

      The expected duration of participation for each participant ranges from a minimum of 12
      months to a maximum of 38 months. Study participants will be randomly assigned into one of
      five study groups, each with a different regimen. Group 1 participants will take one TDF
      tablet daily and one FTC/TDF placebo tablet daily. Group 2 participants will take one TDF
      placebo tablet daily and one FTC/TDF tablet daily. Group 3 participants will take one TDF
      placebo tablet daily and one FTC/TDF placebo tablet daily. Group 4 participants will apply
      tenofovir 1% gel vaginally once daily. Group 5 participants will apply tenofovir 1% placebo
      gel vaginally once daily.

      Study visits will occur every 28 days after enrollment. Medical history, a physical exam,
      behavioral and adherence assessment, urine and blood collection, and counseling will occur at
      all visits. Blood will also be collected and archived for future research at select visits.
      Pharmacokinetic studies will occur at some visits. A pap smear will occur at select visits.
      Some participants may have hair samples collected on an optional basis at study visits every
      2 months.
