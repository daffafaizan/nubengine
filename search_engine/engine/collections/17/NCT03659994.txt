      through hair measurements using Dermoscan and Trichoscan smart software. The device includes
      a camera handpiece with 5MP USB high resolution camera (Full HD) for standardized images and
      reproducible measurements. The Trichoscan smart software will be used for the measurement of
      hair parameters including hair count, hair density, hair width and hair length. Each subject
      will receive a permanent ink marking underneath the chin to standardize the location of
      assessments. Assessment periods over a 5 day period prior to baseline and a 5-day period at
      the end of the study. On the first day of each period, subjects will shave in the clinic and
      image is capture to demonstrate the clean shave of the area (Day 0), subjects do not shave
      for the following 5-days and images will be taken on Days 2 and 5 of each assessment period.
      Day 5 values will be used for comparing supplement effects (baseline to end of study, between
      groups). Day 2 will be used to calculate rate of growth during each assessment period, and
      will be used to compare supplement effects (baseline to end of study, between groups).
