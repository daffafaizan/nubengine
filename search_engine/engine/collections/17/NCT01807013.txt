      This invasive methode is not undisputed. Therefore there is constant effort to improve,
      develop and apply better diagnostic tools. This study is designed to evaluate the in our eyes
      now a days most promising examinations: (1) high frequency ultrasound, (2) elastometry and
      (3) minilaparoscopy. Patients for whom the clinical decision to perform mini laparoscopic
      guided liver biopsy was taken should be recruited. Successive at three time points the
      examiner has to decide for or against cirrhosis: (1) after conventional and high frequency
      ultrasound (2) after elastometry and (3) after laparoscopy.
