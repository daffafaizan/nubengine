    
      This is an observational study in which data on consecutive patients who undergo
      ureterorenoscopy with the use of a flexible ureterorenoscope are collected. In total 6 new
      ureteroscopes are used (3 from Olympus and 3 from Storz) to study the durability of the
      ureteroscopes and the possible microbiological load.

      Before the procedure is started the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two
      different ways:1. Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile
      container filled with 10 cc of NaCl 0.9% 2. Flush the working channel of the ureterorenoscope
      with 10 cc of NaCl 0.9% and collect the sample in a sterile container.

      After the procedure is finished, the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two
      different ways:

      1. Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile container filled
      with 10 cc of NaCl 0.9% 2. Flush the working channel of the ureterorenoscope with 10 cc of
      NaCl 0.9% and collect the sample in a sterile container.

      Transfer all samples to the lab as soon as possible but at least within four hours after
      collecting the samples.

      As for the clinical efficacy during each procedure a detailed questionnaire about the use of
      each ureteroscope is filled out. This includes the ease of use making mention on quality of
      the image, torque, flexibility and durability.

      Data will be collected through electronic case report forms (eCFRs), with use of an online
      Data Management system (DMS).
