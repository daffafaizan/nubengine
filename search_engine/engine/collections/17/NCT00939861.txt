      examination, transvaginal sonography, rectal endoscopic sonography and magnetic resonance
      imaging.Among patients with an indication of surgery, the intensity of dyschesia and other
      gynecological or digestive disorders will be evaluated pre-operatively using a visual
      analogue scale. Quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The
      allocation of the surgical route will be conducted by lottery the day before surgery.
      Patients will be reviewed postoperatively at 1 month and a new assessment of symptoms will be
      made at 6 months. The duration of the study will be 7 months for the patient and 24 months in
      total.If considering the two surgical routes as equivalent, with a delta score (after-before
      surgery) = ±2, standard deviation = 1.55, risk α=2.5%, risk β=10%, and taking into account
      that prevalence of dyschesia in the study population is 63%, 52 patients will be included.
