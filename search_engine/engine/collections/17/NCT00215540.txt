      as a therapeutic approach for prevention of BPD. Determine whether treatment with SURFAXIN
      during the first two to three weeks of life can decrease the proportion of infants on
      mechanical ventilation or oxygen or the incidence of death or BPD in VLBW infants when
      assessed at 28 days of life and 36 weeks post-menstrual age (as determined by the need for
      supplemental oxygen).
