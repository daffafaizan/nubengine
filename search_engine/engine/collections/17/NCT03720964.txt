      Hospital of Angers. After clinical examination and audiometry recording, the eligibility
      criteria will be checked and inclusion in biocollections proposed. Presbycusis affected
      subjects will be enrolled in "Mitochondrial Disease biocollection" and normal hearing
      controls in "Healthy Volunteer biocollection". These biocollections have been approved by the
      board comitee "Centre de Protection des Personnes".

      After DNA extraction and mitochondrial sequencing, candidate variants will be selected by in
      silico analysis. The presence of mitochondrial variants in both groups (presbycusis and
      control) will be compared in multivariate analysis if needed.

      The nuclear DNA may be sequenced in order to complete the previous analysis and look for any
      candidate variant .
