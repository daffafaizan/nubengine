      moderate symptoms. Many of these treatments used heat modality. Hyperthermia is a relative
      recent device which produces deep heating.

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to verify the short-term effects of hyperthermia (HT)
      in pain relief and in functional impairment in patients affected by mild to moderate
      idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.

      Design: A double blind randomized sham-controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient physical
      therapy, institutional clinic. Participants: 23 patients were affected by idiopathic CTS, 11
      of them were affected by bilateral CTS.

      Intervention: Hyperthermia (HT) device treatment, treated for 20 minutes per session, a total
      of 8 sessions.

      Measurement: Primary outcome is pain (Visual analogic scale). Secondary outcomes were
      self-reported pain intensity and physical functioning questionnaire (Levine/Boston),
      ultrasonographic (median nerve cross sectional area mnCSA) and neurophysiological data.
