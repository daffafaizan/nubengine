      morbidity, mortality and postoperative delirium with further hazardous consequences. The
      incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly is reported with a range from 36.6% - 54.9%.
      The pathophysiology of delirium is complex and the interaction of the cholinergic system and
      inflammation reaction is a relevant precipitant factor. It was suggested that there is a
      strong association between the perioperative plasma ChE activity and the inflammatory
      response in patients developing delirium. Patients showed a significant reduction of the
      total ChE activity after orthopaedic surgery, with significant lower pre- and postoperative
      values of AChE and BuChE and increased inflammatory response in patients developing
      postoperative delirium. It remains unclear if these results are applicable to other patient
      populations and which factors have influenced the low preoperative ChE levels. In patients
      suffering from a cardiac disease, a reduced total ChE respectively BuChE activity was
      significantly associated with mortality and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events.
      The investigators hypothesize that the ChE activity in peripheral blood can be used as a
      potential biomarker, to early detect patients at high risk for postoperative delirium.
