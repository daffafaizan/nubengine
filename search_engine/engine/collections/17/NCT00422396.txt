      on:

        1. Fasting and postprandial lipids and lipoproteins after a standarized test meal.

        2. Fasting and postprandial oxidized fatty acids and oxidized low density lipoprotein after
           a standarized test meal.

        3. Fasting and postprandial inflammatory mediators after a standarized test meal.

        4. Fasting and postprandial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine production after a
           standarized test meal.

        5. Fasting and postprandial markers of hemostasis, fibrinolysis and blood viscosity after a
           standarized test meal.
