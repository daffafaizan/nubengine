      determine the safety and effectiveness of use of a noninvasive intraoral electrotherapy
      device to treat periodontal disease at-home for 20 minutes a day. A total of 30 patients were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group received an active intraoral electrotherapy
      device and a scaling and root planing (SRP) at baseline, another group received a sham device
      and a scaling and root planing (SRP) at baseline. The trial was comprised of three in-office
      oral examinations, which were performed at baseline, and at follow-ups～6 weeks (42 days ± 3
      days) and～3months (84 days ± 3 days later). After 3 months of treatment, the effectiveness of
      the intraoral electrotherapy device would be demonstrated by (1) statistically superior
      reductions in the probing depth and clinical attachment level compared to treatment with the
      sham device. (2) statistically superior reductions in the bleeding on probing and gingival
      index compared to treatment with the sham device.
