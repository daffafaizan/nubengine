    
      This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 2 parallel-group, multicenter study
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of a weekly subcutaneously injected dose of albiglutide as
      compared with sitagliptin. Subjects who are renally impaired with a historical diagnosis of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and whose glycemia is inadequately controlled on their current
      regimen of diet and exercise or their antidiabetic therapy of metformin, thiazolidinedione,
      sulfonylurea, or any combination of these oral antidiabetic medications will be recruited
      into the study.
