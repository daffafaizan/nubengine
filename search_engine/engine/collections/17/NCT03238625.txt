      cross-over study. One group receives four injections (two in each forearm) and one group
      receives only two injections (one in each forearm)

      The four injections of group 1 are:

        -  IMP1: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 3:1

        -  IMP 2: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 9:1

        -  IMP 3: Lidocaine

        -  IMP 4: Sodium cloride 0.9% (=placebo)

      The two injections of group 2 are IMP1 and IMP2.

      After each injection the individual has to rate their pain sensation on a NRS scale and
      afterwards the anesthetic effect gets tested by a standardized laser application.
