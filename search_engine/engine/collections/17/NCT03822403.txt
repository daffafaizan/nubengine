      performed over the years. Compared to other permanent filling materials like resin-based
      composites, glass ionomers show several advantages, such as the ability to adhere to moist
      enamel and dentin and anti- cariogenic properties such as the long-term fluoride release. So,
      it was doubtful that glass ionomers represent a capable counterpart of amalgam or resin-based
      composites in posterior teeth.
