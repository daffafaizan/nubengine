      recognizing tumor antigen, and can specifically recognize, bind and kill tumor cells with
      positive antigen. Through local drug delivery, CAR-T cells have successfully achieved
      remarkable effect to treat solid tumors. Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent malignant
      tumors with high mortality, especially in China. Peritoneal metastasis is one of the common
      routes of metastasis. Once peritoneal metastasis occurred, patients should be categorized as
      clinical pathological stage IV with extremely poor prognosis, and the effect of routine
      treatments would be unsatisfactory. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is highly
      expressed in gastric cancer cells and closely associated with the poor prognosis of patients.
      In our previous pre-clinical research researches, the investigators have obtained CAR-T cells
      targeting EpCAM (EpCAM CAR-T), and finished the preparations of cells which could be used in
      clinical practice. Based on our previous works, the investigators aim to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of peritoneal infusion of EpCAM CAR-T cell in advanced gastric cancer
      with peritoneal metastasis by a prospective nonrandomized controlled trial. The results of
      this clinical trial are expected to provide the new treatment strategy for gastric cancer
      patients with peritoneal metastasis.
