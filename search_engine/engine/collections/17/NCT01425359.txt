      Qualifying Period. The allowed concomitant antianginal medication(s) must be maintained at a
      stable dose throughout the study. Participants will document the number of angina episodes,
      number of sublingual nitroglycerin doses taken, and a dyspnea score (on a scale from 1 to 5)
      on a daily basis in a diary. Participants eligible to stay in the study after the Qualifying
      Period will enter the 8-week double-blind dosing phase. Participants will have study visits
      at the end of Weeks 2 and 8. Participants will continue to document the number of angina
      episodes and number of sublingual nitroglycerin doses taken as well as a dyspnea score on a
      daily basis by the end of each day in their diary. In addition, participants will be called
      during Week 2 and at the end of Week 5 to encourage compliance. A safety follow-up phone call
      will be made 14 days after the last study visit or early discontinuation.
