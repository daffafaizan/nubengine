      is commonly attributed to knee pain. Current treatments for knee pain are only modestly
      efficacious, and some common treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)
      have adverse long-term effects. Acupressure is an inexpensive and noninvasive treatment that
      has the potential to be a useful long-term self-management strategy for pain. Acupressure can
      be easily taught and is safe enough to self-apply without supervision. Participants will be
      randomized to three treatment groups: pain-relief acupressure, sham acupressure, and usual
      care (UC). The intervention will last for 8 weeks during which participants in the
      pain-relief and sham acupressure groups will be taught the assigned treatment by a trained
      research assistant who is blinded to the treatment arm, and provided with a digital video
      disc to aid their practice at home. The UC group will not receive training from the research
      team or be required to change their treatment practice.Our research team will make weekly
      phone calls to all three groups of participants to ask about their pain levels and any
      adverse events. For the two acupressure groups, the phone calls serve to support the
      participants' adherence to treatment. Data will be collected at baseline, mid-point (4 weeks
      after baseline) and the end ( 8 weeks) of the intervention. These results will help us assess
      the efficacy of pain-relief acupressure on knee pain in older adults, and allow us to
      calculate effect sizes to determine the appropriate sample size for a larger future study.
      Since no studies have involved older adults in self-administered acupressure, information
      about feasibility of and adherence to using this method in older adults would be invaluable.
