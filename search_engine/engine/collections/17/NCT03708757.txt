      on on hamstring flexibility of cerebral palsy children,and to investigate effects of post
      isometric relaxation on on hamstring flexibility of cerebral palsy children.It is a
      randomized control trial. this study will be conducted in PAF School for PSN Norkhan base
      Rawalpindi. Data collection time is from Oct 2018- March 2019. Sample size is 30 CP child,15
