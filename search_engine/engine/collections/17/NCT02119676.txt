    
      The study consisted of an open-label, Part 1 safety run-in (consisting of 1 to 3 cohorts of 9
      subjects each), to confirm the safety of the regorafenib/ruxolitinib combination in subjects
      with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). If determined to be
      tolerable, Part 2 was to proceed as a randomized, double-blind study evaluating ruxolitinib
      or placebo in combination with regorafenib in subjects with relapsed or refractory metastatic
      CRC previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and/or irinotecan based
      chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and if Kirsten rat
      sarcoma (KRAS) wild type an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.

      Subjects in the safety run-in received open-label ruxolitinib and regorafenib; for the
      randomized, double-blind portion of the study all subjects received regorafenib and either
      ruxolitinib or placebo in a 1:1 blinded manner. Treatment for all subjects consisted of
      repeating 28-day cycles. Regorafenib was self-administered for the first 21 days of each
      cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered during the entire 28-day cycle.
      Treatment cycles continued as long as the regimen is tolerated, and the subject does not meet
      the discontinuation criteria. When subjects discontinued regorafenib, ruxolitinib or placebo
      they remained in the study and were followed for subsequent treatment regimens which were
      initiated and survival.
