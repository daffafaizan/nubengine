    
      This is a first in human study of NYX-2925. This is a randomized, double-blind, sponsor-open,
      placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose, parallel safety, tolerability, and PK
      study of oral NYX-2925 in healthy volunteers. The single ascending dose phase will comprise
      up to five dose groups. There will be up to 3 dose groups in the multiple ascending dose
      phase. One open-label dose group will be repeated in the multiple ascending dose phase to
      collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, in order to explore central nervous system
      penetration. One elderly cohort (single dose) will be completed after all single and multiple
      dose escalation groups have completed. One open-label dose group will be repeated in the
      single ascending dose phase to collect CSF samples, in order to establish a more complete
      cerebral spinal fluid pharmacokinetic profile.

      The influence of food ("food effect") on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of NYX-2925
      will be explored in one dose group in the single ascending dose phase.

      A data review committee will review safety and tolerability (adverse events and other
      relevant data), plus preliminary pharmacokinetic data, prior to proceeding to the next higher
      dose group, cohort, and/or phase of the study, as well as administration of the fed dose in
      the food effect group.

      Stopping rules for individual study participants and dose groups or cohorts are established
      in order to evaluate the dose escalation scheme, the need to stop or terminate dosing, or to
      establish the maximum tolerated dose. If a cohort is stopped due to safety or tolerability
      concerns, the previous cohort may be repeated to determine the highest tolerated dose.
