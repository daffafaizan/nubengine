      people with a stoma and cause one third of all visits to a stoma care nurse. Stoma effluent
      in contact with the peristomal skin (leakage) appears to predispose patients to peristomal
      skin problems.

      To protect the skin against effluent, the appliance used for collection of stoma effluent
      should completely cover the peristomal skin close to the stoma. Coloplast has developed a new
      ostomy appliance to improve the feeling of security and increase comfort by the appliance
      characteristics.

      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate leakage, handling and comfort of a new
      ostomy appliance compared to SenSura.

      The study is a randomised controlled cross-over intervention study, where all study
      participants will test two test products (new ostomy appliance and SenSura). Each test period
      will last 10 Â± 2 days and the subjects will follow their usual wear and change pattern. The
      participants will visit the study investigator at study start and at cross-over. Evaluation
      of the test products will occur via questionnaires the subjects fill in at home.

      50 healthy subjects with a colostomy will be included in the study.
