    
      Using three treatment arms, the study will examine Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      symptom reduction when (1) 1 Hz (hertz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) is administered prior to each of 12
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) sessions compared to when (2) sham rTMS is administered to
      the rDLPFC is administered prior to each of 12 CPT sessions and to when (3) 1 Hz rTMS is
      delivered to rDLPFC alone over 12 sessions.

      Veterans with combat-related PTSD will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment
      arms. Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures, secondary neuropsychological,
      electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures, and
      prescreening assessments for study contraindicators will be collected prior to being assigned
      to a treatment arm (i.e., baseline).

      Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures and secondary neuropsychological outcome
      measures will be collected twice within the span of the treatment sessions (i.e., sessions 5
      and 9) and at three times following treatment competition (i.e., 1-month, 6-months, and
      12-months). EEG also will be collected at the 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month assessments, and
      MRI will be collected at the 6-month and 12-month assessments.
