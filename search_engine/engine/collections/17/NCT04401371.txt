      In Egypt institutions of higher education has taken the decision to temporarily suspend
      attendance in universities and to keep it closed for student during this pandemic.

      Cairo and Fayoum universities overcome this problem by avoiding gathering and facilitating
      the continuity of education for all through remote learning.

      In faculty of dentistry Cairo and Fayoum universities, pediatric dentistry course
      coordinators and instructors made modifications in their course which is taught to 5th year
      dental student.

      These modification included continuation of lectures and group sections through distance
      learning, while postponing any clinical work to avoid direct contact with patient.

      So the aim of the study was to assess distance education learning environment experiences
      among 5th year dental students enrolled in pediatric dentistry online course during COVID-19
      crisis, which will spot the light on strong and weak points in order to provide better
      education and improve their experiences.
