    
      273 patients will be randomly assigned (in 2:1 ratio) to the Surufatinib or Placebo treatment
      group based on interactive web response systemï¼ˆIWRS).The patients will receive continuous
      oral treatment, every 28-day treatment cycle until progression of disease occurs, intolerable
      toxicity or other protocol specified end-o-treatment criteria is met. The tumor should be
      assessed every 8 weeks (+/-3 days) within the first year and every 12 weeks (+/-3 days) after
      the patient has been treated for one year.

      A Blinded Independent Image Review Committee (BIIRC) will subsequently provide a central
      review of the oncologic imaging materials from the patients.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be assembled to monitor safety and
      efficacy data, and evaluate interim analysis. If the interim analysis demonstrates
      overwhelming efficacy of the treatment arm with respect to PFS (primary endpoint) versus
      control arm, IDMC could recommend terminating and to unblinding the study and Surufatinib
      will be offered to the control arm patients who are still on treatment until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity.
