      Nevertheless, cytology-based cervical screening may switch to HPV-based cervical screening in
      future. The implementation of primary HPV screening and insuficiency cervical screening
      attendance are a major challenge. The offering of self-sampling to the cervical screening
      non-attenders could increase women's participation as was shown in several European
      countries. The objective of the HPVPro study was to find out the HPV prevalence in the
      screening population of Czech women since there are no data for the Czech Republic. The
      second objective was to compare HPV DNA detection rate in paired self-sampled cervicovaginal
      swabs and physician-obtained cervical swabs and to determine acceptability of self-sampling
      HPV DNA test by Czech women. This information is important for optimisation of cervical
      cancer screening program in the Czech Republic.
