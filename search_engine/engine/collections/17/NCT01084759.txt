      suppressive effects in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic data in in
      vitro models suggests that this growth suppression may be due to the accumulation of androgen
      induced TOP2B mediated double strand breaks at AR target sites occurring after stimulation of
      prostate cancer cells with high levels of androgens. Provocatively, the number of double
      strand breaks was significantly increased (Figure 3 B) if the cells were treated with
      etoposide, an agent that leads to formation of double strand breaks at TOP2 target sites,
      concurrently with high-dose androgen stimulation. We hypothesize that co-administration of
      testosterone with etoposide could produce high levels of double strand breaks in prostate
      cancer cells, overwhelming DNA repair and survival mechanisms and leading to cancer cell
      death or growth arrest. To test whether this possibility holds promise for therapy of
      advanced prostate cancer, we propose the following clinical trial of parenteral testosterone
      therapy in combination with oral etoposide in men with evidence of progressive prostate
      cancer during chronic androgen ablation.
