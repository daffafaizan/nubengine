    
      This is a randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind
      (participants and study personnel will not know which treatments are being given),
      placebo-controlled (a placebo appears identical to a study drug but has no active
      ingredients), multicenter study. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a
      treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Approximately 250 participants with active RA despite
      MTX therapy will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or CNTO 6785 during the double-blind
      treatment phase. The maximum period of active treatment will be 28 weeks. The maximum
      duration of study participation will be 44 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
