    
      This is an open-label and paralleled study with single oral dose of HMS5552 given to hepatic
      impaired subjects and matched healthy volunteers.

      The primary objective is to access the pharmacokinetic profiles of HMS5552 in 25 mg dose in
      hepatic impaired subjects and (gender, age and BMI) matched healthy adult subjects.

      The secondary objective is to characterize the safety profiles of HMS5552 in single dose in
      hepatic impaired subjects.

      The subjects include mild hepatic impaired subjects (A group), moderate hepatic impaired
      subjects (B group), and healthy subjects (C Group) matched with hepatic impaired subjects in
      gender, age and BMI. The number of subjects in each group was no less than 8, and no less
      than 3 subjects in each gender.
