      volunteers. The first phase is a two-sequence, two-period crossover trial. The volunteers
      will be randomly distributed into two groups and given either TY-9591 tablets or Osimertinib
      Mesylate tablets on a single fasting administration. In the second phase, all volunteers will
      be administrated TY-9591 tablets after a high fat meal. The washout between each treatment is
      no less than 21 days.
