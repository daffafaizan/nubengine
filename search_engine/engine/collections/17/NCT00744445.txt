      dependent. Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis requiring r-HuEPO to maintain
      adequate levels of hematocrit are eligible for the study. Patients were administered r-HuEPO
      subcutaneously three times per week, 50 U/kg, rounded to the nearest 2000 units. r-HuEPO will
      be administered until the hematocrit rises from the baseline level of 20-24% to the target
      level of 30-34%. This will be repeated three times, each at different times of day, either
      0800, 1500 or 2200 hrs and the order of these will be randomly determined. Each patient will
      complete all three of the phases.
