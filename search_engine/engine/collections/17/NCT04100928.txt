      questionnaire was administered to the students when they were attending a lecture together.
      After the lecture, a researcher explained to the students the purpose of this survey and
      assured them of confidentiality. Participation in this study was also voluntary, and all
      participants remained anonymous. The questionnaire was given to all participants after
      explaining the purpose of the study. The questionnaire included demographic details (age,
      gender, year of study), social background (parents' education levels, family income, first
      choice for admission, living accommodation) and lifestyle behaviors (smoking status, presence
      of regular sport activity and hobby). In addition, Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-Being Scale
      was applied to the participants of this study.
