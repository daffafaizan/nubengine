      The study followed healthy siblings of patients diagnosed with CHD before age 60. All
      siblings underwent comprehensive risk factor screening and exercise thallium tomography to
      identify occult CHD. Follow-up was performed from 6-15 years after entry (mean 8.7 years) to
      determine the incidence of (1) acute coronary events (sudden death, myocardial infarction,
      and unstable angina) and (2) progression of occult CHD (repeat exercise thallium tomography).
      Blood was obtained for genomic DNA, which was tested for polymorphisms of candidate genes
      which may be associated with premature thrombotic CHD events (platelet proteins
      GPIIB/IIIa[PlA1/A2 and Baka/b] and GPIbB, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, angiotensin
      converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, D-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator-1, and
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). Plasma levels of proteins implicated in the
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombotic CHD events were measured (fibrinogen,
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator, homocysteine, lipoprotein
      (a), and apo(a) isoform size). DNA was also obtained from living probands and affected
      siblings to use for genetic linkage studies using affected and unaffectedsibling pairs.
      Statistical analyses examined (1) whether selected genetic polymorphisms were linked to the
      occurrence of acute CHD events, and (2) to what extent traditional sociodemographic and
      biological coronary risk factors or new genetic polymorphisms explained the progression of
      occult CHD, or the transition from occult to symptomatic CHD events in families with
      premature CHD.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
