      Mental healthcare might be indicated. Because of internal and external barriers of treatment,
      they could remain inaccessible for many children in need. School staff should not try to
      diagnose conditions. However, collaborative interventions delivered by school and mental
      healthcare staffs in association with other stakeholders as parents and associations should
      ensure clear systems and processes in place for identifying possible mental health problems
      and support children and their parents. Local partnership and early interventions will be
      elaborated within focus groups bringing together all stakeholders and will be experimented in
      7 French sites (preschool, primary school and local public health service) thereafter. These
      complex interventions will be evaluated through mixed-methods including qualitative case
      studies and a pragmatic trial. This feasibility study will produce a set of findings that
      will permit to argue conceptual framework of partnership and early intervention, to provide
      guidelines to implement these in France considering children needs, local context, all
      stakeholders acceptance and public health efficacy.
