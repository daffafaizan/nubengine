      option for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients. However this is still a
      controversial issue. The present study is an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial
      that aims to investigate the efficacy of concurrent NCT with endocrine therapy (AI with or
      without GnRH-a) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast carcinoma.
