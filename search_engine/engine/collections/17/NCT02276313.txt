      received CE-mark in January 2014. Its safety and efficacy has been investigated in two
      randomized First-in-Man trials in patients with stenosis or occlusion of the femoropopliteal
      (BIOLUX P-I) and infrapopliteal (BIOLUX P-II) arteries when compared to an uncoated device.

      The purpose of the BIOLUX P-III all-comers registry is to collect short and long-term
      clinical performance data on the Passeo-18 Lux DRB in the treatment of atherosclerotic
      disease in the infrainguinal arteries in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical
      practice.
