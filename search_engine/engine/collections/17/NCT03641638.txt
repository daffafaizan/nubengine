    
      First pregnant women who between the ages of 18 to 35 years old and normal thyroid function
      before pregnancy were selected. Recruit 300 pregnant women who early pregnancy (1-12 weeks of
      pregnancy) screening TPOAb positive and normal Free triiodothyronine (FT3), normal free
      thyroxine (FT4) ,Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) <4.78mIU / L as the observation group.
      They will be divided into low-level group (TPOAb at 34-102 IU/ml), medium-level group (TPOAb
      at 103-204 IU/ml), and high-level group (TPOAb>205) according to TPOAb. Recruit 100 pregnant
      women who early pregnancy (1-12 weeks of pregnancy) screening TPOAb negative and normal FT3,
      normal FT4,TSH <4.78mIU / L as the Control group.

      Thyroid function (FT3, FT4, TSH) and TPOAb, thyroglobulin antibody(TgAb) ,thyroid hormone
      receptor antibody(TRAb) will be screened in the observation group and the control group at 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months after delivery. If the mother is diagnosed with postpartum
      thyroiditis (PPT), continue to screen for thyroid function (FT3, FT4, TSH) and thyroid
      antibodies (TPOAb, TRAb, TgAb) 18 months after delivery. The correlation between the early
      pregnancy TPOAb level and postpartum thyroiditis was analyzed between the observation group
      and the control group and the observation group. It was explored whether the occurrence of
      postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) can be predicted according to the TPOAb level in the first
      trimester. And targeted maternal effective follow-up and timely intervention to treat PPT
      provide important basis.
