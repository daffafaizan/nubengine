      <20ng/ml) to those of patients with normal Vitamin D (serum level >35 ng/ml). We will focus
      on proliferation and cytokine production to myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptides and on the percentage of Th1 (IFN gamma producing
      cells) and Th17 (IL-17 producing cells) during in vitro polarization assays. Our hypothesis
      is that patients with low Vitamin D have increase proliferation to MBP and MOG and increased
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN gamma and IL-17) and that Vitamin D
      supplementation will decrease this pro-inflammatory profile.

      We will measure cognitive performance in patients with Vitamin D deficiency (serum level
      <20ng/ml) compared to those of patients with normal Vitamin D (serum level >35 ng/ml) after
      adjusting for educational levels and disease duration. We hypothesize that low Vitamin D has
      a negative effect on cognitive performance and that Vitamin D supplementation will improve
      cognitive function.
