      periodontal wound healing and prevent the increase of sensitivity of hard (teeth) and soft
      (gingiva) tissues following non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT).

      This pilot study involves a small number of participants, and while it is not designed to
      prove causation, it will evaluate safety and efficacy. If clinical results are positive,
      these data may be used to determine sample and power needs for larger studies.

      With enhanced post-operative comfort, the patient's ability to disrupt biofilm and maintain
      optimal daily oral self-care can be achieved. Biofilm disruption is paramount to achieving
      periodontal health. Specifically, the adjunctive placement of an adhesive dressing may reduce
      biofilm accumulation that is associated with periodontal inflammation. This novel application
      could improve the patient's oral and thus overall health.

      The present pilot trial aims to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of a cyanoacrylate
      adhesive (PeriAcrylÂ®90 HV) in reducing patient-reported outcomes related to discomfort and
      sensitivity post NSPT, examine their potential positive effects on periodontal wound healing
      as well as recording any potential side-effects that may have been experienced by the
      patients.
