      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device for the treatment of chronic low
      back pain. This clinical trial is a non-significant risk, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled 12-week trial involving the commercially available Empi Select TENS device
      for treating subjects with chronic (>90 days) low back pain. Multiple centers located in the
      United States will enroll approximately 300 subjects in this study. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to either the treatment group or the placebo group. The subjects and
      investigational staff are blinded to the treatment assignment. Subjects will return to the
      investigational center for follow-up assessments at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
