      intravenous (IV) fluids and medications with the potential for tissue injury. This
      prospective controlled study assessed the diagnostic utility of using intravenous diluted
      sodium bicarbonate to confirm placement of IV catheters in volunteers . Diluted sodium
      bicarbonate or 0.9% normal saline, will be injected in a randomized order while end-tidal
      carbon dioxide in the exhaled air will be monitored. The investigators hypothesize that the
      injected bicarbonate will dissolve into carbon dioxide and water and cause a transient
      increase in the measured exhaled CO2. Arbitrary increase of more than 10%in end-tidal carbon
      dioxide is considered as a positive response.

      The effect is unique to bicarbonate and will not appear once normal saline is injected. the
      safety of the administration of bicarbonate on the metabolic profile of the volunteers will
      be assessed by measurement of venous blood pH and electrolytes.
