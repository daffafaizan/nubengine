      transplantation for patients with high-risk disease. Relapse after autologous transplant is
      in part due to the persistence of residual cancer cells. Cellular immunotherapy using
      activated autologous effector cells to recognize and kill tumor targets in a minimal disease
      state after transplant is a strategy being explored to reduce relapse and improve survival.
      We hypothesize that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell-based immunotherapy can reduce the
      relapse rate after high-risk autologous stem cell transplantation by treating post-transplant
      minimal residual disease.
