      (SRM) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to prevent invasive biopsies or unnecessary surgery.
      Similarly, improved imaging methods are needed for unambiguous detection of lesions suspect
      for metastatic and relapse RCC during follow-up. Girentuximab is an antibody against Carbonic
      Anhydrase IX (CAIX), an antigen that is expressed on the cell surface of 95% of clear cell
      RCC (ccRCC). Zr-89-girentuximab PET/CT may be a valuable imaging technique in the diagnosis
      of patients with RCC. The aim of the present study is to show the impact of the
      Zr-89-girentuximab PET/CT on the clinical management of ccRCC patients. Thirty patients will
      be included in whom conventional diagnostics are inconclusive. During a multidisciplinary
      team (MDT) the hypothetical next step in the clinical process will be noted (e.g. further
      diagnostics, treatment or active surveillance). Subsequently, in these patients a
      Zirconium-89-girentuximab PET/CT will be performed. Patients will receive a single
      intravenous dose of 5 mg Zirconium-89-girentuximab (37 MBq). A PET/CT scan will be acquired 4
      or 5 days after injection. The Zirconium-89-girentuximab PET/CT will be read by a clinician
      with extensive experience in radiolabeled girentuximab imaging. The results of the PET/CT
      will be discussed during the MDT and will be used to decide what the next step in the
      clinical process will be. This step will be compared with the hypothetical next step from the
      MDT before the scan.
