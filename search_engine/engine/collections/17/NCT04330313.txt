    
      Healthy individuals without any cervical region pathology will be included in the study.
      Exclusion criterias are pregnancy or cancer, hypertension that cannot be controlled, having
      neurological symptoms, previous spinal surgery.

      Demographic information of the participants will be recorded; cervical joint range of motion
      (CROM device), muscle shortness (acromion-earlobe and occiput-wall distance measurement),
      deep cervical flexor muscle strength (Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback), cervical performance
      level (Cervical Performance Tests), muscle spasm (Palpable Muscle Spasm Scoring) will be
      evaluated. Cervical joint range of motion and muscle shortening will be repeated before and
      after each session, but other parameters will only be repeated at the beginning and the end.
