      are matching the inclusion criteria will be offered to join the study until the desired
      sample size (50) is reached. Combined cataract-iStent surgery will be performed as per the
      devices' manufacturers' instructions. Two iStent inject devices will be micro-invasively
      implanted in the trabecular meshwork of the eye during planned cataract surgery. Six
      post-operative follow-ups will be carried out over a duration of 12 months, during which
      various measurements will be made. Performance Outcomes will analyse the proportion of
      patients with IOP reduction of â‰¥ 20% vs. baseline mean IOP, at 6 and 12 months. Quality of
      life outcome will look at the improvement in perceived quality of life as expressed in the
      NEI VFQ-25 questionnaires from baseline to 3 and 12 months. The rate of adverse events will
      be recorded.
