      sarcoma, drugs that inhibit angiogenesis, such as TNP-470, may be of benefit in patients with
      the disease.

      Patients are entered at 7 escalating dose levels of TNP-470. (PER AMENDMENT 9/3/96: dose
      maximum level changed.) Four patients treated at a given dose level must receive at least 4
      weeks of therapy before escalation in subsequent cohorts proceeds. If 50 percent of patients
      at a given dose level experience dose-limiting toxicity, the previous dose is defined as the
      MTD and an additional two patients are treated at the MTD. Patients receive treatment for 12
      weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest, followed by an additional 12 weeks of treatment. Patients
      are followed for 12 weeks post-treatment.
