      increased airway hyperresponsiveness in adults (1,2). An important aspect of these
      epidemiologic data is that the impact of obesity on asthma is much stronger in females than
      males. For example, the incidence of asthma after the age of 11 years is five- to sevenfold
      higher in female children who become obese versus those who remain lean, whereas no such
      relationship exists for males (3). Recent mouse models of obesity suggest that this condition
      enhances airway responses to ozone air pollution (4). These mice eat excessively due to a
      defect in the gene encoding leptin, a satiety hormone produced in adipocytes. Shore et al (4)
      showed that these leptin-deficient obese mice had greater airway hyperreactivity to i.v.
      methacholine following ozone exposure compared to lean, wild-type mice. Furthermore,
      administration of exogenous leptin (which is actually increased in the serum of obese
      individuals (4)) was shown to enhance ozone-induced cytokine and protein release into BAL
      fluid of lean, wild type mice (4). Reduced lung volumes and altered breathing patterns in the
      obese may also contribute to enhanced airway reactivity in these patients (5). Stretch of
      airway smooth muscle during tidal breathing and especially during deep breaths, i.e. sighs,
      acts as a potent bronchodilator that might ameliorate ozone-induced bronchoconstriction. The
      increased chest load associated with obesity may also diminish tidal breathing volumes and
      frequency of sighs during ozone exposure.
