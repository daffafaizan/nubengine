      procedure compared to other thoracic surgery. However, in the anesthetic preparation,
      complicated technique and procedures are needed including a double lumen endotracheal
      intubation, auscultation, and flexible bronchoscopic confirmation of the tube location, even
      during lateral decubitus position. The double lumen endotracheal tube has a bigger outer
      diameter. And postoperative sore throat and voice change can develop after the intubation
      procedure.

      Recently, single lumen intubation using carbon dioxide gas instillation under general
      anesthesia during thoracoscopic surgery is reported. However, if safety and efficacy are
      warranted, thoracoscopic surgery using nonintubated and self-ventilated anesthesia will be a
      best solution for above mentioned postoperative discomforts.

      Investigators designed the comparative study of nonintubated local anesthesia under sedation
      and intubated general anesthesia in thoracoscopic bullectomy through the single port.
      Investigators will investigate postoperative pain, sore throat, voice change, nausea,
      vomiting, and intraoperative arterial blood gas analysis.

      This study will be performed at Korea University Ansan Hospital. A total of 40 patients will
      be enrolled (20 patients in each arm).
