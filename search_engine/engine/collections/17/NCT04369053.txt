      patterns of cell-free biomarkers in blood to detect cancer early. The purpose of this
      prospective multi-center observational study is to validate a blood-based test for the
      detection of colorectal cancer by collecting blood samples from average-risk participants who
      will undergo a routine screening colonoscopy.
