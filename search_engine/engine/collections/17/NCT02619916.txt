      Conventional therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) are frequently used for reducing these depressive symptoms in
      patients with medical conditions. However, until now evidence from proper designed randomized
      controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of both interventions in cancer survivors, is
      lacking. Therefore, our longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and
      MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in cancer survivors. In addition, potential moderators
      and mediators of each intervention will be explored.
