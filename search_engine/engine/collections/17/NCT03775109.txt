      antibody, Canakinumab (solution for injection), in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.

      ISAIAH is a multicentre, double blind, randomized (1:1), placebo controlled trial. The trial
      will follow patients up for 90 days and will be conducted in centres across the United
      Kingdom. Twenty-six patients will be recruited to each arm of the trial: total 52 patients.

      The trial will be conducted in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (mDF* ≥ 32 and MELD
      ≤27) with treatment initiated during an index hospital admission with the condition.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is histological improvement of alcoholic hepatitis on liver
      biopsy after 28 days of treatment compared to baseline. Histological improvement is defined
      as a reduction in lobular inflammation (regardless of cell type).

      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized and treated. A single dose of 3
      mg/kg Canakinumab or identical placebo will be administered intravenously at baseline (Day
      1). Canakinumab will be made up by dilution in 100 ml 5% Dextrose by an unblinded research
      personnel at each site.

      Patients with AST >2 x ULN on Day 28 will receive a second dose of 3 mg/kg study drug
      administered i.v. on Day 28. Patients who received placebo on baseline will receive placebo.
      Patients who received canakinumab on baseline will receive canakinumab.

      Total follow up time for each patient is 90 days.
