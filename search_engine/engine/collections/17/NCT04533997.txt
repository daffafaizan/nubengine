    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of all consecutive patients with
      decompensated heart failure and signs of volume overload who do not require hospital
      admission but require intravenous diuretic for relief of congestion.

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria, with prior informed consent, will be randomized to
      treatment with furosemide with hypertonic saline versus isolated furosemide (control group).

      Complete clinical evaluation, echocardiography, and blood and urinary tests will be performed
      before the treatment. After 3 hours, diuresis volume, weight and urinary parameters will be
      evaluated. Efficacy and safety visits will be performed at 7 and 30 days.
