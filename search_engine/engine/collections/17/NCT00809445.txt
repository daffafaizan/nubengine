    
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which individuals receiving drug abuse
      treatment will be recruited to participate in a multi-center HIV testing and counseling
      study. The purpose of this study is to assess the relative effectiveness of three HIV testing
      strategies on increasing receipt of HIV test results: (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with
      brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling, (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with
      information only, and (3) referral for off-site HIV testing. The study will also assess the
      effectiveness of the three testing strategies in reducing HIV sexual risk behaviors.
      Injection drug risk behavior will be a secondary outcome. Participants will complete a
      baseline assessment to report their demographics, HIV testing history and sexual and
      drug-using risk behaviors, and will be randomized to one of three groups. At one month
      post-randomization, participants will complete a follow-up assessment to determine whether or
      not they received their HIV test results. At six months post-randomization, participants will
      complete a follow-up assessment to assess any changes in their HIV sexual risk behaviors.
