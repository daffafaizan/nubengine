      children attending schools with and without school-based vaccination programs. Eight schools
      (4455 students) in two school districts matched for size, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
      status, and location will serve as intervention and control schools. During influenza season
      defined by local surveillance data, nasal/throat swabs will be obtained for rapid influenza
      detection assays from all children with fever and respiratory symptoms identified by teachers
      for evaluation in the school nurse's office. Absent children will be offered testing at a
      central location within the schools' communities.Rates of confirmed influenza illness in
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated children will be compared between schools with and without
      vaccination programs. Rates of absenteeism also will be evaluated. The investigators
      hypothesize that in addition to lowering rates of influenza in vaccinated children, raising
      vaccination rates by 30-40% through school-based vaccination programs will decrease incidence
      of influenza in non-vaccinated children attending those schools compared to non-vaccinated
      children in schools with low vaccination rates.
