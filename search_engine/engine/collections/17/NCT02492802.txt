      Groningen, the Netherlands using longitudinal data collection. The design of the study will
      be that patients starting on posaconazole treatment will be evaluated. After informed consent
      is obtained medical data will be collected from the medical chart. Posaconazole plasma
      concentration (trough levels) and inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein) will be
      determined in all samples available from routine analysis (often daily). This will result in
      a detailed data set capturing day to day variations in inflammation and drug concentrations.
