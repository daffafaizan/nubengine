      and test a novel arm restraint in older critically ill mechanically ventilated patients that
      may increase mobility; reduce agitation, use of sedative medications, and delirium; and
      exhibit high satisfaction and acceptability among hospital staff, family members, and
      patients. Older mechanically ventilated patients are often immobilized with wrist restraints
      to prevent self-extubation and are sedated to reduce agitation caused by their restraints and
      endotracheal (breathing) tube. This sedation and immobility lead to complications, including
      delirium and muscle weakness, that are independently associated with long term cognitive
      impairment, reduced physical functioning, and mortality. Specifically, the incidence and
      duration of delirium in the ICU are strongly and independently associated with long-term
      cognitive impairment that is similar to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.

      Healthy Design has developed a novel restraint device that allows arm mobility but prohibits
      hands from reaching oral/nasal endotracheal and feeding tubes or intravenous lines. Because
      it permits mobility, the novel restraint may reduce agitation and the need for sedatives. The
      objectives of this pilot study are to evaluate the novel restraint in 8 older mechanically
      ventilated patients to demonstrate that 1) the revised novel restraint prototype is safe and
      2) a future RCT is feasible.
