        -  Compare overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma
           multiforme treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by temozolomide and
           irinotecan with historical controls from the RTOG database.

        -  Determine the short- and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.
           Concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily, 7 days a
           week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Post-radiotherapy chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 and oral temozolomide
           once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 157 patients will be accrued for this study within 11 months.
