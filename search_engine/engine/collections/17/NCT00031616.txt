        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of NB1011 in patients with
           fluoropyrimidine-resistant metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive NB1011 IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NB1011 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Additional patients receive NB1011 at the MTD as in phase I. Patients are
           followed at day 30 and then for 5 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study. A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
