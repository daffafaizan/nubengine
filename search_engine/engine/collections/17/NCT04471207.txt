      Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective, evidence-based treatment for PTSD; however,
      approximately one-quarter of patients drop out prematurely and one-third who do complete
      treatment remain symptomatic. The proposed study will employ a randomized clinical trial
      (N=40 treatment-seeking veterans with current PTSD) to evaluate the acceptability and
      preliminary efficacy of IB-PE and investigate predictors of outcome by accomplishing the
      following milestones: (1a) Evaluate ability of IB-PE (therapist guided vs. record only) in
      reducing PTSD severity from baseline to end of treatment; and (2b) Use a variety of in vivo
      exposures (IVEs) to identify biometric and behavioral indicators (high heart rate, skin
      conductance) with high predictive value of treatment response. We will use a system of
      discrete wearables (camera, microphone) to allow the therapist to accompany a participant on
      an IVE (e.g: walk through a crowded building). The system will pair with a cellular
      application, and will record information such as heart rate and skin conductance. This system
      will also allow the participant to communicate with the study therapist during this guided
      exercise.
