      7th April until 1st June 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Appendix A). Our study
      aims to evaluate the impact of social distancing and lockdowns during this circuit breaker
      period on our patients with obesity, either post-metabolic surgery (MS) or undergoing active
      medical management (MM), during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Results will help inform
      and address the challenges in patient care that this pandemic has brought to light, its
      long-term implications on the management of the bariatric patient and discuss potential
      strategies for the management of a bariatric patient in a post COVID-19 society. To the
      knowledge of this paper, this is the first study to compare the impact of COVID on MS and MM
      patients which will allow understanding of unique stressors faced by MS patients

      This study adopted a cross-sectional survey design to evaluate the impact of lockdown social
      distancing measures on obese patients in Singapore. The study conducted either face-to-face
      questionnaires in the clinic after lockdown for those who were not suitable for video
      consultation or questionnaires administered via telecommunication channels such as WhatsApp
