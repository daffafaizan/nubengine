      of venous ulcers in patients with venous insufficiency. In a simple-blind controlled clinical
      study, 20 subjects with venous ulcers with age over 50 years will be divided in two
      groups:neuromuscular electrical stimulation(n=10) and control group (n=10). Pain (by Visual
      Analogue Scale) and the ulcer area (by planimetry on graph paper and the software ImageJ Â®)
      were measured.
