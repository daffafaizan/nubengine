    
      Percentage of primary responders who haven't lost response to biotherapies during follow-up
      (anti-TNF, ustekinumab, vedolizumab).

      Response to treatment will be evaluated using objective criteria for measuring intestinal
      inflammation: endoscopic remission (endoscopic biopsy and surgical specimens), radiological
      (MRI), and / or biological (CRP, fecal calprotectin) .

      Response to therapy rates will be correlated with genomic, epigenomic, and microbiota data
      stratified by major environmental factors (nutrition, tobacco, physical activity).
