      surgery in a single center on the day of the surgery in the operating room before intravenous
      fluid application started. Each patient receives systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for
      gramnegative and anaerobic bacteria on induction of anesthesia and prior to skin incision. A
      standardized protocol for general and epidural anesthesia is used. Values of WBC count, CRP,
      PCT, CD64n and HLA-DR monocyte are recorded before surgery and after surgery on POD
      (postoperative day) 1, 3 and 6 or 7. SIRS criteria on POD 1, 3, 6 or 7 and postoperative
      infections up to 30 days after surgery are recorded. SSIs (incisional, organ / space),
      pneumonia, central venous catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), urinary tract
      infections (UTIs) and enterocolitis records are taken. Microbial cultures are using as the
      gold standard. Criteria for SIRS reconsidered in the year 2001 by SCCM / ESICM / ACCP / ATS /
      SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference and criteria for Dosage Control and
      Prevention (CDC) are taken into consideration. After discharge, each patient is being
      monitored by outpatient clinic examinations. The study will recruit approximately 100
      patients during three consecutive years.
