      healthy volunteers:

        -  To capture antibiotic residues in the colon without interfering with its systemic
           pharmacokinetics.

        -  To prevent antibiotic-induced changes of the intestinal microbiota. In addition, the
           security of DAV132 given at different dose regimens during 7 days will be evaluated.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, repeated doses, 12 parallel groups, open-label
      study, blinded to analytical and microbiological evaluations.
