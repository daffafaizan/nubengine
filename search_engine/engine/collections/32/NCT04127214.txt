      inpatient and day hospital care. The routine assessment implemented to this aim includes both
      general measures to gauge the therapeutic progress (CORE system) and measures specific for
      eating disorders (EAT, BITE), which are administered from the beginning to the end of
      treatment in different time points combined with clinical data included in the patients'
      health record such as diagnosis, body mass index, previous treatments, and chronicity.

      According to its naturalistic nature, this study will accept all participants who are
      admitted into the care system offered by "ITA salud mental" between November 2, 2017 and
      October, 2nd., 2020, meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and signing informed consent (n
      = 800 is an estimation). These patients will be followed on three-week bases until October,
      30th., 2020, and less intensively on three-month bases until October 2025 to monitor symptoms
      and to record possible adverse effects.

      The analysis of these data will permit to evaluate the therapeutic effects of this integrated
      treatment and the factors which might influence the outcomes.
