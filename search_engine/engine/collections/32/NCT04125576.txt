      neuropathic pain causes chronic disabilities that is often difficult to treat effectively.

      To study changes in the pain network associated with neuropathic pain, magnetic resonance
      imaging(MRI) will be used to evaluate cerebral blood volume(CBV) in patients who was injuried
      by burn. Over the fifty participants will be recruited. The participants will be comprised 30
      subjects with neuropathic pain caused by thermal injury and 20 healthy contols. The 30
      patients with neuropathic pain will be comprised divided into 15 electrical injury group and
      15 non-electrical burn injury group. The patients are included the patients with severe
      neuropathic pain that is rated at least 5 on the visual analogue scale (VAS), despite
      treatments with gabapentin medication and other physical modalities. The intensity of
      neuropathic pain will be measured using the visual analogue scale(VAS). Depressive mood will
      be assessed using the Beck Depression Scale. CBV maps will be compared between burn patients
      and controls. And the relationship between individual participant CBV(measured in voxels),
      BDS and VAS score will be also examined.
