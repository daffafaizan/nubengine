    
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the presence of Pg in the mouth of edentulous pre-eruption and
      then teething infants.

      Over a 9-month period 15 normal babies will be recruited for a prospective pilot study from
      Creighton University students. Cotton swabs of the tongue mucosa and dental plaque will be
      made to detect the presence of Pg by DNA analysis.

      Specific Aim 2. To determine the daily temperature of infants. Daily child temperatures will
      be recorded by the parent. Specific Aim 3. To measure the thickness of the radial artery
      using a 50 MHz ultrasound probe.

      A 50 MHz ultrasound scan will be made by a trained dental hygienist of the left radial artery
      at an initial visit and at 3-monthly intervals to measure IMT.
