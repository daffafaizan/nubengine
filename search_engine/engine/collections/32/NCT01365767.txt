      early debut. It requires continuous evaluation with either endoscopy, Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) or Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE). These methods
      are either expensive, invasive or with uses radiation. Therefore UltraSound (US), as a cheap,
      fast and well tolerated examination of the small bowel are tested against the the validated
      MRI examination of the small bowel. Both examinations are using intra venous (i.v.) contrast
      agents. Obtained results are compared to disease activity.

      Hypothesis is, that dynamic US is comparable to dynamic MRI and therefore should be the first
      examination of choice in evaluating patients with CD.

      This study is a pilot study only.
