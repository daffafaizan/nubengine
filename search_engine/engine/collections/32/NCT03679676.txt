      proven allergies to 2 or 3 different foods in which one must be peanut. The total population
      will be 110 participants, ages 6 to 25 years that present with a history of multiple food
      allergies of 2 or 3 different foods including peanut, food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels,
      and positive skin prick test (SPT).

      Enrolled participants must react positively during DBPCFCs at or before the 300 mg (444 mg
      cumulative) dosing level of FA proteins of 2 or 3 allergens in which one must be a peanut.

      There will be three study cohorts, all will be double blinded:

      Cohort A (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks
      of treatment with placebo. Cohort B (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8
      weeks, followed by 24 weeks of treatment with dupilumab. Cohort C (10 participants) will be
      treated with placebo for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks treatment with dupilumab. All cohorts
      will receive multifood allergen oral immunotherapy.
