      IgEs in patients attended at the C.H. of the School of Medicine - Botucatu/UNESP. Thirty
      adult patients with AIDS were analyzed in the use of HAART, aged 42 ±11 years, 14 (46.7%)
      male, excluding those that had used anthelminthics 30 days prior to collection. Socioeconomic
      questionaires were applied and 3 samples of feces were taken for parasitological exams
      (TF-test® method) and 5 ml of blood for counting eosinophils (automated hematological
      counter, Pentra 80, ABX) and IgE doses (equipment BN-100, Dade-Behring). The index of
      parasites was 10%, with E.nana (3.3%), E.coli (3.3%) and B.hominis (3.3%). Parasitized
      individuals were from an urban region with complete basic sanitation and good socioeconomic
      level. Normal eosinphil values were found in all samples and increased IgE values in 1
      (33.3%) sample. The index of parasites was low due to good socioeconomic level and disease
      control. Augmented IgE levels corroborate the literature, which reports an increase
      characteristic of immune response in the face of parasitic infections in individuals with HIV
      or AIDS. In conclusion, new studies should be undertaken to evaluate the level of eosinophils
      associated with cytokines to obtain a better understanding of this correlation.
