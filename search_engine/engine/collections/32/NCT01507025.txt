      (LASIK). Although estimates of the incidence of dry eye syndrome vary widely, from 3% to 59%,
      almost all patients will have transient dry eye during the immediate postoperative
      period.Because of the variability in corneal innervation patterns, altering flap
      characteristics in LASIK may affect postoperative corneal sensation and dry-eye disease. Some
      studies have reported that postoperative corneal sensation may be higher and recovery faster
      in eyes with horizontal flaps (nasal- or temporal-hinge) than in eyes with vertical flaps
      (superior- hinge). However, some other studies have not established an association between
      corneal sensation and hinge position. This study reviewed the published literature and
      performed a meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of hinge location on corneal
      sensation and dry-eye symptoms after LASIK.
