      to effectively breastfeeding because of problems with latch and suction generation. Previous
      studies have demonstrated how nipple pain is directly linked to ankyloglossia, but most of
      these studies are done with poor methodology.

      Clinically, tongue-tie and lip-tie have correlate with numerous other symptoms besides nipple
      pain. These babies tend to be inefficient nursers, which can affect weight gain. Abnormal
      intake of air because of the poor latch/seal can lead to reflux symptoms. Finally, there is a
      significant psychological toll on mothers who want to breastfeed but cannot do so.

      This study aims to prospectively analyze these outcomes by using validated tools.
