      tissue zone is the vertical dimension change measured from the free gingival margin to the
      mid crest labially, the bone zone is the hard tissues measured from the crestal bone towards
      the apex(Chu et al., 2012). The concept of the dual zone aims to maintain the hard, soft
      tissue volume and the blood clot where the grafting material act as a scaffold containing
      them and this will enhance the initial healing compared to the classic protocol of bone
      filling till the buccal bone level(Chu et al., 2012). A recent study claims that the
      xenograft particles can be successfully incorporated within the soft tissue without
      inflammation enhancing the soft tissue profile(Araujo and Lindhe, 2005). The temporary
      restoration has shown socket sealing property which protect and contain the blood clot and
      the graft material enhancing healing,thus filling the gap without involvement of the soft
      tissue has been the rational for immediate implant placement(Trimpou G, Weigl P, Krebs M,
      2010).The main benefit of the dual zone concept is maintaining the blood supply from the
      periosteum and endosteum producing maximum healing potential with preserving the soft tissue
      stability by filling the soft tissue zone with bone graft in addition to immediate
      temporization acting as socket seal(Chu et al., 2012).
