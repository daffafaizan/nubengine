      consecutive patients with coronary lesion candidate for FFR assessment. The study aim to
      assess the differences, if any, in FFR measurements made by the OptoWire Deux FFR guidewire
      by comparison of simultaneous data of two different OptoWire DeuxTM guidewires (group 1,
      n=30). In addition, The investigators will compare (group 2, n=15) the FFR measurements
      obtained from an OptoWire Deux FFR guidewire and compare it to the FFR measurement by a
      VERRATA-TM guidewire to assess coronary stenosis in the routine clinical practice. The
      clinical investigation will be conducted in the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de
      Montréal (CHUM). No clinical follow-up is requested after the end of the procedure.
