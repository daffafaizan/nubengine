    
      The objective of this study is to obtain implant survival and outcome data on the Stafit
      Acetabular System by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs, and adverse event
      records.

      Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility, dislocation rate and implant survival, and to
      confirm the long-term safety and performance of the Stafit Acetabular System in primary total
      hip arthroplasty.

      The study design is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, consecutive cohort post
      market clinical follow-up study, involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in total hip
      arthroplasty procedures and experienced with the Stafit Acetabular System.
