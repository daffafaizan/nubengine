      rate of 150 ml/hr starting 2 hours prior to procedure, and continued during and after
      procedure to complete 24 hours (aggressive hydration) or LRS at a rate calculated by the
      Holliday-Segar method given peri-procedurally as described earlier (standard hydration).
      Visual analog scale, serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urine analysis were
      assessed prior to procedure and 24 hours after. The primary endpoint was post ERCP
      pancreatitis defined as new or increased epigastric pain persisting for â‰¥24 hours, elevation
      of amylase or lipase >3 times the upper limit of normal.
