      form by cytochrome system in the liver. Both facts could lead to lower efficacy of the drug
      in hemodynamically unstable patients, where splanchnic and liver hypoperfusion is present. We
      hypothesised that clopidogrel efficacy is insufficient in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction and severe hemodynamic instability. Therefore we would like to compare the effect
      of clopidogrel in unstable STEMI patients on mechanical ventilation with stable STEMI
      patients.
