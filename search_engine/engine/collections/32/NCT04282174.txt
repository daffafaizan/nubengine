      based on their disease, stage of disease, and dose of radiation accumulated in the course of
      treatment. Approximately twenty-four to forty-eight hours after completion of each
      conditioning regimen, patients will receive a transplant of a CD34+ progenitor cell-enriched,
      T-cell depleted fraction of GCSF-mobilized PBSC after fractionation on the CliniMACS device,
      from his/her HLA compatible donor. Due to stringent T-cell depletion, no significant
      Graft-versus-host disease is anticipated. Should Graft-versus-host disease occur, standard
      treatment would be initiated per the Transplant Service guidelines.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the potential of T-cell depleted Haploidentical Stem
      Cell Transplant fractionated by the CliniMACS system, when administered for disease targeted
      cytoreductive regimens, to secure consistent engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution in
      HLA-compatible related or unrelated hosts, and to prevent or abrogate acute and chronic forms
      of Graft-versus-host disease. This study seeks to validate that these pre-transplant
      conditioning regimens, when administered with a CD34+ progenitor cell enriched, T-cell
      depleted graft, fractionated in the CliniMACS system, will be associated with a low incidence
      of non-leukemic mortality.

      The sample size is as follows:

      Regimen A: Hyperfractionated Total Body Irradiation/Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide: 100 patients
      Regimen B: Busulfan/Melphalan/Fludarabine: 100 patients It is anticipated that the accrual
      will last five years. Patients will be followed for two years following transplantation.
