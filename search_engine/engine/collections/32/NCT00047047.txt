    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-AAG (tanespimycin) when given on
      days 1 and 8 of every 3 weeks cycle in combination with Gemzar (gemcitabine hydrochloride)
      and CDDP (cisplatin) (cohorts A, B, and E).

      II. To determine the MTD of 17-AAG plus Gemzar when Gemzar is given on days 1 and 8 and
      17-AAG is given on days 2 and 9 every 3 weeks (cohort C).

      III. To determine the MTD of 17-AAG plus CDDP when given on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks
      (cohort D).

      IV. To define the dose-limiting toxicity of 17-AAG when used in combination with Gemzar and
      CDDP.

      V. To assess the effect of 17-AAG on surrogate markers when used in combination with Gemzar
      and CDDP.

      VI. To report any responses observed.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts.

      Cohort A (closed to accrual as of 3/2/04)*: Patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, tanespimycin IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin
      IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. NOTE: *The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this 3-drug
      combination has been determined as of 3/2/04.

      Cohort B (closed to accrual as of 3/2/05): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride** IV
      over 30 minutes, tanespimycin IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin** IV over 2 hours on days 1 and
      8.

      Cohort C: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride** IV over 30 minutes and tanespimycin IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 2 and 9.

      Cohort D: Patients receive cisplatin** IV over 2 hours and tanespimycin IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 1 and 8.

      Cohort E: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride***, tanespimycin***, and cisplatin*** as
      in cohort B.

      In all cohorts, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.

      NOTE: **Gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin dosage is constant, while 17-AAG is escalated
      in cohorts B, C, and D.

      NOTE: ***Gemcitabine hydrochloride dosage is constant, 17-AAG is started at a higher dose
      level than all other cohorts, and cisplatin dosage is escalated in cohort E.
