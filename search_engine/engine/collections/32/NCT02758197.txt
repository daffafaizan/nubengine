      medical treatment, some survivors continue to experience disabling pain. In our recent survey
      with cancer survivors, we found that the capacity to be aware of different aspects of one's
      day-to-day experiences, without judgment or reactivity (i.e., being mindful) predicted
      decreased pain intensity, pain related disability, and increased health-related quality of
      life among cancer survivors with CNP. Building on these findings, the present randomized
      controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of an online Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) program for cancer survivors with moderate to severe CNP. The program will
      benefit patients in rural and remote regions and patients with mobility issues.

      We will recruit 100 cancer survivors. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a
      pain specialist. Additionally, they will complete an 8-week online MBSR program. We
      hypothesize that the online MBSR program will result in less pain perception, better function
      and increased health-related quality of life. We will also examine the effects of the MBSR
      training on biomarkers of stress and immune function.
