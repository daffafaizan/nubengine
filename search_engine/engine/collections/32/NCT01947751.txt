    
      The aim of this study is to compare the strategy of immediate removal of the catheter with a
      conservative strategy in resolution of infection in patients with sepsis or septic shock
      without a defined origin. The investigators intend to demonstrate that the conservative
      strategy can reduce the rate of unnecessary catheter removal, without increasing morbidity.

      In the intervention group the investigators will adopt the conservative strategy, changing
      the CVC after the confirmation of infection related to it or non-improvement of sepsis. The
      control group is represented by the patients in whom the CVC is removed early.
