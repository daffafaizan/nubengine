      aprepitant, can block opiate reward in non-dependent opiate experienced volunteers in
      response to a standard opiate challenge. Sixty subjects will be included in a randomized
      controlled study. Following a training challenge session, they will receive 1 week treatment
      with aprepitant or matching placebo, followed by a challenge session during which subjective
      and physiological responses to the opiate partial agonist buprenorphine will be assessed.
