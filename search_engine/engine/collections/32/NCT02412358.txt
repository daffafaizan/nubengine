      periodontally healthy individuals. At baseline professional plaque removal and oral hygiene
      instruction are performed for all the students, then they are asked to avoid brushing for 1-2
      days. Thereafter plaque and gingivitis scores are measured using plaque and gingival indices
      (PI and GI). Then subjects are instructed to use Pulsar tooth brush for a two-week period and
      then, GI and PI indices are assessed again. After passing one-week period for wash out,
      subjects don't brush for 1-2 days and indices are recorded again. The same procedure are done
      for Cross action, and Butler 411 tooth brushes respectively.
