      to objectively measure pharyngeal collapse patterns in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during
      sedation as well as natural sleep. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of HRM
      in objectively mapping patterns of pharyngeal collapse observed during drug-induced sleep
      endoscopy (DISE). Quantifying pharyngeal collapse patterns that occur during sedation and in
      natural sleep may significantly impact the selection and success of surgical treatments, as
      well as surgical outcome assessment.
