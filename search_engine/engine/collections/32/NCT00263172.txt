      address this issue on a broad scale. The internet holds promise as a way to disseminate
      effective weight loss strategies. The primary purpose of this study was to compare weight
      loss achieved through a behavioral online intervention vs. a commercial self-help website. A
      second aim was to evaluate the utilization of web components and their relationship to weight
      loss between groups and within groups in order to determine what aspects of web usage
      correlate to weight loss.
