      as well as to collect recommendations for changes to the app itself (appendix one). For this
      Vanguard phase study, the survey for participants will be designed to assess the usability of
      the app (ease of use in general, ease of capturing fluid intake data, including the choice of
      preselected volumes for fluid containers, reasons for not using the app more frequently, the
      usefulness of the app notifications, ease of sending data to the study coordinator for
      review). The survey for the study coordinator will be designed to assess the ease of
      reviewing data from participants and the perceived difficulty of patient use of the app.
