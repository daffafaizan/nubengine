    
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in innate immune cell
      recognition of foreign pathogens, stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. TransCon
      TLR7/8 Agonist is designed as a long-acting localized delivery prodrug of resiquimod, a
      potent toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist, with the potential to prolong high local
      concentrations of resiquimod and promote potent anti-tumoral responses while reducing
      systemic drug exposure and related adverse events. TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is expected to
      stimulate innate and adaptive immune response in the tumor microenvironment and enhance the
      activity of checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab.
