      neurological disability. FRDA is the consequence of frataxin deficiency. Although several
      drugs have been proposed for FRDA, there is no available treatment. Recently it was shown
      that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhu-EPO) administration increases frataxin expression
      in cultured human lymphocytes of FRDA patients. It is therefore of primary importance to test
      extensively rhu-EPO's ability in increasing frataxin levels in-vitro and in-vivo. In addition
      rhu-EPO is an already available and commercialized drug approved for the treatment of anaemia
      associated with chronic renal disease, heart failure and cancer. Towards this overall
      purpose, we will perform an acute clinical trial in FRDA patients with rhu-EPO and will
      assess its effect in-vivo on frataxin expression. In addition, rhu-EPO's safety in FRDA
      patients based on laboratory parameters and neurological indexes will be tested. The results
      will be useful to gain new insight in the role of rhu-EPO in FRDA, and in the future, it may
      be useful to plan further clinical trials.
