      chemotherapy treatment. Peripheral neuropathy often causes weakness, numbness and pain,
      usually in the hands and feet. It can also affect other areas of the body. People with
      peripheral neuropathy generally describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling.

      Acupuncture is a technique that may treat symptoms by inserting very thin, solid, sterile,
      stainless steel needles into the skin at specific points. Research has shown that acupuncture
      can reduce symptoms of pain and nausea by altering pain signaling along nerves. The effect of
      acupuncture can be enhanced by additional movement of the needles called manual acupuncture,
      which involves rotating the needle and moving it up and down. Another type of acupuncture is
      called electro-acupuncture, which involves running a low level electrical current between two
      needle points. Preliminary studies indicate that acupuncture may also be helpful to treat
      chemotherapy related neuropathy. This trial will determine the relative effects of both
      manual acupuncture and electro-acupuncture for treating chronic chemotherapy-induced
      neuropathy.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: 1) manual acupuncture twice a week for 20
      treatments or 2) electro-acupuncture twice a week for 20 treatments. Multiple assessments
      will be performed at baseline and approximately every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks while
      subjects are on study.
