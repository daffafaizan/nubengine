      acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Participating children will be randomized to receive either
      acetaminophen or ibuprofen administered as needed per parental decision for fever and
      analgesia. This study will address which is the most appropriate antipyretic-analgesic
      medication in young children with asthma, and will inform both clinicians and parents seeking
      to treat children with fever and pain. Given the high frequency of administration of these
      drugs, this study will have a significant impact on pediatric healthcare regardless of
      whether a differential effect is discovered as significant uncertainty currently exists as to
      whether acetaminophen use is associated with increased asthma symptoms.
