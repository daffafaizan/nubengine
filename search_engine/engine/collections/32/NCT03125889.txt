      resection system that utilizes a high-velocity saline stream to resect and remove prostate
      tissue in males suffering from LUTS due to BPH. The AQUABEAM System is intended for the
      resection and removal of prostate tissue in patients experiencing lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS).The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance
      of obtaining hemostasis with catheters following prostate resection using AQUABEAM for the
      treatment of LUTS resulting from BPH. Up to 50 participants will be included in the trial at
      one clinical study site. All patients will be followed up for 30 days for safety assessment
      prior to study exit. The trial is a single-arm prospective, interventional clinical trial.
