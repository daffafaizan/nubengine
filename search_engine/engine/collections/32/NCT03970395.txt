      external forces that mould the skull during the first months of life.

      Four months seems to be a critical age for the development of NSP, but many positional head
      shape deformities may improve with time.

      Early assessment and diagnosis is important not only for the shape of the skull, but also for
      possible clinical significant differences in gross motor development.

      In paediatric conditions the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment is documented in
      systematic reviews; in NSP the only study, which is a pilot, reveals an average reduction of
      50% asymmetry on 12 infants who have undergone a course of four osteopathic treatments.
