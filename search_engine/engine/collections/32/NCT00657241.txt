      guidelines mandate the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers in most patients at
      significant risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. There is also continuing interest
      in combining angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACE inhibitors in hypertension based
      on the unsubstantiated belief that "more complete" renin-angiotensin system inhibition is
      desirable. It is more attractive physiologically to combine a long-acting β-blocker with
      vasodilatory actions (Coreg CR) with an ACE inhibitor because this combination addresses more
      directly the two fundamental hemodynamic changes needed to reduce CVD events: lowering
      systolic BP (afterload) and lowering heart rate; the product of the two is a reliable
      surrogate for reduced cardiac work. In fact, clinical trial data suggest that there is no
      appreciable additional BP lowering when ARBs are added to ACE inhibitors and neither class
      lowers heart rate. The present proposal is designed to demonstrate the superior
      "cardioprotection" of Coreg CR compared to ARB (valsartan) when each is added to background
      ACE inhibitor therapy. Principal dependent variables include ambulatory cardiac work (24-hour
      mean ambulatory systolic BP x heart rate) and laboratory stress responses (central systolic
      time-tension indices derived from arterial tonometry pre- and post-bicycle exercise).
      Secondary hemodynamic variables will define changes in flow and pressure (e.g. central
      systolic BP and forward and reflected pressure wave estimations).
