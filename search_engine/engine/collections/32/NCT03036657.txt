      ulnar nerves in patients with median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), using
      nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative sensory testing (QST) as outcomes. Our
      secondary aim is to compare acupuncture's effect on the functioning of a diseased nerve
      (median nerve in CTS) to its effect on a healthy nerve (ulnar). Additionally, we aim to
      compare the local, nerve-specific effect of manual acupuncture to that of low-frequency
      electroacupuncture and of high-frequency electroacupuncture.

      In a mechanistic study of acupuncture, 60 subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) will be
      randomized to manual acupuncture (MA), low-frequency electroacupuncture (LF-EA) and
      high-frequency electroacupuncture (HF-EA) groups. Baseline measurements will consist of QST
      (vibration and cold detection thresholds), as well as NCS of both median and ulnar nerves.
      Then, each group will undergo acupuncture to the median nerve (Pericardium channel points)
      and to the ulnar nerve (Heart channel points), one week apart, order counterbalanced,
      followed by post-acupuncture NCS and QST measurements in both nerves' territories.
