      dissection through its entry point is still the gold standard in prevention of the nerve
      injury and to decrease the RLN palsy rate. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) has also so
      many benefits to search, identify and dissect the nerve through its course during thyroid
      surgery and especially the most important benefit of the IONM is to have real time
      information about the function of the RLN. Most of the endocrine surgeons use the
      inferolateral approach for RLN identification under the guidance of the IONM in the recent
      years. However after the definition of the transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular
      approach (TOETVA) technique, the approach to the RLN have to be changed to craniocaudal
      approach in which a way that most of the surgeons are not familiar with. The different
      approaches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve depend on the indications and on the surgeon's
      habit. Several approaches exist such as the superior approach ,the lateral approach, and the
      inferior approach.
