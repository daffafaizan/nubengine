      prevent arrhythmic deaths. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) events with frequent ICD
      interventions in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients is encountered frequently. Frequents ICD
      interventions is associated with worse outcomes. Anti-arrhythmic drugs ,mostly amiodarone,
      are given prevent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD interventions that may not be curative.
      Ablation of ventricular tachycardia is the suggested treatment when anti-drugs are without
      effect. After ablation of ventricular arrhythmia the continuation of amiodarone is not well
      elucidated.

      In this study we aimed to enroll ischemic cardiomyopathy patients having frequent ICD
      interventions despite medical treatment. VT ablation is performed and patients divided into
      two groups; group one continues having amiodarone after ablation, group two does not have
      amiodarone after ablation. Both groups will be compared in terms of recurrence and death.
