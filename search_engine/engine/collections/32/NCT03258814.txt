      product label and local standard of care. AxSpA patients who responded to newly initialized
      adalimumab treatment based on physicians' decision, and who were eligible for active
      physiotherapy were enrolled in the study. Although this was a non-interventional study,
      participants were randomly assigned to receive either active supervised and standardized
      training physiotherapy or standard of care physiotherapy in order to provide adequate numbers
      of participants in each comparison group.

      Participants who consented to participate in the study were observed for up to 12 months from
      Baseline (defined as the Randomization visit where participants were assigned to one of the
      two physiotherapy options).
