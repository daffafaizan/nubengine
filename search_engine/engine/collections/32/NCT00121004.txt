      which offers a limited trial of life-sustaining therapy in non-terminal illness, declines
      life-sustaining therapy or artificial nutrition in advanced dementia, or declines
      life-sustaining therapy in general. Advance directives (ADs) as currently drafted have been
      questioned since they have not had much effect on end-of-life care. However, the reason for
      the lack of success may be simply that they rarely apply. Traditional ADs, which are limited
      to terminal illness or persistent vegetative states, are difficult to apply to the more
      common cases of critical illness in the setting of potentially reversible disease and
      advanced dementia, which are often not recognized as terminal. In addition, terminal ADs are
      drafted too narrowly for patients who do not wish for life-sustaining therapy regardless of
      condition.

      Patients may execute either AD at the conclusion of the survey. This research has the
      potential to demonstrate widely reproducible methods on which more precise advance planning
      can be based and thereby improve end-of-life care.
