      Will EMT affectively reduce state anxiety and time distortion in patients receiving radiation
      therapy for cancer and in their personal caregivers during their time in the radiation
      oncology department waiting room? The purpose of this study is to (a) rate the patients level
      of anxiety and discomfort prior to radiation therapy as experienced in the waiting area, (b)
      determine if the following music psychotherapy protocol moderates baseline anxiety related to
      their treatment experience and (c) evaluate how an environmental music therapy protocol
      affects the subjects' perception of the amount of they have waited before treatment measured
      against the actual amount of time they have waited.

      Hypothesis:

      EMT will reduce state anxiety and time distortion for cancer patients and their personal
      caregivers in the radiation oncology waiting room.

      The current study will focus on effects of music therapy on 160 patients and their
      caregivers, who are randomly assigned to two groups. All patients with cancer who receive
      radiation and who are waiting for radiation therapy in the waiting room are eligible, with
      the exception of those patients who are not fluent in English. Enrolled participants will
      complete the abridged State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Wong-Baker faces scale pre and
      post EMT or no EMT. The music therapist will provide prescribed live patient-preferred music
      in conjunction with the patients' culture, past medical history, past trauma, and assessment
      of psychological stressors to be observed and expressed prior to radiation, as they wait in
      the waiting room. The live music used will provide an anchor and suggest inter-relationship
      possibilities amongst patients and their caregivers during the EMT sessions.
