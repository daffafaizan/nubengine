    
      This is a prospective, randomized , controlled, open-label, single-center study to evaluate
      the effect of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin on coronary thin-cap fibroatheroma(TCFA). After
      successful coronary angiography and OCT examination, patients with TCFAs in non-culprit,
      mild-to-moderate stenotic lesions will be enrolled. Then, they will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either atorvastatin (20 mg/day) alone or atorvastatin (20 mg/day）plus
      ezetimibe（10 mg/day）by envelope method.

      Angiographic and OCT follow-up will be scheduled for the target vessel after 12 months.The
      primary efficacy endpoint is the change in minimum fibrous cap thickness measured by OCT from
      baseline to follow-up.The secondary endpoints include absolute and percent changes in the
      lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory profile. Then, changes of these indicators above will be
      compared respectively in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
