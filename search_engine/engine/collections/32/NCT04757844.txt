      attentional focus. They will walk on 30 m five times in each of the four different focus
      conditions :1) no instructions about the attentional focus 2) internal focus on their feet
      movements, 3) external focus on two lines drawn on the floor, 4) divided attention (walking
      while performing an arithmetic task). A fNIRS system will be used for the prefrontal cortex
      activation evaluation and FeetMe soles for gait analyses.
