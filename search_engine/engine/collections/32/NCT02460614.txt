      selected. All children participating in the study should be in the first 48 hours of
      hospitalization. Patients were divided in aspiration group (AG), submitted to nasopharyngeal
      aspiration, and clearance group (CG), submitted to retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance (RRC)
      technique with physiological solution (0.9%) instillation. In both groups children were
      evaluated three times in the same day (data collection 1 (C1) - performed early in the
      morning; data collecting 2 (C2) - performed in the early afternoon; and data collecting 3
      (C3) - performed in the evening). In each data collection, cardiorespiratory parameters and
      clinical score of respiratory dysfunction were evaluated before procedures (T0), 10 minutes
      after (T1) and 30 minutes after (T2). Adverse effects were evaluated during the whole day of
      the study.
