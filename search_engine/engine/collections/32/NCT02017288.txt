      given the amenability for visual inspection and specimen collection and the availability of
      recognized precursors. Yet, there are currently no guidelines for screening, treatment, or
      follow-up of patients with oral cancer precursors, in part, owing to the current gaps in
      knowledge regarding the natural history of precursor lesions. We propose to conduct a
      prospective cohort study of patients with oral cancer precursors to address these knowledge
      gaps and to investigate novel etiologic factors.

      In preparation for the cohort study, we recently conducted a pilot study in Taiwan, a country
      with high oral cancer incidence. This pilot was aimed to streamline field operations and
      collect preliminary data to aid in the design of the cohort study. As detailed in our
      concept, we successfully accomplished all of the goals of our pilot study, including
      successful recruitment and retention of patients as well as the collection of critical
      preliminary data.

      Based on these efforts, we are seeking approval to conduct a prospective cohort study of 3000
      patients with precursors to investigate the natural history of histologically-defined oral
      cancer precursor lesions and evaluate epidemiologic/ molecular predictors for progression.
      After completion of the recruitment period, we plan to recruit an additional 500 patients
      with clinically-defined precancerous lesions for passive follow-up. The prospective component
      will be complemented by cross-sectional comparisons of epidemiologic/molecular factors across
      750 controls, 3500 precursors, and 750 cancers.
