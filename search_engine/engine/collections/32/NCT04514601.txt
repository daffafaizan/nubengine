      in patient harm. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of implementing a handover
      protocol on the quality of information exchanged in the trauma handover meetings in a UK
      hospital.

      A prospective single centre observational study was performed at an acute NHS trust, using
      the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology. Ten consecutive weekday trauma meetings, involving
      43 patients, were observed to identify poor practices in handover. This data was used in
      conjunction with the Royal College of Surgeon's recommendations for effective handover (2007)
      to create a standard operating protocol (SOP). Following the implementation of the SOP, a
      further 8 consecutive weekday trauma meetings, involving a further 47 patients, were
      observed. The data collection was performed by 5 trained independent observers. The data was
      analysed using t test for quantitative variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for
      categorical variables.
