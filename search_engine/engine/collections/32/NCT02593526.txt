      safety of performing a large scale study of diuretic use and/or cool dialysate examining
      recruitment, retention, and key outcomes. This study will further assess whether the use of a
      diuretic compared to non-use of a diuretic and/or the use of cool dialysate (35.5 ºC)
      compared to 37 ºC for up to 6 months will improve residual renal function (RRF), improve
      health reported quality of life (HRQOL) and reduce hospitalizations by randomizing 20
      dialysis-naïve patients (started chronic HD in the last three months) from DCI centers in the
      greater Albuquerque area, to either bumetanide and cool dialysate randomized in a two-by-two
      factorial distribution.
