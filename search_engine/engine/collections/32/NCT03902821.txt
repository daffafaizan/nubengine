      women as they re-enter community treatment settings after incarceration. The ODOC pilot
      project offers initiation of opioid antagonist treatment prior to release (extended-release
      naltrexone [XR-NTX]), ongoing support from a Certified Recovery Mentor (CRM), and facilitated
      entry into community treatment for substance use disorders. Community treatment may include
      continuation of XR-NTX,or transition to agonist therapy including buprenorphine or methadone,
      or no medication for opioid use disorder.
