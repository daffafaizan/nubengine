      intended to start in 10/2019. Adult and German speaking patients suffering from aphasia after
      stroke who give informed consent and whose life expectancy is estimated above 1 year are
      included and will be followed up for 3 months. If informed consent is not available their
      legal guardian will have to provide written informed consent for their contribution.

      After Randomization participants are divided into two different groups:

      Patients receiving a standard logopedic speech treatment versus individuals working with a
      computer-based solution (NeolexonÂ® App on mobile devices). Both groups will also have
      self-training and therefore frequency and intensity of this is also going to be analyzed as
      well as in the clinical surrounding.

      There will be three different major ward rounds in both groups during the trial period where
      scales scoring the severity of aphasia are collected and compared (i.e. AABT or LAST).

      Furthermore epidemiologic data and stroke scales (i.e. NIHSS, mRS) are evaluated. The last
      round will be the follow-up after 3 months. Lexi will provide new data to fill the gap of
      organizational barriers and structural problems. Our aim is to show modern alternative
      therapy algorithms that approach the individual problem to offer a potential tailored
      solution to patients.
