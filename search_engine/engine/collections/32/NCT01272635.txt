      visits to the doctor's office, urgent care, emergency room and often hospitalization.
      APRIL-OCELOT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study in 600 preschool
      children with a history of significant wheezing episodes in the year prior to enrollment. All
      children enter the APRIL portion of the study, which will compare azithromycin to placebo,
      given for 5 days during the early signs of an upper respiratory tract illness, for preventing
      the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms. APRIL is a 78 week study, but
      participation will end earlier if the child requires a fourth course of APRIL treatment or
      develops significant lower respiratory tract symptoms. Only those children who develop
      significant lower respiratory tract symptoms during APRIL will enter the OCELOT portion of
      the study, which will compare oral corticosteroid to placebo for treating lower respiratory
      tract symptoms as measured by the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). OCELOT
      participation will be complete after 14 days. Children may not reenter APRIL after completing
      OCELOT.
