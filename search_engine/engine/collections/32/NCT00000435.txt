      that immune cells in the joints of people in the early stages of RA react strongly against
      dnaJ peptides from bacteria. These immune cells may also cross-react with human dnaJ peptides
      in the joints to cause inflammation. dnaJ may help RA by "re-educating" the immune system and
      dampening the abnormal inflammatory immune response in RA.

      This study will last 7 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either dnaJ
      or placebo by mouth. At screening, participants will have medical history, physical, and
      medication assessment. At screening, at 6 study visits every month after the start of
      treatment, and at 1 month follow-up, participants will have a joint exam, blood and urine
      collection, and will fill out a questionnaire about their condition.
