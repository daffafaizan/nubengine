      ongoing worldwide, and most of which achieved fairly good therapeutic effect. To date,
      sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of radioactive iodine refractory DTC. Apatinib
      is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor that reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently,
      and had been proven to be effective in many solid tumors. In this study, the investigators
      aim to further explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in locally advanced or metastatic
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
