      factors or previous preterm labor, we hypothesize that they will also show efficacy in
      pregnancy prolongation in women whose preterm labor was arrested following tocolytic
      treatment.

      Patients diagnosed with arrested pre-term labor following tocolytics at 24-34 gestational
      weeks will be randomly allocated to receive either vaginal micronized progesterone 400 mg/day
      or no treatment.

      This study has the potential to find a treatment to prevent preterm labor and thus to reduce
      neonatal morbidity and mortality.
