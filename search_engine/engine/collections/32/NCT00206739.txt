      with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine, a novel principle of malaria intervention, the following
      parameters are evaluated: i) the level of protection from malaria attacks and episodes of
      anemia during the treatment period, ii) the level of protection from severe malaria during
      the treatment period, iii) the effect on malaria morbidity after sustaining treatment, iv)
      the decrease of overall morbidity and mortality, including the number of hospital admissions
      and visits of hospital outpatient departments v) the influence of the intervention on the
      development of drug resistances, vi) the impact of the intervention on the development of
      immunity, vii) the possible influence of the intervention on sub-clinical organ dysfunction
      due to chronic Plasmodium falciparum infection. Parts of the study are performed in
      collaboration with the Laboratory of Research, Hospital Albert Schweitzer, Lambaréné, Gabon
      and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Development Studies, Tamale,
      Ghana
