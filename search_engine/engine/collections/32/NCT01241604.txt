    
      Primary Hypothesis and end-point:

      The use of the BiPAP autoSV3 device in participants with Comp SAS will treat those
      participants no worse than when compared to the BiPAP S/T device with respect to:

        -  Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)

      Secondary Hypothesis and end-points:

      The use of the BiPAP autoSV3 device in participants with Comp SAS will treat those
      participants no worse than the BiPAP S/T device, with respect to:

        -  Sleep Variables

        -  REM, NREM and Total Sleep Time (TST) Indices

        -  Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)

        -  Center Apnea Index(CAI)

        -  Obstructive Apnea Index (OAI)

        -  Mixed Apnea Index (MAI)

        -  Hypopnea Index (HI)

        -  Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)

        -  REM Onset Latency (ROL)

        -  Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)

        -  Total Sleep Time (TST)

        -  Sleep Efficiency (SE %)

        -  Wake (W), Stages N1,N2,N3 (NREM), and REM (R) sleep (in minutes)

        -  Wake (W), Stages N1,N2,N3 (NREM), and REM (R) sleep (% TST)

        -  Arousal Index [total, AH-related, PLM-related, 'spontaneous']

        -  Nocturnal oxygenation (measured by continuous pulse oximetry during sleep study)

        -  AHI (REM, NREM and TST) using modified hypopnea rule.

        -  AHI (REM, NREM and TST) during epochs for which leak is determined to exist within
           acceptable limits
