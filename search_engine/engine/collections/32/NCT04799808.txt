    
      -  Formation of two separate cohorts of approximately 1000 study subjects each from the
           three categories (dialysis patients, solid organ transplant recipients and medical
           staff) of participants vaccinated using either Biontech or Moderna vaccine (Biontech
           cohort and Moderna cohort, approximately 2000 subjects total).

        -  Study time points: Before administration of the 1st SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose, before the
           2nd vaccine dose, and 8 weeks and 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after administration of the
           1st vaccine dose and after suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        -  At all time points, a questionnaire or eCRF will be completed with questions about the
           dialysis center and the clinical course of the patients.

        -  Humoral immune response will be determined in all study participants.

        -  Formation of a study subgroup of up to 300 subjects in each cohort (Biontech or Moderna
           cohort) for detailed evaluation of the cellular immune response (max. 600 subjects in
           total).

        -  In case of non-sustained immunity > 6 months as well as the occurrence of a 3rd
           SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in autumn 2021, this will be investigated analogously to the
           current wave.
