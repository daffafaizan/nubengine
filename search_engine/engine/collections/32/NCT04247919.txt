      reactions (ADRs) (e.g., major bleeding or treatment failure) in study participants while on
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). A web-based program will analyze the data obtain from
      sequencing, and generate a drug safety score (DSS). The DSS risk score will be compared with
      pre-specified serious ADRs associated with DOAC therapy. A secondary analysis will involve
      discovery of novel variants that arise from our analysis and may potentially affect the
      outcome of DOAC treatment.
