    
      Darifenacin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist drug used to treat overactive bladder. There
      is a new formulation of darifenacin extended release developed by an argentinian
      pharmaceutical company. A bioequivalence study will be performed to validate pharmaceutical
      development before introducing the product in the market.

      The purpose in this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability, pharmacokinetic
      profiling and safety of a brand generic formulation of darifenacin [Darisec(R) 7.5 mg] vs.
      the innovator [Enablex(R) 7.5 mg]in 24 healthy uruguayan volunteers after a high fat
      breakfast of 1000 calories (50% fat, 35% carbohydrates, and 15% proteins)to establish their
      average bioequivalence.

      The bioequivalence will be evaluated using:

        -  The Area Under the Curve (AUC),

        -  The peak plasma concentration (Cmax).

      The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug formulations will be described calculating:

        -  The time to peak concentration (Tmax)

        -  The elimination constant (Ke)

        -  The elimination half-life (t1/2e)

        -  The systemic clearance (Cls)

      Safety will be evaluated recording:

        -  Reported adverse events

        -  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature)

        -  Laboratory analysis (hemogram, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, sugar in blood, etc.)

        -  EKG and chest XRays

      Bioequivalence will be claimed if the drugs comply with local and FDA regulatory
      requirements:

        -  Mean AUCt/AUCr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25

        -  Mean Cmaxt/Cmaxr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25

      Pharmacokinetic profiling will be evaluated by describing the pharmacokinetic characteristics
      of both drug in adequate two-way tables.

      Safety will be evaluated comparing incidence of adverse events/adverse effects for both
      products.
