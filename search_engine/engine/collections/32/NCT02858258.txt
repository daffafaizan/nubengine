      Primary Objective:

      To establish one of three study arms, R-CHOP/R-DHAP followed by ASCT (control arm A),
      R-CHOP+ibrutinib /R-DHAP followed by ASCT and ibrutinib maintenance experimental arm A+I),
      and R-CHOP+ibrutinib /R-DHAP followed by ibrutinib maintenance experimental arm I) as future
      standard based on the comparison of the investigator-assessed failure-free survival (FFS).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the efficacy of the three treatment arms in terms of secondary efficacy
           endpoints

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib during induction
           immuno-chemotherapy and during maintenance and to compare the safety profile of the
           three treatment arms in terms of secondary toxicity endpoints

      Primary Endpoint:

      FFS defined as time from start of treatment to stable disease at end of immuno-chemotherapy,
      progressive disease, or death from any cause.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization, from end of induction
           immuno-chemotherapy in patients with CR or PR at end of induction immuno-chemotherapy,
           and from the staging 6 weeks after end of induction assessment (at month 6)

        -  Overall response and complete remission rates at midterm, at end of induction, 3 months
           after end of induction immunochemotherapy (at month 6)

        -  PR to CR conversion rate during follow-up after end of induction immuno-chemotherapy

      Secondary Toxicity Endpoints:

        -  Rates of AEs, SAEs, and SUSARs by CTC grade (Version 4.03) during induction
           immuno-chemotherapy and during periods of follow-up after response to
           immune-chemotherapy

        -  Cumulative incidence rates of SPMs

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To compare feasibility of ASCT in arm A+I vs. arm A

        -  To compare minimal residual disease status between the three treatment groups

        -  To determine the impact of ibrutinib during induction immuno-chemotherapy and during
           maintenance therapy on the minimal residual disease status

        -  To determine the prognostic value of minimal residual disease status

        -  To determine the prognostic value of positron emission tomography with fluorine
           18-fluorodeoxyglucose

        -  To determine clinical and biological prognostic and predictive factors

        -  To determine the role of total body irradiation (TBI) in ASCT conditioning

      Exploratory Endpoints:

        -  Rate of successful stem cell mobilisations (success: separation of at least 2x2x10(6)
           CD34-positive cells, including a back-up)

        -  Rate of molecular remissions (MRD-negative patients) at midterm, at end of induction
           immuno-chemotherapy, and at staging time-points during follow-up in patients with
           remission after end of induction immuno-chemotherapy

        -  Time to molecular remission from start of therapy

        -  Time to molecular relapse for patients in clinical and molecular remission after end of
           induction immunochemotherapy

        -  RD in FDG-PET negative or positive patients after induction and ASCT

      Exploratory objectives may be evaluated only in a subset of patients according to local
      standards and resources.
