    
      Patients (n=70) with long-term (>2 years) permanent pacemakers with avoidable RV pacing will
      be invited to participate in a single-centre, phase II, randomised, double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial of optimised pacing programming versus standard care. Those
      randomised to the intervention arm will have personalised programming to avoid right
      ventricular pacing, whilst those allocated to standard care will have no programming changes
      made. All participants will be invited back at 6 months for a repeat echocardiogram, quality
      of life assessment (EQ-5D-5L), blood tests and pacemaker check.
