      due to out-of-hospital SCA, admitted to our intensive care unit, underwent MIH. Hypothermia
      was induced by infusion of cold saline and whole-body-cooling methods (electronic
      randomization: invasive Coolgard or non-invasive ArcticSun). The core body temperature was
      operated at 32 to 34 Â°C over a period of 24 hours followed by active rewarming. Neurological
      status was evaluated at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge using the Pittsburgh
      Cerebral Performance Category (CPC).
