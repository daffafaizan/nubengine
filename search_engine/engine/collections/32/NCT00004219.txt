      in the prevention of radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in men with stage I testicular
      seminoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral lerisetron with an
      oral placebo once daily for 14 days. Arm II: Patients receive oral lerisetron once daily for
      14 days. Arm III: Patients receive oral granisetron hydrochloride once daily for 14 days. At
      1-2 hours following antiemetics, all patients undergo concurrent daily radiotherapy for at
      least 10 out of 14 days. Patients are followed daily for 10 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
