      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      This research study is a study with endocrine therapy and CDK 4/6 inhibitor (ribociclib) for
      early breast cancer. There is no placebo in this study. The study has two components -
      pre-screening with ctDNA to detect minimal residual disease (pre-screening), and treatment
      with ribociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (main portion).

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ribociclib in combination with
      aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option for advanced/metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating efficacy of ribociclib in patients
      who have MRD based on ctDNA.

      Ribociclib is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent protein
      kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins are needed for cells to divide and may also control
      the ability of certain cancers to grow. The investigators believe that ribociclib may stop
      the participant cancer cells from growing and dividing by blocking these CDK4/6 proteins.
