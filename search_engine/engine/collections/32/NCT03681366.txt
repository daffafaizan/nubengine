      slow myopia progression and axial length growth in myopic children as compared with single
      vision soft contact lenses.

      The Defocus Incorporated Soft 3.5 Plus Contact Lens (DISC3.5 Plus) is a soft contact lens
      that comprises of simultaneous distance optical prescription and myopic defocus areas.

      The efficacy of the DISC3.5 Plus lens in slowing myopia progression (change in refractive
      error) will be compared to a spherical (front and back surface) single vision soft contact
      lenses in this one-year prospective, randomised and double-masked clinical trial. The
      hypothesis of this study is that the DISC3.5 Plus will slow myopia progression more than
      spherical single vision soft contact lenses.
