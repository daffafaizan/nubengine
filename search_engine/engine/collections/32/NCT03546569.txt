      bridge to elective surgery at Koege- and Slagelse Hospital. Baseline blood samples will be
      collected before the procedure. After the procedure blood samples will be collected 1, 4, 12
      and 24 hours after SEMS placement. After elective surgery a tumor sample will be collected.

      Prior to SEMS placement:

      When potential candidates are admitted to the hospital they will be presented to the study by
      the relevant surgeon. The investigators will be contacted, when the patient is admitted to
      hospital.
