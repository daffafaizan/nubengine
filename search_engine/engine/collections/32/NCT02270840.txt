    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of upgrade to a CRT-D device on clinical
      and echocardiographic response at 12-month in patients with left ventricular dysfunction
      (LVEF ≤35%), symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV-a), and intermittent or permanent
      right ventricular pacing with paced QRS complex ≥ 150 ms compared to continued therapy with a
      single or dual chamber pacemaker (PM) or ICD.

      Prospective, post-market, international multicenter randomized controlled trial.
