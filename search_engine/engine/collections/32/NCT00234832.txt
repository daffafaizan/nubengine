      Lead-in Period, during which subjects received single-blind sibutramine and country-specific
      standard of care for weight management. Subjects who discontinued study drug treatment during
      the Lead-in Period were not randomized and did not participate in the double-blind Treatment
      Period or the Follow-up Period; 3) a double-blind Treatment Period in which subjects were
      randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups and were followed until the study ended; and 4) a
      double-blind Follow-up Period, during which randomized subjects who discontinued study drug
      were followed until the study ended. The Randomization Phase consisted of the double-blind
      Treatment Period and the double-blind Follow-up Period. Subjects received country-specific
      standard of care for weight management during the Randomization Phase.

      An independent events adjudication committee evaluated all potential cardiovascular outcome
      events and confirmed the outcome events and time of onset to be included in the statistical
      analyses.
