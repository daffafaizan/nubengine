      of surgical vertebral resections. The surgical techniques used are multiple, require heavy
      surgery, one or more approaches and surgical time, transfusions, a neurological risk (up to
      20% in some series, risk of non-consolidation, insufficient correction). These surgical
      techniques deserve an evaluation of the early complications and the skeletal maturity of
      these children (maintenance of the surgical correction, evolution of the associated
      curvatures).
