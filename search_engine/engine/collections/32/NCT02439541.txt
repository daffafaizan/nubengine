    
      Phase I-II Clinical Trial-Safety and efficacy of umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell
      (UC-MSC) in patients with chronic heart ischemia cohort and prospective study.

      Forty patients will be selected and divided into two groups according to patients'
      willingness to stem cell treatment. The patients who are willing to receive stem cell
      transplantation will receive UC-MSCs by coronary injection. The patients in control group
      will not receive any intervention.

      Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of chronic heart ischemia, with maximum
      tolerated dosage without side effects.

      The day of infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided
      into 0-1,1-3, 3-6, and 6-12 months.

      Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 12 months of followup.
