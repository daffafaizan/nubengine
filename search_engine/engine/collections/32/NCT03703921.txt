      for Amplified Pain Syndrome (RAPS) program, and a second time near or just after program
      completion (typically 3-5 weeks later). One functional MRI task will involve passive viewing
      of emotional and pain-related images including some that have been widely used in previous
      neuroimaging research (e.g., the International Affective Picture Set, Human Facial
      Expressions; alternating positive and negative affect/valence). The other functional MRI
      task, will involve systematic external application of somatosensory stimulation (pressure) to
      the hand in alternating blocks. The entire imaging procedure will take approximately an hour.
      MRI technicians and/or study staff will administer the scanning protocol. Study team will be
      responsible for the systematic external application of sensory input.
