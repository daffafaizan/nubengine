      supplementation in pregnancy and lactation. It is hypothesized that the current AI of 5 Î¼g of
      vitamin D will be inadequate for women and their infants in Canada to achieve optimal 25OHD
      concentrations (> 75nmol/L).

      Methods: Healthy pregnant women between 18-42 years of age without history of pregnancy
      complications will be recruited for a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial where they
      will receive one of three different dosages of vitamin D (10, 25 and 50ug/day) as part of a
      standard prenatal vitamin. The study at 18 plus/minus 3 weeks gestation and will carry on
      throughout pregnancy and lactation. Mother and infant vitamin D levels in breast milk and
      blood will be measured at regular intervals. Skin colour will be measured via light
      reflectometry. Bone biomarkers such as plasma osteocalcin and urinary n-telopeptide will be
      assessed. Dietary vitamin D intake and sun exposure will be estimated using a food frequency
      and lifestyle questionnaire. Data will be analyzed using multiple regression analysis
      controlling for baseline values.

      Expected Results & Conclusions: It is expected that greater vitamin D intakes (25, 50ug/day)
      will be necessary to raise maternal and infant serum concentrations to 25OHD>75nmol/L to
      avoid infant supplementation. This data will aid policy makers, mothers and healthcare
      workers in recommended and appropriate vitamin D dosage throughout pregnancy and lactation.
