      pressure level. Also in patients suffering a myocardial infarction, circulating aldosterone
      levels are associated with increased mortality. In animal models of myocardial infarction,
      the administration of exogenous aldosterone increased infarct size, although other studies
      did not report this effect. In similar models, antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor
      (MR) reduced infarct size, which was completely abolished in ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73, the
      enzyme that catalyses extracellular formation of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine) and
      adenosine receptor knock-out mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with PHA have an
      increased susceptibility for ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-injury due to down-regulation of the
      enzyme CD73. We will use the reduction in brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by forearm IR
      as a well-validated endpoint for (endothelial) IR-injury.
