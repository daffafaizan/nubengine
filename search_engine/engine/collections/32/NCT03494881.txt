      The primary endpoint will be the mean reduction in the seven day urticaria activity score
      (UAS7) before and after 10 weeks of treatment with mepolizumab. Secondary endpoints will be
      the mean reduction of the urticaria control test (UCT) score and the weekly itch severity
      score (ISS) before and after treatment. Enrollment examination will include a standardized
      history and examination, baseline UCT score, CBC with differential, serum IgE level, chronic
      urticaria index, IgE Fc receptor antibody functional assay, and a 4 mm punch biopsy of
      lesional skin to confirm the urticarial tissue reaction includes eosinophils and is not
      neutrophilic predominant. Patients will discontinue all anti-histamines and start cetirizine
      10 mg PO BID which may be continued throughout the study duration. Patients will be provided
      with a log book to track daily urticaria signs and symptoms in a standardized manner for UAS
      scoring. At week 0 (enrollment visit +7 days), baseline UAS7 and ISS score will be assessed
      and skin biopsy results reviewed. Patients with a confirmatory skin biopsy will receive 200
      mg SC of mepolizumab at week 0,2,4,6,and 8. UAS-7 and weekly ISS score will be calculated at
      week 0, 4, 8, and 10. UCT scoring will be calculated at week 0 and at week 10. Repeat CBC
      with differential, serum IgE level, and measures of basophil serum activation (chronic
      urticaria index, IgE FC Receptor antibody functional assay) will be assessed at week 10.
