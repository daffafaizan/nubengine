      ultrasound (CEUS) to measure the extent of microvascular perfusion impairment in the heart,
      kidneys and/or brain of COVID-19 pediatric patients and, as exploratory analysis, to assess
      the significance of imaging findings by correlating to clinical outcomes.

      Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (LumasonTM, Bracco Inc) is an FDA-approved
      ultrasound contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan with a duration of approximately
      15 minutes will be performed when a COVID-19 diagnosis has been made (or is highly suspected)
      according to established clinical procedures. One CEUS will be performed per patient, with up
      to 2 intravenous injections of the contrast agent. The dosing plan will be weight-adjusted,
      based on a dose of 0.03 mL/kg (with a maximum dose of 2.4 mL per injection). Organ perfusion
      will be evaluated in the heart, kidneys, and/or brain. Clinical outcomes during hospital stay
      will be collected for correlation to CEUS-based measures.
