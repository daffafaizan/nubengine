      I. To determine the objective response rate, defined as partial response or better, of
      imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To further define and describe the toxicities associated with imetelstat in children with
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to progression following treatment with imetelstat in children with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure tumor telomere length in archival samples, and to correlate telomere length to
      the clinical outcome of the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 36 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
