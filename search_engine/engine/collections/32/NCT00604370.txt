      discharge. These risks will go unrecognized, and discharge prophylaxis orders will not be
      prescribed.

      To test this hypothesis, we will perform a retrospective review of approximately 2,500
      patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital at risk for VTE at the time of hospital discharge to
      determine what proportion received VTE prophylaxis. We will correlate the implementation of
      discharge VTE prophylaxis with the occurrence of symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism
      within 90 days of hospital discharge.

      We will also conduct a substudy of this patient population to determine adherence to VTE
      prophylaxis among hospitalized patients.
