      efficacy and safety of azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days to eradicate Ureaplasma spp from the
      respiratory tract of preterm infants 24 weeks 0 days to 28 weeks 6 days gestation exposed to
      positive pressure ventilation. The primary outcome will be survival with microbiological
      eradication of Ureaplasma defined as survival to discharge or transfer with 3 negative
      cultures obtained post-therapy. Secondary outcomes will include physiologic BPD at 36 weeks
      post-menstrual age (PMA), overall mortality, incidence of co-morbidities of prematurity such
      as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, patent ductus arteriosus,
      retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure ventilation, number of days
      of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal steroids, and use of non-study antibiotics. At 6
      and 18 months adjusted age, a pulmonary outcome questionnaire will be administered by phone
      or in person interview. At 18-22 months adjusted age, neurodevelopmental outcomes will be
      assessed by 1) Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSID-III); 2)
      Amiel-Tison neurologic examination; 3) Gross Motor Function Classification System; and 4)
      medical record review for hearing impairment with or without amplification and vision
      impairment (vision <20/200).
