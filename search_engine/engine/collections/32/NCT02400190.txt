      considering tumor biology to select patients who may avoid radiation, with restriction of
      eligibility to women aged 50-69 with hormone-sensitive, Her2-negative tumors with Oncotype-DX
      RS â‰¤ 18 who plan to receive endocrine therapy. In this way, this study seeks to collect
      prospective data supporting the idea that this is a population at low risk of LRR in whom
      omission of adjuvant radiation is reasonable.
