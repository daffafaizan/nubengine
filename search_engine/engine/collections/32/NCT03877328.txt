      designed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the Virtual Coach Program in elderly
      patients with heart failure. Sixteen (16) subjects will be enrolled to allow 8 subjects to be
      randomly assigned to each arm. The study will be conducted in Thessaloniki/Greece. The study
      is expected to complete enrollment in approximately 3 months. Participants will be randomly
      randomized to either the intervention group (use of Virtual Coach program and usual care) or
      the control group (use of usual care alone) after successfully fulfilling all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.
