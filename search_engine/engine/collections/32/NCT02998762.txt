    
      This is a long-term follow up study of the 'Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in
      Depression' (CAN-BIND) study. The CAN-BIND study examines biological markers of
      antidepressant treatment response. The examined biomarkers included clinical, imaging, and
      genetic components. The Long Term Follow up (LTFU) study will continue to follow the patients
      in this study each six months over a five year period. By doing so, a comprehensive clinical
      outcome data on a well characterized cohort of depressed patients will be obtained.

      The research team will conduct a naturalistic study of CAN-BIND participants and will monitor
      the longitudinal progress in mood, functioning, and quality of life, with a view towards
      advising future treatment options. Each patient completing CAN-BIND will be asked to
      participate in the LTFU study.
