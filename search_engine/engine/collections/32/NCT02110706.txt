      Phase II clinical trial utilizing a futility design. The study would include acetylcholine
      receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized MG subjects. This study also presents a unique
      opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune
      diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific
      components that participate in the immunopathology of the disease, namely autoantibodies,
      autoantibody-producing B cells, and antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our
      understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more
      complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab
      leading to new ways to treat the disease.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective
      treatment for subjects with MG.

      The SNOMED code for MG is 31839002.
