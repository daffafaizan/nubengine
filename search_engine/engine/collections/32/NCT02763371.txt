      lunch has on cognitive performance is not clear. A recently published review by Philippou and
      Constantinou suggested cautiously that a low-GI meal may favor cognitive functions in adults,
      but note that their findings are inconclusive due to differences in study design, study
      sample (e.g. size, age), time of testing and the cognitive domain being examined. Because of
      cerebral particularities, children may react highly sensitive to variations of glycose
      supply. Therefore, an optimised composition of meals at favourable mealtime should be
      considered for optimal cognitive performance. The increasing implementation of all-day
      schools in Germany requires the children's catering for lunch at school.

      As prior intake of food can have an influence on the physiological effect of test meal, the
      children's dietary intake in the mid-morning is standardized. The intervention is integrated
      in everyday school life: 9.15 a.m. standardized snack within the frame of the regular break,
      9.45 a.m. to 12.25 p.m. everyday school life, 12.25 p.m. lunch with a high GI-rice or a low
      GI-rice and a water beverage, 12.45 p.m. to 13.15 p.m. regular lunch break, 13.15 p.m.
      computerized tests of executive cognitive and basal (alertness) functioning.

      Parameters of cognition with relevance to everyday school life are measured by a computerized
      test program developed by the Institute of Working Learning and Aging (ALA). Usual eating
      behaviour, sleep behaviour, physical activity and parental education were determined as
      control variables by questionnaires for children, parents.
