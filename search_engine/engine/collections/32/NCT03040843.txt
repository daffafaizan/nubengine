      the environment. There are 2 related areas of neurologic function that are connected to
      consciousness: content (orientation and memory) and level (arousal and response to stimuli).

      The mental changes are best looked for in terms of arousal, attention, alertness,
      orientation, cognition, memory, affect, and perception. Arousal (level of consciousness) can
      be detected by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Others are related to content of
      consciousness and can be evaluated by cognitive tests. After one month pilot study, the
      investigators chose 5 features of content of consciousness due to easy applicable and
      detectable;

        1. Attention (counting numbers backwards from 20) (>1 error positive)

        2. Cognition (disorganized thinking; meaningless speech, irrelevant explanations)

        3. Perception (visual or auditory hallucinations)

        4. Memory (3 items recall) (>1 error positive)

        5. Orientation (day of week, month and year) (>1 error positive)

      These features are also combination of six item screener test and delirium symptoms.

      All elderly patients (65 aged and older) presented to the emergency department, will be
      assessed according to these two methods; content and level of consciousness. And also, every
      patient's baseline status of consciousness will be obtained from surrogates who knows the
      patient best. All changes from patient's baseline status will be recorded. The investigators
      will investigate how changes are reflected in the clinic.
