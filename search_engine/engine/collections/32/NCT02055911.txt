           retinal ganglion cell function after repeated intravitreal injections.

        -  To evaluate the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab repeated injections in patients with
           diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function.

        -  The primary endpoint for the study will be the changes in full-field and focal macular
           photopic negative response (PhRN) amplitude (in ÂµV) over time, from baseline to month
           12.
