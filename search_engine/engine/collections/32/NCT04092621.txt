      fibrillation suffer a greater likelihood of death and other complications when compared with
      patients who remain in sinus rhythm, however, little evidence exists to inform treatment
      strategies in this population. Ours is a pilot study evaluating rhythm vs rate control
      strategies in patients with septic shock and respiratory failure requiring invasive
      mechanical ventilation who develop new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). Design will be
      prospective, randomized, open-label. Patients in the rhythm control arm will receive IV
      amiodarone infusion followed by attempt at electrical cardioversion within 24 hours
      development of NOAF. Those in the rate control arm will receive negative chronotropic agents
      (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, or digoxin) at the discretion of the
      treating physician. Available patient data will be collected for a total of 180 days
      following enrollment, and outcomes assessed will include ICU length of stay, ventilator free
      days, and time on vasopressors
