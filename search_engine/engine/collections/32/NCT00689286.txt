      debilitating because of the challenges it poses to normal walking function. Research has
      shown that exercise can lessen the effect of the osteoarthritis in the knee if done
      diligently. BIONÂ®s implanted in the thigh can produce contractions of the quadriceps muscles
      without much movement of the knee joint, an advantage if moving the knee is painful. In this
      study, teh subjects will be divided into three groups. Two groups of experimental subjects
      will receive stimulation using BIONs. The first group will have a stimulation paradigm like
      that used in a previous feasibility study that preceded the proposed trial, using
      low-frequency (1-5 PPS) "twitch" stimulation. The second group will have a stimulation
      paradigm in which tetanic-frequency stimulation (25-50 PPS) is used to produce fused muscle
      contractions. A third group of experimental subjects will have a standardized program of
      voluntary exercise.. In Groups 1 and 2, the femoral nerve will be stimulated electrically
      according to the assigned protocol during the 12 week experimental period after implantation
      of the devices. Individuals assigned to Group 3, receiving conventional exercise therapy for
      12 weeks, will be allowed to receive BIONs at the end of the trial, providing they request
      BION therapy and they have been at least minimally compliant with the exercises. All
      participants will be eligible to continue treatment following the initial 12 weeks if
      medically appropriate and resources permit.
