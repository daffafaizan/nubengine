      One drop of the dispensed study drop will be instilled in the PROSE lens reservoir twice a
      day and the remainder of the reservoir will be filled with normal saline (0.9% sodium
      chloride solution). In order to standardize solutions used in the PROSE reservoir, all
      patients recruited will be either currently using or will be switched to buffered
      preservative-free normal saline (Purilens, Lifestyle Inc., pH 7.4 ) to better match the
      reported pH of RESTASIS (pH 6.5-8.05).
