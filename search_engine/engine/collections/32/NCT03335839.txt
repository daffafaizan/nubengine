      evaluating the efficacy of a novel approach to prevent and treat microvascular obstruction
      thereby reducing major cardiovascular events using intracoronary administration of very
      low-dose fibrinolytic (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) directly into the culprit coronary
      artery during primary PCI.
