      sensitive subjects will be randomized into one of two groups; Probiotic ES1 or placebo. For
      the duration of the study, subjects must adhere to a gluten-free diet, apart from a scheduled
      fixed gluten exposure of two slices of bread once daily. Subjects will be required to take 1
      capsule before and after consuming the two slices of bread and score the severity of their
      symptoms in a diary provided for the duration of the study (7 days).
