    
      Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (Grazoprevir + Elbasvir), Epclusa (Sofosbuvir
      + Velpatasvir), or another appropriate DAA in at least 10 HCV-negative subjects receiving a
      lung transplant from a hepatitis C (HCV)-positive donor. Eligible subjects will receive a
      lung transplant from a deceased-donor, and then will receive treatment after lung
      transplantation when infection with HCV is confirmed in these lung transplant recipients.
      Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks for most subjects.
