      dislocations. Increased knowledge of the long-term consequences of these injuries could usher
      in changes to treatment paradigms, potentially resulting in improved outcomes. Thirty
      patients will be enrolled into two arms of this prospective study: isolated ankle fractures
      and ankle fracture dislocations. Patients will be followed through their operative and
      postoperative course and clinical and radiographic assessments will be analyzed. We plan to
      compare the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes of patients with ankle fractures
      to those with ankle fracture-dislocations. We also plan to identify factors that contribute
      to or predict poor clinical, functional, and/or radiographic outcomes in patients with ankle
      fractures and fracture-dislocations.
