      The purpose of this protocol is to identify the neural substrates by which acute alcohol
      intoxication leads to an increase in HIV risk behavior during sexual encounters. An

      additional aim is to characterize the influence of negative and positive social context on
      the

      neural mechanism by which acute alcohol intoxication leads to an increase in HIV risk
      behavior during sexual encounters. This study uses a two-visit alcohol-administration
      procedure to examine alcohol-induced changes in brain activity during decisions about risky
      sex.

      Study Population:

      Healthy community participants who binge drink occasionally but do not have alcohol use
      disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will complete baseline measures of sexual history and preferences, HIV risk and
      knowledge, and tasks designed to measure delay discounting of protected sex. At the first of
      two visits, subjects will then receive either alcohol or placebo beverages to increase their
      blood alcohol concentration to approximately 0.08g/dl. Then, participants will undergo
      functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a protected sex discounting task. At a
      second visit, participants will receive the opposite type of beverage (alcohol or placebo).
      Participants will be randomly assigned to order of beverages.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome of this study is changes in neural activity during protect sex
      discounting during the alcohol compared to placebo visits. Behavioral changes (i.e.,
      willingness to engage in unprotected sexual encounters) will also investigated as a primary
      outcome.
