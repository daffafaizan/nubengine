      or Cohort 2a (standard RT/TMZ + dose finding for belinostat), followed by assignment to
      Cohort 2b (standard RT/TMZ + tolerable dose of belinostat).

      Patients will undergo MRSI scans before beginning treatment and then at several time points
      during treatment to look for the early response of their tumor to treatment. Blood and tumor
      samples will be used to measure the levels of certain markers within the cancer cells.
      Patients will also be assessed for the side effects they experience. Progression-free and
      overall survival outcomes will be recorded. Patients will also have assessment of their
      depressive symptoms, quality-of-life and neurocognitive function at several time points
      during and after therapy course.
