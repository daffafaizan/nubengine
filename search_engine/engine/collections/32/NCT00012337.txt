      cancer. II. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.
      III. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 1
      month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
