      influence most aspects of their lives. Pregnancy and delivery can cause serious complications
      such as urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, fecal incontinence, and low back pain
      (LBP) that have negative effects on women's sexual, physical, social and psychological
      health.

      Based on Wu et al. systematic review, prevalence of pregnancy related low back pain (PLBP)
      during pregnancy and postpartum is 45% and 25% respectively.

      LBP is one of the most current causes of disability and sick leave after delivery.Abnormal
      load transfer in the lumbopelvic region has been considered as one possible explanation to
      lumbopelvic pain.The local stabilizing muscles, i.e. the transversely oriented abdominal,
      diaphragm, the lumbar MF and the PFM Play an important role in load transfer in the
      lumbopelvic region.so, we considered that an exercise program that addresses muscular
      dysfunction, such as lumbar stabilization exercise can improve motor pattern of local
      stabilizing muscles and can use in management of postpartum lumbopelvic pain.
