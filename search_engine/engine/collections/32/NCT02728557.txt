      supportive-expressive treatment. Patients will be randomized to one of two conditions: one
      that places a greater emphasis on supportive techniques, or one that places a greater
      emphasis on expressive techniques. These two conditions (supportive vs. expressive) hold the
      potential of either complementing or counter-complementing patients' attachment orientations
      (e.g., for a patient with higher levels of attachment anxiety, the supportive condition is
      complementary while the expressive is counter-complementary; the reverse is true for a
      patient with higher levels of attachment avoidance). Importantly, this study will employ
      multiple complementary methods, which will include session-by-session self-report alliance
      questionnaires from both patient and therapist, as well as a cognitive task assessing
      patients' relationship expectations, and behavioral observations of therapist-patient
      interactions. This study will be the first to utilize such a combination of methodologies in
      psychotherapy research and the first to examine the proposed mediation model. It will also be
      the first to manipulate the use of techniques in order to experimentally examine whether
      therapeutic techniques can be utilized to develop more efficient treatment models, based on
      the two transdiagnostic concepts of attachment and alliance. The findings will contribute
      both to our understanding of the relevance of attachment theory to psychotherapy research,
      and to the growing empirical literature on targeting transdiagnostic concepts (here,
      attachment and alliance) that cut across many disorders and treatment orientations. These
      transdiagnostic concepts can be utilized in the move towards tailoring existing psychological
      interventions to specific individuals according to their attachment orientations.
