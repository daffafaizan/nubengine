      incision will intentionally be left open. Subjects will be randomized using a random number
      generator. Each number will be placed in an envelope numbered 1-30. Arm 1 will be even
      numbers and Arm 2 will be odd numbers. A researcher not affiliated with the study will
      generate the numbers and place them in the envelopes. Arm 1 will place fifteen subjects on
      Negative Pressure Therapy Only and Arm 2 will place fifteen subjects on Negative Pressure and
      Procellera. Arm 1 (Negative Pressure Only) will have their dressing changed 3 times per week
      which is the standard of care for Negative Pressure Therapy. Arm 2 (Negative Pressure Therapy
      and Procellera) will have their dressing changed every 5 days. Arm 1 and 2 will have a tissue
      specimen taken on the 5th day only. The tissue will be taken from debrided material and sent
      for culture. The Negative Pressure Therapy Sponge, which is discarded after each dressing
      change, will be collected, lavaged with saline and the cells will be examined for macrophage
      function and the wound fluid will be tested for inflammation response. Photographs, wound
      measurements, pain scale and pain medication will also be completed at each dressing change.
      We will check the progress of the wound along with your surgeon during the subject's 30 day
      surgical follow up in the surgeon's office. The wound will be measured (if not healed),
      photograph's taken and their pain level assessed.
