      acceptability, and effectiveness of short-term mindfulness training among adolescents. The
      primary purpose was to investigate the effectiveness of two main Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction components-sitting meditation and hatha yoga-on working memory, stress, anxiety and
      mindfulness. The influence of daily home practice compliance on intervention outcomes was
      also examined. Participants (N = 198 adolescents) were recruited from a large public middle
      school in southern California. Participants were randomly assigned to sitting meditation,
      hatha yoga, or a waitlist control group. Participants were asked to complete a computerized
      working memory task, and self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety, and mindfulness
      at pre- and post-intervention/waitlist, as well as one-month follow-up. A series of
      mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine changes in working memory,
      stress, anxiety, and mindfulness between groups at pre- and post- intervention.
