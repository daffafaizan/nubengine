      a high risk of ischemic stroke in the 2 weeks following the initial bleed, and patients with
      clipped or coiled aneurysm. The investigators will apply a blood pressure cuff around leg and
      use it to interrupt the circulation for 5-10 minutes. The investigators will repeat this for
      a total of 3 times every 24 to 48 hours up to 14 days. The cuff will be inflated for 5-10
      minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes. There will be 3 cycles of this. The cuff will be
      inflated to 200mmHg.

      The investigators will first start with 5 minutes of cuff inflation to either the arm or leg.
      The investigators will determine if this is safe in at least 6 patients. The investigators
      will then increase the duration of cuff inflation to 7.5 minutes for another 6 patients. If
      no adverse events are noted the investigators will the proceed to study 10 minutes of
      inflation in another 6 patients. If no side effects are noted the investigators will then
      determine that this is well tolerated.

      The study will be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board who will make decisions about
      escalating the duration of cuff inflation. If 2 or more patients develop an adverse event
      that is related to the procedure the investigators will stop and no longer continue at that
      level of cuff inflation and the previous level of cuff inflation will be determined to be the
      safe and tolerated level.

      The investigators will collect safety data on adverse events such as tolerability, local
      tissue trauma or deep vein thrombosis.
