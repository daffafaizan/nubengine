      will be tilted laterally by 20 to 30 degrees to the left. PASP will be assessed using Doppler
      echocardiography at rest and during during supine bicycle exercise in NORMOXIA and hypoxia.
      Exposure to normobaric hypoxia will be performed by breathing a hypoxic gas mixture at sea
      level during 90 minutes (12,3 % O2 + 87.7 % N2) reproducing conditions at 4300 m altitude.
      Exercise will be started at an initial workload of 40 watts and increased by 10 watts every
      minute to reach a workload level defined by a heart rate (HR) corresponding to 50% of the
      estimated maximal aerobic power
