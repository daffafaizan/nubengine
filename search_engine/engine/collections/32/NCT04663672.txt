      sleep, resulting in synaptic potentiation and strengthening of the re-activated traces.
      Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) typically involves a period of initial learning in the
      presence of an olfactory or auditory contextual cue, coupled with later presentation of the
      cue during sleep to ostensibly facilitate memory reactivation and consolidation. Numerous
      studies have found evidence of improved task performance subsequent to cue-induced neuronal
      replay, however application of TMR to treatment of naturally acquired, clinically significant
      fear has been limited.

      The present study will will provide a rigorous test of TMR's efficacy as an augmentative
      strategy for exposure therapy. It is hypothesized that participants who sleep in the presence
      of the same odor that they are exposed to during exposure therapy will exhibit reduced fear
      at follow up, relative to participants who sleep in the presence of a different odor, or a
      non-odorous control.
