      I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by
      continuous infusion into malignant glioma over 96 hours, in two courses eight weeks apart.

      II. Estimate the response rate, response duration, time to response, and survival after
      interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR into recurrent malignant glioma.

      III. Describe the toxicities of interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR at the selected dose.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are expected to receive two IL13-PE38QQR infusions at 8-week
      intervals. For each course, drug will be infused through each of two catheters; infusion rate
      will be held constant during a 96-hour infusion.

      In Phase I, the dose of IL13-PE38QQR will be increased by increasing the IL13-PE38QQR
      concentration in stepwise fashion, while holding infusion volume and duration constant. Three
      patients will be treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      reached, and an additional three patients are treated at that level. In Phase II, patients
      will be treated at the selected MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: In Phase I, up to 30 patients will be treated. In Phase II, up to 35
      patients will be treated.
