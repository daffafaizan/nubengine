    
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial includes
      a screening period of up to 28 days, an 8-week treatment period (comprising a 2-week
      titration phase and a 6-week maintenance phase), and a 2-week follow-up period.

      At screening (Visit 1), all participants will receive instructions on how to complete a
      writing exercise (Exposure Writing Exercise) related to their traumatic experience. Prior to
      the baseline visit (Visit 2), participants must complete an approximate 30-minute writing
      exercise outside of the trial site and should have re-read the write up at least once to be
      eligible for enrollment.

      Throughout the screening and treatment periods, the dose of SSRI/SNRI used as background
      therapy, if any, should remain unchanged. On Day 1, eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to either nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose that relieves their most bothersome symptom
      of PTSD or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the first 14 days of treatment. Participants
      should continue at the same dose level achieved at the end of the titration phase Â±1 spray
      divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for the remainder of the treatment period.

      Health-related quality of life, safety, and tolerability will be evaluated during the
      treatment period.

      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 14 weeks
      (99 days), including the 28-day Screening period.
