      I. To assess the rate of complete response (pT0) at cystectomy following preoperative dose
      dense gemcitabine and cisplatin (DD GC) in patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma
      of the bladder.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity profile of DD GC when given in the neoadjuvant setting: To define
      the number of patients who complete all three cycles of treatment without dose reduction, and
      to describe the incidence of toxicity.

      II. To assess the 5 year overall and relapse free survival in patients who receive
      neoadjuvant DD GC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tissue specimens from patients to assess for molecular markers that correlate
      with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      cisplatin IV on day 1 or divided over days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-8 weeks
      after chemotherapy, patients undergo radical cystectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
