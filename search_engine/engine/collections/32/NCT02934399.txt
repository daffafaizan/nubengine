      diagnostics system. This is a 3-component collection system which can easily be attached to a
      belt and allows participants to continue with their normal everyday activities whilst
      undergoing sampling. The micro-fractions are minute, the volume would normally be by far too
      small to use with current immunoassays.

      ULTRADIAN will overcome this hurdle by introducing two novel techniques; ultrasensitive
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LCMS/MS) for steroid hormones, and the
      proximity extension assay (PEA®), which allows the simultaneous assay of up to 96 analytes in
      only 1 µL fluid.

      The microdialysis sampling will be performed in addition to the conventional diagnostic
      sampling, and during normal follow-up of patients.
