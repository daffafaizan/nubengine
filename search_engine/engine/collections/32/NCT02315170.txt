      increase comfort levels both during and after such injections. The hypothesis is that
      patients will feel increased comfort from a device which eliminates the need for a speculum
      while still keeping the eyelids apart, allowing a physician to deliver treatment. The results
      of this study will allow physicians to select the optimal device for patient comfort and
      well-being during intravitreal injections
