      of families in which clubfoot has occurred; more specifically, blood samples from the
      affected child and both parents. DNA will be extracted from blood samples. The DNA will then
      be tested to look for genetic factors that cause clubfoot.

      Study Questionnaires: As well as the blood samples, the investigators have a short
      questionnaire for the mother of the child with clubfoot to complete.
