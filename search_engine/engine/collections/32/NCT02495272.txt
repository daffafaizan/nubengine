      administration in the third stage of labour. The investigators are measuring the postpartum
      blood loss: quantitatively in the postpartum 1st hour and indirectly by the decrease in the
      hemoglobin-haematocrit levels in the postpartum 24th hour. The investigators are monitoring
      the length of the third stage of labour, and the need for extra uterotonics and/or surgical
      interventions.
