      exocrine factors secreted by embryo.These factors may have a positive impact on embryo
      implantation and subsequent development. So it is necessary to compare the two ways of embryo
      transfer with Self-spent Culture Medium or New Culture Medium in vitro fertilization - embryo
      transfer process.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze which way can improve clinical pregnancy and birth
      outcomes, is there a significant difference between the two?
