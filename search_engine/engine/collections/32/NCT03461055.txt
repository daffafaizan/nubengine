      due to anticipated discomfort of a procedure and anticipation of a long awaited pregnancy.
      Aromatherapy with lavender, an essential oil, has been shown to be effective in reducing
      anxiety and pain in a variety of procedures such as Botox injections, cesarean delivery and
      intrauterine device placement.
