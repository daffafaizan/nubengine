      Patients in arm 1 (control arm) will receive weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel on day 1 of a
      21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Patients in arm 2 will receive carboplatin on day 1 and
      dose-fractionated weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles.
      Patients in arm 3 will receive dose-fractionated weekly carboplatin and dose-fractionated
      weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles.

      The trial will have three planned stages. Stage 1 will be conducted to confirm feasibility
      and safety of protocol treatment in all patients and separately in the Delayed Primary
      Surgery (DPS) patients. The outcome measure for stage 2 will be 9-month progression-free
      survival (PFS) rate. The primary outcome measures for stage 3 will be PFS and overall
      survival and secondary outcomes will be toxicity, Quality of Life and Health Economics. If
      pre-defined levels of deliverability, at stage 1, or activity, at stage 2, are not met then
      the research arms will be reconsidered.
