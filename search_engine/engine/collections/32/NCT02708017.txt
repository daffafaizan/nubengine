      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed written consent for inclusion in the study was
      taken and during the process,patients were explained about the NRS and other secondary
      objectives.

      Blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance immediately after induction of anesthesia.For
      postoperative analgesia,patients were randomly allocated in two groups using draw/ballot
      method assigning patients to either of the S-TAP block group or P-TAP-block group. The
      patients and the staff providing postoperative care and the doctor assessing the pain after
      surgery were blinded to group assignment. Patients in both groups received standard of care
      analgesia during the post-operative period i.e., I/V Ketorolac 30mg every 8 hourly, I/V
      Tramadol 50mg every 8hourly and as per need basis, and I/V Paracetamol 1000mg every 6 hourly
      Subsequent surgical procedure was performed routinely. After completion of the surgery and
      emergence from anesthesia, patients were shifted to the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit, and time
      of arrival in recovery room was taken as 0-hour and noted. Assessment for outcome measures
      started in recovery room, and continued till 24 hours of the surgery.
