      randomized trial that will test if there is added benefit to addressing both social and
      economic needs and diabetes self-management to improve diabetes management long-term among
      vulnerable populations. In this pilot, the investigator will randomize 100 African-American,
      Hispanic, and/or Medicaid (all race/ethnicities) patients from Kaiser Permanente Northwest
      (KPNW) with A1C â‰¥ 8 and poor follow-up in primary care to one of two 6-month interventions:
      1) patient navigation only; or 2) patient navigation + diabetes self-management training. In
      both study arms, KPNW practice-embedded patient navigators will screen for medical, social
      and economic needs and connect participants to internal and external resources. In the second
      study arm, navigators will also refer participants to community health workers (CHWs)
      embedded in local community-based organizations, who will deliver diabetes self-management
      training. Feasibility of the full-scale trial will be based on several measures including
      recruitment, retention, success rate of referrals to navigators and CHWs, and whether
      medical, social, and/or economic needs are met. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with
      various stakeholders to assess intervention acceptability and determinants of implementation.
      Preliminary effects of A1C, diabetes-related care gaps, health care utilization, and
      medication adherence will also be examined. This pragmatic study design involves a
      collaborative effort among researchers, health system staff, health system senior leadership,
      and local community-based organizations. Findings from the full-scale trial will contribute
      critical knowledge on the most effective, sustainable model of care for integrating lay
      health workers in the efforts to improve diabetes management among high risk patient
      populations.
