    
      The study is designed as an open-label, single arm, prospective, monocenter, phase II study
      of pembrolizumab in a neoadjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC stage II/IIIA
      suitable for curative intent surgery, taking place in Germany. Planned sample size is N=30.

      Investigational drug is Pembrolizumab at fixed dose, given 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2 cycles.
      After completion of immunotherapy lobectomy/ bilobectomy with curative intent is scheduled.

      Primary objectives are to assess feasibility and safety of a neoadjuvant application of
      pembrolizumab and to assess antitumor activity of pembrolizumab with regard to clinical and
      pathologic tumor response. Secondary objective is to assess the impact of neoadjuvant
      pembrolizumab on patient disease free and overall survival. Exploratory objective is o
      explore potential predictive biomarkers for pembrolizumab efficacy (immune cell imaging).
