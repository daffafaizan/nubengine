      machine that is currently in use has a unique feature: the focal zone or the energy that the
      SWL energy is focused on in order to break kidney stones can be varied in size from a narrow
      (or small) focal zone to a wide (or large) focal zone. Previous lithotripters have only
      offered one focal size that corresponded to a narrow range. The objective of this study is to
      compare the single-treatment success rates of narrow and wide focal zones for the shock wave
      lithotripsy of renal stones between 5 and 15 mm in greatest diameter, while maintaining a
      constant overall lithotripsy energy level. A wide focal zone may offer some trade-offs when
      compared with the traditional narrow focal zone: since the area being treated is larger, it
      is more likely that the stone will receive adequate energy as it moves with patient breathing
      during treatment, and less energy per cubic inch will be delivered to the kidney around the
      stone (which might lead to a lower degree of renal injury); on the other hand less energy per
      cubic inch will also be delivered to the stone, so that stone fragmentation might be inferior
      to that with a narrow focal zone. Thus, with this study we want to determine whether there is
      a significant difference in both stone fragmentation and in renal injury (as measured by the
      incidence of post-treatment renal hematoma or bruises, and by measuring urinary markers
      indicating the degree of renal cellular damage). Aside from the random choice of focal zone
      size, there will be no change to the standard of care for lithotripsy treatment. We predict
      that the narrow focal shock zone will result in superior stone fragmentation, with higher
      single-treatment stone free and success rates. However, we may identify a slight increased
      incidence in the rate of subcapsular renal hematoma and renal damage, as detected by urinary
      markers.
