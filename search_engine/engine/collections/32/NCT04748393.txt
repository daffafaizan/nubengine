      divergent expert recommendations and very heterogeneous management approach in clinical
      practice with regard to anticoagulation choice, use of HC and treatment of abnormal uterine
      bleeding during anticoagulant treatment of VTE. Together with the fact that up to 70% of
      female patients with childbearing potential treated with anticoagulants may suffer from
      abnormal menstrual bleeding with a severe negative impact on quality of life, this is a
      compelling argument to initiate high quality observational studies to better quantify the
      magnitude of the problem and to identify unmet clinical needs. This study will do so and at
      the same time provide solid ground for future prospective management trials aimed at
      establishing preventive and/or treatment strategies for VTE patients with
      anticoagulant-associated abnormal menstrual bleeding.
