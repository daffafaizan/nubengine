      which they will receive 2 HLA-matched UCB units. A total of 40 subjects will receive one
      ProHema-CB as part of a double CB transplant and an additional 20 subjects will be enrolled
      as concurrent controls. The determination of which CB unit will be the ProHema-CB unit will
      be made based primarily upon the degree of HLA match.
