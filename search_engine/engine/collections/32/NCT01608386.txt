      before parenchymal transection has been considered the standard approach to a major right
      hepatectomy. However, this approach is often difficult and hazardous when performing liver
      resection for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or for tumors with extrahepatic organ
      invasion in the right retrohepatic region.In setting of right hepatectomy by an anterior
      approach,liver mobilisation is performed only at the end of parenchymal transection, when all
      vascular connections have already been interrupted.The anterior approach was found to be
      associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss, less blood transfusions and a
      lower hospital mortality rate.However,excessive bleeding can occur at the deeper plane of
      parenchymal transection from the right hepatic vein or middle hepatic vein.

      Bleeding from the hepatic veins is closely related to the CVP.Our previous retrospective
      analysisfound that the infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) clamping is efficacious in
      reducing CVP without the need of systemic fluid restriction and is associated with
      significantly less intraoperative blood loss during complex hepatectomy.

      The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if the application of the anterior
      approach combined with infrahepatic IVC clamping during right hepatectomy for large HCC
      reduces intraoperative blood loss.
