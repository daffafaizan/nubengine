      a reverse total shoulder replacement. This is an important population to look at their
      functional and clinical outcomes as they are often still employed and have more physical
      demands upon their shoulder in everyday life than the older replacement population for which
      there are more outcome data available. The investigators would like to determine how the
      younger population is healing and returning to their baseline activities of daily living and
      ability to work. This will help when counseling patients prior to surgery as it will give us
      a study supported understanding of the post-operative recovery timeline in the younger
      population. The investigators will review x-rays to evaluate healing at two years. Functional
      surveys are given pre and post operatively (1 & 2 years) and these will be reviewed as well.
      A physical exam is also performed to determine range of motion pre and post operatively (1 &
      2 years).
