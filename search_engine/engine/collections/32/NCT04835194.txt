      and treatment patterns of an emergingly common and high-risk population. At baseline,
      patients will be grouped into phenotypes. During the 12 month follow up, investigators will
      collect information on predefined outcomes, especially the all cause mortality and
      hospitalization for heart failure, thereby establishing the association between phenotypes
      and outcomes.

      The knowledge gained from the study is supposed to add valuable information on the
      feasibility of phenotype-guided approach for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
      in patients with hypertension and diabetes.
