      initial 8-week EMBARK massage program in order to collect preliminary data on the
      feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of massage in this patient group, in preparation for
      a larger grant submission to evaluate the effectiveness of massage for knee OA in the VA
      healthcare system. All veterans enrolled under this supplement will complete the initial
      8-week massage protocol, since this will allow us the maximum opportunity to assess the
      feasibility and gather preliminary efficacy data. Veterans with symptomatic knee OA will be
      recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center, and the remaining study activities will be
      completed at the Duke site of the EMBARK study.
