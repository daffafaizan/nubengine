    
      MRG-001 is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug, administered as a single subcutaneous (SC)
      injection. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of these 2 APIs in
      mobilizing and recruiting stem cells/immunoregulatory cells and promoting tissue regeneration
      in a wide variety of studies.

      MRG-001 is likely to target multiple aspects of the COVID-19. MRG-001 exhibits
      immunoregulatory and regenerative properties in preclinical studies with a wide variety of
      diseases. Repairing damaged tissues in the lung and other organs, restoring the anti-virus
      immune system and modulating the inflammation are obvious therapeutic targets for COVID-19.
      The combined phase I/IIa trial will involve 138 patients randomized into blinded placebo and
      MRG-001 arms, to determine the safety and efficacy profile of MRG-001 as the primary
      endpoint.
