    
      Inpatient:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms
      you may have had in the past 24 hours. The questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to
      complete.

      You will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. You should wear the
      exercise tracker watch on your wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while you
      are in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when you sleep. The iPod touch will be
      used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study
      team can view your activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the
      trackers to the iPod touch will be given to you and demonstrated by the research staff.

      The research coordinator will be available to help you with any issues you may have while
      taking part in the study and will call you to answer any questions. You will be called on Day
      3 (+/- 2 days) of the study and again at the end of the study. These calls should last about
      5 minutes each time.

      The wearable tracker will record your steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity,
      heart rate, and distance. You may choose to record the food you eat and mood. Your ability to
      keep wearing the watch will be measured.

      You should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. If it
      becomes too bothersome, you can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour.

      You should regularly clean the band and your wrist, especially after your rehabilitation
      sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not
      use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes or household cleaners
      which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate your skin. Always dry the band well
      before putting it back on.

      If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, you should tell the study staff right
      away. They will be replaced at no cost to you as long as you have followed the study doctor's
      instructions. After you complete the study, we ask that you return the devices to the study
      staff.

      Within 24 hours before you are discharged, you will return the devices to the research staff.
      You will be asked to complete the same questionnaire about your symptoms and a questionnaire
      about your experience with the wearable exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take
      about 10 minutes total to complete. If you are unable to complete them in person, you will be
      given the option to complete them over the phone or electronically after you have been
      discharged. If you choose to complete them electronically, your e-mail address will be
      collected so the survey link can be sent to you. We ask that you complete the questionnaires
      within 1 week after you are discharged.

      Information will be collected from your medical records about your daily living at the
      beginning and at the end of the study. Basic information, such as your name, date of birth,
      race, gender, economic background, and medical record number will also be collected.

      Length of Study:

      You participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of
      questionnaires.

      Outpatient:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 2 questionnaires about any
      symptoms you may have had in the past 24 hours and your current level of physical function.
      These should take about 10 minutes total to complete.

      You will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. You should wear the
      exercise tracker watch on your wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while you
      are in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when you sleep. The iPod touch will be
      used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study
      team can view your activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the
      trackers to the iPod touch will be given to you and demonstrated by the research staff.

      5 minutes each time.

      The wearable tracker will record your steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity,
      heart rate, and distance. You may choose to record the food you eat and mood. Your ability to
      keep wearing the watch will be measured. No identifying information will be used on the
      devices.

      You should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. If it
      becomes too bothersome, you can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour.

      You should regularly clean the band and your wrist, especially after your rehabilitation

      instructions. After you complete the study, we ask that you return the devices to the study
      staff.

      At the end of the 14-day period, you will be called by the study staff to remind you to
      complete the same 2 questionnaires about your symptoms and level of physical function. You
      will complete another questionnaire about your experience with the wearable exercise tracker.
      These questionnaires should take about 15 minutes total to complete.

      If you choose to complete these forms electronically, they will be made available online with
      a link on the iPod. You may also choose to complete the questionnaires over the phone.

      You will be asked to return the wearable tracker and iPod Touch to the research coordinator
      at your next routine clinic visit. If you are unable to return to the clinic, you will be
      asked to mail back the devices with the FedEx postage paid envelope provided to you when you
      started the study.

      Basic information, such as your name, date of birth, race, gender, economic background, and
      medical record number will also be collected.

      Length of Study:

      You participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of
