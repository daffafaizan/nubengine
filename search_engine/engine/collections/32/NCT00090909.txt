        -  Determine the response rate and maximum response in patients with relapsed or refractory
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone.

        -  Determine time to progression in patients treated with this regimen who are not
           undergoing stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8, cisplatin IV over 3 hours on day
      1, and oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
