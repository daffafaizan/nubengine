      affecting disease course and quality of life. Furthermore, nutritional status is often
      impaired due to dietary and plasma nutrient deficiencies, decreased muscle oxidative
      metabolism and impaired intestinal permeability. The investigators hypothesize that targeted
      nutrient supplementation can lead to gut-muscle-brain axis-mediated amelioration of physical,
      cognitive and mental health domains, resulting in a healthier lifestyle, in advanced COPD
      patients.

      Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The nutrient supplement is hypothesized to have beneficial effects on general
      health because it applies physical and mental health domains. The healthy lifestyle
      counselling aims to improve medical adherence, to address a healthier lifestyle and to manage
      weight loss which would contribute to improved general health. Risks and inconveniences are
      limited to the time investment associated with taking the supplements and measuring days.
      During the test-days various non-invasive measurements as well as minor invasive blood
      sampling will be performed. The investigators expect no risk of the nutrient supplementation.
