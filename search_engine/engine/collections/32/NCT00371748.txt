      the TAXUS Liberté-SR 2.25 mm paclitaxel-eluting stent. The results will be compared with two
      different historical control groups. The first control group consists of a subset of
      lesion-matched TAXUS V patients treated with a 2.25 mm TAXUS Express-SR paclitaxel-eluting
      stent. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes of
      TAXUS Liberté-SR 2.25 mm stent in de novo lesions versus the TAXUS Express-SR stent. The
      hypothesis is that the TAXUS Liberté-SR stent has non-inferior safety and efficacy to the
      TAXUS Express-SR stent in the treatment of de novo lesions in small coronary vessels. The
      second control group consists of a subset of lesion-matched TAXUS V patients treated with
      either a 2.5 mm or a 2.25 mm bare metal Express stent. The objective of this analysis is to
      evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes of TAXUS Liberté-SR 2.25 mm stent in de novo
      lesions versus the Express bare metal stent. The hypothesis is that the TAXUS Liberté-SR
      stent has superior safety and efficacy to the Express bare metal stent in the treatment of de
      novo lesions in small coronary vessels.
