      eligibility. Immediately after obtaining blood samples for baseline clinical chemistry tests
      wills, patients will initiate 5 days of canagliflozin (300 mg) treatment. Fasting blood
      samples will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic responses at both 48 hours and 120 hours
      after initiating canagliflozin. The principal pharmacodynamic responses will include 24 hour
      urinary excretion of glucose, serum chemistries (phosphorus, FGF23, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,
      parathyroid hormone (PTH), glucagon, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, procollagen type I
      N-terminal peptide (P1NP), and beta-CTX). Research subjects will undergo genotyping, and a
      genome-wide association study will be conducted to search for genetic variants that are
      associated with pharmacodynamic responses to canagliflozin.
