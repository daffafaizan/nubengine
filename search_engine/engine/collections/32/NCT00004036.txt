      produced by high dose cyclophosphamide and carboplatin in patients with advanced
      malignancies. II. Determine the effects of amifostine on the granulocyte and thrombocyte
      nadirs produced by this same regimen when administered with sargramostim primed progenitor
      cells. III. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide and carboplatin that can
      be administered with sargramostim primed progenitor cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine over 10
      minutes on day 0, followed by intravenous cyclophosphamide and carboplatin consecutively over
      5-15 minutes. Sargramostim is administered subcutaneously on days -7 to -2 and again
      beginning on day 1 until absolute neutrophil count is appropriate. Course is repeated every
      28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed. Nonresponding
      patients discontinue treatment after 2 courses. Patients are treated for a maximum of 6
      courses. Groups of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide and carboplatin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs
      in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next lower dose
      is declared the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
