    
      Forty patients with chronic cerebellar ataxia will be enrolled in a double-bind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial.

      By central randomisation, patients will take 50 mg of riluzole or placebo twice daily for 8
      weeks.

      Electrocardiogram routine laboratory tests and pregnancy tests will be performed before drug
      administration, after 4 weeks of treatment and at the end of the study (after 8 weeks of
      treatment).

      At the same time points the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) for
      pharmacological assessment of the cerebellar syndrome will be administered to the two groups
      (riluzole and placebo) of patients. To guarantee the evaluation of the results in blind
      conditions, the neurologists who will evaluate the ICARS scores will be different from those
      who will deal with randomisation and follow-up of patients.
