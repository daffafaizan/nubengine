      10 patients who meet the inclusion-exclusion criteria and after signing the informed consent
      document, in which the 4 researchers will administer the CPS during two sessions on
      consecutive days, with the objective of evaluating the test-retest and intra-observer
      reliability, minimize the differences of criteria in its application and, if necessary, write
      an instruction manual.

      Once each patient has signed the informed consent document and it has been verified that the
      inclusion criteria are met, it will be assigned an Identification Number (ID) that will
      relate it to your Medical Record (IDHC) by simple coding; The custody of the file with the
      relation of each ID with its HC will be borne by the principal investigator. Likewise, each
      observer will be assigned an identification number in order to blind the researcher who
      performs the statistical analysis. The patients included in the study will be evaluated,
      through the Spanish version of the CPS, by two of the researchers with an interval of 10
      minutes between each evaluation, repeating this same procedure the next day. These evaluation
      sessions will be carried out throughout the treatment period, repeating on days 1, 15 and 28
      of the period of admission of the included patients. Two researchers will evaluate the
      patients treated in the morning shift and the other two those treated in the afternoon shift
      of the Physiotherapy Service of the Guadarrama Hospital.
