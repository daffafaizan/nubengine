    
      Primary Objective Evaluate two de-escalated whole brain radiation dose levels (in the setting
      of simultaneous integrated boost to gross lesions) with respect to in-brain distant control
      for brain metastases, defined as an in-brain failure rate outside of the planning target
      volume at 6 months of < 20%.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate treated lesion control at 6 months for brain metastases in the setting of a
           predetermined total biologically effective SIB dose as determined by radiographic
           progression within the planning target volume with fusion and overlay of follow-up MRIs.

        2. Evaluate overall survival at 6 months for brain metastases in the setting of WBRT with
           SIB.

        3. Evaluate changes in neurocognitive function after WBRT with SIB in the following
           domains: verbal learning and memory as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -
           Revised (HVLT-R).

        4. Evaluate changes in health-related quality of life as assessed by the Functional
           Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-Br) after WBRT-SIB for brain
           metastases.

        5. Evaluate changes in performance status as assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status
           tool after WBRT-SIB for brain metastases.

        6. Evaluate adverse events after WBRT-SIB for brain metastases according to current CTCAE
           criteria.
