      I. To compare the stringent complete response (sCR) rate after 12 cycles among arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free and overall survival among arms. II. To describe the adverse
      event profile of each arm.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare sCR after 6 cycles and 24 cycles and quality of life among arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15 of courses 1-12 and
      day 1 of courses 13-24.

      ARM B: Patients receive bortezomib SC as in Arm A, cyclophosphamide orally (PO) on days 1 and
      15 of courses 1-12 and day 1 of courses 13-24, and dexamethasone PO on days 1 and 15 of
      courses 1-12 and day 1 of courses 13-24.

      ARM C: Patients receive bortezomib SC as in Arm A and lenalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days
      1-28.

      In all arms, treatment continues every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
