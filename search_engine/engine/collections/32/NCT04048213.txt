      characterized by myoclonic-astatic seizures which can be associated with myoclonic seizures,
      astatic seizures, absences and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures can be
      difficult to treat effectively and may lead to learning difficulties. During this study,
      parents of children with Doose syndrome will receive a questionnaire regarding learning
      disabilities, quality of life and epilepsy of their children.
