      experience menstrually-related mood or behavior difficulties and to describe the symptoms in
      this group and their relationship to the menses. This will be accomplished by means of
      clinical interviews, self-rating scales, and periodic evaluation of mood and endocrine
      function. We further wish to identify and recruit a subgroup of women with
      menstrually-related mood disorder for participation in specific
      neuroendocrine/neurophysiologic studies (companion protocols) in an attempt to identify
      endocrinologic or physiologic measures that might: 1) be associated with the discrete changes
      in mood and behavior; 2) distinguish this group from a group of age matched controls; 3)
      allow for further subgroup definition on the basis of predicted response to pharmacological
      intervention. Finally, we wish to identify a group of women with recurrent brief depression,
      who will serve as an additional control group for the patients with menstrual cycle-related
      mood disorders.
