    
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious condition characterized by compulsive overeating and
      feelings of powerlessness. The condition often has a negative impact on both physical and
      emotional health. This study will examine ways to help people determine whether they have BED
      and will test whether guided self-help (GSH) treatment is effective in treating BED.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either GSH treatment or usual clinical care
      (which may include general support and talk therapy) for 3 months. The GSH treatment is a
      cognitive behavioral therapy-based program that will be administered over 8 sessions.
      Participants receiving GSH will be given a book that focuses on dealing with BED; they will
      also meet with a therapist regularly to have their progress monitored. The Eating Disorders
      Examination (EDE), self-reports, questionnaires, and surveys will be used to assess
      participants. Assessments will be conducted at study entry, at Weeks 2 and 4 of the
      treatment, at the end of the treatment, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.
