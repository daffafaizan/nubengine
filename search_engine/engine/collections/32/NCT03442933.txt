    
      A crossover randomized controlled trial. The participation in the study requires only 2
      assistances to the data takings that will be developed in the training laboratory of the
      Faculty of Sciences of Physical Activity and Sport of the European University. 40 amateur
      cyclists will be randomly assigned to carry out each (2) conditions of intervention: a road
      bike time trial (CA) and a mountain bike time trial (MT) separated by 7 days washout.
      *Randomization marks the order in which participants are subjected to an intervention
      condition or other.

      These sessions will begin with an initial assessment, which will be carried out: an
      anthropometric assessment (height and weight), followed to an evaluation of the
      tensiomyographic variable maximal radial displacement (Dm) over the thigh muscles: vastus
      medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), and erector
      spinae (EE) at the lumbar level, before and after an acute effort (> 3 hours) in CA and MT
      bicycle. Respect to pain assessment, it will be measured the intensity pain perception on the
      lumbar region (LBPP) by using a 0 to 10 numeric pain-rating scale; the pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) with a manual mechanical algometer; and the functional disability caused by
      LBP through the Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ).
