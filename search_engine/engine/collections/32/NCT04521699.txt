      under going clinically indicated cardiac rehabilitation will undergo baseline testing
      including EndoPAT testing, mental stress testing, blood tests for cardiovascular disease
      biomarkers , physical assessments & survey questionnaires. Patients then will be randomized
      to either CalmioGO stress management device + standard of care treatment or just standard of
      care treatment. Those randomized to CalmiGO stress management device treatment will be
      instructed to use the hand device much like an inhaler once a day for 12 weeks. After 12
      weeks of rehabilitation both groups will return for reassessment of baseline tests.
