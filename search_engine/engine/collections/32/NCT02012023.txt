      placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the purse-string rings
      were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a small incision within
      the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the proximal end of the ileum.
      The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the outer purse-string suture. The
      outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to prevent leakage. Normal saline
      was injected into the air bag until the ileum wall. The investigators will test the pressure
      of airbag, and control the pressure of airbag from 30-40cmHg. The investigators then pulled
      the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The incision site in the ileum was approximated
      to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized by fixing the mobilized ileum wall around
      the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was accomplished using 3-4 interrupted sutures.

      In the CTI group, the tube will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic leakage occurred,
      the investigators will test the airbag pressure and keep the pressure during 30-40cmHg.
      Because with time went on, the ileum will dilated , the airbag pressure will go down, then
      the feces may go through the airbag plane and flow into colon and the tube ileostomy will
      lose its defunctioning effect.When the investigators control the airbag pressure, we can
      control the defunctioning effect of tube stomy. So it is called controllable tube ileostomy.
      The investigators will keep the tube until the anastomotic leakage was cured.
