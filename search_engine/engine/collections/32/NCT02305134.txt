      nonnarcotic antitussive in Japan since 1959. The safety of tipepidine in children and adults
      has already been established. It is reported that tipepidine inhibits G-protein-coupled
      inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK)-channel currents. The inhibition of GIRK channels by
      tipepidine is expected to modulate the level of monoamines in the brain. We put forward the
      hypothesis that tipepidine can improve attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      symptoms by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission through the inhibition of GIRK
      channels. The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to confirm whether
      treatment with tipepidine can improve symptoms in pediatric patients with ADHD.
