    
      This is a single-institution, non-interventional prospective observational study allowing for
      specimen and data collection. All participants will receive standard of care surgery and
      chemotherapy, determined by the gynecologic oncologist and per institutional protocols.
      Patients with a presumed diagnosis of an eligible gynecologic malignancy (epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or uterine endometrial cancer) who are being considered
      for neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to confirmatory biopsy will be given the option to enroll
      on this study.

      Patients will undergo standard biopsy or endometrial curettage to confirm diagnosis.
      Additional tumor tissue for research purposes will be collected at the time of biopsy (if
      safely available). Patients who are undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis will
      have the option to consent to allow excess ascites to be evaluated in this research protocol.
      Additionally, a research blood sample will be collected on the same day as the
      biopsy/curettage.

      After confirmation of diagnosis, chemotherapy administration will proceed per standard
      institutional protocol and surgical planning will be performed by the treating gynecologic
      oncologist. Excess tumor tissue and ascites from the cytoreductive surgery will be collected
      for immune profiling. An additional vial of blood for research will be collected within 3
      days prior to surgery. Post-surgical treatment and chemotherapy will proceed per standard
      procedures. After completion of post-surgical adjuvant therapy, an additional vial of blood
      for research will be collected (at next scheduled clinic visit).
