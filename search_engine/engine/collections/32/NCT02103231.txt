      for developing hypertension and having reduced exercise capacity. Globally, there are 15
      million annual preterm births. In Europe, incidence is 6-15% of all births, with up to 6
      million adults in the United Kingdom having a preterm birth history. Understanding the
      associations between early life exposures and this early cardiovascular risk is extremely
      important to be able to target primary prevention strategies.

      As yet there are no clear explanations for the reduced exercise capacity and elevated risk of
      hypertension reported in preterm born young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of
      young adult born premature demonstrated altered heart shape, with increased left ventricular
      mass, reduced cavity sizes and reduced stroke volumes. The changes in cardiac size identified
      from these studies is similar to those seen in other disease groups and has been equated to
      greater than 50% increased risk of cardiovascular clinical events in these groups. These
      structural changes may account for the reduced exercise capacity observed in preterm born
      young adults

      This study aims to understand the physiological determinants of limited exercise capacity and
      associated cardiovascular risk profile of adult preterm born populations.
