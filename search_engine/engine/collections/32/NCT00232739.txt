      study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-eluting Bx
      VELOCITYTM stent in patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions. A total of 100
      patients will be entered in the study. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled into the study. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 2,
      3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 6 months.
      Approximately 50 patients will be required to have an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      procedure at baseline and at the 6-month angiographic follow-up.
