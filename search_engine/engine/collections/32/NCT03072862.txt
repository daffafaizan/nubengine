      subject acting as his/her own control. Subjects are evaluated subjectively at pre- and
      post-operative intervals that coincide with their routine visits to the clinic. Outcomes from
      routine practice and application of cochlear implant intervention are recorded through
      observational measures using clinical standards scales used widely in geriatrics and
      audiology. The study is aimed at collection of data for patients who have already made the
      decision together with their implant centre clinician for an implant device from the company
      Cochlear. Patients are approached for study participation prior to surgery by the caring
      clinician on a consecutive and voluntary basis and on condition of signing the patient
      informed consent.
