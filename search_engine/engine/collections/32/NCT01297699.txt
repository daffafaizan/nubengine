      and periorbital soft tissues. Ten percent of patients with GO will have long-term serious eye
      problems.

      The cause of the GO is complex. Autoreactive T cells recognize an autoantigen, the TSH
      receptor present in the orbit and thyroid follicular cell, secrete cytokines (IL-6), which
      stimulate the fibroblasts to synthesize glycosaminoglycan, which draws liquid produce
      periorbital edema and muscle, causing exophthalmos.

      This approach suggests that inhibition of IL-6 can be an effective treatment for this problem
      on the basis that tocilizumab specifically binds to the receptors of the IL-6, both soluble
      and membrane-bound. Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit signaling mediated for IL-6Rm
      IL-6Rs.
