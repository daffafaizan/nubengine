      patients in the Royal University Hospital (RUH) Emergency Department (ED), to create
      excellence in health care. The purpose is to measure the impact of visiting therapy dogs on
      reducing ED patient pain.

      The background rationale is that pain is the primary reason individuals attend an ED, patient
      pain is generally not well managed in EDs, Saskatchewan EDs have among the longest wait times
      in the country, and anxiety associated with ED waiting can negatively impact patients' pain.

      Research suggests a therapy dog can change patients' perceptions of pain and its intensity
      and facilitate relaxation. The intervention will be examined for its impact on patients'
      sensory pain (i.e., physical pain severity), affective pain (i.e., emotional pain
      unpleasantness) and anxiety.

      It is important to find creative, low-cost ways to respond to patients attending the ED for
      pain. The primary objective of this study is to generate new health-related knowledge on the
      ED pain patient experience. The secondary objectives are to implement effective end-of-grant
      knowledge translation and dissemination strategies and undertake a successful model of
      collaborative, multidisciplinary research among researchers, patient advisors and system
      representatives, rooted in a One Health framework.
