      who were treated with TRT will be recruited to complete a comprehensive neurocognitive
      evaluation, overnight polysomnography evaluation, brain and neck MRI, cervical strength
      testing, and serum biomarkers related to cardiac disease. As part of their standard SJLIFE
      evaluation, they will also complete an echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests and
      questionnaires designed to evaluate broad health, emotional, socioeconomic and environmental
      factors that impact everyday life.

      The investigators will also recruit a comparison sample of healthy individuals matching on
      age, sex, race and body mass index. The comparison group will complete the comprehensive
      neurocognitive evaluation, overnight polysomnography, neck MRI, and cervical strength
      testing.
