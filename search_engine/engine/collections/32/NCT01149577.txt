      of six weeks of olanzapine treatment. Patients will be assessed at the baseline on BPRS,
      PANSS, CDSS and UKU side effect rating scales and a baseline 40 channels polysomnography will
      be done. After the initial assessment, patients will put on olanzapine treatment, in flexible
      dosages based on clinical response, for a period of six weeks when a final assessment on
      clinical rating scales and polysomnography will be done. The sleep data will be scored
      manually for staging based on Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria.
