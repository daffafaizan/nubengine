    
      Subjects will be recruited during the anaesthesiology consultation preparing to an elective
      surgery.

      First, subject will be asked to self-assess anxiety and comfort. In order to evaluate
      anxiety, subject will use a 0-10 rating Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 = no anxiety at
      all, and 10= the worst imaginable anxiety. The same scale will be used to measure the level
      of comfort where 0 means no comfort at all and 10 very comfortable.

      Subject should be positioned laying on a reclining chair during the session. This session
      will last for 30 minutes. After the experiment, participants will be asked to rate anxiety,
      level of comfort, level of immersion and dissociation.

      Several questions will be asked to the patient to evaluate his/ her experience, the Silva
      module, and the sensations experienced.

      The study will be ended by an evaluation of adverse event (AE) and the evaluation of the
      caregivers.
