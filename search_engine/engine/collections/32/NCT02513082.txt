      postoperative pain and it affect the delay of early mobilization which prevent knee
      stiffness, lessens hospital stay and improves overall patient satisfaction and outcome of
      TKA. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or epidural analgesia is a conventional
      postoperative analgesia. Recently other block techniques like a adductor canal block and
      femoral nerve block were known for good methods of pain relief after TKA. However, femoral
      nerve block reduces quadriceps muscle strength thereby potentially compromising postoperative
      mobilization. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of pain treatment and
      the preservation of muscle function after the procedure of adductor canal block and femoral
      nerve block.

      The present study aimed to determine and compare the efficacy of adductor canal block and
      femoral nerve block combined with general anesthesia on (1) postoperative pain control, (2)
      early patient ambulation and functional recovery and (3) change of muscle power after total
      knee arthroplasty.
