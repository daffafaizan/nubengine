      decompression of the bile duct is deemed potentially beneficial, previous randomised studies
      failed to show the benefit of early endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) except in selected cases.
      However, those studies did not use recent non invasive diagnostic methods such as EUS.

      Methodology: Patients in the study group undergo EUS followed by ES in case of common bile
      duct stones within 48 hours of the onset pf symptoms; The control group includes patients
      with predicted severe ABP undergoing conservative treatment or endoscopic sphincterotomy
      (without EUS) within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms in case of cholangitis or biliary
      obstruction.
