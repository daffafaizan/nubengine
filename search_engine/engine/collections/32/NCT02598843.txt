      of 10 weeks which allows the tendon to heal, or by an operation to repair the tendon.
      Research undertaken in the investigators department has shown that patients treated with
      surgery or with a plaster had similar chance of re-rupture of the tendon after treatment and
      gain a similar recovery. The investigators therefore now manage these injuries in a plaster.

      More recently, further research has shown that a new type of non-surgical rehabilitation
      programme, which is quicker than the traditional non-surgical programme, gave a tendon
      re-rupture rate that was similar to that after surgical treatment. This new rehabilitation
      programme uses a walking boot fitted with a heel-raise (instead of the traditional plaster).
      The potential benefit of this quicker rehabilitation programme is that it allows the patient
      to put weight through the leg immediately, whereas patients treated with the traditional
      plaster cast non-surgical treatment cannot weight bear (this means that they are kept
      non-weightbearing and therefore have to use crutches) for the first 8 weeks. The time spent
      in the walking boot in this new, quicker rehabilitation programme is 8 weeks while that spent
      in plaster is 10 weeks. This new non-surgical, quicker rehabilitation programme is referred
      to as the accelerated non-surgical programme hereafter. There are no known increased risks
      with the accelerated rehabilitation programme.
