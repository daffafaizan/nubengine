      Patients with PLS have slow voluntary movements. In PLS, degeneration of corticospinal tracts
      disrupts the communication between the motor cortex and motor neurons. Normally, voluntary
      movements are preceded by EEG waveform changes that begin before the movement occurs. These
      waveforms are called movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs). The first part of the MRCP
      represents neural activity in the motor cortex. The goal of this study is to determine
      whether the motor cortex and pre-motor cortex operate normally to generate these intrinsic
      signals for voluntary movement in patients with PLS.

      Study population: Patients with PLS of at least 3 years duration with slow finger tapping
      movements will be studied. Patients must fulfill the clinical criteria for the ascending
      subtype of PLS. They must also have a loss of corticospinal excitability as measured by
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Age matched normal volunteers will be studied as a control
      group.

      Design: Patients and normal volunteers will undergo a session of EEG recording while making
      slow finger tapping movements. They will have an MRI of the brain, for the purpose of
      localizing dipole positions of the MRCP components.

      Outcome parameters: The peak amplitudes of components of the MRCPs will be compared between
      patients and a healthy control group as the primary outcome measure. Localization of the
      dipoles of the components is a secondary outcome measure.
