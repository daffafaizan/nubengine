      such as those undergoing laparoscopic procedures in standalone outpatient surgery facilities.
      About 90% of the ambulatory surgical patient population at this institution is non-caucasian
      with the majority of the higher-risk patients having obesity and one or more additional
      chronic health conditions. In this randomized controlled study, the investigators hypothesize
      that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine in higher risk patients undergoing laparoscopic
      outpatient surgery in an urban, stand-alone ambulatory surgery center.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the "fit to discharge time in the PACU."
      The secondary objectives are PACU adverse events, use of additional medications in the PACU,
      0-30 day ED or inpatient admissions for a pulmonary diagnosis and patient satisfaction at
      discharge.

      In this double-blinded randomized controlled study, the study team is evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of sugammadex in patients undergoing ambulatory surgical procedures. Currently,
      both neostigmine and sugammadex are standard of care in this institution. Other than the
      emergent need for NMB reversal, practice preference and individual indications dictate the
      selection of reversal medication.
