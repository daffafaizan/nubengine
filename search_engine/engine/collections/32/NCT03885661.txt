      of statin-treated patients with residual triglyceridemia assigned to chronic daily exposure
      to icosapent ethyl 4 g daily vs usual care to get preliminary data to ultimately design a
      definitive hypothesis-testing experiment to clarify the mechanism of action whereby icosapent
      ethyl alters lipoprotein kinetics. The formal statistical aim is to develop statistical
      parameters such as central tendency, dispersion, and distributional shape to design a robust
      hypothesis-testing study. The primary outcome is based around stable-isotope lipoprotein
      kinetics, specifically apolipoprotein B kinetics.
