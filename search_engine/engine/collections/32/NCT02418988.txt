    
      Study design: multicenter, open-labeled, active-controlled phase II study

      Study treatments: TACE combined with rAd-p53 injection vs.TACE. The treatments are given once
      per 21 days until the disease progression. For the experiment group, 2 X 1000,000,000,000
      viral particles of rAd-p53 will be injected into the embolization artery.

      Study objectives: efficacy and safety of the study treatments

      Study endpoints: safety (adverse events, vital signs, lab tests, ECG and physical
      examination) and efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival, and ECOG PS)
