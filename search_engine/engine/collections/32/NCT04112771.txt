      surgery, and are associated with patients' dissatisfaction after anesthesia and surgery.
      Orthognathic surgery is widely performed for the correction of dentofacial deformities. PONV
      is common after orthognathic surgery. Despite of improved anti-emetic prophylaxis, patients
      undergoing orthognathic surgery are reported to have a high incidence of PONV, especially
      those after bimaxillary surgery.

      It is known that activation of central cholinergic system plays an important role in the
      development of PONV. Muscarinic antagonists such as scopolamine can block muscarinic
      receptors in the cerebral cortex and produce anti-emetic effects. Penehyclidine is a new
      muscarinic antagonists which selectively block M1 and M3 receptors. It has fewer adverse
      effects compared with other anticholinergics. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study
      is to investigate whether use of penehyclidine is associated with a reduce risk of PONV in
      patients undergoing bimaxillary surgery.
