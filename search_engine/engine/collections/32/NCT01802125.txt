      Prospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Patients from ARST0332 study Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine what proportion of unclassifiable sarcomas are unclassifiable because the
      initial evaluation was not sufficiently comprehensive versus what proportion can be regarded
      as "true" undifferentiated sarcoma when a comprehensive assessment has been performed.

      II. To develop formal diagnostic criteria for establishing the diagnosis of undifferentiated
      sarcoma.

      III. To determine whether undifferentiated sarcoma can be subdivided into separate and
      distinct pathologic entities that are distinguishable by light microscopy,
      immunohistochemistry, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling, or clinical
      features.

      IV. To determine whether undifferentiated sarcomas with specific "actionable mutations" can
      be identified based on their histologic appearance, immunohistochemical staining
      characteristics, or SNP array profiling features.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and SNP array profiling using
      microarray and immunohistochemistry.
