      7% in middle aged individuals and increases with age. It is considered an important
      independent contributing factor for the development of hypertension, diabetes and heart
      rhythm disorders. The prevalence of arterial hypertension has been reported to reach 50% of
      patients with OSA. OSA has been identified as the most common secondary cause associated with
      resistant hypertension. There is evidence that compared with older patients, the risk of
      hypertension in OSA patients may be particularly pronounced in younger adult ones (less than
      50 years).

      Traditionally, cardiovascular risk stratification in hypertensive patients was based on the
      average blood pressure (BP) measured in the clinic. Accumulated data has shown that
      target-organ damage is related not only to 24-h mean intra-arterial BP, but also to BP
      variability (BPV) in subjects with essential hypertension. Growing evidence demonstrated that
      BPV has considerable prognostic value for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes,
      independent of average BP. In addition, it has been found that hypoxia condition in
      pneumoconiosis patients was closely associated with exaggerated BPV in ambulatory BP.
      However, the selections of antihypertensive drugs remain yet not very clearly for
      hypertensive patients combined with OSA.
