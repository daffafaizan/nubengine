      iRADIOMICS) provides more information than standard anatomical imaging-based irRC analysis
      regarding the assessment of the effectiveness of immunotherapy and will have a stronger
      predictive power. It is widely accepted that molecular imaging (e.g. PET/CT) reflects changes
      in tissues much sooner than anatomical imaging (CT, MRI). Therefore, we expect that an
      immunotherapy assessment tool based on FDG PET/CT should outperform anatomical-imaging-based
      irRC also timewise. Although we do expect an initial increase in FDG PET uptake (mainly due
      to the metabolic activity of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)), followed by a late
      decrease, we argue that the predictive power of FDG PET can be even further increased by
      including an in-depth analysis of additional imaging features - the aforementioned "radiomics
      texture features". Many studies across different types of cancer have found a correlation
      between the presence of TILs and patient survival. Therefore we expect that iRADIOMICS
      signature of responders will be different from the irRADIOMICS signature of non-responders to
      antiPD1 immunotherapy due to the different levels of TILs infiltration, different TILs
      spatial distribution within the tumour, and different composition of immunosuppressive tumour
      microenvironment containing different levels and spatial distribution of various
      immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSC), regulatory T cells
      (Treg), tumour-associated macrophages (TAM), regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg) and others
      30. Thus we anticipate that it might be possible to assess the response to immunotherapy at
      just one imaging time-point, preferably already in the pseudo-progression phase, thus much
      earlier than with irRC. Based on the assumption that irRADIOMICS might be able to detect
      differences in tumour immunosuppressive microenvironment, we further hypothesise that it
      might be also possible to predict, which patients are most likely to benefit from anti-PD1
      immunotherapy already before the therapy.
