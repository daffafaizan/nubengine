      Yang-Style Tai Chi program or a standard group education program. Both programs met in a
      small group format for twice weekly 60 minute sessions lasting for 12 weeks. 99 subjects
      completed the protocol. Primary outcomes from the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were
      assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included pain intensity and
      interference, sleep, coping, and fitness tests.
