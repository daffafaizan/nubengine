    
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome population is an androgenic syndrome characterized by a wide
      spectrum of clinical manifestations such as obesity, hirsutism, insulin resistance, diabetes
      and presence of specific ultrasonic features.

      Cetrotide®, cetrorelix acetate, is an antagonist of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone
      (LHRH). Cetrotide® is registered in 70 countries (including France) for the prevention of
      premature ovulation in subjects undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by
      oocyte pick-up and ARTs. Ovitrelle®, active ingredient human chorionic-gonadotropin alfa, is
      administered to trigger final follicular maturation and luteinization after stimulation of
      follicular growth.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To compare the hormonal level of plasmatic estradiol on the releasing day (day of r-hCG
           administration) induced by Cetrotide® 0.25 mg/day started on Day 1 (Group A: Day 1) or
           on Day 7 (Group B: Day 7) of the menstrual cycle (Day 0 (S0) or Day 6 (S6) of
           stimulation) in PCO subjects undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the hormonal changes during the stimulation induced by Cetrotide® in A and B
           Groups

        -  To assess by ultrasound scans (US) the follicular development induced by Cetrotide® in A
           and B Groups

        -  To assess biological and clinical outcomes induced by Cetrotide® in A and B Groups

        -  To monitor safety of Cetrotide in A and B Groups

      The trial will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Once each subject has met all eligibility
      criteria, they will be randomly assigned in one of the two treatment groups.
