    
      Hypothesis one: A short course of chloroquine one week prior and four weeks after initiation
      of WBRT is tolerable and significantly increases the median survival time of patients
      suffering from brain metastasis as assessed one, three, six, nine, twelve and 24 months post
      radiotherapy, when compared to historic controls.

      Hypothesis two: The presence of one or both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in the
      gene coding for the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) improves the
      clinical outcomes of WBRT or the response to CQ co-treatment.

      3.2. Specific Aims:

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Determine patients physical profiles prior WBRT and at regular intervals afterwards up
           to 24 months after radiotherapy.

        2. Record the status of patient metastases (i.e. number, location, size)

        3. Determine patients' KPS values.

        4. Record the incidence and causes of mortality of patients.

        5. Determine the genotype of IDO2 for each patient.

        6. Following data analysis, test the validity of the two hypotheses.
