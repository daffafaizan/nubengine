    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of fulvestrant plus erlotinib versus
      fulvestrant plus placebo for subjects with metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed
      after first line hormonal therapy.

        -  Total number of subjects planned for the trial is 130 subjects, that is, approximately
           65 subjects in each arm.

        -  Subjects will be randomized to receive fulvestrant/erlotinib (arm A) or
           fulvestrant/placebo (arm B) and stratified based on accrual center.

        -  The study is a parallel-arm double-blind study, with fulvestrant + placebo on the
           monotherapy arm, and fulvestrant + erlotinib on the combination arm.

        -  The primary variable outcome is time to progression.

        -  Subjects whose metastatic disease was diagnosed more than 12 months after completing
           adjuvant hormonal therapy are eligible to this study if their breast cancer is
           hormone-receptor-positive and after disease progression on first line hormonal therapy
           in the metastatic setting. Subjects may have received no more than one line of
           chemotherapy. While receiving one line of hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting is
           a requirement, receiving chemotherapy is not, and one line of chemotherapy in the
           metastatic setting would not exclude these subjects from the trial. Subjects who had a
           recurrence while on adjuvant hormonal treatment or within 12 months of completion of the
           adjuvant hormonal treatment are also eligible without the need to receive first line
           hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting.
