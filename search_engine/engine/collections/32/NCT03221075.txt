      cross-resistance of Aspergillus spp. is an increasingly recognized problem. The study aims to
      determine the efficacy of antifungal therapy in patients with documented azole-resistant IA.
      On the basis of this study, it will be possible to assess the clinical implications of IA
      caused by azole-resistant versus azole-susceptible Aspergillus spp.

      The investigators aim at collecting at least 55 azole-resistant and 130 azole-susceptible
      cases. Cases diagnosed with an IA by culture from January 1st, 2016 onwards with an
      underlying hematological malignancy are eligible for inclusion. Culture of azole-resistant
      cases must be provided for confirmation of the species, sequencing for azole-resistance
      mutations and determination of MIC using the EUCAST reference method. Isolates obtained from
      patients with presumed azole-susceptible disease will be analyzed to confirm the wild type
      phenotype.

      Eligible azole-resistant and azole-susceptible IA cases will be documented using the
      web-based case report form. If there is â‰¥1 resistant isolate, the patient fulfills the
      definition of a resistant case. Patient level data will be recorded at the respective study
      centres in a continuous fashion. Data items to be documented will include: demographic data;
      type and status of underlying conditions; concurrent immunosuppressive treatment; diagnostic
      measures (clinical presentation, radiology, microbiology, pathology, organ involvement);
      medical and surgical treatment (including prior exposure to antifungals); response to
      treatment (clinical and radiological) at day 14, 42, 84; overall survival at day 14, 42, 84
      and at last contact; and cause of death (if applicable).
