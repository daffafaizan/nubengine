      hemiplegic shoulder pain includes rotator cuff injury, bicipital tendonitis, impingement,
      spasticity, limited external rotation of shoulder joint, adhesive capsulitis, shoulder
      subluxation, shoulder hand syndrome, and brachial/axillary neuropathy. Flaccidity has a
      positive association with soft tissue injury or tendon injury of the shoulder.

      In the preliminary study, base on the sonography results, it is found that the possibility of
      getting tendon injury or inflammation on the affected shoulder joint is higher in the group
      of patients who were with worse motor functions during the rehabilitation in hospital.

      In this study, one hundred acute stroke patients with hemipelgia will be enrolled. And those
      participants would be separated into 2 groups: control group (Brunnstrom stage IV-VI) and
      experimental group (Brunnstrom stage I-III). Clinical characteristics and physical findings
      will be recorded on the admission date. During the process, the investigators will use high
      frequency (5-12 MHz) musculoskeletal ultrasound to evaluate those tendons around bilateral
      shoulder joints on the admission date and at 2 weeks later. In the first year after stroke,
      half patients in those 2 groups will perform positioning training and passive range of motion
      for affected shoulder either during hospitalization or after being discharged. Then, the
      investigators will execute physical examination and use high frequency ultrasound to evaluate
      those tendons around bilateral shoulder joints of the participants twice after 6 months and
      12 months. Then, the investigators will discuss the incidences of shoulder tendon injury
      after receiving rehabilitation program according to ultra-sonographic findings.
