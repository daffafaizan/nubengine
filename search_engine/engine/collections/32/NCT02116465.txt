    
      Isicom® 100/25 mg and Sinemet® (Trade name in Germany: Nacom®) 100/25 mg are authorised
      fixed-combination products containing 100 mg levodopa plus 25 mg carbidopa. These two
      formulations were tested for bioequivalence in 1997 (DESITIN trial № LCD-010/K); based on the
      regulatory provisions in place at that time (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), the two formulations
      could be accepted to be bioequivalent.

      The present study is proposed to be conducted in order to verify and confirm the
      bioequivalence of Isicom® 100/25 mg (test formulation) and Nacom® 100/25 mg (reference
      formulation) in agreement with the pertinent regulatory guidance that came in place 2010
      (CHMP Guideline On The Investigation Of Bioequivalence - CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev. 1/ Corr -
      Jan.2010).
