      working in large, integrated delivery systems, and many are employed by hospitals and
      multispecialty group practices. These dramatic changes in the physician work environment
      raise important questions on how evolving physician payment and care delivery models support
      or undermine your motivation and ability to deliver high-quality patient care.

      To evaluate the impact of workplace changes on what motivates physician to deliver good
      patient care, this study aims to develop an accurate measure of physician work motivation.
      Simultaneously, the investigators plan to test hypotheses on the role of various workplace
      and psychological factors in physicians' work motivation. Namely, the investigators
      hypothesize that:

      20 to 25% of the variance in work motivation is explained by psychological needs
      satisfaction; 5 to 10% of the variance in self-reported overall health status and depression
      is explained by work motivation; 5% of the variation in work motivation is explained by work
      that is seen as a calling; and 5 to 10% of the variation in medicine viewed as a calling is
      explained by the learning environment.
