      Subjects and method One thousand two hundred and sixteen patients admitted to hospital with
      principle diagnosis of coronary heart disease and known or newly confirmed diabetes on oral
      glucose tolerance test will be enrolled. Patients in the intervention arm (n=608) will
      receive telephone intervention between clinic visits by diabetes nurse educator using
      structured counselling tools with particular emphasis on adherence to lifestyle modification
      and medications as well as self-monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure and body weight.

      be followed up by their usual medical teams in their hospitals upon discharge.

      hospitalisations. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations due to cardiovascular events,
