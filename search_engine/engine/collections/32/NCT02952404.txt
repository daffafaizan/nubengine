      morbidity. It has been associated with many long term sequelae, including urinary and fecal
      incontinence. Specifically, third and fourth degree lacerations are known risk factors for
      the development of fecal incontinence.

      Due to their serious impact, third or fourth degree perineal tears are a commonly tracked
      adverse event in obstetric care (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Joint
      Commission). As such, incidence data will soon be available to third-party payers and to the
      public on the Internet. Moreover, functional impairment after perineal lacerations continues
      to be a significant impetus for legal claims. Thus, reducing OASIS while preserving maternal
      and fetal outcomes is an important goal in clinical obstetrics.

      At the two TriHealth tertiary care institutions, the overall rate of OASIS is 3.5%. This is
      comparable, but not superior, to published rates at other centers. In fact, the literature is
      quite variable, with reported incidences ranging from 0.25-6%. Indeed, TriHealth has recently
      set up a task force to reduce these injuries as part of recent endeavors for quality
      improvement. Prevention is the first step in improving these complications.

      This study seeks to decrease the incidence of obstetric and anal sphincter injuries that may
      occur during the birthing process by bringing in a notable physician to review techniques
      with the obstetrics residents to help avoid these injuries then observe the deliveries of the
      women enrolled.
