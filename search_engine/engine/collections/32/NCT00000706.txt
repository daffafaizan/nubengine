      adequate amounts in their bodies. Probenecid and quinine may slow down the rate at which AZT
      leaves the body. Therefore, taking these drugs along with AZT may reduce the amount of AZT
      needed for treatment.

      In part I, four patients who are now receiving AZT at the usual dose take part in
      pharmacokinetic studies (how much of the drug enters the blood stream, what happens to the
      drug in the body, and how it leaves the body) of AZT defined after a dose while at steady
      state and then again after a new steady state has been reached following the addition of
      quinine sulfate. Part II studies the pharmacokinetics of AZT in eight patients receiving AZT
      at 1 of 2 doses and then at the lower dose of AZT plus probenecid with or without quinine.
