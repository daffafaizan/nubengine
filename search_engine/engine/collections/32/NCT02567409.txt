    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the addition of berzosertib (M6620 [VX-970]) to cisplatin/gemcitabine
      hydrochloride (gemcitabine) improves progression-free survival (PFS) relative to
      cisplatin/gemcitabine alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) with the addition of M6620 (VX-970) to
      cisplatin/gemcitabine relative to cisplatin/gemcitabine alone.

      II. To compare tumor response rate with the addition of M6620 (VX-970) to
      cisplatin/gemcitabine relative to cisplatin/gemcitabine alone.

      III. To compare safety with the addition of M6620 (VX-970) to cisplatin/gemcitabine relative
      to cisplatin/gemcitabine alone.

      IV. To assess the role of p53 status in predicting response to M6620 (VX-970)-based therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive berzosertib IV over
      60 minutes on days 2 and 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin as in Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 36 months.
