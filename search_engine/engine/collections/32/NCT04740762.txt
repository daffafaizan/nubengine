      welfare before and during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The problem can lead to
      adverse pregnancy outcomes and also cause a woman to experience psychological issues. Fear of
      childbirth can also influence the determination of the mode of delivery and can amount to a
      rise in cesarean rates.

      The healthcare provided by midwives and other healthcare professionals during pregnancy and
      childbirth have the power to reduce or exacerbate childbirth fears. The most significant
      midwifery intervention that can be used to diminish the fear of childbirth is counseling.
      There is a need to develop and test individual counseling models that require the basic
      training skills that midwives can use as part of their routine care to address women's fears
      and expectations about childbirth. The individual counseling program developed in this
      context may be an easy-to-implement and cost-effective method to use.

      This study was conducted for the purposes of developing an individual counseling program to
      help women cope with their fear of childbirth and testing the program for effectiveness.

      It was tested the hypotheses that there is no difference between the intervention and control
      groups of pregnant women after the intervention in terms of fear of childbirth, childbirth
      self-efficacy and state anxiety scores and childbirth outcomes (duration of labor, mode of
      delivery, elective and emergency cesarean rates, postpartum hypertension and need for a blood
      transfusion, the admittance of the newborn into the intensive care unit, preferences for
      future births and duration of stay in hospital).
