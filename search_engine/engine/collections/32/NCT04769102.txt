      stability and alignment (Macdonald et al.,2015), it is likely that it will become accepted
      that such modifications will affect the UL functional level , mobility and rang of motion.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of contoured cushions as
      adaptive seating intervention on Upper extremity function in children with spastic cerebral
      palsy.
