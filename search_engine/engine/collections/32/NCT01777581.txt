      radicular pain associated with lumbar disk disease. Milnacipran will be titrated based on
      efficacy and tolerability aimed at the higher end of the therapeutic range; a recent study of
      a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients with osteoarthritis pain suggests
      efficacy may be dose related. Patients are likely to have concomitant nociceptive lower back
      pain, and cotreatment with opioids, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs at stable doses will be permitted. Patients participating in stable
      regimen of physical therapy or biofeedback will be eligible. Procedural interventions (e.g.
      epidural steroid injection, nerve block, facet radioablation, acupuncture) during the study
      and 3 months prior will be exclusionary. Anticonvulsants, tramadol, and other antidepressant
      drugs will be excluded.

      The study is a ten-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of
      milnacipran (100-200 mg/day dosed twice a day) for radicular pain associated with lumbosacral
      disk disease.

      Outcome measures and safety assessments will be obtained at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10
      according to the protocol schedule of assessments.
