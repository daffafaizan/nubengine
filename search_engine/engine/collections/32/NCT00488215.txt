    
      This is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 32 healthy
      volunteers with two sessions (I and II). Each session consists of a run-in day for baseline
      assessments, 13 treatment days and 5 additional days for assessments. Subjects will be
      randomized to start with either the prucalopride or placebo session.

      Between the 2 sessions, there will be a washout period of 14 to 21 days, to avoid any
      carry-over effect.
