      Because ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal and uterine cancer spread in the abdominal
      cavity, giving chemotherapy drugs by infusion into the abdominal cavity may result in a
      greater dose of the drugs reaching the tumor cells. Intraperitoneal treatments will be
      administered through an implantable peritoneal catheter. These catheters are to be inserted
      into the peritoneal cavity, tunneled through the subcutaneous tissue, and connected to an
      implantable port, which is placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior, inferior
      thorax.
