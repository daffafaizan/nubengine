      children with moderate and severe TBI have long term sequelae including neurological deficit,
      cognitive impairment and behavioural disorders. In the acute care setting, neither clinicians
      nor researchers are able to adequately predict the long term outcome of children with TBI,
      consequently limiting their ability to tailor medical care, rehabilitation and support
      services. Improving our understanding of a TBI patient's exact cerebral status and prognosis
      is a critical step toward optimized and personalized patient management. In this research
      study, an innovative and integrated model will be developed to improve the prognostication in
      the early phase of a TBI. This model will combine key clinical variables commonly collected
      in the acute care setting and combine these with cutting-edge empirical measures: 1)
      biomarkers; 2) a new physiological monitoring based on heart-rate variability (HRV) to assess
      the integrity of the autonomic system; and 3) a computerized classification tool developed
      using the concept of artificial intelligence to continuously categorize the patient's
      cerebral status.
