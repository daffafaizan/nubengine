      failure. However, much higher doses of calcitriol are needed for any possible anti-cancer
      effect. DN-101 is a new capsule that contains 30 times the amount of calcitriol found in the
      currently available calcitriol capsule. In order to take an amount of calcitriol equivalent
      to 1 capsule of DN-101, cancer patients would need to swallow 30 pills of the approved, low
      dose formulation.

      DN-101 is a pill containing calcitriol, a chemical related to vitamin D that is immediately
      active in your body. The natural vitamin D found in dairy products or in typical vitamin
      pills, must be chemically changed by your liver and kidney into calcitriol before it is
      active. High doses of calcitriol had anti-cancer effects when tested in animals. DN-101 may
      have anticancer effects in your kind of cancer.
