    
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label, long term extension study evaluating the
      safety of topical Diacerein 1% Ointment for the treatment of subjects with EBS. At Visit 1,
      EBS subjects who completed the CCP-020-301 double-blind safety and efficacy study or
      participated in the CCP-020-101 PK study (feeder studies) who meet all the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible to complete 2 treatment cycles of CCP-020.

      Each treatment cycle will consist of 8 weeks on treatment (once-daily, at home study
      medication applications) followed by 8 weeks off treatment (only Investigator approved bland,
      non-medicated emollient/moisturizer, routine cleansing products and sunscreens) with a
      maximum of 2 treatment cycles allowed for up to 52 weeks.

      At Baseline Visit (corresponding to the final study visit of the feeder study), the
      investigator will perform a clinical assessment and determine if any of the subject's lesions
      require treatment (up to 30% BSA). If the subject has active lesions as determined by the
      Investigator's clinical assessment, the subject will initiate a cycle of once-daily, at home
      study medication application to their EBS lesions for 8 weeks (treatment period) followed by
      an 8-week period where no treatment will be administered. Subjects presenting with no active
      lesions (as determined by the Investigator's clinical assessment) will not begin treatment
      and instead, will be instructed to return to the clinic for re-evaluation in 8 weeks or upon
      worsening of EBS lesions, whichever happens first.
