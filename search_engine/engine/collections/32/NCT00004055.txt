      partial response rate in patients with previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung
      cancer. II. Determine preliminary estimates of survival in this patient population in
      response to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral topotecan on days 1-5 followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      on day 5. Beginning 24-48 hours after chemotherapy, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily for up to 10 days until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients who develop CNS
      progressive disease only should receive whole brain radiotherapy before continuing study
      treatment.
