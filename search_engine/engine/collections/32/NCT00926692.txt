      cells. This will be done by evaluating IgM secretion, surface markers, functional
      characteristics, V gene usage, N-region addition, and phosphorylation status of intracellular
      proteins, gene expression, sequencing of immunoglobulin genes, determination of antigenic
      specificity, replication history, and response to different stimuli.

      The goal of this project is to begin to the translation of decades of basic science research
      and research in the mouse model into the human system. It is believed that properly defining
      this B cell subset in humans will lead to better therapeutics, prognostics and prevention for
      a number of disease including infections, autoimmune disease, and cancer.
