    
      Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Project Health significantly reduces increases in % body
      fat relative to the Healthy Weight intervention and video control condition during a 2-yr
      follow-up; secondary outcomes are BMI, depressive symptoms and eating disorder symptoms. The
      investigators will also compare Healthy Weight to video controls.

      Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Project Health participants will experience increased
      cognitive dissonance (an uncomfortable psychological state) regarding eating unhealthy foods
      and engaging in sedentary behaviors, and that changes in dissonance mediate the program's
      weight gain prevention effects. The investigators will also test whether reduced calorie
      intake and increased physical activity mediate the effects of Project Health on change in %
      body fat.

      Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that intervention effects are amplified for participants with
      elevated body dissatisfaction (which should increase motivation change) and preference for
      consistency (which should maximize dissonance induction) and mitigated for participants who
      report emotional eating and substance use (because these factors increase risk for
      overeating).
