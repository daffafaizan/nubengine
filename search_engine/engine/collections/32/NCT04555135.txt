      detection assistance software based device during screening and surveillance colonoscopy
      procedures. The study subjects will be randomized to a procedure with or without the use of
      EndoVigilant software. While using this device, colonoscopy will continue to be performed in
      the standard manner as is done without the use of this device. The video signal from the
      colonoscope will be fed into a computer running the EndoVigilant software in addition to the
      standard video output to the procedure monitor. The gastroenterologist performing the
      procedure will therefore be able to observe a standard colonoscopy video on the primary
      monitor and the augmented video on the second monitor. The gastroenterologist may rely on the
      second monitor (with augmented video generated from EndoVigilant software) for polyp
      detection, but the standard procedure monitor with the original feed will always be
      operational and available for maneuvers such as fast insertion, polypectomy etc.

      The study will have an adaptive design with an interim analysis after 700 subjects to
      re-estimate the final sample size of the study.

      The study will include a diverse set of endoscopists across age, sex, years of experience and
      practice settings. In order to comply with FDA guidance this pivotal study will only include
      endoscopists with ADR of 25-40% in their routine clinical practice. At the discretion of
      Endovigilant, endoscopists with an ADR of <25% or >40% may be included for a separate
      exploratory analysis to examine the impact of the system on endoscopists with ADR outside of
      the FDA-mandated range. But in accordance with FDA guidance, the procedures done by these
      endoscopists will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis.
