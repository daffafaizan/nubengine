      hospitalised in medical wards. Based on this, several clinical trials with anticoagulants
      including low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux have been performed in
      patients hospitalised for acute medical illness to prevent thromboembolism. Interventional
      trials consistently showed that prophylaxis with anticoagulants reduces the risk of composite
      endpoints of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and DVT-related death.
      These results prompted recommendation to the use anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients
      hospitalised for acute medical illness, but, despite this, there is a widespread underuse of
      anticoagulant prophylaxis in the medical wards of hospitals.

      This observational multicentre study wants to evaluate the incidence of venous
      thrombo-embolism in acutely ill patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards.
