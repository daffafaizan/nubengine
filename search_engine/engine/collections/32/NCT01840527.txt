      drawn at the same time as your regularly scheduled blood draws that are part of standard care
      for melanoma.

      About 2 to 4 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for each research sample.

      Depending on which group you are in, you will have either a one time blood draw or ongoing
      blood work for 1-2 years.
