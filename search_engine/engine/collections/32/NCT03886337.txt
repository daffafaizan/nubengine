      therefore an important target for infection prevention. Visible light at 405nm has been shown
      to be germicidal. Investigators plan to install ambient, germicidal lighting (Indigo-Clean
      Lights) that uses this wavelength in 4 operating rooms. Patients will undergo surgery
      according to usual practice. Investigators will conduct a case-control study where patients
      undergoing surgery with the lights are matched with patients undergoing surgery without the
      germicidal lights. Patients will be matched by procedure then case duration then American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status health classification. These patients will
      undergo infection surveillance. Infection surveillance will involve use of National
      Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) checklists applied to patients who are positive for one or
      more of the initial screening criteria (elevated white blood cell count, fever (>38.4 degrees
      Celsius), office note documentation of infection, positive culture (sputum, blood, urine,
      wound, other body fluid), or anti-infective order within the 90 postoperative day period.
