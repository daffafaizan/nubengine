      pressure effects of a pragmatic combined training program, with low equipment needs, in
      comparison with a health education program. The sample is composed by 184 older adults,
      divided in two implementation centers. Randomization ratio will be 1:1 and interventions will
      last 12 weeks, with three weekly sessions for the exercise arm and one to the health
      education arm. In order to analyze the effects of interventions in a comprehensive way, a
      range of variables related to ambulatory blood pressure (primary outcome), physical fitness,
      vascular and autonomous function, together with emotional and cognitive aspects will be
      evaluated in a pre-post fashion. The study's hypothesis, as well as the sample size
      calculation and analysis plan, is based on a superiority expectation for the exercise program
      in comparison with the health education program, especially for the blood pressure control,
      functional capacity and quality of life. The present study was designed and will be conducted
      by a multidisciplinary staff and follows ethical and methodological recommendations for
      clinical trials. It is expected that this multicenter randomized trial will provide
      scientific evidences with a high applicability to the non-pharmacological management of
      hypertension in the elderly.
