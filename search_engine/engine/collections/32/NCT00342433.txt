      etiology for decades, epidemiologic studies in humans have not been able to confirm this
      hormonal hypothesis. Most of the studies used sere (blood) to examine the relationships of
      circulating hormones with subsequent prostate cancer risk. However, it is possible that
      circulating levels of hormones may not reflect intraprostatic and androgenic activity
      accurately.

      To gain further insights and to provide directions for future epidemiologic studies, the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) is conducting a comprehensive methodological study called
      Intraprostatic androgenicity in relation to circulating levels of hormone and polymorphisms
      of hormone-related genes: a methodologic study. The specific aims of this study are:

        -  to correlate circulating levels of androgens and estrogens with tissue levels (including
           testosterone, DHT, DHT sulfate, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol,
           estrone, and estrone sulfate);

        -  to determine whether the serum-tissue correlation is mediated by age, race, and selected
           epidemiologic factors, such as smoking and body size;

        -  to determine whether tissue hormone levels correlate with polymorphisms of certain
           hormone-related genes, including androgen receptor (AR) and SRD5A2; and

        -  to correlate circulating levels of hormones with intraprostatic androgenicity, as
           defined by the combined levels of tissue hormones, androgen receptor, and its associated
           protein (ARA70).
