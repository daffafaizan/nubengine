      pharmacotherapy. Nicotine patch is an FDA-approved cessation aid. The optimal duration of
      counseling and pharmacotherapy for patients undergoing low-dose CT (LDCT) lung screening is
      not clear. In addition, helping smokers to address other social and psychological barriers
      might help them succeed in quitting smoking. This randomized controlled trial will test, in a
      factorial design, two options for delivering each of 3 interventions to help current smokers
      stop smoking in the context of having routine CT lung cancer screening. Patients will receive
      4 or 8 weeks of behavioral counseling (with their choice of video conferencing or regular
      telephone calls), 2 or 8 weeks of nicotine patch, and will receive referral (vs. no referral)
      to an online resource to connect smokers to community-based social service resources. Outcome
      measures for smoking cessation will be assessed by a survey administered by phone at 3,and 6
      months.
