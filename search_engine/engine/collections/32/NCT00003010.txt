      metastatic breast cancer who have responding or stable disease after receiving standard
      systemic chemotherapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of marimastat compared with placebo in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer who have responding or stable disease after receiving
      standard systemic chemotherapy. III. Determine whether there is an association between trough
      marimastat concentration and time to disease progression and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified by the number of involved disease sites at study entry, prior chemotherapy for
      metastases, osseous disease only at study entry, and bisphosphonate therapy at study entry,
      and concurrent hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized into two groups.
      Patients take either marimastat or placebo, one capsule orally twice a day, approximately
      every 12 hours (i.e., during or after breakfast and dinner). The drug or placebo is given
      until the development of progressive disease or prohibitive toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 334 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
