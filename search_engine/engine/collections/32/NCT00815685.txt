      include getting full quickly when eating (early satiety), loss of appetite, weakness
      resulting in weight loss and loss of lean body mass. Even a weight loss of 5% in cancer
      patients reflects poor health, hospitalization, and a higher rate of illness. Research shows
      that the elderly are at higher risk for deficiency of vitamins and trace minerals. Other
      pre-existing chronic diseases and drug therapies in this population may increase the needs of
      certain nutrients. Recent studies have also shown that advanced malnutrition is much more
      difficult to treat in the elderly than in younger adults, and the consequences of failure to
      treat it delays recovery and can decrease function and quality of life. At this time, the
      ways to treat CC include giving medications to increase appetite and giving nutritional
      supplements that are high in calories and protein.

      Recent studies have shown that certain types of fats that are present in fish, walnuts and
      other foods that we eat called Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may help with weight gain,
      especially gain in muscle and improve quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer.
      However, EPA has never been studied in prevention of cancer cachexia in cancer patients
      showing early signs of weight loss. Based on these early, small studies, it is clear that we
      need to study if and how EPA can prevent loss of muscle and weight in cancer patients and
      prevent this from becoming worse.
