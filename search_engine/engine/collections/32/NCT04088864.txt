    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD22 CAR T cells for administration to
           children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD22 expressing B-cell ALL or
           lymphoma using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy system.

        -  Determine the safety of an established dose of CD22-CAR T cells in children and young
           adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      - Assess the clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in children and young adults with R/R CD22
      expressing B-cell malignancies, including overall survival (OS) and progression free survival
      (PFS).
