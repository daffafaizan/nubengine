        -  Compare whether screening with low-dose helical CT scan vs chest x-ray reduces lung
           cancer-specific mortality in participants who are at high risk for developing lung
           cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      NLST participants were randomized to either low-dose helical CT or chest x-ray in equal
      proportions. A total of 53,454 participants were enrolled (26,722 in low-dose CT and 26,732
      in chest radiography) at 33 screening centers across the United States. Screening was offered
      three times (at baseline and two annual follow-up examinations). The primary endpoint of the
      study was lung cancer mortality. The study arms were compared with regard to overall
      mortality, lung cancer incidence, and screening-related complications.

      All low-dose scanners and chest x-ray machines were certified for use and met NLST protocol
      requirements and American College of Radiology guidelines. Low-dose CT acquisitions and chest
      radiographs were interpreted by trained radiologists. Participants and their health care
      provider were informed of study examination results. Participants with abnormalities
      suspicious for lung cancer were contacted for information regarding diagnostic evaluation.
      Medical records were collected on diagnostic evaluation, medical complications, and initial
      treatment.

      Participants were then contacted at least annually by mail or telephone.

      The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) represents the union of two NCI-sponsored efforts,
      the NCI Lung Screening Study and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN).
