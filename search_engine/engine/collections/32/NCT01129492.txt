      iodine-replete areas. An autoimmune dysfunction causes humoral and cellular responses that
      lead progressively to thyroiditis. There is no effective therapy available that can change
      the natural history of CAT, which presents a high incidence of hypothyroidism and requires
      continuous treatment with levothyroxine (LT4).

      Laser light can be valuable since the local and systemic actions of low-level laser therapy
      (LLLT) have been shown to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid
      arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. There is also evidence suggesting that LLLT can facilitate
      regeneration of various tissues and, in animal thyroids, can lead to improvement in
      microcirculation and increases in serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels.
      Since the LLLT is a non-invasive, cost-effective and painless procedure, the objective of
      this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of LLLT in patients with
      hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, based on patients' thyroid function,
      their concentration of thyroid autoantibodies, and the parameters of their ultrasonography
      study.
