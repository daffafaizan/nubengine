      these people are currently being treated with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP) for their
      addiction and with medications for HIV infection. Tipranavir is a medication that was
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      HIV-infection. Tipranavir is given in combination with another HIV medication, ritonavir.
      Tipranavir acts by making it more difficult for the virus that causes AIDS to multiply and
      cause more damage to the immune system. Ritonavir acts by increasing the amount of tipranavir
      available to fight HIV.

      Earlier studies looking at the combination of BUP and HIV medications have shown that BUP and
      some HIV medications act differently when taken together. It is important to learn if taking
      BUP and HIV medications together results in changes in the blood level of either medication.
      If the HIV medication decreases the level of BUP in the blood, an individual taking BUP and
      HIV medications may experience symptoms of withdrawal ("dope sickness"), even while taking
      their usual dose of BUP. On the other hand, if BUP decreases the amount of HIV medication in
      the blood, then the HIV medication may be less effective in controlling HIV infection. It is
      therefore important to learn if tipranavir/ritonavir and BUP will affect each other when
      taken together.

      In order to learn about the effects of BUP on tipranavir/ritonavir, we will need to measure
      the amount of BUP in your blood for 24 hours after you have taken tipranavir/ritonavir and
      BUP together and then compare that to the amount of BUP in your blood when you are not taking
      tipranavir/ritonavir.
