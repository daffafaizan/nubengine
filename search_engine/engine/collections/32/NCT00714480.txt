      immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Induction therapy is used for the majority
      of persons receiving kidney transplant. In 2004, 72% of patients that received a kidney
      transplant also received induction therapy. This number is up from 46% reported in 1995.
      Anti-Thymocyte Globulin is the most commonly used agent for induction therapy. It was used
      for 37% of kidney recipients in 2004, and its use appears to be increasing year over year. A
      prominent example of this class of drugs is Thymoglobulin(TMG), a purified, pasteurized gamma
      immune globulin, which is obtained by immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes. The
      resulting preparation contains polyclonal antibodies directed against multiple T-cell
      markers, including CD antigens, HLA, and homing receptors.

      Although the mechanism of action for the immunosuppressive effects of TMG has not been fully
      elucidated, there is evidence that complement-dependent cell lysis and depletion,
      cell-surface antigen modulation, blocking of adhesion molecules, and partial T-cell
      activation/anergy may play potential roles.

      Many of the effects of TMG are evident in the peripheral blood compartment, including a rapid
      decline in circulating T-cells. Non-human primate studies have demonstrated that TMG
      treatment leads to depletion of T-cells via apoptosis in peripheral lymphoid tissues (spleen
      and lymph nodes), but no studies have been conducted to assess the effect of TMG in the bone
      marrow, and no studies have examined the peripheral lymphoid tissue in humans receiving TMG
      therapy.
