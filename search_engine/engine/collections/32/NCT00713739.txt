      visible on CT and KUB, and who are medically stable will be offered enrollment. Upon consent,
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of four outpatient treatment arms, randomized
      1:1:1:1 and include; Group 1 - Alfuzosin 10 mg daily, Group 2 - Nifedipine 30 mg daily, Group
      3 - Doxazosin 4 mg daily, or Group 4 - Prazosin 1 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint is
      stone expulsion rate and secondary endpoints are time to expulsion, need for additional
      intervention, degree of pain control, amount of narcotic use, and evaluation of study drug
      side effects. The treatment regimens consist of daily medication until the stone passes or 21
      days, whatever is shorter. Patients will also receive oral pain medication as needed.
