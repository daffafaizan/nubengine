      plans has on body fat reduction is important for several reasons. First, the details of this
      research study may equip the public with knowledge to select quality nutrition programs for
      weight loss responsibly. Second, it may encourage the wellness and fitness community to
      reconsider the practice of providing clientele with non-personalized meal plans for weight
      loss, which are not usually designed by accredited dietetic professionals. Third, this study
      may benefit dietetic professionals by opening the lines of communication between the wellness
      community and the dietetic community regarding standards of care, and protecting the public
      by dispelling harmful and erroneous nutrition advice.
