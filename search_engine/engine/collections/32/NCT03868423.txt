      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of brigatinib in patients with advanced solid
      tumors harboring genomic alterations in ALK (excluding lung) and ROS1 (all solid tumors).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors
      harboring genomic alterations in ALK (excluding lung) and ROS1 (all solid tumors).

      II. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
      advanced ALK or ROS1 mutated solid tumors treated with brigatinib.

      III. To assess sensitivity and durability of response to brigatinib in different solid tumor
      types.

      IV. To assess the role of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in the development of
      resistance to brigatinib.

      V. To identify candidate genomic (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA])
      and proteomic biomarkers of tumor sensitivity and resistance to brigatinib using
      high-throughput approaches (exome, transcriptome, reverse phase protein array [RPPA]).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of brigatinib exposure with efficacy and safety. II. Correlation of tumor and
      plasma biomarkers with brigatinib efficacy and safety.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 52 weeks.
