      platelet transfusions per day being administered while a patient is undergoing ECMO
      treatment.1 In general, a platelet transfusion is ordered for a patient on ECMO if the
      platelet count falls below 100,000/uL in order to prevent generalized hemorrhaging.1,2 The
      cause of thrombocytopenia during ECMO largely involves platelet adherence to the oxygenator
      membrane,3 but other mechanisms are also likely to be involved.4 Platelet transfusions carry
      risks as well as benefits.5 Infections with bacteria or yeast are the most commonly reported
      complications of platelet transfusions,6,7 but with multiple platelet transfusions the
      development or worsening of pulmonary hypertension may be another common adverse effect.8,9
      Pulmonary hypertension can be the result of administering biologically active
      pro-inflammatory proteins (known to be present in platelet transfusions) into the venous
      circulation. Of note, the first capillary bed encountered will be within the pulmonary
      circulation.

      It is likely that if fewer platelet transfusions could safely be administered during the ECMO
      run, the cumulative adverse effects of platelet transfusions would diminish and thereby
      patient outcomes might improve.
