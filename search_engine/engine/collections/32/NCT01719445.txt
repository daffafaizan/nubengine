      concerns identified by the reviewers of the first grant application. We will then test the
      RFPM's validity (accuracy) compared to the validity of pen-and-paper food records. Our
      experience and the literature indicate that the RFPM is acceptable and feasible in school
      settings. Following modification of the RFPM and pilot testing with 4 adolescents, we will
      test the reliability and validity of both the RFPM and food records when used by 60
      adolescents (12 to 18 years of age). During one week, participants will use the RFPM and
      during another week they will use food records (the order will be balanced across
      participants). The accuracy of each method will be examined by comparing energy and nutrient
      intake (collectively referred to as food intake or FI) to three gold standards: 1) doubly
      labeled water or DLW (energy intake only, or EIDLW), 2) a laboratory-based test meal
      (FILaboratory), and 3) food intake during lunch in a school cafeteria (FISchool).
      User-satisfaction and participant burden will also be compared between methods, and a
      cost-effectiveness analysis will determine if and under what conditions one method is more
      cost-effective than the other.
