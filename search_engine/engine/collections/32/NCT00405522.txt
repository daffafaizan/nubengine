      at the Hospital for Sick Children. In a previous study, we determined the optimal dose of
      remifentanil which provides effective anesthesia with little or no movement during LP in
      children. The present study will determine the optimal dose combination of propofol and
      remifentanil to keep patients comfortable and still during the procedure while decreasing the
      incidence of side effects and allows for shorter recovery times and earlier discharge from
      the recovery room.
