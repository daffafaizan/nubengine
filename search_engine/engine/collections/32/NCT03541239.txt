      organ, has shown to have protective effects against IRI in various organs. The protective
      effect of rIC seems convincing, but to date it is not clear which mechanisms give rIC its
      effects, and why effects are absent in some situations. Effects of rIC on the immune system
      are also not clear, but important if rIC is used in transplantation and autoimmunity
      settings, and also in regards to infection risk. Patients studied have often been given
      medical treatment and/or have comorbidities affecting the results.

      This project will measure how intracellular phosphorylation of STAT3, p38 MAPK, ERK and AKT,
      inflammatory cell patterns and cytokine production react to rIC in healthy humans, and
      potentially give a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate the protective effects
      of rIC. The intracellular mediators studied are involved in the initiation of cytokine
      production and regulate apoptosis and activation of the inflammatory cells. An altered
      balance between leucocytes and their mediators could be of importance for rIC effects,
      particularly in transplantation and autoimmunity, and this will be elucidated in our study.

      As a secondary end point the investigators will measure the effect of rIC on pulse
      variability and blood pressure using a non-invasive device, since evidence regarding these
      aspects is sparse, although documented positive effects of rIC have primarily been on the
      heart and vascular system.
