      symptoms of burnout within 3 months, as measured by self-report (survey), physiologic, and
      neuro-functional imaging studies.

      SPECIFIC AIM 1: To conduct a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of TM (N=40)
      vs. Control (CTL, N=40) in frontline HCPs. HCPs will be screened by a single-item stress
      scale and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). The Global Severity Index of the
      Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-18 Global Severity score will be used as the primary outcome
      for pre- and post-TM training (baseline, 1 vs. 3 months). SPECIFIC AIM 2: Evaluate changes
      (pre/post-treatment) in heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological measure of stress, and
      overall cardiovascular resilience) in response to TM practice versus CTL. Participants will
      be asked to wear an Apple Watch throughout trial participation to assess changes in resting
      HRV during meditative practice. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) refers to the changes in sweat
      gland activity that result from changes in an emotional state. A portable GSR device (e-Sense
      Skin Response) will be used to evaluate GSR score (baseline and 3 months). fMRI (N=20 for
      each group) will be performed by the Duke Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC).

      fMRI Protocol: The first 20 eligible (exclusion criteria: pregnancy, claustrophobia,
      reluctance to participate) patients from each group will be randomly assigned to get fMRI at
      baseline and at the end of the study.
