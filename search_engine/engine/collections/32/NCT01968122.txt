      approved by the ethics committee at the coordinating centre and by the local institutional
      review board at each participating centre. This study is initiated by the investigators, with
      20 participating stroke centres (see online supplementary appendix II), and plans to recruit
      300 consecutive patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the enrolment,
      all participants would be evaluated at baseline, day 4, day 30, months 6, months 9 and year 1
      (see online supplementary appendix I). The Wingspan stent system is provided by the Boston
      Scientific company and the Apollo stent is provided by the MicroPort Company, but they will
      not participate in data collection, analysis, editing or make decisions about the
      publication. This study is sponsored and conducted by the Cerebrovascular Disease Center of
      Tiantan Hospital in addition to its responsibility for data analysis. An independent Data and
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversees the conduction, safety and efficacy of the study.
