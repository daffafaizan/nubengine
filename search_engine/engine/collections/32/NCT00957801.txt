    
      4 groups of healthy men aged 60 - 85 years were studied over 15 days, in 2 distinct time
      periods, pre-treatment and treatment.

      Pre treatment week from study day -7 to study day -1. Treatment week from study day 1 to
      study day 8.

      Groups:

        1. Testosterone by injection (100mg testosterone enanthate) administered on study day 1.

        2. Testosterone by gel application (10g/day Androgel 1%) administered daily beginning on
           study day 1 through study day 7.

        3. Methylpredisone (Medrol) dose pack beginning on study day 1 (24mg) and decreasing by 4mg
           each day, with an additional 4mg taken on study day 7. Study day 1 (24mg), study day 2
           (20mg), study day 3 (16mg), study day 4 (12mg), study day 5 (8mg), study day 6 (4mg),
           study day 7 (4mg).

        4. Testosterone by injection (100mg testosterone enanthate) administered on study day 1 and
           Methylpredisone (Medrol) dose pack beginning on study day 1 (24mg) and decreasing by 4mg
           each day, with an additional 4mg taken on study day 7. Study day 1 (24mg), study day 2
           (20mg), study day 3 (16mg), study day 4 (12mg), study day 5 (8mg), study day 6 (4mg),
           study day 7 (4mg).

      Subjects were asked to fill out the Brief Fatigue Inventory daily for all 15 days.

      Subjects were studied at the clinical research center before treatment (study day 1) and
      after treatment (study day 8). Resistance exercise was performed on study days 1 and 8. Blood
      was drawn before and after exercise for measurement of serum cortisol. Subjects were asked to
      return to the clinical research center each day during the treatment week (study days 1-8)
      for blood draws for measurement of total testosterone, estradiol and C-reactive protein
      (CRP). Labs were drawn on study days 1 and 8 for complete blood count, comprehensive
      metabolic panel and lipid panel.

      Part 1:

      In this part of the project we will study the acute response to testosterone treatment
      between two groups of subjects, comparing two methods of administration (injection vs.
      topical gel) in order to obtain pilot information for a subsequent, randomized, blinded
      long-term investigation.

      Part 2:

      In this part of the project we will study the acute response to Medrol (methylprednisolone)
      taken over 7 days with or without testosterone (given as 100mg IM) in order to obtain pilot
      information for a subsequent, randomized, blinded long-term investigation.
