      sargramostim (GM-CSF), Montanide ISA-51, or QS21 as adjuvant in patients with advanced
      melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity of this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in
      conjunction with these 3 adjuvants in these patients. III. Evaluate the antitumor effects of
      this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (65 years and
      under vs more than 65 years) and previous systemic chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Arm I (Sargramostim (GM-CSF) as adjuvant): Patients
      receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine administered
      intradermally during weeks 1, 5, and 9. For each vaccination, GM-CSF is administered
      intradermally on days 1-10; the vaccine is administered on day 7. Arm II (Montanide ISA-51):
      Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine mixed with
      Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously (SQ) during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Arm III (QS21
      as adjuvant): Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine
      mixed with QS21 and administered SQ during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Patients with stable or
      responding disease may receive 3 additional monthly immunizations beginning 3-6 months
      following completion of 1 course of immunizations if there is evidence of T cell response
      against either wild type peptide. Patients are followed at weeks 13 and 17.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
