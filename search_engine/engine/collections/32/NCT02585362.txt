      and 3 month. After 6 month there will be an additional follow-up test point to assess the
      sustainability of the intervention. The 3-month intervention study consists of a physical
      exercise program and nutrition counseling in combination with a specially formulated whey
      protein supplement high in leucine. The standardized training program will be performed twice
      a week in the physical department of the Kantonsspital Winterthur (KSW) and once a week in a
      home based setting. Additionally, participants of the intervention group will be aks to
      consume 15 g of the nutrient supplement powder with approximately 150 ml water. On workout
      days the supplement should be taken twice a day and on the remaining days once a day. During
      the three month intervention study participants will take part in a nutrition counseling for
      at least three times.
