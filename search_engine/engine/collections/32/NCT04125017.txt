      cells to a temperature of -196 Â° C in seconds that produces glass-like solidification of a
      solution without crystallization, but by extreme elevation in viscosity during freezing
      Unlike the slow freezing method, vitrification has better results in a complete elimination
      of ice crystal inside the cells as well as in the surrounding solution -Also, it has a
      significantly higher post-thawing survival rate in comparison to slow freezing method
