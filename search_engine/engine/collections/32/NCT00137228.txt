      raters will perform three separate blinded measurements for hand edema using the
      figure-of-eight measurement technique. A third rater will then perform two blinded
      measurements using water volumetry. All measurements will be read and recorded by an
      independent recorder. The three measurements of rater 1 and 2 will be analyzed to determine
      intratester reliability. The average of the three figure-of-eight measurements will be
      compared to measure intertester reliability. The two volumetry measurements will be compared
      to determine intratester reliability. The average of the 2 volumetry measurements and the
      average fo the three figure-of-eight measurements will be used to determine concurrent
      validity.
