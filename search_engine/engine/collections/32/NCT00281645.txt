    
      There are two ways by which subjects could enter this study.

      Subjects who completed 12 weeks of treatment in two other double blind clinical studies of
      bicifadine (Studies 020 and 021, both in the United States) could roll over into this study.

      Also, de novo subjects (that is, subjects who had not previously received bicifadine) could
      enroll in this study.
