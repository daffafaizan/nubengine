      metformin are safe and effective treatment options for preventing diabetes among adults with
      prediabetes and overweight/obesity. Despite being included in expert clinical guidelines,
      these treatments are rarely used in practice and little existing research has focused on
      approaches for promoting their use.

      This novel intervention, delivered by medical assistants before patients' routinely scheduled
      office visits, consists of the following 3 components intended to promote initiation of ILI
      and metformin: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on diabetes risk and treatment options
      for preventing diabetes; 2) a "think aloud" exercise; and 3) formulating a preliminary
      treatment plan. Previous studies report that medical assistants can improve uptake of some
      preventive health services in primary care, which may also be true for ILI and metformin.
