      diabetes insipidus versus patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic accuracy.
      An oral test would be easier to perform, causes less risks and discomfort for the patients
      and would require less resources in clinical practice. This study investigates stimulation of
      the posterior pituitary gland by oral Macimorelin (a ghrelin receptor Agonist) to be a novel
      diagnostic test in the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.
