      morbidity and incurs heavy utilization of healthcare resources. The direct cost of hospital
      admissions related to COPD is the single largest source of expenditure in the public hospital
      system. This study assessed whether a short course pulmonary rehabilitation programme with
      periodic reinforcement exercise training and phone call reminders would help to increase
      physical activity in COPD patients and also decrease readmissions for AECOPD.

      Hypothesis: The above programme can reduce readmissions for AECOPD

      Design: Randomised control trial. Patients will be randomised to the intervention or usual
      care group

      Subjects: Patients discharged from hospital after an episode of acute exacerbation of COPD

      Study instruments: Activity monitor, quality of life questionnaire

      Interventions: The Intervention group will receive a short course pulmonary rehabilitation
      training as out-patient in the physiotherapy department for 4-8 sessions, 2 hours each time,
      1-2 times weekly. The training is scheduled in the way that each subject would have at least
      4-8 weeks supervised training by trained physiotherapist. Home exercise will be taught and
      the case manager will give phone calls to the subject every 2 weeks to provide support and
      reinforcement for having continuous exercise at home for one year. Patients will be invited
      to attend reinforcement out-patient physiotherapy training once very month or every 2 months
      if they are willing to attend.
