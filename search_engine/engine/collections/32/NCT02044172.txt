        -  To assess survival of patients with localized prostate cancer at 10 years and 15 years
           after treatment.

        -  To investigate disease progression (i.e., biochemical and clinical), treatment
           complications, and lower urinary tract symptoms in these patients.

        -  To investigate the psychosocial impact of cancer detection and treatment on these
           patients, including generic health status, quality of life, and sexual function.

        -  To estimate the resource use and costs of detection, treatment, and follow-up.

        -  To compare costs and outcomes of treatment in terms of survival and health-related
           quality of life.

        -  To collect samples suitable for basic science research (ProMPT study).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (50-55 vs 56-59 vs 60-65
      vs 66-69 years), Gleason score (6, 7, 8-10), and average result of recruitment and first
      biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests (< 6 vs 6-9.9 vs â‰¥ 10 ng/mL). Patients are
      randomized or select a treatment to be followed up in a cohort study.
