      influenza infection is that, physicians do not strongly recommend its applications to
      cardiovascular patients at risk. We evaluated the preventive impact of vaccination against
      death in severe congestive heart failure hospitalized patients.

      Methods and Results: A total of 117 severe congestive heart failure patients (New York Heart
      Association class III and IV) admitted in the first 12 hours who required ventilator support
      without endotracheal intubations and high doses of loop-diuretics, were included in a
      prospective, multicenter log, during the winter season. Congestive heart patients received
      intravenous vasodilators and loop-diuretics plus standard therapies, and then were randomly
      allocated in a single-blind manner as a unique intramuscular influenza vaccination or as
      controls. Death, and combined end points (death, and re-hospitalization for any reason) were
      assessed at 6 months follow-up.

      The first primary outcome - cardiovascular death - occurred in 3% of the patients in the
      vaccine group Vs 17% in controls (odds ratio with vaccine as compared with controls: 0.16; 95
      percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.79; p=0.022). The composite end point occurred in 33%
      of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 74% in controls, p = <0.001. The need of adding
      inotropic drugs occurred in 8% of patients receiving vaccination, and in 12.5% in the control
      group.
