      newborn[1,2], The main goal in the treatment of patients with Hirschsprung,s disease is to
      resect the aganglionic segment and pull down the Normo-ganglionic bowel[3]. With the
      introduction of minimally invasive surgery, classic pull-through techniques were modified and
      improved with laparoscopy, because of the obvious advantages of laparoscopic-assisted
      pull-through operations in form of reduced pain and improved cosmoses this approach has
      gained much popularity[4,5].
