      revision rate. A correct rotational (axial) alignment reduces patellofemoral complications,
      polyethylene wear and unexplained knee pain.

      A randomized controlled study is conducted to test if to use the TruMatch® (DePuy Johnson &
      Johnson, Warsaw, Indiana) patient specific instrumentation reduces the number of patients
      presenting femorotibial mismatch.

      Secondary goals are to compare:

        -  alignment in the coronal, sagittal and axial plane of the femoral component;

        -  alignment in the coronal and sagittal plane of the tibial component;

        -  number of recuts during surgery and surgeon's adherence to planning;

        -  blood loss;

        -  clinical outcome after two months using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS).

      After having signed informed consent, patients will be randomized in 2 groups preoperatively.
      A long-leg CT scan, according to manufacturer's instructions, will be performed on patients
      randomized to the TruMatch® group.

      Haemoglobin and haematocrit will be recorded pre- and postoperatively.

      Two months after surgery a knee CT-scan, anteroposterior and laterolateral scanograms will be
      performed on all patients, and OKS will be recorded.
