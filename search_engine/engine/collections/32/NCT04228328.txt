      sclerosis (MS) patients. The protocol for this test recommends a distance of 30 meters
      (6minWT30) to perform the test. However, this distance is not always available in practices
      and patients' homes. The aim of this study is therefore to validate a protocol over a
      distance of 6 meters (6minWT6) and to evaluate its reliability : intra-evaluator and
      test-retest.

      The project focuses on the population of walking patients with MS. Inclusion: adults,
      confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3 to 6.5, or be able
      to walk 30 metres with or without aids, good understanding of French, have already completed
      a 6-minute walking test, be able to give consent by signature.

      Exclusion: Lung disease, heart disease, co-morbidity preventing 6minWT, relapse in the last 3
      months, chronic fatigue â‰¥ at 8 (Visual Analog Score-Fatigue or Rochester Fatigue Diary).

      21 participants will be needed to obtain a good correlation coefficient, which is the
      objective of the validation of the new version of the 6minWT. The alpha was set at 0.01, the
      power at 0.9 for a correlation of 0.8.

      Each patient will enter the study for one week, corresponding to two visits. The participant
      will perform the 6minWT6 and the 360 Degree Turn Test the first day and the 6minWT30 followed
      by the 6minWT6 after up to 45 minutes rest, the second day, a week apart.
