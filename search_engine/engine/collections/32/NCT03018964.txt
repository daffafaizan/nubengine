      non-inferior study design(α=0.05, power (1-β)=0.90); comparing a complications rate between
      Solo-SILC group and conventional cholecystectomy group (Ca-SILC).

      Total of 272 patients who were undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder
      disorders will randomly assign to two groups according to a computer-generated table of
      random numbers Solo-SILC group using a laparoscopic camera holder (n=136) or Ca-SILC group in
      which a camera operator joins (n=136). .

      Demographics (i.e., age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology
      (ASA) score, indication for operation, need for conversion to open surgery or additional port
      will be recorded. Outcome including pain, hernia, complication rates, post-cholecystectomy
      diarrhea, operator's workload will be investigated
