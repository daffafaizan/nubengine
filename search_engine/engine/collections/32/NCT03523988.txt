    
      This study is designed to determine if the preemptive use of a combination of acetaminophen
      and ibuprofen is more effective in reducing pain following orthodontic tooth movement when
      compared to the use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen alone. Before their orthodontic
      appointment, participants will be administered acetaminophen (650mg), ibuprofen (400mg), or
      acetaminophen (650mg) + ibuprofen (400mg). Participants will be asked to record their pain
      intensity using a numerical (0-10) visual analog scale (VAS) during rest, light biting, and
      while chewing paraffin wax during the following time intervals: immediately following drug
      administration, 6 hours after, the morning after, and the second morning after orthodontic
      treatment.
