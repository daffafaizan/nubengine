      Principals at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and with full participation
      of the Steering Committee. One Freezel is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled
      trial with a goal to enroll and randomize a minimum of 90 study participants. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either PVI with a single freeze per pulmonary vein (1F
      Group) or to PVI with at least two freezes per pulmonary vein (2F Group). The One Freeze
      study's primary aim is to determine if one 3-minute cryoablation per pulmonary vein results
      in a lower composite adverse event score as compared to the traditional method of using two
      3-minute cryoablations per pulmonary vein.
