    
      This is a randomized, non-blinded, controlled, adaptive, multicenter, Phase II study in
      subjects aged â‰¥18 years and in good health or stable clinical situation that have received a
      previous single dose of VAXZEVRIA. Subjects will be randomized to immediately receive or not
      a dose of COMIRNATY in a ratio of 2:1. If primary analysis at day 14th confirms the starting
      hypothesis, subjects randomized to no vaccination will be considered for administration of
      one dose of COMINARTY at day 28th according to Public Health Department of the Ministry of
      Health recommendations on heterologous vaccination. In case the primary analysis does not
      confirm the starting hypothesis, subjects will be followed at the time points defined in the
      flow-chart without administration of COMIRNATY. Other heterologous vaccination strategies
      could be incorporated if deemed necessary for public health reasons. This could include the
      use of different vaccination strategies including those already marketed vaccines for
      comparative assessment of their safety and efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
