      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose of treatment with
      cyclophosphamide, alvocidib, and rituximab in patients with high-risk B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      II. To determine the feasibility of administering this regimen as an outpatient regimen in
      these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate, partial response rate, and minimal-residual
      disease-negative response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of alvocidib and dexamethasone as part of this regimen.

      III. To determine the immunologic effects of this regimen as measured by serial T-cell and
      NK-cell number, T-cell function, and immunoglobulin levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alvocidib.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1 (days 1-3 in course 1), cyclophosphamide
      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3, and alvocidib IV over 4.5 hours on days 1 and 8 (day 8
      only in course 1). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected periodically for
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
