      system, integrated in an expert diagnostic algorithm (TIS), to determine the sleep stages and
      identify respiratory events, compared to conventional polysomnography (PSG) in adults with
      clinical suspicion of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

      METODOLOGY: DESIGN: Prospective, unicentric, randomized and blinded study carried out into
      two phases: Phase I: Development of the tool in 99 full valuable adults with suspected OSA
      (PSG recruitment, coordination and quality control, image capture, Information and
      development of the expert system); Phase II: Validation of the tool compared with the PSG in
      another group of 99 full valuable adults with suspected OSA. INSTRUMENTALIZATION: a) Clinical
      history and anthropometric variables; b) Sleep and quality of life questionnaires; c) PSG; d)
      TIS; e) Cost-effectiveness study.

      ANALYSYS : The validity of the results of the TIS will be analyzed compared with the results
      of the PSG. The agreement measure will be established according to the different categories
      of the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and
      the area under the curve. The investigators will also validate the therapeutic decisions made
      with PSG compared to those performed with the TIS. Finally, a cost-effectiveness study will
      be performed.
