    
      This is a Phase I, randomised, open-label, three-way crossover study to assess the effects of
      oral pH on the PK of Sativex. Subjects will receive each of the following treatments in a
      random order across three residential treatment visits:

        -  Treatment A (acidic oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with Coca-Cola;

        -  Treatment B (neutral oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with tap water;

        -  Treatment C (alkaline oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with an oral
           suspension of magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia).

      The target pH for each treatment will be determined from the results of a pilot study.

      Each dose administration will be separated by at least seven days. Study subjects will
      participate in a total of five study visits.
