      with transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) failure or refractoriness.However,the median
      overall survival of those treated with sorafenib monotherapy was 16.4 to 24.7 months.

      Whether combining sorafenib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC) of
      oxaliplatin,5-fluorouracil and leucovorin is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious remains
      unknown, with no prospective clinical data currently available.The investigators therefore
      conducted a prospective and randomized phase II trial to compare the safety and efficacy of
      HAIC with sorafenib in patients refractory to TACE
