      FDA-approved antimalarial drugs. Recent studies have suggested that artemisinins also exert
      anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells. Artesunate (ART) is a water
      soluble semisynthetic artemisinin with improved pharmacokinetic properties.

      A single-center phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      oral Artesunate in patients with Advanced HCC.

      Approximately 15 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Dose-escalation protocol: The first
      patient will receive 200 mg Artesunate once-daily for 14 days. If no dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) is observed after 14 days, the next patient will start at a daily dose of 300 mg
      Artesunate. If no DLT is observed after 14 days, a cohort of 3 patients will receive 400 mg
      once-daily for 14 days. For each subsequent cohort of 3 patients 200 mg will be added to the
      dose, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
