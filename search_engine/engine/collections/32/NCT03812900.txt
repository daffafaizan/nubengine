      from Echinacea purpurea Herba and Radix; lozenges or spray) with two basic and authorised
      pharmaceutical forms (tablets or drops; comparator groups) for the treatment of acute
      symptoms of the common cold and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) in adults. Trial subjects are
      preventatively screened and included in the study (n = 400). If they show acute symptoms of a
      common cold or ILI during the study period, they are instructed to call the study centre to
      have confirmed the indication for treatment and begin with the treatment, they are randomized
      to (1:1:1:1 randomization into one of four groups). The primary endpoint is the time until
      remission of respiratory symptoms with the new pharmaceutical forms compared to the basic
      forms during the first episode. Secondary endpoints include remission of all treated episodes
      (max. 3 episodes), remission times comparison between different pharmaceutical forms (e.g.
      lozenges vs. spray, lozenges vs. drops etc), reduction of viral load on day 5 and 9 compared
      to day 1 of treatment (nasopharyngeal swabs), differences in safety (blood parameters before
      and during treatment), differences in number of adverse events, tolerance and efficacy
      assessed by the patients.
