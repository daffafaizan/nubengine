      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival rate at 6 months in patients with recurrent
           glioblastoma multiforme or other malignant glioma treated with temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and every 2 months for 2 years for evaluation of
      markers of neo-angiogenesis. Samples are analyzed by protein expression,
      reverse-transcriptase PCR, ELISA, and western blot. (Samples are no longer being collected
      and tested as of 1/12/09)
