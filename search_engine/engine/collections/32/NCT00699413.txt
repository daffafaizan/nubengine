      the increased rates of pediatric obesity, overweight children present clinically with
      adiposity related comorbidities such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The
      prevailing recommendations for overweight youth are to increase physical activity levels and
      limit energy intake in order to improve body composition. Currently there is little empirical
      evidence to support the efficacy of these recommendations. Alternatively, evidence in adults
      suggests that nutritional supplementation with (-) hydroxycitric acid (HCA), an organic acid
      found naturally in citrus fruits, and chromium may lead to favorable changes in body
      composition and improve glucose regulation. To date, these issues have not been tested in
      youth. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the effects of a
      nutritional education program combined with either HCA + chromium or placebo on measures of
      body composition and glucose regulation in overweight adolescents.
