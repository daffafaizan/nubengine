    
      The study is double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial and is composed from two
      parts. First part of the study aims to examine any difference in gut microbiota after
      postnatal antibiotic administration between the neonates who received probiotic Lactobacillus
      reuteri DSM 17938 or placebo and to compare the gut microbiota of patients to microbiota of
      healthy newborns. Second part of the study aims to determine whether probiotic L. reuteri DSM
      17938 supplementation to antibiotic therapy has any beneficial influence on incidence of
      functional gastrointestinal disorders of infancy and body composition and bone density 6
      weeks and one year after inclusion in the study.

      Additionally the associations of the clinical parameters with the composition and
      developmental characteristics of fecal microbiota during antibiotic treatment in children
      will be evaluated; relevant clinical data such as mode of delivery, child's nutrition, health
      problems, growth and developmental attributes which could be found associated with fecal
      microbial community, will be tracked and statistically evaluated for the investigated
      population.
