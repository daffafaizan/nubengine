      stress, hair cortisol, and migraine in adolescents. Although adolescents most frequently
      report stress as their migraine trigger, stress measurement and treatment are usually beyond
      the scope of routine clinical care. Hair cortisol levels may identify stressed adolescents
      who need structured stress management, as well as provide objective evidence for the medical
      community, migraineurs (i.e. individuals who experience migraines), and their families, who
      may be reluctant to accept stress as a migraine factor. The rationale for this research is
      that scientific validation of an association between stress and migraine will inform future
      prevention studies in the headache field and potentially identify a stress biomarker for
      migraine.

      This prospective study will enroll 67 adolescents (aged 13-17) with migraine and 33
      adolescents without migraine for 12 weeks with the following aims:

      Aim 1: Measure the relationship between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress in
      adolescents with and without migraine.

      Hypothesis: The association between hair cortisol and perceived stress (3 month averages)
      will be a positive in both adolescents with and without migraine.

      Aim 2: Measure the relationship between migraine frequency with perceived stress and hair
      cortisol concentration in adolescents with migraine.

      Hypothesis: The association between migraine frequency with (a) perceived stress and (b) hair
      cortisol will be positive in adolescents with migraines.
