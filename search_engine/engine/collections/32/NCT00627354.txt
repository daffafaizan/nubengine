      Primary

        -  Determine the palliative response rate in patients with hormone-resistant prostate
           cancer treated with mitoxantrone hydrochloride vs etoposide vs vinorelbine ditartrate as
           second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of palliative response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the biological response (PSA > 50%) in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression (biological and clinical) in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life and the impact on autonomy of patients over 70 years of
           age.

        -  Determine the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 5 minutes once a week for 3
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral etoposide twice daily on days 1-14.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral vinorelbine ditartrate once daily on days 1 and 8 and
           oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21.

      Treatment in all three arms repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
