      patients with NSCLC after completion of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Patients will
      be enrolled in this study if they have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR)
      or stable disease (SD) at least 4 weeks after completion of standard first line therapy.

      The following 2-step design will be used:

        1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose
           levels).

        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 6 patients for assessment of immune response
           levels.

      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless
      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Leukine Â®) will be used as adjuvant for 11 of the 13
      doses of UV1.

      After completion of the main study treatment period at week 26, if the patient agrees,
      additional vaccinations may be considered for the following patients:

        -  Immune responders within first 6 months

        -  Immune non-responders providing they have at least SD
