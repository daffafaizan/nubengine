      Musculoskeletal disorders cause economic burdens in the individual and social field. In
      addition, getting reports is one of the main causes of reduced productivity and work
      disability. Therefore, inexpensive and easily applicable screening questionnaires are needed
      to determine the patient population with high risk musculoskeletal disorders. The Örebro
      Musculoskeletal Screening Questionnaire is a practical questionnaire that can evaluate
      musculoskeletal disorders and is tailored to the WHO-ICF themes. For this reason, the aim of
      the study is to translate the Örebro Musculoskeletal System Survey-12 into Turkish
      intercultural translation and to investigate the construct validity, reliability and
      practicality.
