      outcomes of intraocular inflammation in children aged 16 years and below that presented to
      uveitis clinic in Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) from January 1989 to January 2017,
      will be retrieved from the uveitis database retrospectively.

      Data on demographics, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, secondary complications,
      treatment and outcomes will be analyzed using statistical software.

      The results will be compared with other published studies on different study populations.

      The results of this study will lead to an improved clinical practice with better treatment
      selections and an optimised monitoring protocol for follow up care for our paediatric
      patients with intraocular inflammation. This will lead to better clinical outcomes and
      prevention of serious sight threatening complications.
