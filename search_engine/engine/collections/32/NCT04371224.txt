    
      -  At the time of initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, resectable pancreatic cancer is
           around 20%, locally-advanced pancreatic cancer is around 25-30%, and the remaining is
           metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        -  In metastatic pancreatic cancer, Gemcitabine/Abraxane or FOLFIRINOX
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan/oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is most commonly used
           regimen as a palliative 1st-line chemotherapy. In gemcitabine-pretreated pancreatic
           cancer, irinotecan liposome(nal-IRI)/5-fluorouracil(5FU)/leucovorin(LV)(NAPOLI regimen)
           improved overall survival of patients compared to 5FU/LV. Now, NAPOLI is standard of
           care in gemcitabine-pretreated pancreatic cancer.

        -  Oral 5-FU such as TS-1 is used in gemcitabine pretreated pancreatic cancer patients or
           1st-line treatment in gemcitabine-intolerable patients.

        -  Capecitabine is oral 5-FU, which is commonly used in GI cancers, usually replacing
           intravenous infusion of 5-FU. It improves patient's convenience not requiring vascular
           access or hospital admission.

        -  In NAPOLI regimen, iv 5-FU/LV could be replaced with capecitabine. So far,
           nal-IRI/Capecitabine combination has not yet been tested.

        -  Based on these rationale, we plan to conduct the open-label, randomized phase 2 study to
           assess the safety and efficacy of NaliCap (nal-IRI/Capecitabine) compared to NAPOLI
           (nal-IRI/5-FU/LV) in patients with gemcitabine-pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer.
