      different Belantamab Mafodotin doses in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

      The study is comprised of two distinct parts: Part 1 will evaluate different doses of
      belantamab mafodotin in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in up to 3 cohorts
      and will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be further evaluated for safety and
      clinical activity in the dose expansion cohort (Part 2). The RP2D dose will be used for
      future studies in the transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed MM setting. Part 2 of the study
      will also evaluate an alternative dose modification guideline for corneal adverse events.

      Participants will undergo visits and assessments in accordance with the Schedule of
      Assessments (SoA).

      Overall, approximately 66 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participant follow up
      will continue until 5 years after the last participant is randomized. The estimated accrual
      period will be 12 months corresponding to an approximate total study duration of 6 years.
