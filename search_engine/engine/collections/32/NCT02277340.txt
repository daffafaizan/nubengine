      described for pilonidal disease. The curative rate may be as low as 65 % and the recurrence
      rate is at least 10 % after crystallized phenol alone application for pilonidal disease. The
      experience with endoscopic treatment of pilonidal sinus is only limited but at least 4 %
      recurrence rate was reported.

      In this study a preliminary group of 23 patients were treated with combination of these two
      modalities between February to May 2014 and at the end of 6-9 months follow up, there was no
      recurrence after excellent cosmetic results. Patients were all operated and mild sedation and
      local anesthesia. There was no serious complication but only some skin irritation was noticed
      secondary to phenol burn. Some patients felt mild pain and the pain was self limited in most
      cases where only a few needed oral pain killers. Some patients were observed to have mild
      drainage from the sinus but only two of them needed further application of phenol crystals.
