      interleukin-2 (IL-2) on CD4 counts in patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts above 200
      cells/mm(3). 60 patients will receive either antiretroviral therapy or antiretroviral therapy
      plus IL-2 administered by continuous infusion at a dose of 18 million international units
      (IU)/day for 5 days every two months for 1 year. Patients will be seen at the NIH every 4
      weeks, at which time immune parameters, including CD4 number and percent, will be determined.
