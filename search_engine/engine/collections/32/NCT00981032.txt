      involved in motivating behavior change (i.e., aspirin prophylaxis). While complex behavior
      change likely demands high levels of involvement, a single simple action (aspirin
      prophylaxis) may not require such complex interactions.

      We propose to compare the effectiveness of three models of care in a rigorous randomized
      controlled trial that will consist of a 3-arm, within-clinic design in which patients will be
      randomized to either the physician-initiated, the patient-initiated model, or to a control
      group in which usual care is delivered. In a patient-initiated model, patients are active
      participants in their own care and receive a pre-visit summary that contains an
      individualized risk assessment and patient education. In the physician-initiated model,
      patients receive the pre-visit summary and the physician uses a clinical decision support
      tool through the electronic health record that details the patient risk of CVD.

      The specific aims of the proposed work are to compare the reliability and overall
      effectiveness of two different methods for motivating patients to take aspirin to prevent
      stroke and heart attacks as well as to develop a plan for translating the intervention into a
      process that is suitable for a paper-based clinic.
