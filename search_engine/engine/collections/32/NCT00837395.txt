      quality of life than men with the same level of asthma severity. The etiology for these
      sex-related differences in unknown, but a subset of women has premenstrual asthma (PMA) with
      worsening of their asthma symptoms either prior to or during menstruation. Previous small
      trials have suggested that an increase in the host inflammatory response may correlate with
      PMA symptoms. We have evidence that small inhibitory ribonucleic acids, microRNAs,
      circulating in the peripheral blood of human patients may be expressed in different patterns
      in certain disease states when compared to healthy individuals.

      We plan to compare the patterns of microRNA expression in a well characterized group of women
      with PMA to those without PMA to determine if alterations in these microRNA patterns play a
      role in increased asthma symptoms in the premenstrual period. In addition, we plan to compare
      the levels of inflammatory markers in these populations to better define the specific subset
      of women that may be at risk for premenstrual asthma. By better characterizing these women,
      we hope to identify clinically relevant predictors that may guide therapy for women who
      suffer from PMA.

      Procedures to be used in this study include questionnaire administration, pulmonary function
      assessment, exhaled nitric oxide evaluation, urine sampling for pregnancy, and blood draws
      for microRNA and serum leukotriene evaluation. These techniques are utilized widely in
      clinical asthma research, and are associated with minimal risk.
