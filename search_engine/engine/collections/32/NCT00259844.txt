      patients is poor although cure can be obtained if disease is localised and operable. Patients
      with metastatic disease confined to the liver may achieve a cure rate of between 20% and 60%
      if these metastases are resited, but there is a risk that micrometastatic disease will
      persist post-operatively.

      TroVax consists of a highly attenuated vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara) containing
      the human tumour associated antigen ST4.

      The human oncofetal antigen 5T4 a surface glycoprotein expressed by placental tissue, but
      also by a wide range of human carcinomas including most colorectal and renal carcinomas. 5T4
      exhibits only low level expression in normal tissue and is thus a suitable target for immune
      therapy of cancer.

      This study will evaluate for the first time in man the immunological effects of the TroVax
      vaccine locally within a target tumour and in peripheral blood. Tolerability of the vaccine
      will also be assessed.

      Patients receive 2 intramuscular injections of TroVax at a 2 week interval followed by
      surgery 10 days later. Two further vaccinations are given at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery.
      Patients who show a response to the first four vaccinations are given 2 additional
      vaccinations 20 and 28 weeks post surgery.
