        -  Evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on disease progression in patients with
           idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral losartan potassium daily for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo pulmonary function tests with gas diffusion lung volumes, Carbon monoxide
      diffusing capacity (DLCO) tests, and 6-minute walk tests at baseline and then at 3, 6, 9, and
      12 months. Patients also complete baseline/transition dyspnea index questionnaires at
      baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
