      breast milk including BSSL or pasteurized breast milk without BSSL for the first 7 days.
      After a wash-out period of 2 days the patients will "crossover" to the other treatment
      regimen and receive an additional 7 days treatment. The primary efficacy measurements will be
      made by collecting stool during the last three days of each treatment period.
