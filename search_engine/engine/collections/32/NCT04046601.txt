      experienced examiners. The early detection is essential to determine the following treatment.
      Early stages of esophageal cancers can be treated by endoscopic resection (ER) whereas
      advanced neoplasia might lead to esophagectomy. Diagnosis is made usually by biopsies of
      suspicious lesions or untargeted quadrant biopsies. The electrical properties in inflammatory
      tissue and dysplasia can be sensed by electrical bioimpedance technique. The aim of this
      study is to compare the impedance probe with the histological result and to investigate the
      feasibility of the new technique in detection of esophageal cancer.
