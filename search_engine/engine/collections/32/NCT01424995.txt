      The eitiology of congenital trigger thumb is unclear with many authors proposing both
      hereditary and acquired causes2-4. Surgical release of congenital trigger thumbs has been
      recommended as definitive treatment, though controversy exists over the natural history of
      congenital trigger thumbs5-8. There have been a number of studies looking at the natural
      history of congenital trigger thumbs with spontaneous resolution rates ranging from 0-96%
      over a median duration of follow up that ranged from 6 months to 48 months9-14. Based on our
      clinical experience, the investigators do not feel that congenital trigger thumbs resolve
      spontaneously and that definitive treatment requires surgical release. However, the
      investigators need to do further scientific research into the natural history of trigger
      thumbs to determine how often trigger thumb resolves without needing surgical intervention.
