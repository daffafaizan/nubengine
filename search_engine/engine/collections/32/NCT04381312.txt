      novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in
      February, 2020, by WHO. The COVID19 is much more dangerous for people over 60 with a death
      rate of 3.6% after 60, 8.0% after 70 and 14.8% after 80 -and according to our Italian
      colleagues over 20% after 90- against 2.3% in the general population. The elderly patients
      exhibits more complications (ARDS, delirium, cardiac and renal insufficiency) needing
      intensive care, and often had multiple comorbidities and in particular: cardiovascular
      disease (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and
      hypertension (6%).

      Very few data are available the specific burden of Infectious diseases (ID) in older
      populations. The large majority of literature is often related to intrahospital or direct
      mortality and only recently arise the idea of indirect impact of ID particularly in that
      populations. In that meaning, ID may be considered as a trigger of other medical events such
      as myocardial infarction, stroke, or other specific outcomes such as functional decline; For
      the last 10 years, the Specific interest group " GInGer "( Groupe Infectio-Geriatrique ) a
      network of infectiologist and geriatrician SPILF/SFGG) carried out several studies on
      different aspects of ID in theses populations and recently demonstrated the indirect and long
      term impact of influenza and Clostridioides difficile infections. As an example, In influenza
      study, death-rate increases from 12,2 % in hospital related death to 25% at 3 months with
      high rate of complications (57%), high rates of rehospitalisation (25%) and functional
      decline (35%) leading to high increase in nursing home admission. The cost of these indirect
      impact is high and underestimated.

      Because of incidence and comorbidities rates, severity of the actual French older COVID
      19-infected older populations and because of the potential indirect and long term impact of
      COVID19 in these populations, it seems essential to know whether 3 month related death is
      largely higher as for influenza, to determine risk factors for intra hospital and long term
      death, measure acute and long term complications, and describe the impact of COVID 19 on
      specific ageing outcomes such as functional status at Month 3 (M3).
