    
      Subjects with front-line or relapsed NSCLC or relapsed HNSCC who are intended to receive
      standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors without a contraindication to Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to a single cancer deposit greater than 1 cm (metastasis or primary
      cancer) will be enrolled. Subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) immune checkpoint
      inhibitors and within 2 weeks of initiation, and will receive either:

        -  SBRT to target to achieve Biological Equivalent Dose (BED) > 100 Gy OR

        -  30 Gy fractionated radiation therapy (RT) delivered as a 3 dimensional (3-D) dose.

      The lesion choice will be made by the treating radiation oncologist and will be directed to a
      single malignant focus (non-CNS) that measures â‰¥ 1 cm. Essentially, the goals of both
      techniques are the same but SBRT is reserved for lesions that are readily encompassed by a
      single field with large RT fractions in which dose-limiting organs are within safe limits.
