      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Also, evidence is lacking on the consistency
      of dietary guidelines for overall health and CRC prevention given that it is not feasible to
      have an optimal diet for every disease. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling has not been
      widely assessed with respect to CRC risk. Metabolomics is uniquely suited to assess metabolic
      responses to dietary stimuli, given that it is situated downstream to all the other "omics".
      Building on prior work in hypothesis-driven dietary patterns and CRC prevention, the
      researchers seek to fill these knowledge gaps by proposing to: 1) use a standardized
      methodology to compare the best diet for overall health with the best diet for CRC
      prevention, and further determine if any associations of dietary patterns with CRC prevention
      are mediated by mechanisms involving inflammation and insulin; 2) determine metabolites that
      may mediate the association of dietary intake with CRC risk. The researchers will utilize two
      large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals
      Follow-up Study (HPFS), in which dietary and nondietary data have been collected every 2 to 4
      years among 173,230 women and men over the last ≥30 years, with ≥3,400 CRC cases and ≥43,800
      all-cause deaths. This integrated interrogation of dietary patterns and metabolomics data
      will inform the design of guidelines for healthful lifestyles that are optimized for CRC
      prevention.
