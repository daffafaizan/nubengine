      events regarding to obesity were analyzed. Data include age, gender, stroke severity,
      neuroimaging studies, cardiovascular risk factors. Within the inclusion period, all of the
      included patients were followed until censoring (10th of December 2011) or readmission
      because of recurrent stroke, cardiovascular event or death, whichever came first. The
      Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard model was applied
