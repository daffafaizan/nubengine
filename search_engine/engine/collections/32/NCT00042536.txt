      usually associated with increased age. There is substantial evidence available suggesting
      that noadrenergic and opiate transmitter systems are involved in regulation of sexual
      function. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects and safety of a
      potential novel treatment combination for ED consisting of both, the alpha-adrenoreceptor
      antagonist yohimbine, and the opiate antagonist naltrexone. The study uses a three-phase,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design. Healthy, male volunteers will
      participate. The effects of differing dosages of yohimbine (10 mg versus 20 mg) and a fixed
      dose of naltrexone (50 mg) on penile tumescene and rigidity, and sexual arousal are assessed
      in a placebo-controlled design. The anticipated risks of the study are considered minimal in
      relation to the importance of our increased knowledge about regulation of physiological and
      psychological aspects of regulation of sexual function and dysfunction. This novel treatment
      combination could be later also applied to patients with ED of different origin, e.g.
      organic, psychogenic, and mixed causes.
