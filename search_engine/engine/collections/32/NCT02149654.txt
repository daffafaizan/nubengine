    
      The study objective is to characterize the safety and clinical benefit of the Engager
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation System in a real world setting.

      The primary endpoint of this study is all-cause mortality at 30 days or during index
      hospitalization.

      Secondary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Device success according to VARC2 is defined as:

        -  absence of procedural mortality (all-cause mortality at discharge, 30 days or during
           index hospitalization), AND

        -  correct positioning of the Engager bioprosthesis in the proper anatomic location, AND

        -  Engager bioprosthesis performing as intended (no prosthesis-patient mismatch and mean
           aortic valve gradient < 20 mmHg or peak velocity < 3 m/s, AND no moderate or severe
           regurgitation).

        -  Composite early safety (at 30 days) according to VARC2 includes the following

           severe prosthetic valve regurgitation)

        -  Time-related valve safety accordingly to VARC2 at 6 months and 1 year is defined as:

        -  Structural valve deterioration

           and/or (DVI) <0.35 m/s, AND/OR moderate or severe prosthetic valve regurgitation)

        -  Requiring repeat procedure (TAVI or SAVR)

        -  Prosthetic valve endocarditis

        -  Prosthetic valve thrombosis

             -  Cardiovascular mortality at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year

             -  Incidence of TAVI-related complications at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year:

        -  Myocardial infarction

        -  Periprocedural and spontaneous stroke

        -  Life-threatening, major and minor bleedings

        -  Acute kidney injury state 1, 2 and 3

        -  Apical and vascular complications

        -  Conduction disturbances

        -  Conversion to open-heart surgery

        -  Unplanned use of cardiopulmonary bypass

        -  Coronary obstruction and dissection

        -  Ventricular septal perforation

      Subject population All patients with severe aortic stenosis requiring treatment, who are
      selected by a heart team to be treated electively with the Engager Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation System are eligible to be included in this study.

      Treatment The Engager Transcatheter Aortic Bioprosthesis will be implanted using the Engager
      Transcatheter Delivery System. The bioprosthesis is delivered transapically on a catheter
      during a beating heart procedure.
