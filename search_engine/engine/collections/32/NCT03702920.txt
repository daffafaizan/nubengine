    
      Approximately 380 subjects with cirrhosis, ACLF, and high risk of hospital mortality
      (ACLF-1b, ACLF-2, or ACLF-3a) will be included in this study after obtaining written informed
      consent. In case of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), written informed consent will be obtained
      from a relative or a legally authorized representative (surrogate).

      Randomization of subjects will be stratified by region (European Union [EU] or North America
      [NA]) and the 3 ACLF grades (ACLF-1b, ACLF-2, or ACLF-3a). Within each stratum (ie, each
      unique combination of region and ACLF grade), subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into
      2 treatment groups below:

        -  SMT+PE-A 5% (treatment group)

        -  SMT (control group)

      SMT + PE-A 5% Treatment Group:

      PE-A 5% will be performed using 5% albumin (AlbuteinÂ® 5%) as the main replacement fluid
      administered intravenously. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given after each PE-A 5%
      session to prevent coagulopathy.

      The exact number of sessions will be determined by the pattern of response (achieving
      complete response or no improvement/deterioration of ACLF) to PE-A 5% therapy. IVIGs will be
      administered to prevent the development of hypogammaglobulinemia and infection.

      SMT Control Group:

      The Treatment Period will be 7 days for all subjects and will be prolonged depending on
      subject's ACLF evolution to up to 17 days.

      Subjects in both the SMT+ PE-A 5% treatment group and the SMT control group will be followed
      for 90 days after randomization. During the entire study, the safety of both groups will be
      monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board.
