      sphincter saving procedure is contraindicated, or likely to be technically impossible.

      Recruited patients will initially undergo trial dissection by conventional sphincter
      preserving surgical techniques, which if successful will result in patients entering study
      arm 1.

      However, should this not be possible, a trial anterior perineal dissection will be attempted,
      with patients entered into study arm 2 if perineal dissection is adequate to allow full
      rectal excision, and preserve sphincter integrity.

      If during a trial of anterior perineal dissection it is decided that sphincter preservation
      is not safe, or will not allow eradication of rectal disease, conventional proctectomy will
      be performed, with patients entering study arm 3.
