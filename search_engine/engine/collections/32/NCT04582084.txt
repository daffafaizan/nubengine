      with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis received biosimilar
      etanercept 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly in real-world settings. Safety and
      effectiveness of biosimilar etanercept were evaluated in study participants for a duration of
      up to 12 months. Patient information was recorded in four notebooks, and each notebook had
      three sections, one section for each month. The first section of notebook I contained
      demographic information, pregnancy and lactation status in female patients, cigarette smoking
      and alcohol consumption, and past medical history. All safety and effectiveness outcomes were
      recorded at the appropriate sections of the notebooks.
