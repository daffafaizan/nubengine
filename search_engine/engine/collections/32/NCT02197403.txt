           sedation can't provide comfort to patient during surgery, otherwise excessive sedation
           can cause variable complications like respiratory depression or delayed awakening.

        2. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting Î±2 receptor agonist that is increasingly being
           used as a sedative for MAC and intensive care with mechanical ventilated patients
           because of its analgesic properties, "cooperative sedation," and lack of respiratory
           depression.

        3. Because of the different site of action between dexmedetomidine and propofol, we assumed
           that paradoxical excitement responses which appeared in heavy alcohol drinkers in
           midazolam or propofol-induced sedation might be less observed in dexmedetomidine-induced
           sedation.
