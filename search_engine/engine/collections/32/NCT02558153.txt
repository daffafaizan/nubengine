    
      Prospective multicenter randomized (1:1) Investigator Sponsored Trial, in which 150
      consecutive patients candidates for percutaneous intervention of haemodialysis access will be
      randomly assigned to one of two study arms:

        1. Treatment Arm: paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) dilatation using the APERTO-balloon

        2. Control Arm: standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).

      The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) for
      the reduction of restenosis in haemodialysis shunts compared to standard percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA).
