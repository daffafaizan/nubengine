      complications and long term major cardiovascular events, particularly in patients developing
      symptomatic neurologic ischemia after circulation shutdown.

      Establish and validate biomarkers which improve the predictive value of current risk
      stratification models for patients benefiting from carotid revascularization, outperform
      existing biomarkers, and reach clinical application standards.

      Clarify the pathophysiology of carotid endarterectomy-related stroke and the role of GDF-15,
      FGF-23, BNP and hs-troponin I and other biomarkers in the prognosis of symptomatic carotid
      stenosis.

      Imagiologic markers are to be included - intima-media; gray weale plaque classification,
      cerebral CT Peak wave velocity
