      among elderly populations in developed countries. Majority of AMD patients (80%) suffer from
      the dry or non-exudative form of the disease. Currently there are no approved treatments for
      dry AMD. Clinical development of therapeutic agents for dry AMD is limited by slow
      progressing nature of the disease as well as the lack of sensitive endpoints to assess
      therapeutic efficacy. Visual acuity, the commonly used functional endpoint, remains minimally
      affected during early stages of dry AMD. Thus novel visual function endpoints, that can
      identify functional deficits during early stages of dry AMD prior to development of
      geographic atrophy, are needed. In the current study a battery of visual function tests will
      be evaluated in subjects with different stages of dry AMD and normal controls, to assess
      their sensitivity and feasibility as potential functional endpoints for dry AMD.
