      prospective study. All participants with CI will be treated with 12 weeks of office-based
      vergence/accommodative therapy. The primary outcome measure will be the average peak velocity
      for 4Â° symmetrical convergence steps. Other objective outcome measures of disparity vergence
      will be time to peak velocity, latency, and accuracy. Changes in clinical measures [near
      point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence at near (PFV)] and symptoms will be
      evaluated.
