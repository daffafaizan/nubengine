      NC participants with HCV genotype (GT) 1 infection previously failing a DAA regimen of either
      sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir (LDV) [Arms 1 and 2] or elbasvir (EBR)/GZR [Arms 3 and 4] were
      randomized to receive either one of the following: 1) MK-3682B + RBV for 16 weeks [Arms 1 and
      3]; or 2) MK-3682B for 24 weeks [Arms 2 and 4]. Study Part A was completed as planned per
      study protocol. In Part B, C or NC participants with GT1 through GT6 infection previously
      failing any all-oral DAA regimen (GT1-6) or SOF/pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR)
      regimen (GT 3 only) were to receive MK-3682B for 16 weeks. However, the trial was terminated
      prior to participant enrollment for study Part B.

      Participants in MK-5172-017 (NCT01667081) were eligible for enrollment in the study.
