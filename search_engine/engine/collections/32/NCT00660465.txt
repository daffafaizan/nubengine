      arterial blood has a significant effect. A small increase in arterial PaCO2 level will cause
      a significant increase of CBF , followed by increase of O2 level . The main objective is to
      explore the effect of arterial PaCO2 level on regional CBF and brain O2 level, by using
      breathing exercises to modulate arterial PaCO2. The regional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent
      (BOLD) signal produced by MRI , will indicate the regional O2 level.
