    
      The investigators will ask to a patient and his/her family physician to complete in parallel
      a brief questionnaire at the beginning of the consultation:

        -  for the patient: self-evaluation of his/her vaccine hesitancy (with a 0-100 scale)

        -  for the physician: evaluation of this patient vaccine hesitancy (on the same 0-100
           scale) Each of these 2 questionnaires should be filled blindly from the other.

      The investigators will recruit 400 to 500 patients in 20 medical practices of general
      practioners.
