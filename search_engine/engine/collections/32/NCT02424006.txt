      collagen-phosphorylcholine(RHCIII-MPC) corneal substitute will be implanted in patient's
      corneas with corneal scar (leukoma) developed after infection, trauma or keratoconus using
      anterior lamellar keratoplasty technique, i.e. once patient's diseased anterior part of
      cornea is removed, either manually or with assistance of femtosecond laser, it will be
      substituted with proposed transparent implant. Control patients with same condition will be
      grafted with human donor cornea using the same surgical technique.

      The investigators will test the safety and the effectiveness of developed biosynthetic
      corneas. Overall 20 patients are planned to recruit. They will be randomized in two groups -
      10 patients will undergo RHCIII-MPC cornea implantation, another 10 will be impanted with
      human donor cornea. The patients will be follow-uped for 12 months.
