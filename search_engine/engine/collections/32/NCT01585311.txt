      heart rate and uncontrolled tachycardia using patients enrolled in the investigators
      prospective observational cohort study since the electronic medical record systems have been
      implemented. The investigators know that there have been periods when these electronic
      systems have failed, resulting in lost data. The investigators anticipate retrospective
      collection of hourly heart rate for approximately 400 SAH patients that will have ICU data
      and 3 month modified Rankin documented in our Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Outcomes Project (SHOP)
      database. The investigators will determine what percent of them have prolonged elevated heart
      rate and tachycardia. Prolonged heart rate and uncontrolled tachycardia has been defined as a
      heart rate greater than 95 for greater than 12 hours in one 24 hour period of their ICU stay.
      The investigators will conduct a ROC curve analysis to determine the appropriate heart rate
      and duration thresholds that are most predictive of poor prognosis after SAH. Patients be
      will stratified based on several criteria including admission coma score, early (SAH day 0 to
      3) or late (SAH day >=4) ICU admission, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage on admission
      CT, history of beta-blocker usage, age, and gender.
