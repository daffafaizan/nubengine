      technologies and with CPAP prescription. They follow up an adaptation session where an
      automatic CPAP machine is delivered. Patient's are titrated with this automatic device in 5-7
      days and are treated with the automatic device during 3 months.

      The other part of the follow up consists on a voicemail where the patient can contact the
      sleep unit 24h a day and on a tablet, with an special app where the patient's answer a
      questionnaire once two weeks.
