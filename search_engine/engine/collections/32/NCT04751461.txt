      their eligibility within 45 days prior to enrollment, randomization and confinement.

      Following the Screening Visit, eligible subjects will be scheduled for a check-in and
      randomization visit. At the check-in and randomization visit, subjects' continued eligibility
      will be confirmed prior to being randomized to a product use sequence and beginning their 6
      nights and 7 days of confinement.

      Starting on study Day 1, subject will start a Pre-study ENDS IP Acclimation Period through
      Day 2. Subjects will be asked to acclimate to each of the ENDS IP at least once, while having
      access to their usual brand (UB) cigarettes for ad libitum use. Starting on Day 3, subjects
      will participate in five separate Test Sessions for nicotine PK assessment, one for each ENDS
      IP. For approximately a half day prior to each respective Test Session (starting on Day 2),
      subjects will use their assigned ENDS IP for the following day's Test Session at least twice.
