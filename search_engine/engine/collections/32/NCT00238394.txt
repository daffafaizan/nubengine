      I. Determine the 6-month survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      hepatocellular carcinoma treated with AZD2171.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine tumor response and time to progression in patients treated
      with this drug.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate biological markers
      with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients experiencing disease
      progression within 5 years after completion of study treatment may receive additional courses
      of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 22 months.
