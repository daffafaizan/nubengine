      newly diagnosed or treatment-refractory patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following
      unsuccesfull resection and/or chemoradiation. The Phase I clinical tria,l carried out in a
      small, open-label study, demonstrated safety and promising efficacy. The purpose of this
      study is to gain additional information from a larger clinical trial aimed to recruit at
      least 20 patients with GBM. Patients may be newly diagnosed with GBM or are those who have
      been subjected to resection and/or chemotherapy or radiation, but without success. Patients
      need to have imaging records and health assessment prior to study enrollment. Those on
      chemotherapy or radiation can be in washout period or may receive immunotherapy concurrently.
      Patients will be administered daily dose of V-Boost oral tablet for at least one month and
      additional dosing can be envisaged depending on outcome of first month. The primary objective
      is to evaluate the effect on tumor size and progression free survival (PFS) in comparison to
      patients on standard of care.
