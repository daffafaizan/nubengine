      I. Determine the effect of megestrol acetate (MA) plus pterostilbene (PTE) versus MA alone on
      tumor proliferation (Ki?67) during the preoperative window in patients with endometrial
      cancer (EC) who are scheduled for hysterectomy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of MA plus PTE versus MA alone on histologic response during the
      preoperative window in patients with EC who are scheduled for hysterectomy.

      II. Explore biological characteristics of tumors to determine potential biomarkers which
      could select for treatment eligibility in future studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pterostilbene orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and megestrol acetate PO
      BID for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive megestrol acetate PO BID for 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks.
