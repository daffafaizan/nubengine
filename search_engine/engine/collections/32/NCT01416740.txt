      under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This
      is invasive, risks infection, and requires time and resources. It has recently been shown
      that the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances the joint cavity
      during an MRI and thus indirectly produces an arthrographic effect(Indirect MRA). The study
      will enroll patients who have already had a Direct MRA as part of their standard of care
      diagnostic test for shoulder pain, if it is determined by their surgeon that arthroscopic
      surgery is indicated they will be asked if they would be willing to have an Indirect MRA
      prior to their arthroscopic surgery. The patient will need to have a blood test(BUN and
      Creatinine)done to ensure kidney function is normal, and a serum and urine pregnancy test, if
      female, to ensure there is no pregnancy, prior to the completion of the Indirect MRA. After
      the patient's scheduled shoulder arthroscopic surgery, the results of the two MR arthrography
      techniques will be compared for sensitivity and specificity in detecting partial and full
      thickness rotator cuff tears, labral tears, long head biceps dislocation/tearing, and grade
      IV cartilage lesions by comparing the results to the actual arthroscopic findings. The Direct
      MR arthrography and arthroscopic surgery are standard of care and would occur regardless of
      this study, the Indirect MR arthrography is the diagnostic intervention that is
      study-related.
