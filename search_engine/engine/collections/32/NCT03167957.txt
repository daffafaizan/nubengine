      dosing in subjects with fluconazole-resistant vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).

      Approximately 16 women with fluconazole-resistant VVC will be randomized to either 200 mg or
      400 mg oral CAMB for 14 days. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the clinical
      cure rate, mycology eradication and responder outcome. The secondary objective of this study
      is to evaluate the safety of 200 mg and 400 mg doses of oral CAMB.
