      capable of de novo regeneration of pulp-dentin complex and restoration of normal pulp
      physiology in teeth with necrotic or inflamed pulp. This is a highly novel study that will
      bring the regenerative endodontic approaches to the next level. Furthermore,
      revascularization approaches, as delivered in today's endodontic offices, present several
      challenges, including lack of de novo pulp-dentin regeneration, and frequent occurrence of
      intracanal calcification. These findings attest to the limitation of revascularization as a
      regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) and necessitates advent of novel approach for
      functional restoration of dental pulp. The ultimate objective of the current study is to
      develop a new REP that allows for de novo regeneration of functional dental pulp, which can
      be readily performed in a chair-side manner.
