      ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear. Despite normal hearing in one ear, these
      individuals experience reduced speech perception in noise, variable abilities on localization
      tasks, increased reports of hearing handicap, reduced quality of life, and often, they obtain
      limited or no benefit from conventional amplification. In the United States, the prevalence
      of UHL in children ranges from 0.03% to 3%, depending on the age of the child.

      Cochlear implantation performed for children with bilateral, severe to profound deafness has
      significant impacts on several aspects of child development.

      The practice of providing cochlear implants to children who have significant hearing loss in
      one ear is of great interest and is occurring with greater frequency as reported in case
      studies and small set clinical reports. The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to
      demonstrate the effectiveness of cochlear implantation in children, age 3 years 6 months to 6
      years, 6 months, with moderate to profound UHL. Postoperative results will be evaluated with
      speech perception measures, localization tasks, hearing in noise tasks, and subjective
      reports.
