      recovery and rehabilitation in patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore,
      patients who suffered from severe postoperative pain and emesis tend to be dissatisfied with
      their surgical treatments. Although contemporary protocols to control perioperative pain and
      emesis after TKA have been reported to substantially reduce postoperative pain and emesis
      compared with traditional measures, pain and emesis after TKA remain to be a challenging
      issue for patients and health care providers. In our previous study, the use of Ramosetron
      was found to reduce postoperative emetic events, but the antiemetic effects by Ramosetron
      were incomplete. In search of a further antiemetic measure, we identified the use of
      dexamethasone as the additional measure fortifying our antiemetic protocol using Ramosetron.
