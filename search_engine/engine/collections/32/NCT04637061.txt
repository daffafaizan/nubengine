      primary anastomosis for rectal cancer selected for the study will udergo a surgical
      intra-operative assessment of the anastomosis based on the check of the following 4 items
      (4-check):

        1. Extra-luminal (serosa) evaluation of the proximal colon and distal rectal stump
           perfusion based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the near infrared (NIR) indocyanine
           green (ICG)-induced fluorescence angiography (FA).

        2. Endo-luminal (mucosal) evaluation of the proximal colon and distal rectal stump
           perfusion based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the NIR-ICG-induced FA.

        3. Air leak test (extra-luminal and reverse).

        4. Assessment of the anastomotic donuts. aiming to test the efficacy of the procedure
           (overall incidence of intra-operative anastomosis repairs) and the overall incidence of
           anastomotic failure
