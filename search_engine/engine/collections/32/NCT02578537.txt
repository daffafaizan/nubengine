      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, clopidogrel is being questioned for its
      insufficient platelet inhibition and residual platelet reactivity, especially in patients
      with impaired renal function. Ticagrelor, a new P2Y12 receptor antagonist, achieve faster,
      consistent and higher platelet inhibition than clopidogrel, which was more noticeable in
      patients with ACS combining chronic kidney disease(CKD). Nonetheless, the pharmacokinetic
      properties of ticagrelor in the patients with CKD and NSTE-ACS, to the best of the
      investigators' knowledge, has not been thoroughly studied. This study was designed to provide
      PK and PD data of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, in order to estimate that ticagrelor
      is superior to clopidogrel in getting better inhibition of platelet in patients with CKD and
      NSTE-ACS. The potential hypothesis is to evaluate the correlation of platelet inhibition and
      renal function and CYP2C19 gene type in patients treated by ticagrelor and clopidogrel. P2Y12
      inhibitor na√Øve patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 ) and NSTE-ACS will be enrolled in
      this single-center, prospective, randomized, parallel study and randomly assigned in a
      one-to-one ratio to receive ticagrelor or clopidogrel on top of chronic aspirin treatment.
      The primary endpoint was the PRU by Verify Now at 30 days after loading dose.
