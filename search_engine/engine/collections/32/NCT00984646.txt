      intradermal Prevascar. Subjects had four 1cm incisional wounds made on the inner aspect of
      each upper arm (eight in total), giving four sets of anatomically paired wound sites per
      subject. Each subject acted as their own control with one site from each wound pair randomly
      treated with intradermal Prevascar and the other treated with Placebo (vehicle) or Standard
      Care.

      Intradermal Prevascar was administered at 100μl per linear cm of wound site prior to wounding
      on Day 0 and 100μl per linear cm to each wound margin 24 hours later on Day 1. Group 1
      subjects received doses of 5, 50, 250 and 1000ng/100μl and group 2 subjects received 25, 125,
      500 and 2000ng/100μl.

      Subjects in each group were also randomised into two control subgroups to receive either
      100μl/linear cm intradermal placebo (Subgroup 1) or Standard Care alone (Subgroup 2) at
      control wound sites.

      Subjects returned for follow-up at Day 14, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12.
