      The randomized controlled trial is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferior, randomized
      controlled trial. The control device (RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent) used in this trial
      was provided by Medtronic. RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent has been already approved by
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2009 and become commercially available in
      Chinese market. 400 patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly assigned to CRE8 group
      (n=200) and RESOLUTE group (n=200) in a 1:1 ratio. The long stent observational trial plans
      to enroll 30 consecutive patients. Patients in the observational cohort will receive the long
      CRE8 stent with length 38mm.All 430 patients will be required to receive clinical follow-up
      at 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and annually up to 5 years after the procedure, and
      angiographic follow-up at 9 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint is in-stent LLL
      at 9 months after the procedure, and the secondary endpoints are device success rate,
      device-oriented cardiovascular composite endpoint, patient-oriented cardiovascular composite
      endpoint and stent thrombosis.
