      global pandemic. Current research showed that SARS-Cov2 virus invades human cells via the
      receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through scRNA-seq data analyses. The study
      identified the organs that are at risk and are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore,
      cells with ACE2 receptor distribution may become host cells for the virus and cause
      inflammatory response in related organs and tissues, such as the tongue mucosa and salivary
      glands. These results suggest that oral mucosa could be a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection .

      Although many authors reported the presence of oral lesion associated with SARS-CoV2
      infection, the prevalence of the oral manifestation and the range of oral manifestation are
      still unknown. Further studies are necessary to better understanding of the symptoms of the
      SARS-CoV2 virus in order to faster detection. A multidisciplinary team following the patients
      could be the key in treatment of the infection and faster recovery.
