    
      The primary study objective was addressed by calculating the Area Under the
      Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) from week 0 (prior to DMPA injection) to week 12 (twelve weeks
      after DMPA injection) in our study participants.

      DMPA was supplied and administered as part of the protocol, however Kaletra was not. It was
      required that participants already be on a Kaletra based regimen prior to entering the study,
      as described in the eligibility criteria.

      Arm A of AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5093, which consisted of 14 participants who were
      administered DMPA without Kaletra, was used as reference data.
