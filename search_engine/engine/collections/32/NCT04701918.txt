      study the combination of pembrolizumab and cryoablation on people with urothelial carcinoma,
      including bladder cancer, that has spread.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both cryoablation and pembrolizumab
      as a treatment option for urothelial carcinoma, including bladder cancer, that has spread.
      However, the FDA has not yet approved the combination of the drug, pembrolizumab, and
      intervention, cryoablation, for urothelial carcinoma, including bladder cancer, that has
      spread.

      Pembrolizumab is believed to work by binding to a chemical called PD-1 that is found on a
      special type of white blood cell in your body. This may help your body to be better at
      finding and destroying tumor cells. Cryoablation is an intervention which may kill cancer
      cells using extreme cold. It may help the immune system better recognize tumors and act
      against it.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment as long as their disease does not get worse or they
      do not have any unacceptable side effects for up to two years. Participants will be followed
      for up to 2 years after ending the study treatment.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.

      study by providing funding for the needles used in the study intervention.
