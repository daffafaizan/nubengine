      functions in response to weight cycling will be investigated under controlled conditions in
      normal weight subjects. The mechanisms of the catch-up fat phenomenon are analysed starting
      from stable energy balance followed by overfeeding, weight loss and weight regain following
      weight loss (refeeding). Changes in body composition (including ectopic fat), metabolism
      (resting energy expenditure, substrate oxidation rates, insulin resistance) and plasma
      hormone concentrations will be assessed. Fat tissue probes will be used to characterise key
      enzymes and signalling pathways, redox status and whole genome expression. Modulation of the
      hormonal response to weight cycling is brought about by varying macronutrient content and
      glycemic index of the diets. We hypothesize that, insulin and leptin resistance are explained
      by increased insulin secretion during the refeeding period. Both, adaptive thermogenesis as
      well as insulin and leptin resistance can be ameliorated by attenuation of the increase in
      insulin and leptin secretion during refeeding a low GI diet after weight loss.
