      hATTR-PN is an inherited, progressive, fatal disease caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR)
      proteins that accumulate as amyloid fibrils predominantly in the peripheral nerves, heart,
      gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. hATTR-PN is a rare disease and there are no large
      epidemiological studies that reliably provide an indication of its prevalence. The worldwide
      distribution is unequal, with higher rates in Portugal, Japan, Brazil, Northern Sweden, and
      the US. Current estimates suggest there may be 10,000 afflicted patients worldwide.

      TEGSEDI (inotersen) is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of human TTR protein synthesis.
      In Europe and Canada, TEGSEDI is indicated for the treatment of Stage 1 or Stage 2
      polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). In the
      US, TEGSEDI is indicated for treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary TTR-mediated
      amyloidosis in adults. Efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with hATTR-PN, as reflected
      by a slowing or reversal of disease progression.

      Research Question:

      The overarching goal of this study is to further characterize the long-term safety of TEGSEDI
      in patients with hATTR-PN under real-world conditions.

      Population:

      Patients in Europe, US, and Canada will be enrolled from centers that manage patients with
      hATTR-PN. Physicians participating in the study will be instructed to invite all patients who
      meet study eligibility criteria to enroll until the enrollment period is closed.
