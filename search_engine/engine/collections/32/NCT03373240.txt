      methadone/buprenorphine) treatment for any substance use disorder (other than PCP) at the
      Substance Abuse Treatment Unit in New Haven. As the goal of this project is to develop
      interventions that address self-regulation across multiple disorders, we will recruit
      individuals who have a range of substance use disorders and levels of severity. Our primary
      Specific Aim will be to evaluate the efficacy of the cognitive-remediation program relative
      to the control condition control on the indicators of cognitive-affective functioning and
      substance use, testing the hypothesis that individuals randomized to the cognitive
      remediation program will demonstrate improved functioning on the cognitive-affective battery
      as well as reduced real-world substance abuse. We will also explore potential moderators of
      response to the training, including baseline measures of cognitive-affective function.
