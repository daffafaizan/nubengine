      to receive 3 doses of placebo (N=10); 1 dose of placebo followed by 2 doses of AERAS-404
      (N=30; AERAS-404 2 dose regimen); or 3 doses of AERAS-404 (N=30; AERAS-404 3 dose regimen). A
      total of 69 (98.6%) subjects completed the study; the remaining subject, in the AERAS-404 2
      dose regimen, withdrew consent. All 70 subjects received the first and second vaccinations
      with placebo or AERAS-404 on Study Days 0 and 56, and 67 (95.7%) subjects received the third
      vaccination on Study Day 231. Three subjects did not receive the Study Day 231 vaccination (2
      in the AERAS-404 2 dose regimen, 1 due to withdrawal of consent and 1 due to pregnancy [the
      subject delivered a healthy boy without complications and was followed to study completion];
      and 1 in the AERAS-404 3 dose regimen, due to inability to discontinue daily isotretinoin
      started after the second vaccination [the subject was followed to study completion]).
