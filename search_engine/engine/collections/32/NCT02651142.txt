      patients who are randomized to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph
      node dissection group vs. those receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel
      lymph node dissection

      Outline:

      Patients are randomized assigned to the following one of two groups and are followed
      annually.

      Arm I: Patients receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node dissection
      Arm II: Patients receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node
      dissection
