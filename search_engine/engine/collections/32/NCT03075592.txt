      therapeutic tool in the management of pancreatic and biliary diseases. However, it carries up
      to 10% risk of developing acute pancreatitis, 10% of which will be severe. Current models to
      predict the severity of acute pancreatitis are incomplete and unable to prognosticate early
      in the course of the disease because they are based on biomarkers of late immune response.
      Recent findings suggest that polymorphisms in the gene coding for MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemotactic
      Protein-1) play an important role in the early immune response leading to either mild versus
      severe acute pancreatitis of various etiologies.

      This study plans to directly address the problem of post-ERCP pancreatitis to gauge the
      various factors involved in its development and genetic variability in the immune response to
      an isolated pancreatic insult. In addition, we hope to study markers of the early immune
      response to this injury and to develop a risk-assessment model.
