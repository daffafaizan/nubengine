    
      Primary Aim

      Determine survival to hospital discharge with Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) ≤ 3 in adult
      (18-75 years old) patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest who do not
      have ST-segment elevation on emergency department 12-lead ECG (no-STEMI) randomized to
      receive either: 1) initial CCL admission, or 2) initial ICU admission.

      Hypothesis: The corresponding hypothesis is that a large proportion of all resuscitated
      patients presenting with VT/VF have ischemic heart disease as the underlying cause for the
      participants cardiac arrest and that a strategy to facilitate prompt revascularization in all
      patients presenting with VT/VF who do not have ST-segment elevation on emergency department
      12-lead ECG will improve survival with good neurological outcome.

      Primary Endpoint

      Survival to hospital discharge with mRS ≤ 3

      Secondary Aims

      Determine secondary assessments of survival, left ventricular function, hospital duration,
      and rehabilitation in-hospital and assessment of survival and functional status at 3 months
      in both groups.

      Hypothesis: The corresponding hypothesis is that initial CCL admission will result in
      improved secondary assessment values at 3 months.

      Secondary Endpoints

      In-hospital secondary endpoints: Survival to hospital discharge, CPC score, mean peak
      troponin level, mean ejection fraction, mean length of ICU stay, mean hospitalization
      duration, the incidence of and mean length of rehabilitation.

      3-month post-hospital discharge secondary endpoint: Survival to 3 months, survival to 3
      months with mRS ≤ 3, functional status at 3 months (CPC score), incidence and length of
      rehabilitation, incidence of congestive heart failure, incidence of re-hospitalization over 3
      months, and incidence and time to return to work.

      Pragmatic Clinical Trial

      The ACCESS Trial will randomize patients to receive one of two standard treatments currently
      practiced in the United States: either, 1) initial CCL admission, or 2) initial ICU
      admission. Other than randomizing to one of these two standard treatments, care is not
      otherwise specified and is completely at the discretion of the treating clinician, including
      coronary interventions, if any, hemodynamic support, medications, therapeutic hypothermia,
      and all other interventions and clinical care.
