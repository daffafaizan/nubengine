      immunotherapy (PDL-1 inhibitor; atezolizumab) administered early at the time of biochemical
      relapse (circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive) in patients who have undergone radical
      cystectomy because of muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      Biomarkers that predict response to systemic immunotherapy will be identified by
      comprehensive multi-omics analysis of primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Furthermore, we
      will determine if ctDNA levels during therapy can be used as a biomarker for early indication
      of therapy response.

      The hypotheses is that 1) early initiation of immunotherapy in high-risk (ctDNA positive)
      patients will result in better response rates and improved survival compared to later
      treatment following conventional imaging diagnosis of metastasis, and 2) biomarkers for
      predicting response can be identified and used for tailoring treatment regimens in the future
      to patients at high risk and at high likelihood of response.
