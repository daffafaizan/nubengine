    
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-stage, phase II trial of Trifluridine/tipiracil
      (TAS-102) as a palliative treatment for patients with metastatic triple negative breast
      cancer who have failed both a taxane and anthracycline or have contraindications to these
      agents.

      The trial will begin with a safety run-in of 10 patients treated as follows:

      Cycle 1: Trifluridine/tipiracil administered at 30 mg/m2 orally bid, 5 days per week, with 2
      days of rest, for 2 weeks, followed by 14 day rest. Intra-patient dose escalation to 35 mg/m2
      orally bid, 5 days per week, with 2 days of rest, for 2 weeks, followed by 14 day rest for
      subsequent cycles in the absence of dose limiting toxicities. As long as at least 80% of
      patients tolerate dose escalation, the trial will proceed to the next stage.

      Patients enrolled in stages I and II will start Trifluridine/tipiracil at 35 mg/m2 orally
      bid, 5 days per week, with 2 days of rest, for 2 weeks, followed by 14 day rest.
