      current study. Participants will be randomized to one of the three interpretation training
      conditions: an TAF-INC, TAF-CON, or SMP. Before and after the training, participants will
      complete some self-report questionnaires and clinician administered measures. The
      computerized training will provide statements intended to activate the mechanisms involved in
      thought-action-fusion (TAF), which will almost always produce a negative outcome
      interpretation. It is hypothesized that through TAF-INC participants will learn alternative,
      more neutral, ways of interpreting the thoughts and lower the subject's TAF. The TAF-CON
      condition will receive the same statements as TAF-INC, but TAF-CON is designed to leave the
      interpretation of the scenarios unchallenged. The study will also include another comparison
      condition, SMP, to test if TAF-INC outperforms not only TAF-CON, but also stress reduction
      techniques provided in empirically supported psychological treatment. The SMP training will
      be similar in procedure and structure to the other two conditions, but it will provide
      psychoeducation about stress and stress management techniques.
