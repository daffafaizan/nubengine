      I. To evaluate if the addition of adjuvant everolimus to the R0 or R1 surgical resection of
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases to the liver will result in an improvement in
      disease free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the addition of adjuvant everolimus to the R0 or R1 surgical resection of
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases to the liver will result in an improvement in
      overall survival.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity associated with adjuvant everolimus following resection in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors to the liver.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio.

      ARM A: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 150 patients
