      of skeletal muscle in cirrhotic patients. Current strategies involve prolonged tracer
      infusion and multiple muscle biopsies. We will use an innovative approach to determine the
      rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown using multiple tracers administered
      at short intervals followed by a single muscle biopsy. These studies are likely to provide a
      conceptual advance in determining the cellular and molecular responses of the skeletal muscle
      in cirrhosis.
