    
      After presenting with new onset idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, one third of patients
      experience dramatic recovery of left ventricular function, while for the majority chronic
      heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction persist. This marked variation in clinical
      outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to
      myocardial injury. This population has been excluded from most clinical trials and few
      studies have examined the role of cytokine and neurohormonal mediators in modulating the
      balance between left ventricular recovery and remodeling in early cardiomyopathy. This
      proposal will investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of inflammatory and neurohormonal
      mediators influence subsequent clinical outcomes for patients with recent onset primary
      (idiopathic) dilated cardiomyopathy. The study will enroll 500 patients with recent onset
      left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 0.40) due to non-ischemic primary cardiomyopathy at
      eleven centers and follow these patients prospectively to evaluate subsequent left
      ventricular recovery and freedom from clinical events.

      Specific aim 1 will be to determine the correlation of echocardiographic parameters of
      systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating inflammatory mediators: TNF, IL-6
      and TNF receptors 1 and 2. Specific aim 2 will be to determine the predictive value of early
      plasma TNFÎ± levels and of left ventricular size by transthoracic echo at baseline in
      predicting improvements in left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) at 6 months. Specific
      aim 3 will evaluate the effects of the TNFA 1/2 promoter polymorphism on circulating plasma
      TNF levels and its influence on subsequent improvement in LVEF. Specific aim 4 will look at
      the impact of the deletion allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the genetic
      variation of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors on left ventricular recovery.
