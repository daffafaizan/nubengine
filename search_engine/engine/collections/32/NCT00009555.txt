      increase in abdominal fat. The mechanisms of abdominal fat accumulation in HIV-infected
      patients are not known. Studies have shown: treatment with testosterone gel reduces total
      body fat in young, androgen-deficient men; testosterone replacement in middle-aged men with
      mid-segment obesity decreases visceral fat; and replacement doses of testosterone decrease
      fat mass and augment lean body mass in HIV-infected men with androgen deficiency. Therefore,
      there is a strong rationale for evaluating the effectiveness of testosterone replacement in
      HIV-infected men with visceral obesity and low testosterone levels.

      Patients are stratified based on their viral load. Patients receive either testosterone gel
      or placebo applied to the skin once daily for 24 weeks. Patients remain on their current
      antiretroviral regimens, which are not supplied through the study. Patients who receive
      testosterone during the first 24 weeks are eligible to receive it for an additional 24 weeks.
      Patients on placebo are followed for an additional 24 weeks. Clinical and laboratory
      evaluations for visceral fat changes are performed throughout the study.
