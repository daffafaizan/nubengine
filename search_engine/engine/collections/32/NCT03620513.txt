      randomization. Group one will receive atomized spray of normal saline as placebo before the
      procedure. Group two will receive two sprays of atomized oxymetazoline (approx 0.18 ml of
      0.05% oxymetazoline) with a gap of 10 seconds in between the sprays. Group three will receive
      two sprays of 15% lidocaine with a gap of 10 seconds in between the sprays. Group four will
      receive two sprays of oxymetazoline and then two sprays of lidocaine at an interval of two
      minutes.

      Sample size calculation: With alpha error of 0.05, power of .8, mean discomfort scale for
      placebo of 2.8 (literature review) and SD of 1.1, presuming that the treatment would be able
      to reduce discomfort by at least 25%, with two tailed test and same SD, minimum sample size
      would be 40 in each group.

      To reduce bias, all the procedure will be performed by senior consultants. Patients and the
      person performing the procedure will be blinded.

      Discomfort of pre-medication, discomfort of scope insertion, pain due to scope insertion, and
      ease of procedure will be scored as VAS score (1 to 10, 1 is least and 10 is most). Also,
      patient will be asked how likely s/he is to recommend the similar procedure to his/her
      friends and family members in case they need to undergo the same. Side effects of
      pre-medication and procedure will also be noted.

      Outcome variables among the groups will be compared using ANOVA test if they are normally
      distributed.
