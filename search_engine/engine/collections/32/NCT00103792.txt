      highly effective, but also relatively toxic drugs, and, secondly, after remission is
      achieved, maintenance therapy with less toxic drugs. The standard induction therapy of a
      relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis consists of the combination
      of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. Although this induction therapy is very effective, it
      is very toxic as well.

      Searching for an alternative for cyclophosphamide, we will test the efficacy and safety of a
      new combination therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. We will compare the
      effect and safety of the standard induction therapy with the new therapy. When relapses
      occur, patients will be randomized for either the standard therapy with cyclophosphamide or
      for mycophenolate mofetil.
