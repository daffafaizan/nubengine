      for 14 consecutive days. For each adaptation session, subject will sit in a chair within
      reaching distance of a wall or cabinet upon which two dime-sized targets will be placed (one
      above the other, approximately ten inches apart). While wearing goggles, you will point
      rapidly to one target then the next, bringing the hand back to his/her torso between each
      pointing movement. They will be instructed to perform these movements "as quickly as
      possible" for a total of 50 pointing movements in each treatment session. After performing
      the 50 pointing movements, they will remove their goggles. Throughout the treatment period
      they will be asked to keep a diary in which they will log the time and duration of each prism
      adaptation session. At the first and second site visits, participants will be assessed for
      posture, gait and activities of daily living which will include some questionnaires.
      Questionnaires will be sent via mail after post-treatment at one week,1 month and 3 months.
