      who are both cocaine and alcohol dependent and who will receive either CBT or BRENDA alone or
      in combination with naltrexone. There will be 300 DSM-IV cocaine-alcohol dependent male and
      female subjects randomized to one of four groups (75 subjects per group). Subjects will be
      randomized to either 150mg/day naltrexone or placebo and to receive either CBT (a type of
      cognitive behavior therapy derived from relapse prevention principles), or a new primary-care
      basedmodel, BRENDA, comprised of strategies for enhancing motivation and treatment
      compliance. All subjects will receive one of the four combinations of medication and
      psychosocial treatment. The length of the study for each subject includes one week of
      screening/baseline assessments, 12 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled naltrexone
      treatment combined with one of two psychosocial treatments, and a 6-month and 12-month
      follow-up visit. Following successful completion of detoxification (abstinence from alcohol
      and cocaine for 7 days), informed consent will be signed, and Week 1 will be devoted to
      completing screening and baseline measures. In Week 2, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      medication/ psychosocial treatment combination. Following completion of the 12-week,
      double-blind treatment trial, subjects will be evaluated at 6-month and 12-months
      post-treatment visits.
