      population reach. However, these interventions are also modular; they can be delivered
      independently to maximize cost-effectiveness or combined with other approaches (e.g. provider
      counseling) to maximize outcomes. This study is a 12-month experimental trial among 448
      adults with obesity. All participants will receive a core 6-month weight loss texting
      intervention that includes tailored behavior change goals, interactive self-monitoring,
      automated feedback, and skills training. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 32
      different experimental conditions.
