      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on the absolute walking distance (AWD) measured
      during a treadmill test in peripheral artery disease patients.

      Arteriopatic patients will be randomized in 2 groups :

        -  patients submitted to a 12 weeks program of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES
           group)

        -  patients without any program (control group) All patients will also receive a study
           participation guide that will include an information leaflet outlining tips for active
           living and walking.

      After eligibility criteria will be assessed, patient will be included and randomized (visit
      1). A second visit will be performed after 12 weeks (visit 2).

      In parallel, 2 ancillary studies will be performed :

        -  Among Rennes' arteriopatic patients, endothelial function will be assessed using
           measures from 40 patients. Assessment will be done between 1 and 14 days after visit 1
           (visit 1')

        -  The second ancillary study concerns 40 volunteers with no cardiac or vascular pathology,
           only in the coordinating center Rennes. The same measures will be performed for these
           volunteers and for arteriopatic patients.
