      because of high surgical morbidity ratio and high adverse event ratio of adjuvant therapy.
      For example, our preliminary results showed that regular gemcitabine administration
      (1000mg/m2, day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) after hemihepatectomy was too toxic and induced
      severe leukocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Formerly, the investigators planned the study
      to decide more safety adjuvant protocol (recommend dose: RD) for Gemcitabine or S-1 after
      hemihepatectomy using Continuous Reassessment Method (CRM) analysis and decided the recommend
      doses. Note: In the former study, the investigators decided that tolerable ratio of Dose
      Limiting Toxicity (DLT) would be less than 10%.

      Herein, the investigators planned the study to evaluate efficacy (recurrent free survival as
      primary outcome, and overall-survival as secondary outcome) and safety (as secondary outcome)
      in our recommended protocols, and to compare the efficacy as randomized control trial.
