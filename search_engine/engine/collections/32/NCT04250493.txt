      between 6 and 10 years. MSA belongs to the synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the
      abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. We have recently shown brain insulin resistance
      (i.e. reduced insulin signaling) in post-mortem brain tissue of MSA patients and transgenic
      MSA mice, as illustrated by increased protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-1
      phosphorylated at serine 312 (IRS-1pS312). Additionally, exendin-4, an approved anti-diabetic
      drug targeting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, was capable of decreasing brain
      levels of IRS-1pS312 and preserving dopamine neurons in transgenic MSA mice. We further
      observed an inverse correlation between plasma neural-derived exosomal IRS-1pS312 levels and
      survival of dopamine neurons in transgenic MSA mice.

      The aim of this study is to further characterize peripheral and central insulin resistance in
      MSA patients, thereby validating this target for future treatment trials. For this purpose,
      fasting blood glucose and insulin levels will be determined in samples of MSA patients and
      healthy controls for a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA).
      Additionally, IRS-1pS312 will be measured in neural-derived plasma exosomes of MSA patients
      and healthy controls.
