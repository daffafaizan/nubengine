      of prostate cancer, reducing rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies, and in cases of prostate
      cancer, correct staging of the disease and corresponding management.

      Consequently, use of PSMA PET-CT in patients with suspicious PSA changes may improve our
      knowledge whether the prostate tumor is clinically significant or not (for the development of
      PSMA PET-CT with 68 Ga ligand allows to visualize prostate cancer with aggressive patterns),
      and improve clinical decision making for performing prostate biopsy or selecting patients for
      observation only.

      In light of the above, we are of the opinion that this proposed study has the potential to
      significantly alter the medical practice of how prostate cancer is diagnosed, which even
      today suffers from real clinical dilemma.
