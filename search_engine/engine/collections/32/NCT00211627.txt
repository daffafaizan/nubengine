      breathing during sleep. This method has not been described in the medical literature and has
      been successful in limited testing. This clinical trial is to determine the safety and
      effectiveness of the KEEPASLEEP device utilizing 30 subjects with simple snoring. Each
      subject will serve as his/her own control. The device augments airflow into the posterior
      pharynx to minimize airway collapse,tissue vibration, and consequent snoring.The device
      passes through the retromaxillary space and requires that the subject be absent their wisdom
      teeth.
