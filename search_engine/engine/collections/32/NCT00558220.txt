      (MegaCHOP - Cyclophosphamide 3 g/m2, Vincristine 2 mg, Adriamycin 75 mg/m2, Prednisone 300
      mg/m2 every three weeks with G-CSF for three cycles, followed by ESHAP - Etoposide 240 mg/m2,
      Cisplatin 100 mg/m2, Solumedrol 2000 mg and cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 for three cycles every
      three weeks with G-CSF) followed by intensive consolidation (BEAM) and stem cell support
      improves progression-free survival in adult patients (18-65 years old) with aggressive B-cell
      lymphoma (namely, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and
      follicular lymphoma grade II) with aaIPI 2 and namely, with aaIPI 3. This study was aimed to
      find out if addition of four to six doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 on first day of every cycle
      of intensive induction further improves prognosis of these patients.

      Inclusion criteria for this trial were:

        -  newly diagnosed aggressive B-cell lymphoma, namely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
           primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade III

        -  age 18-65 years

        -  age adjusted IPI (International Prognostic Index) score 2 or 3

        -  ECOG performance status 0-3

        -  signed informed consent

      Exclusion criteria were:

        -  relapsed lymphoma

        -  previous treatment (up to one cycle of standard pretreatment - COP, CHOP or steroids was
           permitted and later became mandatory to decrease disease burden and/or improve the
           performance status of the patient)

        -  Burkitt lymphoma

        -  posttransplant lymphoproliferation

        -  CNS involvement

        -  other malignant tumor in previous history, except basalioma, skin squamocellular
           carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ

        -  other serious comorbidity

      Primary endpoints was progression-free survival

      Secondary endpoints were:

        -  rate of complete remission and overall response rate

        -  overall survival

        -  toxicity of the protocol, measured as grade III-IV toxicity and/or inability to finish
           the protocol as planned

      Planned number of accrued patients was 100.
