    
      Young adult drivers with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will be compared on
      a driving simulator after taking PRC-063 or LDX in a repeated-measure, randomized,
      doubleblind, crossover study design. Each subject will be randomized to receive up to a
      21-day course of PRC-063 followed by up to a 21 day course of LDX or vice versa. There will
      be no washout between treatments. On days 1 through 7, subjects will receive the lowest dose
      (45 mg of PRC-063 or 30 mg of LDX) of study medication. On days 8 through 14, subjects will
      receive the middle dose (70 mg of PRC-063 or 50 mg of LDX). On days 15 through 21, subjects
      will receive the highest dose (100 mg of PRC-063 or 70 mg of LDX). During Days 1 through 21,
      if a subject is responding satisfactorily to medication, he or she may remain on that daily
      dose. Driving laboratory testing will be conducted between Day 17 and Day 21. Following the
      laboratory testing, the subject will begin a second titration of the alternate treatment,
      starting on Day 22 through Day 28 at the lowest dose (45 mg of PRC-063 or 30 mg of LDX) of
      study medication, Day 29 through Day 35 on the middle dose (70 mg of PRC-063 or 50 mg of LDX)
      and Day 36 through Day 42 on the highest dose (100 mg of PRC-063 or 70 mg of LDX). During
      Days 22 through 42, if a subject is responding satisfactorily to medication, he or she may
      remain on that daily dose. Following titration with the second treatment, subjects will
      attend a second driving laboratory testing, conducted between Day 38 to Day 42. Subjects will
      subsequently attend a safety and study termination visit.
