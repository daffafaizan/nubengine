    
      A single center non randomized, non blinded Phase I/II clinical trial is proposed to study
      the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of steroid refractory graft versus
      host disease (GVHD) following an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Patients who develop grade II to IV GVHD following an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be
      enrolled. MSC will be expanded from the donors of all patients who develop GVHD. Expanded MSC
      will be infused at a dose of 1-2 million cells/kg in patients who have steroid refractory
      GVHD.

      Response to therapy will be studied using established criteria for grading GVHD.
