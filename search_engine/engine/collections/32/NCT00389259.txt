      oximes improve the outcome of patients with OP poisoning and CNS manifestations. Design: A
      multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Setting: Emergency
      Departments & Intensive Care Units in Israel. Participants: Patients 2 -60 years old with
      acute OP poisoning and CNS manifestations. Interventions: In addition to standard treatment
      with atropine and obidoxime, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups, scopolamine group, and placebo group (both given in the same volume).
      Scopolamine will be given IM or IV in a dose of 0.25mg for adults and 0.006mg/kg for children
      every 4 hours. At least three doses of scopolamine (or placebo) will be given. The medical
      staff will be blinded to the treatment given. Main outcome measures: Improvement in
      neurological status, duration of seizures and number of days on ventilator. Data analysis:
      The main outcome measures, will be compared using the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney
      tests as appropriate. The *2 or Fisher Exact tests, as appropriate, will be used for
      comparisons of categorical variables. We will use multiple logistic regression to examine the
      extent to which variables predict success or failure of the treatment.
