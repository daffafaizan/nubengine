      continuous intravenous bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide G3139 in patients with recurrent
      small cell lung cancer. II. Evaluate the clinical response of this patient population when
      treated with this regimen. III. Evaluate the correlation between bcl-2 expression in these
      patients and efficacy of this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to whether they have received prior taxane therapy
      (yes vs no). Patients receive bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide G3139 IV continuously on
      days 1-6 followed by 2 weeks of rest. Paclitaxel IV is administered over 3 hours on day 6 of
      each course. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Intrapatient dose escalation is allowed. Patients are
      followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
