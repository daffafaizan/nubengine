    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an
      investigational vaccine being developed for immunotherapy of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and
      post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The vaccine, identified as Leish-111f + MPL-SE,
      consists of a recombinant three-antigen Leishmania polyprotein (Leish-111f) together with
      adjuvant MPL-SE.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Leish-111f + MPL-SE
      vaccine given as three subcutaneous injections every 28 days at each of three dose levels of
      the Leish-111f protein (5 μg, 10 μg, or 20 μg) together with MPL-SE adjuvant (25 μg) in
      healthy adults.

      The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine by evaluating T-cell
      and antibody response to the Leish-111f protein of the vaccine.
