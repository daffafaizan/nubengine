      greater than or equal to 18 years of age and children with a weight of greater than or equal
      to 70 kg will receive an intravenous injection of 370 ±10% MBq (333 to 407 MBq [9.0 to 11
      mCi]) of [123I]mIBG. Children <16 years of age (with a weight of 8-70 kg) will receive an
      activity of [123I]mIBG calculated on the basis of a reference activity for an adult scaled to
      body weight. Each investigator is responsible for obtaining the appropriate thyroid blockade
      agent and for its administration in accordance with national and local regulations and
      guidelines. Approximately 24 (± 6) hours following administration of [123I]mIBG all patients
      will return to the clinic for scintigraphic imaging. Imaging will be performed as per the
      standard procedures of the investigational site. This should include at a minimum total body
      planar scintigraphy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be performed
      following planar scintigraphy, as appropriate.
