      comparing the efficacy and safety of anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus
      dose-dense anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus dose-dense anthracyclin followed
      by weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin for high-risk, triple-negative early breast
      cancer.High risk is defined as positive lymph nodes or negative lymph nodes but ki-67 is not
      less than 50%. We aim to explore whether the addition of carboplatin can improve the
      disease-free survival of early high-risk triple-negative breast cancer. At the same time, the
      experimental group's anthracyclines must be given in a dose-dense manner, while
      anthracyclines in the control group are dose-dense or not.
