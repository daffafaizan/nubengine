      approximately 200 patients referred for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device(CIED) lead
      extraction at one of the five study centers. The objective of this study is to determine
      whether a correlation exists between fibrosis detected on ECG gated cardiac CT and the ease
      of lead extraction as measured by need for extraction energy. All patients will be followed
      for 30 days post-lead extraction to assess vital status and re-hospitalizations via phone
      call
