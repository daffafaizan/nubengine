      glucose can induce increases in IL-6, TNF-Î± and CRP in abdominally obese and diabetic
      subjects. As over two-thirds of the U.S. population is overweight or obese, it is important
      to identify foods that can attenuate postprandial increases in lipids, glucose and
      inflammation in this population. Therefore, the purpose of the pilot study is to determine
      whether a high SFA / high glucose control meal will induce an acute inflammatory response in
      overweight individuals, and whether the addition of peanuts to this meal will ameliorate this
      response. To ensure that these effects are due to peanuts, and not to the increase in total
      fat, we will compare this response to another test meal that includes an oil blend with a
      similar fatty acid composition to peanuts.
