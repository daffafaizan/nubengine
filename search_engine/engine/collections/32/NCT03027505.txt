    
      Objectives :

      Main objective :

      To ensure the recovery rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute malnutrition is
      significantly greater than 75% (reference value of the national program in BF).

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To ensure the mortality rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute
           malnutrition is significantly lower than 3% (reference value of the national BF
           program).

        -  To ensure the default rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute
           malnutrition is significantly lower than 15% (reference value of the national BF
           program).

        -  To ensure the non-response rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute
           malnutrition is significantly lower than 8%.

        -  To ensure the hospitalization rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute
           malnutrition is significantly lower than 15%.

        -  To ensure the coverage rate of the program increases by 30% after the year the
           integrated protocol was introduced (specific protocol annexed).

        -  To estimate the relapse rate of the integrated protocol for treatment of acute
           malnutrition.

        -  To compare RUTF rations per child of the integrated protocol compared to the national
           protocol

      Methods :

      The study population will include all acutely malnourished children aged between 6 and 59
      months seeking consultations at all of the health centers in Yako District between January
      2017 and December 2017.

      The study will be implemented in Burkina Faso's Yako District, which includes 54 health
      centers.
