    
      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the repeatability of SD-OCT (Spectralisâ„¢
      OCT, Version 6.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) RNFL thickness measurements with the new
      software (method B) and with the previous method of measurement (method A) in patients with
      glaucoma.

      It is a prospective, not blinded, not randomised, monocentric study. Inclusion of 50 patients
      with a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), that will be recruited from the
      ophthalmology outpatient department of the UniversityHospital Zurich, Switzerland. All
      patients will undergo a full ophthalmic examination including measurement of refraction, best
      corrected visual acuity, examination of anterior and posterior compartment and measurement of
      the intraocular pressure. On the same day they will have 3 OCT examinations with a new method
      of measurement (method B).On the same day the first 10 patients will undergo also 3 OCT
      examinations with the previous method (method A) and they will get an other 3 OCT
      examinations with method B by a second observer. For this 10 patients the next consultation
      (3 months +/- 1 month) the 3 OCT examinations with method B will be repeated by the first
      observer.

      Primary objectives are coefficient of variations (COV) of method A and B;
      Intra-class-correlations (ICC) of method A and B.
