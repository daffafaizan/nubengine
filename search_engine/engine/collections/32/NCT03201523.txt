    
      The purpose of this research study is to design, implement, and evaluate a community level,
      socio-ecological based CVD prevention intervention using a participatory approach for women
      in a homogeneous ultra-Orthodox Jewish Hasidic community in Israel. A quasi-experimental,
      pre-post study design will be utilized, where all community participants will be exposed to
      intervention components. Pre and post samples will be selected through randomized cluster
      sampling of pre-existing community groups (n=239 ). Intervention components will be designed
      through qualitative and quantitative data collection (focus groups, interviews, and
      questionnaires) from the target population and implementation will be conducted in
      partnership with community organizations. Intervention components will include a health
      newsletter, health workshops, community evening/health project registration, lay leader
      training, neighborhood exercise groups, community walking programs with pedometers, healthy
      cooking contest, and school health promotion activities. It is hypothesized that
      ultra-Orthodox Jewish Hasidic women exposed to this community intervention will have improved
      healthy eating behaviors, reduced unhealthy eating behaviors, increased engagement in
      physical activity and sleep, and reduced risk for obesity (weight, BMI).
