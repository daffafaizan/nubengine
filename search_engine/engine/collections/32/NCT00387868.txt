      is important in preventing recurrence. Strategies which would help the surgeon's ability to
      completely remove the tumor therefore need to be investigated.

      This study represents a multi-institutional, phase II pilot trial of preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy for patients
      with invasive thymoma or thymic carcinoma at significant risk for recurrence. We hypothesize
      that this strategy will be well-tolerated and produce response and resectability rates
      exceeding those previously published involving surgical resection alone, or preoperative
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with locally advanced thymoma, based on
      radiographic and biopsy criteria, will undergo pretreatment computed tomography (CT) scan and
      positron emission tomography (PET) followed by concurrent (simultaneous) chemotherapy
      (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation. After this therapy, patients will be reassessed
      using computed tomography (CT) and PET, and undergo surgical resection of their tumors.
      Following resection, patients will be either observed, or treated with postoperative
      chemotherapy, or chemotherapy and radiation. Correlative genomic, serologic and pathologic
      studies will also be performed.
