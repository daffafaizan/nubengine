      duct obstruction. The standard clinical evaluation may include EUS and/or ERCP. At centers
      where EUS is available (like CPMC), it is usually used first as it is generally considered a
      better tool for tumor detection, staging, and performing biopsies (FNA). ERCP is then
      performed, if needed, to place a stent and relieve jaundice. As EUS is a relatively newer
      technology that has not widely disseminated, other centers use ERCP as the 1st modality to
      evaluate suspected malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction. The role of ERCP in this setting
      is to not only place a stent to relieve jaundice, but to additionally obtain cytology
      brushings for tissue diagnosis.

      Several studies have reported high sensitivity of EUS-FNA for detecting pancreaticobiliary
      cancers that are causing bile duct obstruction and jaundice (80-90%). The sensitivity for
      ERCP brushings and biopsies to detect the same types of tumors is reportedly lower (30-80%),
      but there have been no direct comparisons of these techniques.

      Few centers use both technologies (EUS and ERCP) for patient care, or often perform EUS and
      ERCP at separate sessions. At CPMC, the investigators routinely perform EUS and ERCP together
      for patients needing these procedures. Thus the investigators are in a unique position to
      directly compare EUS-FNA to ERCP brushings for tissue diagnosis of suspected
      pancreaticobiliary tumors.

      The proposed study will be the 1st direct comparison of EUS-FNA to ERCP tissue sampling for
      patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary cancers. Study results will highlight the best
      approach to obtain a biopsy diagnosis of pancreatic and biliary tract cancers.
