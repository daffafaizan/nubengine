      Primary

      * Determine the pathologic complete response rate of radiotherapy, pemetrexed disodium, and
      carboplatin when administered prior to esophagectomy in patients with locally advanced
      esophageal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity, in terms of clinical response rate and adverse event profile of
           radiotherapy, pemetrexed disodium, and carboplatin when administered prior to
           esophagectomy.

        -  Determine the overall survival, time-to-progression, and time-to-treatment failure for
           patients receiving the above combined modality treatment.

        -  Determine the surgical outcome for all patients who undergo esophagectomy.

        -  Determine the time-to-disease recurrence and disease-free survival for patients who have
           a curative resection.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a
           multicenter study. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 Â½
           weeks and concurrently receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and carboplatin IV
           over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are eligible will undergo
           esophagectomy between 4-12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, immediately prior to day 22 of chemotherapy, and
      within 2 weeks prior to surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 4
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
