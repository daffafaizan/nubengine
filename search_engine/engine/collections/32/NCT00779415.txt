    
      We plan to conduct a retrospective cohort study to assemble a research database of all
      patients with shoulder pain from 1/1/02-12/31/06 presenting at the Hershey Medical Center.
      Participants will be identified using billing codes in the medical records office, with
      inclusion/exclusion criteria as described above. Data extraction will include medical record
      number, demographic data (age, race/ethnicity, sex, insurance type), pre-fracture functional
      status, pre-admission residence, medical co-morbidities, prior hospitalization within 30
      days, abnormal clinical findings on admission, shoulder score, pain score, range of motion
      score, type of diagnosis (partial tear, full thickness tear, tendonitis, shoulder pain),
      occupation, past medical history, physical therapy and duration of physical therapy,
      cigarette/cigar use, drug use, alcohol use, treatment protocols (anti-inflammatory
      medication, injections, etc.), and complaints by patient of pain status.
