      Blood vessel dysfunction and exercise intolerance are common in CKD. Blood vessel dysfunction
      has been shown to predict future cardiovascular events and decreased physical activity can
      contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this study investigates
      if dietary nitrate from beetroot juice, which has been shown to improve blood vessel function
      and exercise capacity in other cardiovascular disease pathologies, could be effective at
      improving these measures in patients with CKD. In a controlled, double blinded trial, stage
      3-5 CKD patients will be randomly assigned to receive either beetroot beverage or a placebo
      and then complete measures of blood vessel function and an exercise test.
