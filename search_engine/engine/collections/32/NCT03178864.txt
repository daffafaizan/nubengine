    
      SECRET is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will assess the safety
      of rivaroxaban, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), compared with
      standard-of-care (unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin with transition to warfarin
      [INR 2.0-3.0], or continued low molecular-weight heparin) for cerebral venous thrombosis.
      Recruitment will occur at 17 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 3 years.
      During the pilot phase, 50 adult patients within 14 days of symptomatic cerebral venous
      thrombosis diagnosis will be randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg daily versus standard of
      care (warfarin or low-molecular weight heparin). Patients will be followed for 1 year. The
      feasibility of recruitment will be tested during the pilot phase and outcomes refined for a
      future Phase III trial.
