      insufficiency in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with shock. The focus had been
      on stable preterm and critically ill preterm infants. Given that steroid treatment improves
      blood pressure and stabilizes cardiovascular status in preterm infants with volume and
      pressor-resistant hypotension,it becomes essential to examine the incidence of adrenal
      insufficiency in this cohort (rather than a broad group of critically ill preterm infants).
      Moreover, there are no studies on adrenal function in Indian neonates.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of basal and stimulated (using low dose
      [1Âµg/k] ACTH) cortisol levels in preterm (28-34 weeks gestation) very low birth weight (birth
      weight 750 gm to 1500 gm) infants with shock in the first week of life requiring vasopressor
      therapy and matched (gestation, birth weight, postnatal age-matched) hemodynamically stable
      infants ('control group').
