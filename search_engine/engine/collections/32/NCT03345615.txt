      infarction, assessing for new-onset AF after hospital discharge. Patients will be randomized
      to receive intensive monitoring or standard care in a 2:1 distribution. Patients randomized
      to intensive monitoring will receive a SpiderFlashÂ® monitor, worn for 30-days after discharge
      and returned for analysis.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate at the incidence of new-onset AF at
      30-days post-MI using an intensive monitoring strategy, compared to standard of care.
      Secondary objectives include the impact of intensive monitoring on oral anticoagulation rates
      at 90-days and 1-year after monitoring, and the risk factors for developing new-onset AF, and
      the variables associated with initiating or withholding anticoagulation.
