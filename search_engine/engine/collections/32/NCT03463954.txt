      invited to participate. Subjects will receive a screening MRI and if eligible will then have
      laser ablation, followed by MRI and an excision at 4-6 weeks following the laser procedure.
      This study will be deemed successful if the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval for the
      proportion of patients who have complete tumor ablation with one Novilase laser ablation
      procedure at 4-6 weeks post-procedure is greater than the performance goal. Specifically,
      Novilase will have demonstrated success if the complete tumor ablation rate is greater than
      87.85%.
