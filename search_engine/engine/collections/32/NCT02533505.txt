      dynamic hyperinflation during exercise. Treatment with inhaled long-acting beta agonists and
      combination of the long-acting beta agonist (LABA), formoterol and the inhaled
      corticosteroid, budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease lung hyperinflation. In
      a similar previous pilot single centre study with budesonide/formoterol (SymbicortÂ®) the
      analysis of cardiac outcomes demonstrated a decrease in maximum volume of oxygen (VO2)
      compared to placebo. Findings suggested that the use of Symbicort can decrease the cost of
      breathing and therefore reduce the cardiac demand experienced by COPD patients with
      hyperinflation at rest. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Symbicort therapy can
      decrease resting VO2 by decreasing static lung hyperinflation in subjects with COPD and to
      evaluate changes in cardiac function.
