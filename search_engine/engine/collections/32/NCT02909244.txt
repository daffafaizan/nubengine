      (CGD, XIAP or TTC7A deficiencies), and they will collect feces samples from them.

      In parallel, as control groups, patients with no inflammatory bowel disease and no primary
      immune deficiency will be included, and also patients suffering from Crohn's disease without
      known primary immune deficiency.

      The laboratory collaborators will then realize analyzes on the microbiota collected for all
      patients.

      The study team will then analyze the microbiota composition of the different types of
      patients, and try to identify some factors, associated with the appearance of an inflammatory
      disease on these patients.
