      Followed by 3 identical courses and 6 courses of maintenance by azacitidine alone to be
      delivered every 28 days, in those patients reaching CR or PR after 3 courses (evaluation of
      response from 28 to 56 days from course 3).

      Randomization R2: type of maintenance:

      Response to induction will be evaluated 2 weeks after myeloid recovery, just before first
      consolidation course, due use of to pegfilgrastim, lenograstim or filgrastim during
      induction.

      Responses will be classified according to the Revised Recommendations of the IWG for AML.
