    
      Angiosarcomas are very rare tumors (incidence < 1/100.000/year) of vascular or lymphatic
      origin characterized by a clinical heterogeneity in terms of presentation and behavior.In
      several prospective and retrospective studies, weekly paclitaxel showed promising activity in
      patients with advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma. Given the important role of PD-L1 in the
      suppression of T-cell responses, and the mode of action of avelumab which blocks the
      interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, avelumab is being developed as a potential
      therapy for subjects with various tumors. In prior study cutaneous angiosarcoma patients with
      a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression were more likely
      to have favorable survival.

      Therefore, antitumor activity of Avelumab as inhibitor of PD-1/PDL-1 interaction with
      Paclitaxel, standard chemotherapy, might have more therapeutic improvement.
