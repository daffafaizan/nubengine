      Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut) for increasing rates of accurate child abuse reporting.
      Grounded in an Experiential Learning conceptual model, iLookOut is a multi-media, online
      intervention that engages learners emotionally and intellectually through an interactive,
      video-based story-line that provides education, challenges learners with decision-points, and
      gives critical feedback. iLookOut uses "gamification" strategies to promote experiential
      learning through simulation, problem-solving, and practice opportunities to apply new
      information and understanding. It also will include follow-up activities that promote
      retention and integration of new knowledge, as well as help CCPs to remain aware and engaged.

      Prior studies have demonstrated that iLookOut significantly improves CCP knowledge and
      attitudes about reporting suspected child abuse, and is very well received by CCPs. To
      evaluate its impact on actual reporting behavior, the proposed research will randomize CCP
      sites in southern Maine (total = ~1,300) to receive iLookOut, Standard training, or Control
      (no intervention).

      The primary goal is to increase the number of CCP reports for which either child abuse is
      confirmed or social services (e.g., therapeutic services, nutritional assistance) are
      recommended -as these are the kinds of reports that are likely to actually benefit a child.

      The secondary goal is to decrease the proportion of reports that don't offer such benefit,
      and in particular to decrease costs to the state associated with intake and investigation of
      non-beneficial reports.
