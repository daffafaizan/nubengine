      promising yoga and mindfulness program for children developed by Jennifer Cohen Harper, MA,
      E-RCYT, which incorporates five elements (connect, breathe, move, focus, relax) to improve
      the child's ability to sustain attention and regulate emotions. While research supports that
      yoga programs and mindfulness programs yield positive outcomes on numerous factors, there are
      no independent studies presently examining the effects of a combined yoga and mindfulness
      intervention (like Little Flower Yoga for Kids) on both emotion regulation and sustained
      attention.

      The investigators propose conducting an initial evaluation of Little Flower Yoga for Kids in
      a small sample of 18-30 Kindergarten and First Grade students (3-5 per class) enrolled in
      Girls Preparatory Charter School of the Bronx. Little Flower Yoga for Kids is currently part
      of the curriculum at Girls Preparatory Charter School of the Bronx and implemented by Kelli
      Love, M.Ed., 500 RYT, received her certification from the Little Flower Yoga for Kids Teacher
      Training Program. Specifically, the investigators will conduct a preliminary trial with a
      sample of 5-7 year olds (Kindergarten/First Grade), who meet a predetermined threshold of
      having either emotional regulation and/or attentional difficulties, to determine the effects
      of Little Flower Yoga for Kids on sustained attention and emotion regulation. Measures of
      these outcomes will occur at initial participant screener, baseline, mid-treatment (4.5
      months after the start of the program), and post-treatment (after 9 months).
