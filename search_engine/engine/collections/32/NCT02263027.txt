      detect an increase in systemic adverse events compared to control vaccination. These trials
      do identify a non-trivial risk of systemic symptoms occurring in the week after both placebo
      and vaccine. There is a small population of healthcare workers who report consistent systemic
      symptoms after split virus vaccination which may occur because a small group of healthy
      adults have true physical reactions to components of the vaccine or excipients. If this is
      true, then alternatives - such as the use of subunit vaccines or live attenuated nasal spray
      vaccines - might be expected to be better tolerated by these people.
