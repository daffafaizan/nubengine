      girls' motivation and skills to engage in safer sexual behavior (Project HEART: Health
      Education and Relationship Training). Half of participants will receive Project HEART and
      half of participants will receive Project Growing Minds, an attention-matched control website
      focused on growth mindsets of intelligence and self-regulation. The ultimate goal of this
      work is to help girls reduce their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and to
      avoid unplanned pregnancies.

      Primary outcomes for this study include 1) acceptability of the program, 2) communication
      self-efficacy, and 3) communication intentions.
