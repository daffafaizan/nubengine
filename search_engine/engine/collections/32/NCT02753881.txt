      is to perform an analysis of the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol on
      the body (doxorubicin pharmacokinetics ) after conventional transarterial chemoembolization
      (cTACE). A pharmacokinetics profile (PK profile) will be constructed and will include peak of
      plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum concentration (TMax), and area under the
      concentration curve (AUC). This composite measure will be used to compare patients in cTACE
      lobar administration and cTACE superselective administration. In addition, the PK profile
      will be correlated with toxicity, tumor burden, body surface area, and gender. Feasibility
      and safety will also be assessed.
