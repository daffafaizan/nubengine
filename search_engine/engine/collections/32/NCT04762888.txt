    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide (68Ga
      PSMA)-dual contrast PET/MRI for detection and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and
      to compare it with standard-of-care (SOC) imaging.

      II. To identify the biologic correlates of biomarkers derived from 68Ga PSMA-dual contrast
      PET/MRI with histopathology features and PSMA immunostaining of HCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Patients then undergo PET/MRI
      over 60 minutes or PET/CT over 30 minutes.
