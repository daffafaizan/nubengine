      only contributing to rising medical costs but also exposure to ionizing radiation, of which
      CT imaging plays a prominent role because it requires a relatively high dose of radiation to
      produce an image when compared to conventional X-rays. The growth in the use of CT imaging
      along with all other advanced medical imaging has been well documented, and taken as a whole
      the use of these services has grown quicker than all other services provided by physicians.
      Research has also shown great variability in the amount of radiation exposure to individual
      patients, even when patient and other characteristics are controlled for. Given the increase
      in the use of CT imaging and the variability in radiation exposure between similar imaging
      exams, it is important to study ways of standardizing and reducing radiation levels from CT
      imaging. Little is understood about the role of CT technologists' attitudes and how they may
      influence patient radiation exposure, therefore, this project also give us the opportunity to
      survey the technologists and determine if there is a relationship between technologist
      attitudes and awareness and the radiation exposure of patients.
