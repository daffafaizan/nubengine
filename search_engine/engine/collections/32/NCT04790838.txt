      (BE250-PIVOTAL), BECRO/RESP/BREATH-BE250-PILOT (BE250-PILOT) and BECRO/RESP/BREATH-PK250
      (PK250) were included.

      A pooled analysis of all three studies was conducted, including all eighty-two (82) subjects
      of the three studies. Then, a pooled analysis of the BE250-PIVOTAL and the respective Pilot
      study (BE250-PILOT) was also conducted since these two studies used products of the same
      batch, including forty-eight (48) subjects.
