      individuals. It requires quick reactions, executive function, memory and fine motor skill. In
      E-Sport competitions and tournaments, E-Sport players often play for hours per session over a
      series of days. Thus, the ability to maintain cognitive and executive function, concentration
      and fine motor skill is paramount. Two recent studies have evaluated the effects of ingesting
      bonded arginine silicate (ASI) and ASI with additional inositol on cognitive function. In the
      first study, ASI supplementation (1,500 mg/d for 3 days and 14 days) significantly improved
      the ability to perform complex cognitive tests requiring mental flexibility, processing speed
      and executive functioning. In the second study, adding 100 mg of inositol to the ASI
      significantly improved cognitive function in gamers after playing video games for one hour.
      This study is designed to assess the effects of bonded arginine silicate and inositol
      ingestion on reaction time and cognitive function prior to and following a 1-hour gaming
      challenge.
