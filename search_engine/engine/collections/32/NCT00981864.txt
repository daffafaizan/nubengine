      modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). IMRT is a sophisticated technique deliberately using multiple
      non-uniform beams, resulting in complex, conformal dose distributions. This technique offers
      several advantages. A concomitant IMRT boost potentially offers improved dose distributions
      by allowing more conformal doses around the boost volume and increased sparing of the
      remaining breast and adjacent organs at risk. Several studies have shown better target dose
      homogeneity resulting in less toxicity with adjuvant breast IMRT . One study found a
      significant reduction in the rates of moist desquamation with IMRT compared to wedged
      tangential fields (31% vs. 48%, P=0.0014).

      Longer treatment duration increases the inconvenience and decreases patient compliance.
      Furthermore, this places extra financial and emotional hardship on the patient and her
      family, particularly if they must travel long distances between home and the treatment
      centre. Studies have found 10-30% of patients do not receive adjuvant radiotherapy after
      lumpectomy,placing these patients at higher risk for local recurrence and death from disease.
      Radiobiologically, a boost increases the risk of late normal tissue effects. In the EORTC
      study, they found significantly higher but limited rates of severe fibrosis at 10 years of
      4.4% vs. 1.6% (p<0.0001) with the boost. No age effect was noted on the incidence of
      fibrosis. One study compared a shorter hypofractionated schedule of 42.5 Gy/16 fractions over
      3.5 weeks with the standard schedule of 50 Gy/25 fractions over 5 weeks and observed
      comparable 5 year local recurrence rates and cosmetic outcomes.
