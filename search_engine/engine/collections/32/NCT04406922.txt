      humans as it combusts fatty acids and glucose towards heat. Human BAT can be activated by
      sympathetic stimulation resulting from cold exposure or treatment with sympathomimetic drugs.
      Short-term acclimation to mild cold was shown to reduce fat mass in obese subjects and
      decrease peripheral insulin resistance of patients with T2DM. Recently, in preclinical
      studies the investigators showed that BAT has a circadian rhythm. It is currently unknown
      whether this is also the case in humans. The investigators postulate that BAT activity should
      display a circadian rhythm that adapts to changes in circadian behavior, and may determine
      glucose/lipid levels throughout the day.
