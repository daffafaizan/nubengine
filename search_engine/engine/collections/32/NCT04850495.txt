    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the safety, toxicity profile and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of zanubrutinib
      in combination with R-CHOP (ZaR-CHOP) for patients with previously untreated diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ZaR-CHOP in patients treated at
      the RP2D.

      II. Provide descriptive data on treatment exposure to zanubrutinib and R-CHOP including
      treatment discontinuation rate and relative dose intensity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of zanubrutinib and fixed-dose R-CHOP regimen
      followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive zanubrutinib orally (PO) once or twice daily on days 1-21, rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV on day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on
      day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.
