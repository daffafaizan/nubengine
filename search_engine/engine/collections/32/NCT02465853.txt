      patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain. The patients are randomly divided into two groups. In
      experimental group, the patients (25 people) will accept the shoulder hyaluronic acid
      injections for pain management. In control group, the patients (25 people) will receive 0.9%
      physiological saline injections. All participants will receive total 3 times shoulder
      injections at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd week. Except shoulder injections, stroke patients may receive
      regular rehabilitation program including physical therapy and occupational therapy. All
      measurements including shoulder sonography, physical examinations, and the questionnaire for
      life quality (SSQOL) will be conducted before the first injection, after completing shoulder
      injection, and 3/6 months after shoulder injection. Shoulder sonography is used to
      investigate shoulder soft tissue condition of hemiplegic shoulder including biceps tendon,
      infraspinatus tendon, supraspinatus tendon, subscapularis tendon, and subdeltoid bursa in
      this study. The physical examination includes all shoulder motion plane, shoulder sensory
      (light touch, pinprick, and position sense) and motor function (Fual Meyer scale and
      brunnstrom motor recovery stage), shoulder spasticity measured by modified Ashworth scale,
      and hemiplegic shoulder pain by visual analog scale. The investigators use Stroke Specific
      Quality of Life Scale to evaluate the quality of life in stroke patients with HSP. In this
      study, the investigators want to explore the short and long term effects of HA injection on
      pain relief, motor function recovery, and life quality in stroke patients with HSP.
