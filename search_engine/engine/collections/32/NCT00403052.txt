    
      This is a Phase I, open-label study of escalating dose levels of 1018 ISS in combination with
      irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Approximately 15 patients will be treated. The objectives of this study are to establish a
      safe, tolerable, and active dose of 1018 ISS, determine tumor response, time to disease
      progression, and overall survival in treated patients.

      The safety and tolerability of 1018 ISS will be evaluated by periodic laboratory assessments,
      physical examinations, and compilation of adverse events.

      Once study patients have been consented, screened, and assigned to one of the dose levels of
      1018 ISS, patients will receive two 4 week cycles of 1018 ISS therapy plus irinotecan every
      other week and cetuximab weekly. Irinotecan and cetuximab will continue thereafter until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient refuses treatment.
