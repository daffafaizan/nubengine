    
      Primary Objective and Endpoint To identify decrease in Ki-67 mRNA following treatment with
      entinostat across TNBC breast cancers.

      Secondary Objectives and Endpoints To identify messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene
      expression changes following treatment with entinostat, across TNBC.

      To evaluate changes in the proliferation signature by mRNA expression following treatment
      with entinostat across TNBC.

      To identify differential kinome activation before and after treatment with entinostat across
      TNBC

      To correlate mutation and/or copy number variations by whole exome sequencing (WES) with mRNA
      gene expression changes and reduction of proliferation signature following treatment with
      entinostat across TNBC.

      To correlate protein lysine hyperacetylation in peripheral blood and tumor from pre- and
      post-entinostat treated TNBCs.

      To explore molecular subtype, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and other immune checkpoint
      molecule expression, immune gene and innate anti-programed cell death-1 resistance (IPRES)
      expression signatures and phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including delineation
      of effector and regulatory T cells, and define T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire prior to and
      following entinostat treatment in TNBCs. We will also explore mutation and copy number
      variation status, and predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I neoantigen
      burden.

      To document safety of entinostat in patients with TNBC prior to their scheduled surgical
      resection per National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE
      v4.0).
