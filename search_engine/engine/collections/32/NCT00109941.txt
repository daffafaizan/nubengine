      Primary

        -  Determine the growth inhibitory effects of opioid growth factor ([Met^5]-enkephalin) in
           patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pain control, depression, and nutritional status of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive opioid growth factor ([Met^5]-enkephalin) IV over 45 minutes once weekly.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks during study treatment, and at the
      completion of study treatment.

      Patients are followed weekly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
