      surgical rehabilitation of patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) undergoing
      either type I thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the management of
      unilateral vocal cord paralysis. This study will use the non-invasive imaging technique,
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to investigate cortical responses and responses
      in the larynx of patients with UVCP who have been deemed to be candidates for either type I
      thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the purpose of rehabilitating this
      UVCP. Patterns of brain activity from the fMRI studies will be compared with the preoperative
      study with each patient serving as their own control for the purpose of evaluating the
      alterations in sensory motor organization of the brain in response to UVCP. In addition,
      responses in patients with UVCP will be compared to normal controls. This will allow us to
      identify the impact on speech and swallowing and the subsequent reorganization which we
      theorize will occur in response to the vocal cord medialization. Patients will undergo
      standardized voice evaluation with improvement in voice serving as a secondary endpoint. The
      results of the current investigation will provide needed information on both central and
      peripheral mechanisms of adaptation.
