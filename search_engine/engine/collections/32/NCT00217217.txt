      in bipolar depressed individuals was associated with reports of improved mood. These studies
      employed oscillating magnetic fields similar to those used in functional MRI (fMRI), but
      which differ from the usual fMRI scan in field direction, waveform frequency, and strength.
      As the abbreviation EP-MRSI is used to describe several relatively common MR sequences, the
      specific potential clinical procedure being used is referred to as low field magnetic
      stimulation or LFMS. Following these initial results, investigators are conducting studies to
      determine the critical variables in both subjects and treatment for optimal response. Studies
      are also underway to characterize the response of specific depression symptoms, the degree of
      response, and the duration of response.
