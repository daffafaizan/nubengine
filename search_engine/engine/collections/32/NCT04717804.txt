      Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) approach for treatment of lung cancer. The study will compare
      whether the quick snapshot or longer-last image is more representative of breathing motion.
      The standard of care way to verify breathing is to use the Cone Beam Computerized Tomography
      (CBCT) before each treatment. For this study the researchers will use two other standard of
      care ways to verify breathing motion during treatment only during the first and last
      radiation treatment sessions. During the other radiation treatment sessions the CBCT alone
      will be used. These two other methods are FDA approved, but not routinely being used at the
      Mays Cancer Center. One method is called 4D-CBCT and is conducted immediately prior to
      treatment. This will create an image taken over a longer time of the patient's lungs which
      will be compared with the images from the CT Simulation used to plan the radiation. The other
      way is called Intrafractional CBCT and is imaging that is done at the same time as the
      radiation treatment delivery. This will show the researchers how the tumor is moving while
      the radiation treatment is taking place. These two methods require a longer treatment time,
      approximately 10 minutes during the first and last treatments.
