      the study, as well as availability. Following telephone screening, participants will meet
      with a clinician who will administer a semi-structured interview to determine diagnostic
      status followed by a more specific standard semi-structured interview to measure symptom
      strength in those participants who meet diagnostic criteria of OCD (primary obsessions).
      Participants will then be invited to join the study. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to either immediate treatment or delayed treatment (three month delay). Participants will
      then be again be randomly assigned to either Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) or Stress
      Management Therapy (SMT). The delayed participants (wait list control) will be randomly
      assigned to either of the two active treatment groups in three months time. Both active
      treatment conditions involve one hours, individual treatment sessions for 12 consecutive
      weeks by one of the treating psychologists. All participants will also be asked to complete a
      package of psychometric questionnaires before treatment. Participants assigned to the delayed
      treatment condition will be asked to complete these questionnaires again before proceeding to
      treatment once they have completed the three month wait. The participants will be
      re-evaluated at the end of treatment, at six months after treatment, and at one year after
      treatment, using the same assessment procedure.
