      receptors. Somatostatin analog PET tracers, such as 68Ga-DOTANOC, bind to somatostatin
      receptors and are able to detect pulmonary TB lesions using PET/MRI. This study aims to
      better understand the pathology of the spectrum of latent TB using 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI
      imaging, identifying individuals with subclinical pulmonary TB who may be at risk of
      progressing to active TB.

      Currently, biomarkers to identify those who are at risk of developing active TB are limited.
      Non-invasive biomarkers for pulmonary lesions are sorely needed and imaging with 68Ga-DOTANOC
      PET/MRI provides an opportunity to detect subclinical pulmonary disease in those who have
      been in close contact with smear-positive pulmonary TB.
