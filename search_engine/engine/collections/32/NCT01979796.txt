      safety of electronic cigarette. The trial will take the form of a prospective 12-month
      randomized clinical study to evaluate smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and adverse
      events in schizophrenic smokers not intending to quit. The investigators will also monitor
      quality of life, neurocognitive functioning and measure participants' perception and
      satisfaction of the product.

      The main strengths of the SCARIS study are the following: it's the first large RCT on
      schizophrenic patient, involving in and outpatient, evaluating the effect of a three-arm
      study design, and a long term of follow-up (52-weeks).
