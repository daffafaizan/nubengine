           of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on how much total dose the tumor requires. The radiation
           doctor will see the participant once each week to monitor and record any side effects
           they may have from radiation treatment.

        -  A special device will be made for each participant to help them hold still during the
           treatment. This may either be a mask or foam cradle, depending on the area to be
           treated.
