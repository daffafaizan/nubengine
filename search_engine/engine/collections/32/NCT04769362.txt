      reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, current major guidelines recommend that oral
      treatment of β-blockers should be continued during and after hospitalization in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without contraindications to β-blocker use.

      A clinically important but difficult decision on β-blocker therapy after AMI is to determine
      the duration of β-blocker therapy after discharge in patients without heart failure (HF) or
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Previous studies for long-term β-blocker therapy after
      AMI were inadequate to derive definite conclusion because of small sample size and potential
      selection bias.

      Therefore, the SMART-DECISION trial will investigate whether discontinuation of β-blocker
      after at least 1 year of β-blocker therapy is noninferior to continuation of β-blocker in
      patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI.
