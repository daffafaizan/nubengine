      intracoronary 316L stainless steel stent with a coating that consists of a blend of Sirolimus
      and polymers.

      Sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent which has been proven to prolong graft survival
      in many animal models of transplantation. Sirolimus prevents both proliferation and migration
      of smooth muscle cells (in vivo and in vitro) in graft and balloon injury models.
      Furthermore, Sirolimus has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis and the need for
      repeat revascularization while demonstrating superior efficacy measures such as angiographic
      late loss and binary restenosis.

      The NEVO™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is a cobalt-chromium alloy stent platform that
      incorporates two unique features: reservoir technology, and a bioresorbable polymer which
      prevents initial contact between the polymer and the vessel wall and chronic polymer
      exposure. This design minimized initial tissue exposure to polymer, and also enables polymer
      resorption within approximately three months.
