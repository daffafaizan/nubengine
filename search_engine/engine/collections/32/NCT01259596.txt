      stigma, transportation, lack of local appropriately trained service providers, and impaired
      mobility. The proposed treatment is delivered in a workbook format and by telephone, which
      maximizes its portability. Treatment will be compared with nondirective supportive therapy, a
      very credible comparison condition equivalent to the intervention in therapist attention. We
      propose to randomize 88 adults â‰¥ 60 years with a diagnosis of GAD to either cognitive
      behavioral therapy delivered by telephone, or nondirective supportive therapy. The 2 primary
      treatment outcomes are anxiety symptoms as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and
      worry symptoms as assessed by the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated. The proposed
      secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms, sleep, disability, and quality of life. Further,
      mediators and moderators of the treatment effect will also be examined. Mediators include
      process variables (therapeutic alliance, adherence, participant satisfaction, and treatment
      credibility) and new psychotropic medication use; moderators include demographic information
      (age, education, gender, race, income), psychiatric variables (baseline anxiety severity,
      baseline depressive disorders, baseline psychotropic medication use), medical comorbidity,
      and therapist assignment. Maintenance of response will be assessed over 6 months. This
      research has great public health significance, because it is a low-cost intervention with
      high potential for widespread dissemination, and it targets an underserved group -
      community-dwelling rural elders - who currently lack effective treatment interventions
      tailored to their needs.
