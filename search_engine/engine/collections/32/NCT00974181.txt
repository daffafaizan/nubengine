      prospective, multi-center, two-arm study to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      CoStarÂ® stent for the treatment of symptomatic ischemic heart disease attributable to
      stenotic de novo lesions of the native coronary arteries that are amenable to treatment by
      percutaneous stenting.
