      children. However, sometimes the child has to receive a certain dose that requires a very
      large volume to be administered into the nose, because of the types of concentrations of
      drugs that are available. Most drugs are not concentrated enough so that small volumes can be
      consistently given, so as a result, sometimes a very large amount of medication is
      administered intranasally. When the amount is too large, most of the medication either runs
      back out the nose, or down the back of the nose and throat and is swallowed, instead of being
      absorbed in the nasal cavity, where it can be quickly absorbed and produce optimal
      effectiveness.
