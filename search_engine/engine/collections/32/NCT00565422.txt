      perceived inability to control their 'non-essential' (non-job/school related) use of the
      Internet. Frequently these people develop a preoccupation with the Internet, a need for
      escape to the Internet, and increasing irritability when trying to cut back use of the
      Internet. There have been no studies to date looking at the effectiveness of medications in
      the treatment of this disorder. In our clinical experience, we find these patients with
      Internet addiction usually respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors within 12 weeks. This
      study will examine the efficacy of escitalopram in Internet addiction among adults.
