      related to race and socioeconomic status (SES). Our previous work confirms these disparities
      and suggests that they may be related to population differences in the prevalence of
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. We propose that these disparities can be
      significantly reduced or eliminated by (1) a community-based intervention program that
      incorporates a multidisciplinary education program led by a behavioral interventionalist, a
      nutritionist and an exercise physiologist, and (2) a novel approach to cardiovascular risk
      stratification that considers population differences in traditional and nontraditional risk
      factors and subclinical atherosclerosis.

      To successfully implement this program, particularly in traditionally underserved
      communities, we have formalized a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh School of
      Medicine and Graduate School of Public Health, the Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center, and the
      Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Urban League of Pittsburgh, and Jewish Healthcare
      Foundation. This partnership is positioned to study the following specific aims:

        1. To determine whether a community-based intervention program that incorporates a
           multidisciplinary education program led by a behavioral interventionalist, a
           nutritionist, and an exercise physiologist can reduce racial and socioeconomic
           disparities in cardiovascular risk in intermediate and high risk populations.

        2. To ascertain whether a comprehensive assessment of nontraditional risk factors and
           subclinical atherosclerosis can provide incremental value above and beyond traditional
           risk assessment in identifying individuals at high cardiovascular risk.
