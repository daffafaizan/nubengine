      pediatric trials for acute pain therapeutics in infants and young children from a caregiver's
      perception. Study team members will conduct phone-based qualitative interviews, using a
      semi-structured interview guide, with 42 primary caregivers of pediatric patients under 3
      years of age who are experiencing or have experienced acute pain. Once participants give
      verbal consent, they will fill out a demographics form. Interviews will last about one hour
      and will address the participant's experience recognizing and managing their child's acute
      pain. The investigators will use these concept elicitation interviews to identify important
      aspects of acute pain assessment, treatment, and response to treatment in children who are
      under 3 years old. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed with participant
      permission. Transcripts or interviewer notes will be reviewed by two analysts and will be
      double coded until inter-rater reliability is reached by agreement of at least 80%. The study
      team will conduct a thematic analysis of the coded transcripts. This is a minimal risk study.
      All information will be kept confidential and information will be stored on a secure network
      which is only accessible to the study team.
