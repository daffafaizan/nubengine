      found on medical images are also reflections of the tumor biological behavior. However, the
      limitations in spatial and intensity resolution of the naked eye are two inevitable
      shortcomings of image interpretation by naked eyes, resulting in subjective and limited
      analyses of images. Computer aided image analyses such as radiomic analysis and machine
      learning methods are emerging as promising image interpretation methods. The natural
      advantage of the unlimited spatial and intensity resolution of computers can overcome the
      shortcomings of visual inspection with the naked eye. Moreover, the massive computing power
      of computer is also far greater than that of humans. This study will focus on the application
      of computer aided analysis in predicting treatment response and prognosis in lung cancer.
