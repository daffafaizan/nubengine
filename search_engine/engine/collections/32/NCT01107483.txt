           venipuncture and using pyrogen-free syringes, needles, and glassware. Plasma samples
           were heated at 70℃ for 10 min. Plasma concentration was then measured in duplicate using
           a commercially available Limulus amebocyte lysate assay following the manufacturer's
           protocol.

        3. ELISA ELISA kits were used to assess in duplicate the plasma concentrations of IL-6,
           IL-10, TNFα, sICAM-1 and sCD14.
