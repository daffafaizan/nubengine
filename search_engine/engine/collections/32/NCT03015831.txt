      several studies to lower the incidence AF but the results were generally disappointing. There
      was no benefit in reducing AF and there was a high incidence of GI side effects especially
      diarrhea, often leading to stopping the medication. However, a recently published
      meta-analysis showed that colchicine reduced AF, but again warned of the high incidence of GI
      side effects. The maintenance dose of colchicine used in these studies was 1 mg daily it is
      hypothesized that low dose colchicine (0.5 not 1 mg colchicine) might lower AF after cardiac
      surgery without the prohibitive GI side effects Patients will be randomized to colchicine vs.
      placebo started the day before surgery and continued until hospital discharge.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the incidence of AF. The primary safety endpoint will
      be the GI side effects
