      questionnaire, dietary compliance, and quantities of food returned over the 12 weeks.

      Analysis of differences in weight loss will be based on all participants with a baseline and
      a 12-week weight assessment. In order to investigate the impact of missing data, all subjects
      will be analysed using last weight observation carried forward and baseline weight carried
      forward.

      Other secondary endpoints will determine the effect of the Korean diet on blood pressure,
      metabolic parameters and chronic metabolic disease control in the Australian population.
