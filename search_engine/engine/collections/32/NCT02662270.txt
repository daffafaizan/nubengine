      views with skepticism and only recently was accepted as a true condition by the World Health
      Organization. Some physicians see it as a form of depresion mixed with rheumatic pain.
      However recent findings in functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emited
      tomography documented diminished brain activity on several regions. The impairments must be
      located within the areas with a documented functional defect, wherein, spontaneous braincells
      activity chould arise. Therefor electroencephalography findings should be a valuable
      diagnostic tool for early detection in fibromyalgia. The present study aims to analyse the
      differences between bioelectric characteristics in EEG from fibromyalgia patients with their
      eyes closed in a 21 electrode arragement. Normal graphoelements as well as abnormal ones and
      its topographic distribution and functional conections will be analyzed.

      The working hypotesis is that fibromyalgia patients will present distintive characteristics
      in the same areas where a diminished brain activity has been documented by metabolic and
      morphologic tests as a group and that those characteristics are suitable to be measured by
      QEEG and distinguishable from healthy subjects.
