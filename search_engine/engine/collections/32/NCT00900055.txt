    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify the specific molecular function of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementing gene
           products in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients and normal volunteers.

        -  Identify functional defects in hematopoietic stromal cells, including macrophages, from
           patients with FA, and selected blood cancers as well as normal volunteers.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, and marrow fibroblasts
      are collected for loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis related to the Fanconi
      anemia complementing gene.
