      individuals living in Germany are men who have sex with men (MSM) whereas only 15% were
      infected by heterosexual contact. The HIV epidemic is mainly restricted to big cities such as
      Cologne, Berlin, Hamburg. The successful conduct of HIV vaccine efficacy trials requires
      recruitment, enrolment, and long-term retention of informed, willing, and HIV-negative but
      at-risk participants. Therefore, the University Hospital Essen plans a vaccine preparedness
      study to assess the feasibility of future HIV vaccine efficacy trials in Germany, a subtype B
      prevalent region in Europe, as this has never been assessed in Germany.

      Notably investigators conduct a cohort study to characterize HIV incidence and retention
      among high risk, HIV uninfected MSM/Transgender women (TGW)/Transgender Men (TGM)/Intersex in
      the setting of prevention modalities that may be available to participants, including PrEP
      and regular HIV risk reduction counselling and testing. The design of the study will address
      several unique questions about the community at highest risk for HIV infection and will
      provide strong data for prevention methods including PrEP.

      Moreover, it has been clearly demonstrated that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can
      increase the risk of acquiring a HIV infection. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of
      STI is crucial to reduce this risk factor of HIV acquisition and to inform individuals about
      their risk to become HIV infected. As STIs are a crucial factor in the scope of an incidence
      analysis of HIV in MSM and are underdiagnosed often, extensive screening measures are
      implemented within the study to an extent never performed in Germany before.
