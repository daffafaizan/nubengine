      in vivo studies.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of three different treatment regimen arms
      containing either the active drug or matching placebo tablet

      Following conclusion of 12 months of follow-up of DNDi-CH-FEXI-001 clinical trial, unblinded
      data review showed high sustained parasite clearance rates of FEXI even at the lowest dose
      tested (1200 mg 2 weeks), including in patients that received < 3days treatment.
