        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of intrapleural BG00001 in patients with malignant
           pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusions.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the success of gene transfer/interferon beta gene expression in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine systemic and intrapleural cytokine responses and cellular and humoral immune
           response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive BG00001 via an intrapleural catheter on day 1.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BG00001 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, biweekly for 1 month, monthly for 4 months, and
      then every 6 months for 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
