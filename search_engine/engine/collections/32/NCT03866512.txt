      with ingestion of one of two drug or placebo. Before and after immobilization, they will
      receive a stable isotope tracer infusion (5.5 h) combined with repeated blood and muscle
      sampling under insulin clamp conditions, in order to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle
      protein synthesis in the fasted and fed state.
