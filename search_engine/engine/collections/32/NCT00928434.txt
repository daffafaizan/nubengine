    
      This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to determine if degarelix
      intermittent therapy was non-inferior to continuous androgen deprivation therapy (combination
      of treatment groups receiving continuous degarelix and leuprolide therapy, respectively) in
      maintaining PSA levels at ≤ 4.0 ng/mL at 14 months.

      The study consisted of two phases, Phase A and B. During Phase A, patients in the degarelix
      intermittent and degarelix continuous arms received 7 months of therapy with degarelix
      one-month depot formulation and patients in the leuprolide continuous arm received leuprolide
      one-month depot injection (7.5 mg) followed by two 3-month depot (22.5 mg) injections. After
      7 months of treatment, patients with a PSA ≤2 ng/mL continued into Phase B.

      During Phase B, patients in the degarelix intermittent arm had a 7-month off-treatment
      period. Patients randomized to the degarelix continuous arm and the leuprolide continuous arm
      continued to receive degarelix or leuprolide depot as in Phase A for the remainder of the 14
      months.
