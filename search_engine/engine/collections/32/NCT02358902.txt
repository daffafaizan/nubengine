      into account a type I error of 5%, a type II error of 10% and a power of 80%. From the sample
      calculation was found an n = 10 for each group. The sample is amplified in order to avoid
      possible effects of dropout ending with a n = 15 in each group with a total N = 45.

      Randomization was performed by a blinded therapist using sealed envelopes for each
      individual. The subjects will be divided into three intervention groups: tDCS (tDCS - DC
      stimulator, Neurocom, Germany) / AE Group, in which will receive active intervention of
      aerobic exercise training and active tDCS intervention. AE group, which will receive active
      intervention of aerobic exercise and placebo tDCS. And tDCS group, which will receive placebo
      AE and active intervention for tDCS.

      Participants will be blinded to the intervention groups as well as therapists involved in the
      evaluation process.

      The evaluation methods were carried out one week before the beginning of the intervention
      (baseline) for all variables. After the first week of intervention (neuromodulatory period)
      was performed ratings for level of cortical excitability (T1), and after the end of the one
      month period of intervention for all variables (T2). Follow-up evaluations were conducted one
      month (T3) and two months (T4) after the end of the intervention period."
