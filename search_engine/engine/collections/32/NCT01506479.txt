      conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of exercise on the
      progression of PD symptoms. The primary aim is to determine whether individuals with de novo
      Parkinson's disease (na√Øve to drug treatment) can achieve the randomly assigned levels of
      mean exercise intensity (60-65% HRmax or 80-85% HRmax) and adhere to the exercise protocol.
