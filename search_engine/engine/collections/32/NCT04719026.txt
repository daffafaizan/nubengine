      myocardial infarction and results from interaction of genetic, lifestyle and environmental
      factors. However, as many as 50% of CAD patients lack classical risk factors of CAD
      suggesting the presence of other contributory mechanisms. Inflammation plays a central role
      in the initiation and growth of the plaques which form in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and
      lead to CAD3. As such periodontal disease, an inflammatory process leading to progressive
      destruction of tooth-supporting structures, has been associated with CAD. In vivo
      pre-clinical studies have shown that bacteria associated with periodontal disease can
      exacerbate atherosclerosis 7. Numerous clinical studies have explored the association between
      periodontal disease and CAD at different follow-up times following episodes of myocardial
      infarction 8-9. However, there are no reports investigating this association during the acute
      phase of myocardial infarction. In addition the need for rigorous matching of all known CAD
      risk factors in case control studies has so far been overseen.

      RATIONALE FOR STUDY:

      This case-control study aims to compare the health of tooth supporting structures
      (periodontium) in patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction to a control group of
      patients rigorously matched for known CAD risk factors, age and gender.
