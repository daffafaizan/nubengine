      Primary

        -  To determine the 90-day clinical benefit (defined as the sum of complete responses,
           partial responses, and stable disease) in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial
           cancer treated with single agent fulvestrant.

      Secondary

        -  To establish the time to termination of treatment (due to all causes including
           progression and intolerance) for patients treated with this drug.

        -  To describe the toxicities observed in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the effect that prolonged estrogen receptor antagonism has on markers of
           bone mineral turnover.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and then
      on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in continued response at
      the end of 1 year may continue treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Urinary N-telopeptide and serum skeletal-specific alkaline phosphatase are assessed at
      baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months during study to determine the influence of estrogen
      blockade on bone mineral turnover.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 3 months during treatment, and at the end
      of treatment using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O) cancer
      questionnaire.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days.
