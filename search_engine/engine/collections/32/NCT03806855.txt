      evaluation were reviewed. The classification of OAB-wet or OAB-dry is based on the record of
      the three-day bladder diary of each patient. The diagnosis of OAB in each patient was based
      on the presence of at least one episode of urgency in her three-day bladder diary and with
      the absence of stress urinary incontinence. The presence of at least one episode of urgency
      associated incontinence was defined to be OAB-wet, otherwise, OAB-dry. Besides, only female
      OAB patients with available King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) data were reviewed in this
      study.
