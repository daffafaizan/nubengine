      debilitating event. Usually taking the form of physical therapy prior to surgery,
      prehabilitation programs have demonstrated success in colorectal, urological, and surgical
      oncology cases. Patients with a gynecologic oncology diagnosis face an arduous course. Their
      treatment generally involves a major surgery and is often followed by chemotherapy,
      radiation, or both.The patient population is generally older in life as the average age for
      an endometrial or ovarian cancer diagnosis is 63. These patients may already have a lower
      performance status at baseline deeming their treatment course exponentially more difficult to
      endure. Women with gynecologic cancer suffer significant mental duress often living in fear
      of the high rates of recurrence from some of these malignancies suggesting they may benefit
      from psychologic support and counseling through their treatment.

      Given the proven success in other surgical disciplines, we believe that instituting
      prehabilitation programs should be standard of care. Patients will be randomized to a
      trimodal approach (physical therapy, nutritional counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy)
      versus a unimodal intervention (physical therapy) for a formal prehabilitation program. Our
      primary outcome will be functional return to baseline following surgery with secondary
      outcomes including items such as quality of life assessments, patient satisfaction, and
      compliance.
