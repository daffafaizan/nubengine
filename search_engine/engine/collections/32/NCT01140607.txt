    
      The study consists of:

        -  a screening phase (maximum length of 21-day).

        -  a treatment phase with 21-day study treatment cycles. Cycle lengths may be extended up
           to maximum of 12 additional days in case of unresolved toxicity.

      Patients continue to receive treatment until they experience, unacceptable toxicities/AEs,
      disease progression ,withdraw their consent, or the investigator decides to discontinue the
      patient, or study cut-off, whichever comes first.

        -  a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.

      The cut off date is when the last patient treated has completed cycle 1 and the subsequent 30
      days follow-up.

      Patients may continue to be treated as long as they are benefiting from study treatment and
      have not met study withdrawal criteria.
