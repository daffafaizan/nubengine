    
      Over 18 years old patients, with leg with or without low back neuropathic pain (DN4 â‰¥4),
      previously undergoing low back surgery that, after an Evidence-Based (EB) medical therapy,
      can be eligible to SCS therapy following the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will be
      implanted of two leads in the epidural thoracic level with at least two poles (Medtronic
      Vectris) covering the T9-T10 interspace and, if the trial is positive, a Medtronic Intellis
      Internal Pulse Generators (IPG) will be implanted.

      The patients will be randomized to two groups to compare the improvement of pain control, the
      functional state and the quality of life of the patients by SCS Therapy across 12 months.
