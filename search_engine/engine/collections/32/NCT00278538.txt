      normal saline (NS) over 1 hour. Hydration with 0.9 NS at approximately 100-250-ml/ hour will
      begin 4 hours prior to cyclophosphamide and continued for 24 hours after termination of
      cyclophosphamide. Urine output approximately greater than 100 ml/hour should be maintained.

      Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be administered subcutaneously at 5-10
      mcg/kg/day and will be started 5 days after termination of cyclophosphamide administration.

      After the absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1000/ul or after hematological nadir,
      leukapheresis using a continuous flow blood cell separator will be initiated. A 10-15 liter
      apheresis will be performed unless stopped earlier for clinical judgment of toxicity (e.g.,
      numbness, tetany). The G-CSF will continue until apheresis is discontinued. If necessary,
      platelets will be transfused to greater than 60,000/ul prior to each apheresis.

      Conditioning Regimen Mesna: 50mg/kg/day x 4 days will be given intravenously over 24 hours.

      Cyclophosphamide: 50 mg/kg/day x 4 days (the lesser of ideal or actual weight) will be given
      intravenously over 1 hour in 250 cc of normal saline on days -5 through -2.

      Hydration: approximately 50-200cc/hour in adults should begin 6 hours before cyclophosphamide
      and continue until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose. Hydration rates need to be
      individually adjusted by daily weights to maintain dry weight count. Twice daily weights will
      be obtained. Warning: Participants with renal insufficiency are prone to volume overload.
      Early institution of ultrafiltration or dialysis is recommended.

      rATG 0.5mg/kg will be given IV on day -5, 1.0mg/kg will be given on day

      -4, 1.5mg/kg will be given IV on days -3, -2, -1 (no dose adjustment). It will be given over
      10 hours. Premedicate with Solumedrol 250mg IV, acetaminophen 650mg po qd and diphenhydramine
      25mg 30 minutes before infusion.

      Rituximab 500mg/day will be given IV on days -6 and +1. At the first dose (D-6), rituximab
      infusion will be started at 50mg/h and escalate the infusion rate by 50mg every 30minutes to
      a maximum of 400mg/h. Starting the second dose (days -4, -2 and +1). IV infusion will be
      started at 100mg/h and escalate the infusion rate 100mg every 30minutes to a maximum of
      400mg/h. Premedicate with Solumedrol 250mg IV, acetaminophen 650mg po qd and diphenhydramine
      25mg 30 minutes before infusion on days -6 and +1. Premedicate acetaminophen 650mg po qd and
      diphenhydramine 25mg 30 minutes before infusion on days -4 and -2.

      Stem Cell Reinfusion Previously collected stem cells will be reinfused on day 0 as noted in
      Table 4. The stem cells are infused over approximately 20 minutes through the central venous
      catheter, such as a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line). Following stem cell
      reinfusion, routine daily labs will be obtained including complete blood count (CBC),
      chemistry panel, and liver function tests. Antibiotics and blood transfusions will be
      administered as required by clinical judgment.
