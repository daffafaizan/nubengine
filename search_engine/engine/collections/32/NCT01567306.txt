      pratense extract in depot presentation using 3 different dose escalation scheme. The
      objective was to compare tolerance and safety of the three dose escalation scheme as well as
      to determine the maximum dose tolerated by the population.

      Once the range of tolerated doses was established, and following the strict norms of the EMA,
      a Phase II dose response clinical trial was designed wherein the efficacy of subcutaneous
      immunotherapy in depot presentation could be compared in 5 different doses. One of these
      doses will be the MTD established by the population in the first study, another will be lower
      than this dose, and three will be greater than it. The dose escalation scheme to be tested
      was chosen based on the results of the aforementioned clinical trial. As dictated by EMA
      norms, a control placebo will be used.
