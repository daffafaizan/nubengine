      with significant immediate and long-term complications, particularly difficult to endure in
      adolescent patients. Tumor response is assessed only at resection, often after the patient
      has received months of potentially toxic and ineffective therapy. Surgical approaches in this
      setting are extensive and life changing, with amputations not uncommon. Poor response to NAC
      is the single most important prognostic indicator in localized OS/ES. Early identification of
      those patients unlikely to benefit from the prescribed regimen could have significant
      clinical implications and allow for earlier adjustments in the patient's therapy. In patients
      with OS/ES there remains a compelling yet unmet need for more advanced quantitative,
      noninvasive imaging methods that can be deployed early after the initiation of treatment and
      which are capable of longitudinally measuring quantitative changes in relevant physiological,
      metabolic and/or biophysical parameters that can serve as reliable surrogates, or even
      predictors, of long-term tumor response to intervention, including pathological response at
      surgery. In this pilot study we will use multi-parametric 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, deployed before
      and after the first cycle of NAC, to correlate early changes in imaging biomarkers with the
      patient's eventual histopathological response at surgical resection. We will measure
      treatment-induced changes in: 1) protein content, measured via the amide proton transfer
      asymmetry (APTasym) using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI); 2) tumor
      fibrosis, measured via the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) using magnetization transfer
      (MT) MRI); 3) tumor cellularity, measured via the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using
      diffusion-weighted MRI); and 4) tumor perfusion, measured via the volume transfer coefficient
      (Ktrans) using dynamic contrast-enhanced DCE-MRI. The relevance and future clinical impact of
      each of these imaging biomarkers (alone or in combination) in OS/ES is potentially very high.
