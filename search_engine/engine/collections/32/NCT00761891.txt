      aspirin-treated patients fail to exhibit expected changes in bleeding time and platelet
      aggregation. Recent evidence has correlated aspirin "non-response" to poor cardiovascular
      outcomes.

      In order to study the mechanisms of aspirin resistance, an assay is needed to measure the
      catalytic activity of platelet cyclooxygenase (which should be inhibited by aspirin). A
      common assay in general use is the measurement of thromboxane B2 production in clotting whole
      blood. This measure, however, is influenced by genetic and environmental variations in the
      glass-activated coagulation pathway, albumin binding capacity, platelet activation pathways,
      arachidonic acid pools, and phospholipase activity.

      Our laboratory has developed a direct assay of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX-1) activity that
      is not influenced by these variations. This study will generate a reference range in normal
      volunteers taking a routine clinical dose of aspirin (81mg daily) for this assay.
