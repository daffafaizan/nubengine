    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-plan, prospective clinical study. According to the
      available evidence, we selected patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer with stage Ⅲ-C-Ⅳ confirmed by cytology or histology and positive
      EGFR-sensitive mutation, then patients accept first-line treatment with S-1 plus gefitinib or
      gefitinib. This study will collect FFS during treatment until the patient dies and will
      follow the survival of the subject after the disease progresses.
