      I. To determine whether recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages is related to
      clinicopathological factors in Wilms tumor (tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor
      progression, and survival).

      OUTLINE:

      Paraffin-embedded specimens are analyzed for macrophage markers. Results of each sample are
      then compared with patient's tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression,
      and survival.
