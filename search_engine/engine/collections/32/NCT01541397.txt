    
      Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
      phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) (NIH, October 16-18, 2000). Elevated plasma levels of
      phenylalanine (phe) cause mental retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, eczema,
      and behavior abnormalities. Adequate control of the plasma levels of phe by a phe-restricted
      diet can prevent the developmental and behavioral problems.

      The foundation of this diet is a phe-free metabolic medical product/formula made from free
      amino acids. Based on longitudinal studies, it has been reported that the most benefit is
      attained by individuals who maintain a phe-restricted diet throughout life. On December 13,
      2007, KUVAN™ (sapropterin dihydrochloride) was approved by the FDA for the indication of
      reducing blood phe levels in patients with HPA due to BH4 responsive PKU, in conjunction with
      a phe restricted diet (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Investigator's Brochure March 25, 2008).
      Studies were performed to determine a definition of response to KUVAN™. In a phase 2 clinical
      trial in 2007, Burton, et. al. defined a Kuvan™ responder as having a 30% or greater
      improvement in blood phenylalanine levels compared to baseline after 8 days of drug therapy.

      Kuvan™ has been shown to improve phenylalanine tolerance in some individuals with HPA. This
      drug enables these individuals to consume more protein from natural sources. However, there
      have been no research studies assessing the effects of KUVAN™ along with liberalization of
      the diet on bone mineral density.

      The investigators propose a prospective study to compare the bone mineral density in adults
      with HPA on KUVAN™ therapy to those not on therapy. The investigators hypothesize that after
      one year of KUVAN™ therapy, there will be an improvement in their bone mineral density.
