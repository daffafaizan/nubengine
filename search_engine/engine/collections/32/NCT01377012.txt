      CAIN457F2302E1 (Extension study): terminated early May 26 2015, ((unrelated to safety) due to
      the results of study AIN457F2309, which indicated the efficacy of AIN457 was not comparable
      to the currently available RA treatment, abatacept, thus leading to closing of the AIN457 RA
      program.
