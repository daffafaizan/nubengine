      Although atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are widely used as treatment of choice
      for these illness based on acute efficacy and safety, long-term efficacy and safety of these
      agents are still open to debate. Prospective follow-up study in naturalistic condition may be
      a useful way of elucidating cons and pros of long-term psychopharmacotherapy.In this study,
      efficacy and various side effects of drugs will be measured, and the possibility of
      neurophysiological markers will be tested by serial measurements of electroencephalographic
      changes.
