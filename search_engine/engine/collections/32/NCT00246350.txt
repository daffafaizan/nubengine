    
      Spinal manipulation is the signature therapy of chiropractic care involving manual adjustment
      of joints in the neck and back. Data indicate that spinal manipulation is an effective
      treatment for back pain and chronic headaches, particularly cervicogenic headaches, which are
      caused by problems in the cervical spine. However, studies that have determined the optimal
      frequency and duration of spinal manipulation treatment are limited. This study will
      determine the feasibility of conducting a large spinal manipulation clinical trial. This
      study will also determine the effectiveness of spinal manipulation in treating cervicogenic
      headaches and neck pain and the optimal number of treatments necessary to sustain spinal
      manipulation benefits.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of either spinal
      manipulation or light massage treatments for 8 to 16 weeks. Self-report scales will be used
      to assess participants' headache frequency, pain, satisfaction with treatment, and overall
      physical and mental health. Assessments will occur at study entry, at the end of each week,
      and at the end of the study.
