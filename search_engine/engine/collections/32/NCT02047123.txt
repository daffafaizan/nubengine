      conducted at a pharmacy in Elche on female clients with mild alterations in their lipid
      profile. Since they were patients with a high cardiovascular risk, the investigators aimed to
      determine the effect of the administration of (FS+Y+D), (Y+D) and (D) on various nutritional
      indicators.

      A monitoring of nutritional intervention was carried out for 30 days and blood samples were
      obtained by capillary puncture for total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, glucose. These
      parameters were determined in situ by dry chemistry. A series of anthropometric measures were
      also carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study including weight and height,
      BMI (Body Mass Index), WHR (waist-hip ratio), systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and
      heart rate.

      Statistical analysis was carried out using STATGRAPHICS Centurion XV software (StatPoint
      Technologies, Inc. Warrington, VA, USA); likewise, significance was defined at p ≤ 0.05. Data
      are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (sem). Intra-group statistical comparisons
      were performed using the following hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric:
      t-test, sign test and signed rank test for paired samples. Inter-group statistical
      comparisons were performed using the one-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis
      hypothesis tests. Also, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) Multiple Range Test and
      Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) were used in order to determine which means
      were significantly different from the others. In addition, Generalized Multiple Regression
      was used to statistically analyze the relationships between the variations in the lipid
      profile and the different factors included in the study.
