    
      ICU Recovery Clinic is standard of care for patients surviving a critical illness in the
      Medical ICU at the University of Kentucky. The ICU Recovery Clinic includes a
      transdisciplinary team with input from five disciplines that provide coordinated outpatient
      care with a focus on medical issues, medication management, nutrition, sleep disruption, and
      any issues related to post-intensive care syndrome such as anxiety, depression, PTSD,
      cognitive dysfunction and physical impairments.

      Individualized physical therapy treatment: After the initial ICU recovery clinic appointment
      patients will begin their 8-week physical therapy program which will be delivered 1-2 times
      per week in a supervised 1:1 session and supplemented with 3 days of unsupervised home
      exercises and walking program on days not participating in physical therapy sessions.
      Supervised sessions will be run by a physical therapist (>20 years of experience in ICU and
      pulmonary rehabilitation) either face to face in outpatient setting or through telemedicine
      using video consultation platforms for patients unable to attend appointments due to
      transmission risk, transportation issues, or geographically living >45 miles from clinic.
      Prior to commencing the first treatment session patients will complete baseline testing to
      inform the starting parameters (frequency, intensity, repetitions) based on performance in
      physical tests such as 6MWT and muscle strength testing. The patient will receive an
      individualized and tailored physical therapy treatment, which will be targeted towards
      increasing their aerobic fitness, muscle strength and functional ability.
