      the antibacterial enzyme, lysozyme on biofilm formation and gingival health in a group of
      young adults. Xylitol is a well-established non-sugar sweetener and an anti-caries agent. The
      use of this polyol results in loosely adherent biofilms by reducing the amount of
      extracellular lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids, facilitating its easy removal by
      mechanical means. Lysozymes are antibacterial proteins that hydrolyze the linkage between
      N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram +
      bacteria effectively limiting growth.
