      I. To decrease the length of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and rate of 30-day
      mortality from CRS due to SARS-CoV-2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To decrease the rates of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. II. To decrease the rate of
      invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). III. To decrease the length of ICU stay. IV. To
      decrease the rate of tracheostomy. V. Safety and efficacy of tociluzumab. VI. Biomarker
      assessment for response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tocilizumab intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for up to 3 doses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard
