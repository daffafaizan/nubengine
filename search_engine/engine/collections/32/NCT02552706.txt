      preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.Although study showed it is a multifactorial
      disease, its pathogenesis is still not yet unclear currently. Prematurity and formula feeding
      is considered as the main risk factors.Gut microbiota disturbance and immature immune system
      is associated with NEC. A lot of studies had showed that oral probiotics can alter gut
      microbiota flora colonization and reduce the incidence of NEC,but the exact mechanism remains
      unclear.The aim of this study is to elucidate the clinical efficacy and possible molecular
      mechanism of oral mixture probiotics in preventing NEC among preterm VLBW infants.

      Patient Registry procedures: First,randomized numbers was generated by the computer and sent
      to the principal investigator(PI) at each center when an infant was eligible for
      enrollment.Second, patient will be assigned randomly to experimental group or control group
      by PI.Finally,the PI at each center will be responsible for the accuracy,completeness or
      representativeness of medical records, registry forms,data collection.

      Sample size determination: The incidence of death and NEC was around 20% recently.To reduce
      the incidence of NEC and death to 10% at discharge would require a 50% improvement.At 80%
      power at P = 0.05 (two-sided),the loss rate of 0.2, this would require 135 subjects per arm.

      Statistical analysis:The two groups were compared by a Î§2-test for categorical
      variables,Mann-Whitney U Test were used when reporting medians.A P value of <0.05 was
      considered statistically significant.
