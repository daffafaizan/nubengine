    
      In this trial, the investigators will test two implementation interventions being applied to
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) dissemination and implementation in justice
      settings for justice-involved populations: NIATx Coaching and the Extension for Community
      Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model. NIATx Coaches provide expertise in MOUD implementation and
      organizational change to help treatment organizations and staff make, sustain, and spread
      MOUD. The ECHO platform focuses only on the provider side by connecting the primary care
      provider with expert MOUD prescribers to promote high-quality MOUD practices. This will be
      the first trial that assesses the comparative effectiveness of these approaches overall, and
      in justice settings.

      The trial will be conducted with a combination of 48 jails and community-based organizations
      that treat individuals with opioid use disorders (OUDs) post-incarceration. Sites will be
      randomly assigned to one of four study arms, with 12 sites in each arm: High-Dose
      Coaching/ECHO, Low-Dose Coaching/ECHO, High-Dose Coaching/No ECHO, and Low-Dose Coaching/No
      ECHO. The intervention period will be over a 12-month span with an additional 12-months for
      sustainability.
