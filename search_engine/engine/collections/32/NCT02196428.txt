      AAL-Wizard is an IHE(Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise)-compliant, web based
      documentation and communication platform with an integrated electronic patient record, which
      can be used by the study participants during the study. Vital parameters are collected with
      the help of certified medical products according to the guidelines "93/42/EEC(European
      Economic Community) on medical devices" (e.g. blood pressure devices, scales, pedometers),
      transmitted electronically, documented and archived directly in the system. Vital parameters
      out of range will be prioritized displayed in the AAL Wizard (e.g. traffic light system,
      short message notification, pop-up function, etc.) and the study participant will be
      contacted by the tele doctor (teleconsultation) . The decision on the necessary intervention
      (e.g. contact of the in-house home care, therapeutic and diagnostic recommendations or
      recommendation of a primary care consultation /hospital submission) are in the responsibility
      of the tele doctor based on the communication with the patient and the family doctor's
      recommendations for the treatment of his patient.

      At the beginning of the study, the tele doctors of the Clinical Telemedicine at the
      University Hospital Zurich (USZ) perform an appointment with the respective study
      participants. The electronic patient record will be set up and the process of the
      telemonitoring will be defined.
