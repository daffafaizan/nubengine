      excessive and hypertrophic scarring can occur. Burn garments are usually used to reduce such
      scarring. However, measure are taken manually by a measuring tape using interpolation.
      Therefore, compression garments produced on base of 3D surface imaging using a scanning
      system are compared to compression garments based on manually measurements regarding correct
      fitting, wearing comfort, suitability for daily use and scar properties.
