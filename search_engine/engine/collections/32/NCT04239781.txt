      EASL did not recommend any adjuvant therapy to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence of HCC.
      The goal of an adjuvant therapy is to meet the requirements of patients, which are influenced
      by many factors such as the strength of doctors' recommendation, economic affordability,
      tolerance of adverse reactions to treatment, and expectation of efficacy. Therefore,
      understanding patients' expectations for an adjuvant therapy after surgery will help doctors
      give more reasonable treatment. Participating in clinical trials is a new process of
      understanding and acceptance for each patient, so investigators try to understand the
      willingness and ideas of patients to participate in clinical trials, so as to provide more
      information for designing clinical trials and recruiting subjects for clinical trials.

      The research was conducted through face-to-face interview, WeChat and telephone interview.
      For face-to-face interview and WeChat to participants, an informed consent should be signed.
