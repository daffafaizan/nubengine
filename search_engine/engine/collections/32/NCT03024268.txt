      surgery in selected high-risk patients. Clip placement requires interatrial transseptal
      puncture and meticulous manipulation of the steerable sheath. There is evidence that the
      persistence of a relevant iASD after MitraClip is associated with worse clinical outcomes and
      increased mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate, if the interventional closure of an persistant
      hemodynamic relevant iASD 30 days after MitraClip implantation, has favorable effects on
      clinical outcome. Eligible patients, after obtaining written informed consent, are 1:1
      randomized either in group A (interventional occlusion of iASD) or group B (best supportive
      care).
