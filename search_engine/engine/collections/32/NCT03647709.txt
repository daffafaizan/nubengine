    
      All study patients will receive a standardized protocol

        -  All surgical procedures performed by single surgeon using same implants, approach,
           pre-op and post-op optimization, and simplified pain protocol at a single hospital or
           surgery center

        -  Will attempt to minimize the number of anesthesiologists to further control variability
           in care

      Methods:

        1. Pre-op Optimization

             -  All patients enroll in education program

             -  All patients have optimized BMI, hemoglobin, albumin, glucose control-A1C, and
                blood pressure

        2. Total Joint Procedure

             -  Tourniquet-free cemented total knee arthroplasty is performed with intra-articular
                block

        3. Data Collection

             -  Electronic medical record chart review

             -  Pre-op assessment and Post-op assessment (post anesthesia care unit (PACU), Phase
                II-prior to discharge

             -  Phone calls after discharge

             -  Follow-up assessment in surgeon's office

             -  Swift path / KOOS JR surveys

        4. Pain Management Regimen

             -  pre-op physical therapy teaching

             -  post-op multimodal pain regimen
