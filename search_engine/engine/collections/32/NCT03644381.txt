      between 6 to 20 years of age, diagnosed with IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy using strict
      skin testing and serological criteria, will be recruited for this study. 42 will undergo oral
      immunotherapy, while 42 will be followed as natural history controls but will be offered
      similar therapy, should it be successful, at the completion of one year. OIT subjects will
      initaiate therapy with a 2-day rush desensitization treatment using oral doses of milk, in
      the investigator's Clinical Investigation Unit. They will then continue the highest tolerated
      dose of milk at home for two weeks. Subsequently, they will return for weekly increases in
      doses until a maximum of 200 ml of milk is ingested daily. The primary clinical outcome will
      be a comparison of the amount of milk consumed safely on oral challenge performed prior to
      OIT, when the OIT dose has reached its maximum (200 ml or highest tolerated dose) and after
      one year of therapy. Patients will also be followed with clinical symptom scores and adverse
      event diarie. Their immunological parameters such as changes in milk-specific IgE, blocking
      antibodies (IgG4 and IgA) and regulatory T and B cells will also be monitored. It is expected
      that there will be important improvement in the ability to safely ingest milk and other dairy
      products, and this will be accompanied by significant decreases in IgE and increases in
      Regulatory T and B cells.
