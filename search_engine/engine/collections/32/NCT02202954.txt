      treatment, either using a Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract or conventional therapy in the
      community. Patients with chronic stroke-induced hemiparesis (over a year post stroke) will be
      selected to be randomized between the two groups, Conventional or in Guided
      Self-rehabilitation Contracts.

      In Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense,
      providing double guidance:

        -  Technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent
           thorough visits, for example every month.

        -  Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.

      The patient agrees to:

        -  Perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the
           long term.

        -  Document this work in a written diary.

      To facilitate such contracts, a manual for guided self-rehabilitation in spastic paresis has
      been developed and will be provided to patients randomized to that group.

      124 patients will be enrolled from 6 centers in France: Creteil, Paris Fernand-Widal,
      Toulouse, Reims, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux. The duration of patient participation will be 2
      years: 6 months follow-up, 1 year intervention and another 6-month follow-up after the study
      intervention. Only functional assessments will be used, using in particular ambulation speed
      for the lower limb and the Modified FRENCHAY Scale for the upper limb.
