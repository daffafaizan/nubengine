      measures of neuropsychological function, quality of life and mental health. To avoid extra
      training effects of neuropsychological testing on participants allocated to waitlist/BHW,
      assessment following BHW (approximately one-year post T1) will consist of self-report
      measures only. Patients in all groups will be reassessed within 14 days post intervention
      (T2), and at 6 months post intervention (T3) and further five years after the preassessment
      (T4). The participants at T1 not showing the specific cognitive difficulties will also be
      included at T4.
