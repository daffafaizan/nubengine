      a spinal manipulation treatment. To do this, positive responses to treatment, characterized
      by improvement in pain score, functional capacity, as well as the global perceived change
      will be evaluated at baseline and at 7 days. Pain score will be also assessed every day with
      text-tracking. Global perceived change will be evaluated using single and multiple logistic
      regressions in which biomechanical variables, comfort, expectation will used as potential
      predictors. 100 individuals with a history of non-specific back pain will be recruited in a
      chiropractic care center.
