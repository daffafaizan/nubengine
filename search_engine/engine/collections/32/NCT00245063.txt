      I. To determine the objective response rate of AZD 2171 in patients with recurrent small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival and time to progression. II. To assess the toxicities
      associated with the administration of AZD 2171 for patients with recurrent SCLC.

      III. To perform molecular correlative studies on archival tumor and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily for 28 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
