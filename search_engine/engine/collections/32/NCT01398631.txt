    
      This is a prospective, observational study in patients admitted to the emergency room for
      chest pain. All patients are checked by the resident in charge immediately on admission,
      before any lab values are known, by means of an admission Case Report Form (CRF), consisting
      of classical elements of patient history, risk factors, medication and physical examination.
      This CRF is filled out immediately by the resident. No additional effort will be asked of the
      patients.

      Patient data during a follow up of at least 6 weeks are gathered from hospital charts.

      The predictive value of the three scoring systems: HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors,
      Troponin), TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute
      Coronary Events) for both the discharge diagnosis and the occurrence of Major Adverse
      Cardiovascular Events (MACE) is calculated.

      The primary hypothesis of the study is that the HEART score is a significantly better
      predictor than the TIMI and/or GRACE score for cardiovascular events during a six week period
      following admission to the emergency room.
