      the clinical course of neonates post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The study will focus on
      neonates for a few reasons. Although their post-CPB clinical course is typically more severe
      and intensive care unit (ICU) care more prolonged than older children, their modes of
      morbidity are also well characterized. Further, the high level of severity itself provides a
      substrate for identifying the positive effects of a particular therapy. Finally, a therapy
      identified as beneficial has the greatest potential for benefit in this vulnerable
      population. The well characterized scenario of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) will be
      used as the primary endpoint, while a variety of secondary endpoints will be related to the
      biochemical anti-inflammatory effects of therapy, ICU care and late neurological outcome.
