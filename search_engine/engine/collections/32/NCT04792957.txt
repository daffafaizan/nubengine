      exert their effects through cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling pathways.
      Janus kinase/signal transduction and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway
      is implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)
      is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by progressive and recurrent skin ulceration of
      destructive course. Treatment of PG requires aggressive immunosuppressive therapy but despite
      the use of several agents, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitory treatments there is
      still an unmet need in refractory PG. Recent reports suggested activation of JAK/STAT pathway
      in PG and some case-based studies suggested the beneficial effect of JAK-STAT inhibitory
      agent in the treatment of PG.

      Skin biopsies obtained from PG, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis and healthy subjects will
      be studied to evaluate JAK/STAT pathway by using immunohistochemical methods. The following
      immunohistochemical stains will be used to evaluate the expression of JAK/STAT pathway: JAK1,
      JAK2, JAK3, Tyrosine Kinase 2, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6. Staining
      intensity will be recorded categorically (negative and positive). The positive staining will
      also be graded semi-quantitively as follows: mildly positive, moderately positive and
      strongly positive.
