        -  the HR-QOL of massive burns shows a significative alteration compared to general
           population

        -  this alteration is comparable with another chronic disease

        -  the main predictors of impaired quality of life related to physical health status are
           hand injury, age at time of burn and time since burn

        -  the main predictive factors of change in quality of life related to mental health status
           are age of onset and facial involvement.
