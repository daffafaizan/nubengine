      complications. It is time consuming for the patient and incur costs to the health institution
      due to the post-procedure observation needed. Coronary computer tomography angiography (CCTA)
      is a good alternative to CICA to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD). Moderate to
      excellent sensitivity and negative predictive values have been reported with 64-slice CT
      angiography. The main ethical problem has been the radiation doses given to the patient
      during CT angiography which was high >10 millisievert(mSv). With 265 or higher slice CT
      machines and radiation dose reduction techniques, it is possible to evaluate coronary anatomy
      with radiation doses below 1 mSv. Heart rate reduction with B-blockers is in most cases not
      necessary with new generation CT machines but is recommended in guidelines.

      800 patients already accepted for CICA based on clinical information will be scheduled to
      undergo CCTA prior to invasive coronary angiography. Coronary anatomy will be described
      according to American Heart Association (AHA) classification with 17 segment analysis. The
      main purpose of the study is to achieve high sensitivity and high negative predictive value
      with CT angiography. Radiation doses in relation to gender and body mass index (BMI) will be
      monitored. In addition we will measure coronary calcification (Agatson score) and look at any
      association to the Vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Patient reported quality of life
      evaluation with validated questionnaires and long term follow up (5 and 10 years) regarding
      clinical endpoints.
