    
      After intestinal surgery, many patients suffer from a "postoperative ileus" (POI). The cause
      is multifactorial and can be attributed to surgery itself, the lingering effect of the
      anesthetic, the use of narcotics and decreased mobility of the patient.

      An ileus can delay the time to full diet, thus lengthening the hospital stay of the patient -
      sometimes up to several weeks.

      There is evidence that early drinking/eating and increased mobility may accelerate the return
      of bowel function. "Fast-tracking" is well documented in the adult literature; protocols have
      been put in place to enhance GI tract recovery and thus decrease the morbidity of a prolonged
      hospital stay and ileus. "Fast-tracking" has been done in pediatric patients but not in a
      large RCT for abdominal surgery.
