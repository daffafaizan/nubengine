      biological parameters from Stewart approach for acid base disorders (pH, SIDe, SIDa, SIG,
      Atot, PaCO2) before, and at 1hour, 2hours and 24 hours after a 200mL 20% human albumin
      perfusion (the consensus conference ANAES of 1995 recommands to correct hypoalbuminemia below
      20g/L).

      Clinical parameters (respiratory, haemodynamic, neurologic) were also collected at the same
      times.
