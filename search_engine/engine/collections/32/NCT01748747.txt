      I. Evaluate the immune response of each immunization regimen and determine an optimal regimen
      in terms of immune response to recommend for phase II testing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the adverse events profile of each immunization regimen. II. Evaluate
      disease-free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the immunological efficacy of the vaccine preparations with Gag267-274
      (Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine) and resiquimod, as measured by the frequency and interferon
      (IFN)gamma production of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).

      II. Examine immune responses to the tumor antigen analog MART-1a (MART-1 antigen) versus the
      xenoantigen Gag267-274.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      ARM I: Patients receive MART-1 antigen and Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine emulsified in
      Montanide ISA 51 VG subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive MART-1 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG SC followed by
      resiquimod applied topically on day 1.

      ARM III: Patients receive MART-1 antigen and Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine emulsified in
      Montanide ISA 51 VG SC followed by resiquimod applied topically on day 1.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months.
