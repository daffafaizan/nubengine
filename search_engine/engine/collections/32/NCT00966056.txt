      have been widely used for the treatment of nasal synechiae, but are associated significant
      morbidity until removal. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies in literature
      comparing Mitomycin C with septal splints as an atraumatic alternative in the treatment of
      nasal synechiae. This is a preliminary study taken up to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
      Mitomycin C in the treatment of nasal synechiae.
