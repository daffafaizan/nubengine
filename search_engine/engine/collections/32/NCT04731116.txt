        1. Describe the impact of CBD on the cytokine profile in patients with severe and critical
           COVID-19 infection.

        2. Explore the safety and efficacy of CBD treatment in patients with severe and critical
           COVID-19 pulmonary Infection.

      Methods:

      This is a single center, prospective open label phase 1/2-study which will be conducted in a
      Corona isolation ward.

      Investigational therapy:

      Cannabidiol 5% dissolved in olive oil, will be given orally or through a nasogastric tube at
      a dose of 150 mg twice daily during 14 days or until discharge (the earliest). This dose is
      based on safety data generated from more than 100 transplanted patients. Treatment duration
      may be extended up to 28 days according to the physician discretion. In case of intolerance
      to the dose of 150 mg twice daily, the dose of CBD will be reduced to the maximal tolerated
      dose.

      In the case of grade 4 side effects related to CBD or in the case of inability to provide the
      CBD during more the 3 days, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.
