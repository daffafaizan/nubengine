      over the span of approximately 8 weeks. The expected outcomes for this project are that (1)
      rtACS activates viable but poorly or non-functional retinal ganglion cells to improve their
      structural and functional capabilities, (2) measures of retinal, optic nerve, and visual
      brain structures and function will correspond with improvement in visual function, and (3)
      changes in visual function following rtACS will be associated with improvements in
      participants' functional ability and QoL. rtACS has successfully been used in the
      rehabilitation of visual impairments in people with optic neuropathies; however, we do not
      know the clinical value of rtACS specifically for people with glaucoma, including the effect
      of rtACS on people's functional ability and QoL.
