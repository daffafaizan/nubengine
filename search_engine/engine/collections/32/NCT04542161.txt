      randomized, pre-/post-treatment design to investigate the effect of NAC dosing on brain GSH
      levels and measure temporally concordant plasma levels of several established circulating
      markers of oxidative stress. Three study groups, of 20 subjects each (for a total of 60 who
      completed all components of the study), will each be administered a different dose (0 mg/day,
      900mg/day, 3600mg/day) of the study intervention over a four week period; N-acetylcysteine
      (NAC) treatment. Subjects receiving 0 mg/day dose will be administered a placebo. Baseline
      visit assessments will include blood collection, survey questionnaires, MRI and MRS imaging.
      Subjects whose initial screening confirms low GSH level at baseline will be provided with a
      4-week supplement of anonymized NAC or placebo caplets. After 4 weeks, subjects will then
      undergo a follow-up visit to repeat the baseline assessments.
