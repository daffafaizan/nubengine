      disorders such as social anxiety and agoraphobia. The main advantage of VR is to expose
      participants to their fears in a controlled and safe environment. However, the access to VR
      remains costly for health professionals who need to pay licenses for the use of a limited
      number of environments. Therefore, these standardized environments only address the symptoms
      of standard anxious patients. As a way to provide an accessible tool that can be tailored
      according to patients' specific difficulties, the proposed approach builds on 360-degree
      videos as an alternative to VR.

      The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized
      expo-sure intervention using 360-degree videos. In addition, the role of cognitive processes
      (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs and self-efficacy) in the exposure efficacy is examined. The
      intervention includes eleven sessions including five sessions of exposure in 360-degree
      videos de-signed especially for each patient difficulties.

      A multiple single-case design (n=5) is adopted with three types of evaluations: (1)
      traditional assessment scale of primary/secondary outcomes and aspects related to the
      therapy, (2) daily ambulatory assessment with a multiple baseline design, (3) experience
      sampling of cognitive processes about feared situations.

      Each video will also be assessed by the participants after exposure sessions.
