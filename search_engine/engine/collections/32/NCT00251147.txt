      with respect to lost time from work and the inability to play sports, thereby affecting the
      individual's quality of life.

      The standard treatment for full-thickness rotator cuff repair is with an open acromioplasty
      procedure. An alternative procedure for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is with a combined
      procedure of arthroscopic acromioplasty and mini-open repair, which has the potential
      advantages of a preserved deltoid origin, lower perioperative morbidity, shorter hospital
      stays and less soft tissue dissection. The progression towards arthroscopic repair requires a
      comparison to the standard, open procedure for full-thickness rotator cuff tears, using
      validated outcomes in a randomized fashion.

      This study is designed as a multi-centre randomized controlled trial with a priori sample
      size calculation of 28 patients per group. Patients presenting with unremitting pain, failed
      conservative treatment of at least 3 months, weakness of the rotator cuff and positive
      imaging indicating a full-thickness rotator cuff tear are eligible for the study. Previous
      surgery on the affected shoulder and massive rotator cuff tears are excluded. Patients are
      randomized using computer-generated block randomization, stratified by surgeon, to either
      open or mini-open rotator cuff repair.

      Disease-specific quality of life is assessed using the validated Rotator Cuff Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, a self-administered, 34-item questionnaire designed specifically to assess
      patients before and after surgery. It utilizes a visual analog scale scored out of 100, with
      a higher score reflecting a better quality of life.
