      seeking help at their primary health care for joint pain, stiffness, swelling etc. Patients
      presenting with such symptoms (not explained by injury or other factors) are suspected to
      have an arthritic condition such as RA, and are routinely tested for presence of
      autoantibodies RF and ACPA. In this observational study we add measurement for survivin to
      the blood analyses of these patients. Information about patients expressing high levels of
      survivin will be reported to the referring doctor at the primary health care, and for
      patients not previously having been examined by a rheumatologist this will be offered.

      The study will be performed at Sahlgrenska university hospital Gothenburg and Ume√• university
      hospital.
