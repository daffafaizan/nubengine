      volunteers. The population is composed of nonsmoking healthy adults and patients having birch
      or timothy pollen allergy with rhinoconjuctivitis symptoms and without other diseases. The
      diagnosis of pollen allergy is verified with positive history, skin prick test, and allergen
      specific IgE antibodies. Subjects undergo a spirometry with a bronchodilatator test and a
      histamine challenge. Quality of life and patient history data is collected by questionnaires.
      Four peripheral blood samples, as well as nasal cell swabs from nasal mucosa without local
      anesthesia are collected from each patient; in spring and winter before the group of the
      intervention arm starts with birch pollen subcutaneous immunotherapy; and during the first
      spring and winter when a subgroups has received the birch pollen immunotherapy. We plan to
      perform the following analyses for the nasal specimens: transcriptomics and their regulators,
      sequencing of 16SrRNA and RT-qPCR for assessing mucosal microbiome, mass spectrometry for
      analyses of proteins and protein-protein complexes, immunohistochemistry for tissue level
      localization and quantitation of proteins, in silico analyses for the data mining,
      integration and display. In addition we observe the alterations in inflammatory mediators
      after in vitro allergen activation of purified peripheral blood leukocytes by ELISA and real
      time qPCR.
