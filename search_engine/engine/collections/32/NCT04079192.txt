    
      This clinical trial will serve as a first-in-human (FIH) experience for the BA9™ DCB in a
      population of patients with coronary artery disease who have an indication for interventional
      treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in a bare-metal stent (BMS) or drug-eluting stent
      (DES).

      The study uses a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized controlled trial design
      to enroll 195 patients. The study will seek to prove that the BA9-DCB is non-inferior to the
      approved CE marked Sequent Please® Paclitaxel Coated Balloon with respect to % Diameter
      Stenosis and has similar safety characteristics.
