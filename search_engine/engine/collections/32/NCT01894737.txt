    
      Seven days of one-legged knee immobilisation in young subjects with creatine or Placebo
      supplementation. A randomly selected leg is immobilized for seven days. Muscle mass and
      strength will be determined and muscle biopsies will be collected before and immediately
      after immobilisation. A week after the cast is removed we will assess any differences in
      recovery between intervention groups.
