      and a cereal-based snack intervention group. The almond intervention will be roasted,
      unsalted almonds at a level of 56 grams per day for 4 weeks. The cereal-based intervention
      will be isocaloric snacks provided in the form of a mixture of dry cereal, pretzels, and
      bread sticks for 4 weeks. A satiety test protocol will be done at the beginning and the end
      of the intervention period. Each test day will include measures of satiety responses to two
      standard meals, two snacks (either almonds or cereal-based snacks), and a dinner buffet. The
      protocol to evaluate satiety signals include tonic measures that may signal homeostasis to
      the brain and evaluation of episodic signals that may drive food intake In addition, other
      modulators of satiety will be tested including evaluation of preferences for palatable foods,
      self-reports of cravings and satiety using questionnaires, and perceived hunger, fullness,
      desire to eat.
