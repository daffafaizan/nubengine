      However, in patients with severe lung failure, blood may not adequately be delivered to the
      lungs, or the lungs may not adequately supply blood with oxygen. In this case, patients may
      require assistance from a machine to help provide this oxygen. Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) is a device that acts as an artificial lung, allowing the patient to
      recover from their illness. Patients receiving support from ECMO are often put in a medically
      induced coma while their lungs heal. Certain drugs may stick to the internal surfaces of the
      machine; therefore leading to decreased concentrations. Patients receiving ECMO often require
      antimicrobials to treat severe infections. However, little data exist concerning the likely
      changes in drug concentrations from drug circuit interactions in adult patients receiving
      ECMO.
