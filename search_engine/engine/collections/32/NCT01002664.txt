      Subjects are those not currently on any medicines for BPH or LUTS. During and at the end of
      the 12-week treatment period, randomized subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety
      parameters. All subjects will be advised to maintain a normal diet, similar to what was
      consumed before joining the study.
