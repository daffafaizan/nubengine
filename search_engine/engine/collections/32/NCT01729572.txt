      remitting course. Although anti-psychotics can prevent relapse, its effect on schizophrenia
      outcome remains very limited, mainly due to very poor adherence to medications by the
      patients. This study aims to find, whether the add-on of remote monitoring of medication
      compliance via tele-medicine, to routine out-patient clinic care, can improve patients
      adherence and reduce the risk of relapse. The study is an uni center, open, prospective,
      randomised and controlled.
