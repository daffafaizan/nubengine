      of female infertility. The majority of women regard a hysterosalpingogram as acutely painful
      since it involves placement of a cervical tenaculum, traction on the cervix, and instillation
      of dye through a cervical cannula. Different techniques have been employed to attempt to make
      the procedure less painful, including use of balloon catheters rather than cannulas; however,
      this has not been shown to be uniformly effective. Previous studies have shown a reduction in
      overall pain during HSG after pre-medication with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
      Benzocaine gel (20%) applied to the cervix has also been shown to reduce pain. Conversely, a
      study of pre-medication with paracetamol (acetaminophen) showed no statistical improvement in
      pain perception. Additionally, transcervical intrauterine instillation of lidocaine has been
      shown in randomized studies to not improve pain scores and may actually increase pain after
      the procedure is complete A MEDLINE literature search of papers written in English from
      January 1966 to August 2005, using the keywords "hysterosalpingogram," "analgesia",
      "paracervical," and "intracervical" did not reveal any prior studies on the use of an
      intracervical block prior to hysterosalpingography. A paracervical block has been shown to
      decrease pain with therapeutic abortions, endometrial biopsy, and office hysteroscopy (7, 8).
      We hypothesized that an intracervical block would also decrease pain during a
      hysterosalpingogram. A three armed, randomized controlled trial comparing pain control after
      a 1% lidocaine intracervical block, saline injection or no injection in patients undergoing
      hysterosalpingogram was performed.
