      the Teachable Moment Brief Intervention (TMBI) for suicide attempters admitted to a
      psychiatric inpatient unit. A total of 60 patients will be recruited from the inpatient
      psychiatry unit at Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital and 30 healthy community members
      for the study. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants and administration of
      the baseline assessment battery will be completed prior to randomization for patients.
      Patients will then be randomized to either (a) an experimental group receiving TMBI or (b) a
      group receiving treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention will consist of no more than 90
      minutes (expected mean is 45 minutes for the intervention based upon previous studies of the
      TMBI) of 1:1 interaction with a study clinician. All participants will complete a follow-up
      assessment immediately following TMBI, TAU, or a rest period. Further, patients receiving the
      experimental intervention will then be asked to complete a client satisfaction survey. The
      aim will be to assess whether TMBI affects psychological, experimental pain, and autonomic
      nervous system responses as compared to TAU and community controls.
