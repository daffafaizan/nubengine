    
      The primary endpoint for this study is safety as measured by the following which will be
      assessed over the 12 month follow-up period as indicated in the Data Collection Table:

        -  Adverse Events

        -  All-cause Mortality

        -  Heart failure (HF) Hospitalization

      Secondary Endpoints

      The secondary safety endpoints assessed will include the following:

        -  Echocardiographic assessments at 4 weeks +/- 3 days post-administration of
           BNP116.sc-CMV.I1c including

        -  Echocardiographic assessments of LVEF, LVEVD, LVEDVI, VLESV, LVEVI, SpI and GLSand
           degree of mitral regurgitation o

      The secondary efficacy endpoints will explore efficacy. Functional endpoints will be assessed
      as changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months following investigational product administration
      as indicated. These endpoints include:

      Functional Status & Hospitalizations

        -  Peak VO2 assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing

        -  6-minute walk test

        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification

        -  Total number of days alive out-of-hospital (as well as total days out-of-hospital as a %
           of total days alive post study intervention)

      Physiologic Assessments at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline

        -  Echocardiographic assessments of LVEF, LVEVD, LVEDVI, VLESV, LVEVI, SpI and GLSand
           degree of mitral regurgitation

        -  NT-proBNP level

      Quality of Life at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline

      o Health related quality of life as assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaire (MLWHFQ)

      The following endpoints will also be measured over the 12 month follow-up period and
      long-term follow-up period (until month 36 post-intervention):

        -  Survival

        -  Cardiac transplantation

        -  Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation
