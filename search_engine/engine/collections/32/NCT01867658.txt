    
      This is a prospective, open label, multi-center clinical study designed to assess the safety
      of the Progel® PALS product, including the Extended Applicator Spray Tip, when used in Video
      Assisted and Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery. The study will treat approximately 105
      evaluable subjects at up to 15 U.S. sites. All subjects will provide informed consent prior
      to enrollment in the study.

      Patients who have met the initial screening criteria and who have a visible pleural air leak
      which requires treatment with a sealant, after standard closure techniques are used (standard
      sutures, staples or devices supplied by the hospital for thoracoscopic surgery) will be
      eligible for study participation. If the subject is treated, the surgeon will utilize Progel®
      PALS to the same sites originally treated with standard technique.
