      I. To assess the accuracy of contrast-enhanced endoscopic lymphosonography guided fine-needle
      aspiration (FNA) of sentinel lymph nodes compared with unenhanced endoscopic ultrasonography
      (EUS) guided FNA in the characterization of esophageal cancer-associated lymph nodes using
      pathology as the reference standard.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ability of contrast-enhanced endoscopic lymphosonography guided FNA compared
      with unenhanced EUS guided FNA in the overall detection of biopsy proven cancer-involved
      sentinel lymph nodes.

      II. To assess the impact of overall tumor staging by contrast-enhanced endoscopic
      lymphosonography compared with unenhanced EUS.
