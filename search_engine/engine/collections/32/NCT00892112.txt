    
      Rationale: Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) persistence in the heart has been associated with
      progressive cardiac dysfunction and evolution to idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

      Objective: A controlled trial to investigate whether high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIg) in addition to conventional heart failure therapy in patients with idiopathic
      cardiomyopathy and PVB19 persistence in the heart achieves improvement of cardiac function in
      conjunction with virus elimination.

      Study design: All patients will undergo routine diagnostic work-up (including physical
      examination, coronary angiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, blood studies and
      endomyocardial biopsies (EMB)), treatment and follow-up for their heart failure. Patients
      will be randomized to either receive IVIg or placebo on top of their standard heart failure
      regimen.
