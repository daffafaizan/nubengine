      premature babies, and thereby reduce the occurrence of neurological problems. The
      investigators predict that the blood flow measured by ultrasounds of the heart will be higher
      in babies who receive umbilical cord milking compared to those whose cords are clamped
      immediately. Secondly, the investigators predict that cord milking will improve blood volume,
      blood pressure, and urine output, and delay the need for blood transfusions.

      This will be the first study to look at the effect that umbilical cord milking has on
      important measures of blood flow, which can predict bleeding in the head and subsequent
      developmental problems in very premature babies.
