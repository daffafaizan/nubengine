    
      In the first phase, 18 infants meeting set criteria are randomised into receiving three test
      meals with novel LNS preparations over a three-day period. The meals will consists of the
      following, each given on one day and in a random order: 1) 7.5 g of LNS-10gM mixed in 30 g
      maize-soy porridge, 2) 15 g of LNS-20gM mixed in 30 g maize-soy porridge, 3) 15 g of
      LNS-20gNoM mixed in 30 g maize-soy porridge. As a run in procedure, each participant will
      undergo a test feeding session with one of the the test foods on the day before the actual
      test-feeding period. As a positive control, each participant will undergo test feeding
      session with standard Nutributter (NB) on the day after the actual test-feeding period.

      In the second phase a set of 48 infants are randomised into 3 groups receiving the following
      food supplements for a period of 2 weeks: 1) 10 g/day of milk-containing, very concentrated
      LNS (LNS-10gM), 2) 20 g/day of milk-containing, concentrated LNS (LNS-20gM), 3) 20 g/day of
      milk-free, concentrated LNS (LNS-20 g NoM)

      Outcomes measures in the first phase will be assessed through safety reports and quantities
      of test food consumed by the child and a hedonic scale of acceptability by the mothers of the
      children. The second phase will be assessed with qualitative outcomes, from data obtained
      from focus group discussions with the guardians of the infants consuming the test foods.
