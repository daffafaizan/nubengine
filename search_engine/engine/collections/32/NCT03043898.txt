      the chest as recorded by an acoustic array.

      In Part A, healthy volunteers and patients at Addenbrooke's hospital will have the chest
      sounds at their back recorded using an electronic-stethoscope array. This will be done in a
      single session lasting approximately 30 minutes. 50 healthy volunteers and 100 patients will
      be included.

      In Part B, 50 patients undergoing a bronchoscopy at Addenbrooke's hospital will have their
      bronchoscopy extended by 5-10 minutes so that sounds can be played through the working
      channel of the bronchoscope and recorded by a microphone array at the posterior chest. Part B
      will investigate 25 patients with structurally 'normal' lungs (for example patients with
      Chronic Cough) (Part B(i)), and 25 patients with lung disease that has resulted in an
      'abnormal' lung structure (Part B(ii)).

      The consultant bronchoscopist will assign the patient to the relevant group based on
      information from their medical history and their CT scan. For Part B of the study an existing
      CT scan is an inclusion criterion. CT scans will not be carried out specifically for this
      study.
