      vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial
      pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), potential of hydrogen (pH), arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3) and partial pressure of arterial
      oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio to compare the effects of drugs.
