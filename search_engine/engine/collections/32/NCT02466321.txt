      orthopaedic surgeons skilled in shoulder replacement surgery. Each case enrolled will receive
      an Anatomical Shoulderâ„¢ Inverse/Reverse implant. All system components are CE-marked and
      commercially available. Patients will be selected according to the subject selection
      criteria.

      All patients will undergo pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative physical
      examination, radiographic evaluation according to the hospital's routine procedure and
      collection of quality of life metrics. Follow-up evaluations are to be conducted at either 6
      weeks or 6 months (according to the hospital's standard care plan) and thereafter at 1, 2, 5
      and 10 years post hospital discharge.

      There are 5 study centres taking part in this project enrolling in total a maximum of 160
      patients.
