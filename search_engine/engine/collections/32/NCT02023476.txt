      wrapped in a stockinet sleeve and pull straps (Fig.1). It performs three functions - blood
      removal (exsanguinations), arterial flow occlusion, and placement of sterile stockinet 30.
      The ring is placed on the extremity and then straps are pulled proximally. The silicone ring
      rolls up the limb while the stockinet sleeve unfolds onto the limb. During the rolling up
      process, the ring exerts pressure and squeezes the blood away from the limb. Application of
      the device takes less than a minute.

      The technique behind this device is fundamentally different from classic pneumatic
      tourniquets, as pressure is exercised by only a single silicon ring so that the profile is
      very small.

      Zimmer A.T.S.®3000 The A.T.S.®3000 is an automatic broad tourniquet system with a Limb
      Occlusion Pressure (LOP) feature. It is the latest innovation in tourniquet technology and
      has FDA approval. It was invented by McEwen 4 and the basic function is described in several
      clinical trials and publications 28. The main difference to other pneumatic tourniquets is
      the LOP and the Recommended tissue pressure (RTP) feature. These parameters are suitable to
      optimize the pressure force on the tourniquet for each individual patient. The LOP is
      detected before inflating the tourniquet and the RTP is the LOP plus a safety margin to
      guarantee a blood free field (Operator & Service Manual Zimmer A.T.S.® 3000 Automatic
      tourniquet system REF 60-3000-101-00).
