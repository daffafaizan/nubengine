      with HERG mutations . It has also been reported in association with the SCN5A gene. We report
      on a neonate with congenital LQTS and congenital complete heart block who experienced
      frequent episodes of torades des pointe and ventricular tachycardia, which, over the first 2
      days of life, was recalcitrant to traditional therapy of beta-blockers and other
      antiarrhythmics. Eventually hypotension necessitated the use of an epinephrine infusion,
      which halted the ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A pacemaker was implanted once the infant was
      stable and, currently, he is thriving. Genetic analysis revealed a HERG mutation.

      For this study, we will need access to the infant's inpatient and outpatient medical records
      at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston Children's Hospital and Sibley Heart Center
      Cardiology to include his age, date of birth, medical record number, inpatient labs,
      inpatient echo reports, outpatient echo reports, inpatient and outpatient EKG's, inpatient
      pharmacy records, the results of his genetic analysis, his history and physical, transfer
      notes, daily progress notes, consultation reports and operative reports from his admission
      beginning 9/30/04.
