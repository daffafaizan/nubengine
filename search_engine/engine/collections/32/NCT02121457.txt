      Division, University of São Paulo Medical School (Brazil). All participants fulfilled the
      criteria proposed by the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment (Winblad et
      al., 2004), which include the following: (1) the person is neither normal nor demented; (2)
      there is evidence of cognitive deterioration shown by subjective report in conjunction with
      objective cognitive deficits; and (3) activities of daily living are preserved and complex
      instrumental functions are either intact or minimally impaired. The diagnosis of MCI was
      based on a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment which included the Consortium to
      Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery (Welsh et
      al., 1994; Bertolucci et al., 2001). Participants were recruited from May 2011 to August
      2012. Eligible subjects were aged 60 years or older, fluent in Portuguese, and free of any
      other significant neurologic or psychiatric diseases. None of them presented major depression
      or psychosis, had a regular intake of Brazil nuts, used supplements with selenium, or had
      intolerance to oleaginous food. An informed consent was obtained before the interview from
      all participants. The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Comittee of the
      Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas da Universidade de São Paulo.
