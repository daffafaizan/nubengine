    
      BACCARAT study consists in a monocentric prospective cohort study that will finally include
      120 women treated with adjuvant RT for breast cancer in the Clinique Pasteur in Toulouse, and
      followed for 2 years after RT.

      Women aged 50 to 70 years, treated for breast cancer and for whom adjuvant 3DCRT is
      indicated, without chemotherapy are eligible for the study.

      Baseline and follow-up include measures of functional myocardial dysfunction based on
      2D-speckle tracking echocardiography, anatomical coronary lesions based on Coronary computed
      tomography angiography, and a wide panel of circulating biomarkers. Absorbed doses is
      evaluated for whole heart and for each different parts of heart, in particular coronary
      arteries.

      Analysis on occurrence and evolutions of subclinical cardiac lesions and biomarkers will be
      performed and completed with dose-response relations with absorbed doses of different heart
      segments.
