      opioid dependence. Because buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist opioid, under certain
      conditions it is possible for buprenorphine to precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid
      dependent individuals. A person with a high level of physical dependence could experience
      buprenorphine-related precipitated withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to test the acute
      effects of different doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid dependent individuals
      maintained on methadone. The study is designed to provide dosing schedules similar to those
      that might be initially used in a physician's office.
