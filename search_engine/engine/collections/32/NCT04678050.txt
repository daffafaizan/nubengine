      who will undergo dental pulp therapy. The study participants will be allocated into two equal
      groups. Subjects in group I will receive ketofol solution (ketamine/propofol mixture, each mL
      contains 5 mg of ketamine plus 10 mg of propofol). A loading dose of 0.125 mL/kg will be
      administered intravenously (IV) over 10 min, followed by maintenance infusion at a rate of
      0.05-0.125 mL/kg/h. Subjects in group II will receive the Dex solution (4 µg/mL). A loading
      dose of 2 µg/kg will be administered IV over 10 min, followed by a maintenance infusion of
      0.1-1 µg/kg/h. Non-invasive blood pressure (mean ABP), peripheral oxygen saturation, heart
      rate, and respiratory rate will be assessed at baseline, at 2 minutes, then at 5 minutes
      intervals till 60 minutes. Ramsay sedation and Aldrete's recovery rating scores will be
      assessed before, during, and after the procedure.
