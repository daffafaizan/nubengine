      conditions, some crucial hemodynamic changes can appear and can be claimed non invasively
      with the whole body bioimpedance. In this research, any kind of hemodynamic difference
      between this method and urgent or elective C/S case will be detected and the clinic pursuit
      can be developed creating an advantage in favor of both maternal and fetal conditions. Under
      general anesthesia, measuring the hemodynamic changes with the method of non-invasive
      whole-body bioimpedance system during C/S.

      Detection of in which phase of operations the potential changes densify and differences
      between urgent and elective conditions non invasively.
