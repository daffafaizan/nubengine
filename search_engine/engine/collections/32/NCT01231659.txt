    
      Screening Period:

      Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer whose disease was refractory to hormonal therapy and had a documented recurrence or
      progression on last therapy for their breast cancer with either tamoxifen, anastrozole,
      letrozole, fulvestrant or exemestan were screened for eligibility within 28 days prior to
      treatment Day 1.

      Treatment Period:

      Patients started receiving everolimus (10 mg daily oral dose) combined with letrozole (2.5 mg
      daily oral dose) tablets from treatment Day 1. Study treatment continued until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Dose adjustment (reduction,
      interruption or possible dose re-escalation to starting dose) could be done based on the
      safety findings. Tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks until disease progression.
      In order to confirm response at least four weeks after first observation, additional scans to
      determine a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) were
      performed. Patients were followed for safety until 28 days after study treatment
      discontinuation.

      Post Treatment Follow up for Survival:

      Patients were followed for survival every 3 months for up to 3 years. Survival information
      could be obtained via phone and information was documented in the source documents.
