      important public health problem among children, and the visual impairment caused by visual
      development disorders is lifelong and can be profound. Timely discovering and treatment of
      visual development disorders are significant for the recovering of visual function in
      children. The national basic public health services of China offer the basic visual acuity
      screening every year for free. In this study, the investigators try to explore the
      cost-effective and compliance of the national basic public health services based tertiary
      care model for the management of visual development disorders among preschool children. This
      Tertiary care based on disease management model among preschool children was conducted at
      Yudu county, Jiangxi province, in China. Preschool vision screening relied on the national
      basic public health services of China (refractive errors examined by the Retinomax
      autorefractor). Children who failed the screening were randomized into two groups, the
      intervention group: their parents will be informed and transferred to an ophthalmologist and
      optometrist at Ophthalmic Referral Center, receiving basic eye examination and therapy
      (visual corrected by glasses and periodic review); The control group: their parents will be
      informed and suggest them to take their children to the hospital for further examination by
      themselves.
