      wholegrain convenience bars, for 8 weeks on inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers and
      plasma antioxidant capacity. This study is a randomized, parallel arm study with 20 men and
      20 women who will adhere to a low anthocyanin and low phenolic aid diet for the duration of
      the study. The participants will be randomly divided into two groups, using stratification
      for matching sex and screening hs-CRP level to be equally distributed in each group, and
      assigned to either the treatment group or control group. Both group will have a 10 day diet
      run-in period where consumption of foods rich in anthocyanins and phenolic acids will be
      limited. Both groups will consume 4 servings of wheat products per day for 8 weeks and will
      replace 4 grain servings from their typical daily intake with the study treatment products.
      Fasting blood samples will be collected during three study visits, including baseline, for
      the analysis of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma antioxidant capacity.
      The plasma metabolites of anthocyanins and phenolic acids will also be determined.
