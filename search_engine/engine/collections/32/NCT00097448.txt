      improvement is seen in approximately 20% of subjects. Improvement is seen in approximately
      60% of subjects treated promptly with oral corticosteroids. Anecdotal case reports and
      uncontrolled case series have suggested the intratympanic corticosteroids may work as well or
      better than oral treatment. The risks of oral prednisone are well-known. In theory,
      intratympanic treatment should achieve a higher drug concentration at the target (inner ear)
      with less risk of systemic side effects. This study is a head-to-head comparison of oral
      prednisone vs. intratympanic methylprednisolone for primary treatment of idiopathic sudden
      deafness. The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial testing that hypothesis that
      intratympanic methylprednisolone is not inferior to oral prednisone treatment. Subjects
      assigned to the oral treatment arm receive 14 days of high dose prednisone (60mg/day)
      followed by a 5-day taper. Subjects assigned to the intratympanic treatment arm receive 4
      doses of methylprednisolone injected into the middle twice weekly for two weeks. The primary
      outcome measure is hearing as measured by pure tone audiometry. Secondary outcomes include
      word recognition hearing levels and safety issues of local vs. systemic steroid side-effects
      and pain.
