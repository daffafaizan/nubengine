      effect of protease inhibitors. If T cell responsiveness is restored under therapy,
      potentiation of anti-viral T cell functions by exogenous T cell stimulation might be
      exploited to complement and to further improve response to available therapies. Monitoring
      the T cell function might also be useful to predict more accurately response to therapy.

      To address these issues, phenotype and function of HCV-specific T cells will be analyzed
      longitudinally before, during and after therapy in na√Øve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C
      patients treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin or with peginterferon and ribavirin plus
      boceprevir. To analyze the global CD4 and CD8 reactivity against all structural and
      non-structural HCV proteins a wide panel of peptides corresponding to the whole HCV genome of
      genotype 1 will be employed. To further analyze CD8 reactivity, HLA-A2/peptide tetramers will
      be used in HLA-A2 positive patients to directly quantify ex vivo HCV-specific CD8 cells
      circulating in the peripheral blood.The T cell function will be analyzed as capacity of
      expansion in vitro, cytokine production and cytotoxicity.
