    
      This is a single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled study. The first part of the study
      consists of 6 exposure sessions in Alyatec EEC, including placebo and birch pollen allergen
      exposures.

      The second part of the study involves in-field evaluations of rhinitis and conjunctivitis
      symptoms during birch pollen season.

      Alyatec environmental exposure chamber, also called allergen challenge chamber, allows to
      evaluate allergic symptoms in standardized and reproducible conditions. All the metrological
      parameters (temperature, air flow, hygrometry ...) are controlled as well as the allergen
      concentration diffused in the room.

      This enables to induce and observe rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma symptoms for up to 20
      patients at the same time, in a reproducible way and without the potential perturbations or
      contaminations of the natural environment.

      The current study aims to get specific information about allergic symptoms induced in the
      Alyatec EEC chamber in patients sensitized to birch pollen allergen.
