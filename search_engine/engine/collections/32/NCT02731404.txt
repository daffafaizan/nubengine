      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study group included 10 patients that were ventilated by
      high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). In the control group (16 patients) the investigators
      used the standard intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Both groups were matched
      according to clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Intra-ocular pressure was measured by a
      senior ophthalmologist that was blinded to the ventilation technique. Laparoscopic surgery
      was done as usual, and the intra-peritoneal pressure was automatically set on 14 mmHg.
      Statistical significance was considered whenever P value was less than 0.05.

      The investigators anticipate that the use of HFJV during laparoscopic operations under PP may
      prevent increased intra-ocular pressure that accompanies increased intra-abdominal pressure
      under conventional ventilation (IPPV).
