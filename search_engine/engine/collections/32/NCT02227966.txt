      left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients or their
      legally responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to
      use it at home. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied everyday in the morning for
      12 weeks. The patients were evaluated at baseline, at week 6 and 12.
