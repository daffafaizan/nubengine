      either autogen bonegraft or a HA-βTCP graft material in a group of children with planovalgus.
      The hypothesis is that it is possible to achieve a stabile osteotomy with HA-βTCP graft
      material equal to the use of autogen bonegraft thus avoiding the need to obtaining iliac
      crest graft material at growing children.
