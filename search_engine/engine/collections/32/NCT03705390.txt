    
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor
      neuron diseases and mainly involves the nerve cells (neurons) in the body. Voluntary muscles
      produce movements like chewing, walking and talking. ALS is caused by gradual deterioration
      (degeneration) and death of these motor neurons. The disease is progressive, meaning the
      symptoms get worse over time and most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually
      within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. Currently there is no cure for ALS
      and no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease (National
      Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Fact Sheet).

      The aim of this study is to explore the safety and acceptability of a type of low molecular
      weight dextran sulfate called ILB.

      The investigators will invite 15 patients to take part from a single centre in the UK.
      Participants will be closely monitored for any side-effects; for changes in ALS symptoms and
      on quality of life during and after the study.

      The trial period for patient participation is maximum 56 weeks (12 months), ILB injections
      will be administered once weekly for up to a maximum of 48 weeks.
