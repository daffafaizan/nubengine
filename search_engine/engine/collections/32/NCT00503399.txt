    
      This study is a multinational, European, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active
      comparator controlled study with 2 study periods: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, and an
      open-label treatment phase of 18 months. Approximately 100 adult men with osteoporosis
      associated with sustained glucocorticoid therapy will be enrolled into the study.
      Approximately one-half of the participants (at all investigational sites) will be randomized
      to teriparatide 20 micrograms/day (ug/day given as a subcutaneous (sc) injection), and the
      other half randomized to risedronate 35 milligrams (mg) once weekly (QW) oral (po) tablet.
      All participants will receive approximately 1000 mg/day elemental calcium and 800 to 1200
      international units per day (IU/day) of vitamin D.
