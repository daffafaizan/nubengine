      analgesia. However, the relative efficacy, safety, and cost of the two approaches remain
      unclear.

      Epidural analgesia is frequently used as a component of multimodal analgesia for thoracic and
      abdominal surgery. QL block has been introduced recently as a component of multimodal
      analgesia for lower thoracic and abdominal surgery. In general, insertion of QL catheter is
      easier and safer than insertion of epidural catheters. QL catheter management is also less
      complicated than epidural analgesia (fewer catheter displacements and less hemodynamic
      compromise) and decreases the level of complexity in postoperative care. Our hypothesis is
      that the subcostal QL approach with a continuous catheter is non-inferior to epidural
      analgesia for pain control and opioid consumption in patients having open partial nephrectomy
      procedure.
