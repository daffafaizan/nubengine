    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder thought to be caused by the
      accumulation of the peptide amyloid beta and the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the
      brain. There are increasing arguments in favor of an important role of vascular damages in
      the development and progression of AD.

      The time course of these vascular alterations and how they relate to dementia and AD
      pathology remain unclear, as no protocol that allows the development of the diverse vascular
      pathology to be scored, and hence to be tracked with ageing, has so far been developed and
      widely validated. The aims of this project are to investigate, in a large clinical sample of
      patients presenting either isolated cognitive complaints or light to mild cognitive deficits,
      how vascular risk factors and vascular alterations (assessed at macro and micro levels)
      relate to cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.

      The primary objective of this ancillary study is to investigate the prospective association
      between vascular risk factors, inflammation markers and vascular damages on cognitive decline
      and neurodegeneration progression over up to 4 years of follow-up in a sample of individuals
      presenting with a spectrum of cognitive profiles ranging from isolated cognitive complaints
      to cognitive deficits without dementia.

      The secondary objectives are the following

        -  To investigate the role of vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension,
           hypercholesterolemia) and vascular damages on progression to clinical dementia over up
           to 4-year follow-up.

        -  To study whether the interaction between changes in markers of macrovascular and
           microvascular structures on cognitive deficits progression.

        -  To study the association between in BP, hypertension, antihypertensive treatments and
           vascular damages, progression of cerebrovascular disease seen at MRI and cognitive
           decline and dementia risk

        -  To assess the temporality of vascular damages burden on neurodegeneration

        -  To assess the association between retinal vasculature defect and brain neurovascular
           damages

        -  To study the link between vascular damages and AD pathology (Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF)
           and Positron emission tomography (TEP) amyloid imaging) biomarkers in the subsample of
           participants having all measures available

        -  To investigate how inflammatory markers mediate the association between vascular damages
           and neurodegeneration

        -  To assess whether vascular factors and neurodegenerative factors act independently or
           synergistically on the course of cognitive decline

        -  To assess simultaneously the impact of vascular damages on end organs (brain, eye, and
           kidney)

        -  To study the correlation between cerebral blood flow, measured by Arterial spin-Labeled
           (ASL) MRI and cognitive decline

        -  To study whether genetic polymorphisms revealed from genome-wide association studies
           (GWAS) of AD of vascular factors could modulate the association between vascular damages
           and cognitive decline
