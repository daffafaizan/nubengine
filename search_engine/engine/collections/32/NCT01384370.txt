    
      The APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay (AHPV-GT Assay) is an in vitro nucleic acid
      amplification test for the qualitative detection of E6/E7 viral messenger RNA (mRNA) of human
      papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18 and 45 in cervical specimens from women with positive
      results in the APTIMA HPV Assay. The AHPV-GT Assay can differentiate between samples positive
      for HPV 16 from those positive for HPV 18 and/or 45, but does not differentiate between HPV
      18-positive samples and HPV 45-positive samples. Cervical specimens collected in ThinPrep Pap
      Test vials containing PreservCyt Solution (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, Massachusetts) with
      commercially available collection devices (broom-type collection device or cytobrush/spatula
      combination) may be tested with the AHPV-GT Assay either pre- or post-Pap processing. The
      assay is used with the TIGRIS DTS (TIGRIS) System.

      In both the ASC-US Study and Adjunct Study populations, the objectives are to:

        -  evaluate the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay for detecting cervical
           disease in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results and

        -  evaluate the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay to detect HPV high-risk types 16, 18, and 45
           in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results.
