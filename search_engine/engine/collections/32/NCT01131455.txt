      construct applied intra-operatively to the bony surface, has osteo-generating and enhanced
      wound healing properties. With that knowledge there is a clinical need and enthusiasm for the
      application of concentrated platelets, which release a large quantity of growth factors to
      encourage recovery in non healing injuries or surgical sites. This study represents an effort
      to more clearly define the true clinical outcomes with or without biologic enhancement, and
      fulfills a need for fortifying evidence concerning the efficacy of ACP in live human bone
      healing-- based on radiographic and CT scans.
