    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the objective tumor response rate for
      VELCADE plus ELOXATIN in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

      The aims of this study are to: (a)to determine the tumor response rate, median survival, time
      to response, duration of response and time to treatment failure or progression of
      disease;(b)to ascertain if in vitro assessment of gene expression profiles via PCR can be
      used to ascertain a patient's response to VELCADE (bortezomib) therapy (c) to characterize
      the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of VELCADE plus ELOXATIN in this patient
      population.

      Each cycle of treatment is composed of 28 days and consists of four treatments with VELCADE
      (d 1,4,15,and 18) and two treatments with ELOXATIN (days 4,and 18). Patients will undergo a
      physical examination and routine blood work at each visit. A Quality of Life (QOL) assessment
      will be performed prior to initiating each cycle of therapy and CT scans will be performed at
      baseline and every 2 cycles (8 weeks)to assess tumor response.
