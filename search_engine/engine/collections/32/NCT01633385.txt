    
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the variability of lung function values and
      bronchial inflammation of 20 Patients with Bronchiolitis obliterans aged between 6 up to 25
      years. The patients' data will be compared with the results of a reference group with similar
      age conditions to determine possible outcome-parameters for following interventional studies.

      The sputum samples will be processed and quantitatively analyzed to get a profile of the
      cytological composition.

      (Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) (qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA).)

      Methods and Work Programme:

      This study consists of two study visits (V1 and V2)

      V1:

        -  Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO)

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Bronchodilation

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, (genetic markers of
           the non-specific pulmonary defense system)

        -  Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations

      V2:

        -  Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO)

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Bronchodilation

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations
