    
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that modulates mast cell activity via
      inhibition of c-Kit, Lyn and Fyn kinase signaling pathways. This is a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-parallel-group, trial comparing oral
      masitinib versus placebo in the treatment of patients suffering from smouldering or indolent
      systemic mastocytosis with severe symptoms of mast cell mediator release (also referred to as
      handicaps), unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatment. The treatment period is 24 weeks.
      Participants receive masitinib (3.0 mg/kg/day), given orally twice daily, with a dose
      escalation to 4.5 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks of treatment, followed by dose escalation to 6.0
      mg/kg/day after 4 weeks of treatment. Each ascending dose titration is subjected to a safety
      control.
