    
      The trial assigns participants to one of three arms: RemovAid+lidocaine patch (n=75),
      RemovAid+lidocaine injection (n=75) or traditional approach+lidocaine injection(n=75).
      Complication rates in the different arms will be compared. Efficacy (successful implant
      removal) will be the secondary comparisons. Finally, pain during removal and duration of
      removal procedure will be compared. Participants will return to the clinic within 4 weeks of
      the removal procedure to record the healing process and final interventions (if any).
