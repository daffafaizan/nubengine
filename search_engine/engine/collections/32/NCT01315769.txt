      and primiparous women. Populations: The sample size was established considering a
      significance level of 5%, the test power of 80%, and the estimated error of 10%. According to
      these results and considering the range between percentages of answers as the casual error,
      each group was established with approximately 50 participants. Methods: 100 women were
      prospectively distributed into: Group G1 (n = 50) comprising by healthy nulliparous women;
      Group G2 (n = 50) with primiparous ones. Subjective evaluation of PFM strength was performed
      using transvaginal digital palpation (TDP). The objective evaluation of PFM strength was
      assessed using a portable perineometer. All parameters were performed at one moment in G1,
      and in G2, during the 20th and 36th weeks of pregnancy, and 45 days after the delivery.
      Results: In G2, 14 women were excluded due to the lost follow-up. The median of age was 23
      years in G1 and 22, in G2, there was no statistical difference between the groups. In G1, BMI
      was in average 21.7 Kg/m2, and 25,0 Kg/m2 in G2, there was statistical difference between the
      groups (p= 0.0004). In G2, TDP evaluation showed a significant impairment of PFM strength at
      36th week of pregnancy (p=0,0006) and 45 days after the vaginal delivery (p=0.0001) compared
      to nulliparous. Objective evaluations of PFM strength showed a significant decrease 45 days
      after vaginal delivery compared to nulliparas. Conclusion: Pregnancy and vaginal delivery may
      cause weakness of PFM.
