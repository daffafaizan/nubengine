      treated with standard chemoradiation have been traditionally poor, suggesting a critical need
      for translation of novel biologically-based targeted approaches into clinical practice. In
      clinical trials, the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitor Olaparib has been
      combined with other systemic agents, including paclitaxel, irinotecan, carboplatin and
      gemcitabine, in the treatment of patients with various solid tumors. Pre-clinical models have
      shown cooperative effects of combining PARP inhibition with radiation. A combined modality
      approach utilizing RT in combination with C225 and Olaparib after induction chemotherapy
      represents a rational, targeted approach for investigation in locally-advanced HNSCC
      patients.
