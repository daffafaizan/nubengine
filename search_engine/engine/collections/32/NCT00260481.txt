      methamphetamine dependence will be investigated as compared to a placebo condition. The
      procedure utilizes a combination of medications delivered both orally and by infusion in a
      controlled medical setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication
      or placebo condition, and will receive medications for 40 days, including two inpatient
      hospitalization phases of three days each. All participants will also receive once-weekly
      psychosocial cognitive-behavioral therapy throughout the 106 day study duration. A variety of
      data will be collected throughout the study, including psychological, cognitive, medical, and
      laboratory assessments.
