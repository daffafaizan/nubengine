    
      This is a national open phase II trial, assessing the immunogenicity and safety of vaccine
      candidate Pfizer - BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 in participants with no history of SARS-CoV-2
      infection receiving two doses of vaccine and in participants with history SARS-CoV-2
      infection of more than 6 months and receiving only one dose of vaccine.

      A total of 300 volunteers will be included and vaccinated in 2 groups:

      Group 1: Adults with no history of COVID 19 (N=150)

        -  Sub-group 1A: 18 - 45 years old: 50 volunteers

        -  Sub-group 1B: 65 - 74 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)

        -  Sub-group 1C: At least 75 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)

      Group 2: Adults with history of COVID 19 of more than 6 months (N=150)

        -  Sub-group 2A: 18 - 45 years old: 50 volunteers

        -  Sub-group 2B: 65 - 74 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)

        -  Sub-group 2C: At least 75 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)

      Within each subgroup of the group 2, a distribution will be respected including:

        -  1/3 volunteers with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection,

        -  1/3 volunteers with mild COVID-19 infection (symptomatic but not hospitalized) and

        -  1/3 volunteers with severe COVID-19 infection (hospitalization required).

      Participants within the group 1 will receive BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®) intramuscularly as a
      2-dose series spaced 28 days apart at a dose of 30 µg each.

      Participants within the group 2 will receive BNT162b2 intramuscularly as a single dose of 30
      µg.

      Analyses of humorale and saliva immune responses will be performed in differents centralized
      laboratories blinded for the trial group, by ELISA at Day -6/D0 (pre-vaccination sample),
      D29, D57, M6, M12, and M24.

      T and B cell analyses will be performed in a sub-group of participants Immunosenescence will
      be analysed in pre-vaccination samples.
