      accepted treatment option among breast cancer patients. This change in practice has resulted
      in a significant number of patients who undergo radiation therapy after breast
      reconstruction. Following irradiation, the reconstructed breast often experiences fibrotic
      contracture, volume loss, altered pigmentation, or some combination thereof, producing an
      asymmetric and aesthetically compromised result. The effects of radiation on reconstructed
      breasts as well as the implications that such changes have for timing of reconstructive
      surgery, post-operative management and surveillance imaging are topics of growing importance
      in plastic surgery, radiology and surgical oncology.
