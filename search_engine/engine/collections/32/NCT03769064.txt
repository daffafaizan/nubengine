      models, including primates, show that high-dose MPH can produce reinforcement or reward. A
      number of studies suggest that the rapid elevation of MPH levels in the blood and brain that
      occurs following intranasal or oral administration of supra-therapeutic doses is a key
      requirement for development of MPH-associated euphoria, reinforcement, and addiction. The
      concerns about MPH abuse potential and addiction often play a role in the decision of
      patients, parents, or physicians who opt against treatment with MPH, despite its
      effectiveness. This provides an imperative for development of MPH formulations that are
      therapeutically potent but with lower abuse potential. Methylphenidate acts mainly through
      the dopaminergic system. At sufficiently high doses, MPH can also activate the mu opioid
      receptors (MOPR) in the brain. Recent data indicate that blockade of MOPRs by naltrexone
      (NTX) blocks the rewarding effects of MPH in mice. Clinical studies on the modulatory effect
      of NTX on dopamine release following chronic amphetamine use also support the involvement of
      opioid-dopamine interactions in the reinforcing and rewarding effects of amphetamine. These
      data support the hypothesis that NTX will block the reinforcing effect of MPH in humans.
