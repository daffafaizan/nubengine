    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of the combination of the PI3Kδ inhibitor
      parsaclisib or matching placebo and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in participants with PMF
      or secondary MF (PPV-MF or PET-MF) with DIPSS risk category of intermediate or high.
      Prospective participants must have not received prior MF therapy with a JAK inhibitor or a
      PI3K inhibitor. After participants have been determined to be eligible for the study and
      completed the baseline symptom diary assessment for 7 days, they will be randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment groups, with stratification for platelet count (≥ 100 × 10^9/L vs 50 to < 100 ×
      10^9/L inclusive) and DIPSS risk category (high vs intermediate-2 vs intermediate-1).

      Once all enrolled participants completed the week 24 assessments the study will be unblinded
      and and participants randomized to placebo will have the opportunity to cross over to begin
      receiving parsaclisib, together with continued ruxolitinib, as long as hematology parameters
      are adequate.
