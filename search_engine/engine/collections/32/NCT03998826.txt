    
      -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed. Eligible patients will be treated in one visit.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group (premedication
           with 20 mg of piroxicam) and the control group (premedication with placebo). Each
           participant will receive a standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection. After
           endodontic treatment, patients will be given postoperative instructions and informed, in
           case of pain, to receive ibuprofen 200 mg as rescue medication.

        -  Postendodontic pain intensity and incidence at the different pain categories (No, mild,
           moderate, severe) will be assessed 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7 days postoperatively
           using a 0-10 numerical rate scale (NRS). Analgesic intake throughout the 7 days will be
           recorded.
