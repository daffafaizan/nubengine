      Primary

        -  To determine the median time to tumor progression in patients with recurrent ovarian
           epithelial cancer, fallopian tube adenocarcinoma, or peritoneal serous papillary
           adenocarcinoma treated with Doxil and atrasentan hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the objective response rate and survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      treatment with platinum-taxane (sensitive vs resistant).

      Patients will be administered Doxil 50 mg/m2 intravenous every 28 days and take atrasentan 10
      mg orally everyday continuously beginning on Day 1. Patients will continue Doxil + atrasentan
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and every 2 months
      thereafter.
