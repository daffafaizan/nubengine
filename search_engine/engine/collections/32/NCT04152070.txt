      been developed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of a gold standard method
      to be used. Therefore, simple, reliable, and valid instruments are still needed for both
      research and clinical purposes. The Kihon Checklist is a multidimensional tool widely used in
      Japan and in other countries, but an exhaustive validity in Spanish population has not been
      yet established.

      The main objective is to validate the Spanish version of the Kihon Checklist for screening
      frailty in Spanish community-dwelling older adults, and as a secondary objective, to study
      and to compare different scales of frailty in the Spanish population, and to study their
      associations.

      To cope with the objectives of the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted. To
      this purpose, data were collected through various tests and questionnaires about: frailty;
      clinical, demographic and anthropometric characteristics; physical assessment; functional
      status; cognitive function; health-related quality of life; depressive mood; and nutritional
      status.
