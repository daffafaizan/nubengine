    
      This is a randomized, parallel-arm, open-label, multicentre, Phase II study to determine the
      efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC90-L)
      followed by paclitaxel and lapatinib (PX-L) compared with EC90 followed by paclitaxel and
      trastuzumab (PX-T) as systemic neoadjuvant therapy for patients with previously untreated,
      operable, ErbB2-overexpressing, Stage I- IIIA breast cancer.

      Approximately 164 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomised in a
      1:1 ratio and stratified according to the following factors, each of which must be
      established prior to commencing randomisation:

        -  Tumour size (â‰¤ 2 cm versus >2 cm in diameter).

        -  Locally determined ER status (either ER positive or negative).

      Patients will be randomised to one of two treatment arms and will receive the following study
      treatments:

      Arm A: Experimental Arm (n=82) Part I (Week 1-12) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1
      every 21 days Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Lapatinib 1000
      mg orally once daily continuously Loperamide as required for the proactive management of
      diarrhoea (see Section 5.13.6)

      Part II (Week 13-24) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 of each week Lapatinib 1000
      mg orally once daily continuously Loperamide as required for the proactive management of
      diarrhoea (see Section 5.13.6)

      Arm B: Reference Arm (n=82):

      Part I (Week 1-12) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Cyclophosphamide
      600 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Part II (Week 13-24) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by
      IV infusion on Day 1 of each week Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV load followed by 2 mg/kg IV Day 1 of
      each week

      The primary study period includes the screening phase, administration of randomized
      neo-adjuvant study treatment, and assessments up to the primary endpoint assessment at the
      time of definitive breast cancer surgery.
