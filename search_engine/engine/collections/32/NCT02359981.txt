      user interfaces make manual logging of users' behavior easier and more pleasant; sensors make
      tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing
      counts or attractive visualization of tracked data. Human experts (health coaches) have
      needed to interpret the data and tailor make customized recommendations. No automated
      recommendation systems like Pandora, Netflix or personalized search for the web have been
      available to translate self-tracked data into actionable suggestions that promote healthier
      lifestyle without needing to involve a human interventionist.

      MyBehavior aims to fill this gap. It takes a deeper look into physical activity and dietary
      intake data and reveal patterns of both healthy and unhealthy behavior that could be
      leveraged for personalized feedback. Based on common patterns from a user's life, suggestions
      are created that ask users to continue, change or avoid existing behaviors to achieve certain
      fitness goals. Such an approach is different from existing literature in two important
      aspects: (1) suggestions are contextualized to a user's life and are built on existing user
      behaviors. As a result, users can act on these suggestions easily, with minimal effort and
      interruption to daily routines; (2) unique suggestions are created for each individual. This
      personalized approach differs from traditional one-size-fits-all or targeted intervention
      models where identical suggestions are applied for groups of similar people or the entire
      population.
