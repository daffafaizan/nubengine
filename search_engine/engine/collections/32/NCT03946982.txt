      cesarean delivery. Inadequate acute pain management is associated with numerous negative
      effects, including delayed postpartum recovery, interference with mother-child bonding
      because postoperative pain limits breastfeeding, and a high risk of postpartum depression and
      persistent pain.

      Epidural analgesia (EA) is being increasingly preferred to systemic opioid because of better
      analgesic effect. Although EA is widely used for cesarean delivery, the effect of the site of
      epidural catheter insertion on the quality of postoperative pain management remains
      inadequately investigated. For example, placement of the epidural catheter in the low
      thoracic intervertebral spaces may be more suitable for catheter-incision-congruent analgesia
      during caesarean delivery than in the lumbar intervertebral space; however, epidural catheter
      insertion is conventionally recommended at the lumbar intervertebral space. Therefore, in
      this study, we aim to investigate the difference in post-cesarean pain control quality
      between low thoracic EA and lumbar EA.
