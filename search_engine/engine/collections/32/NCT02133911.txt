      with non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Ranolazine is a new drug, developed to releave
      symptoms of angina in patients with stable coronary disease that is not suitable for surgical
      or percutaneous revascularization. The main mechanism of action of Ranolazine is the
      inhibition of late I(Na) thus decreasing the Ca++ load in the cardiomyocites. Consequently
      oxygen consumption also decreases. It has also been shown that in patients with stable
      coronary disease Ranolazine improves myocardial perfusion as shown with myocardial nuclear
      imaging. The aim of this trial is to evaluate effects of ranolazine on myocardial perfusion
      in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

      Primary end-point: To determine wheather Ranolazine improves perfusion of the myocardium in
      patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.

      Secondary end-points: To determine wheather Ranolazine improves patients' NYHA functional
      class, excercise capacity, LV systolic and diastolic function and weather ranolazine affects
      supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia occurance/frequency.
