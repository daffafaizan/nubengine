    
      Capsaicin cream, which stimulates the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)
      receptor, causing a burning sensation, will be applied to both halves of the upper lip until
      a burning sensation with 8/10 intensity on an NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scale is experienced
      or five minutes have elapsed. Following this, the capsaicin cream will be wiped off and 30%
      mannitol in vehicle cream ( isopropyl palmitate, caprylic capric triglyceride, propylene
      glycol, ceteareth 20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, polyethylene glycol 100 stearate,
      dimethicone, octyldodecanol, lecithin, ethylhexyl glycerin and phenoxy ethanol) will be
      applied to one half of the upper lip, and vehicle cream alone will be applied to the other
      half. Cream assignment will be randomized and neither the subject nor the person applying the
      cream will know which half upper lip has which cream. Every minute for 10 minutes, the heat
      sensation felt in each half upper lip will be measured, using a visual scale from 0 to 10. A
      repeated measures analysis of variance will compare the NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scores from
      the 30% mannitol cream, to the NRS (Visual Analog Scale)scores from the vehicle cream.
      Significance will be accepted if P less than .05.
