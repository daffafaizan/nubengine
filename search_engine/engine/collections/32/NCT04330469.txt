      &amp; II (initial to moderate) with all-cause and cirrhosis-related mortality in patients
      with cirrhosis. We also plan to evaluate the oral microbiome and association of oral
      dysbiosis with complications of cirrhosis to assess if early treatment by dental
      interventions may improve nutrition and outcomes in cirrhosis. Lastly this prospective
      randomized controlled trial will provide insight into whether manipulation of the oral
      microbiome by dental procedures and oral hygiene training, antibiotics- local and systemic,
      use of probiotics etc can alter adverse outcomes, nutrition and health related quality of
      life in cirrhosis.
