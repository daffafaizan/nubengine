      emergency cricothyroidotomy is a potentially life saving intervention that is the common
      final pathway of difficult airway algorithms. Significant debate surrounds the ideal method
      of performing an emergency cricothyroidotomy. The literature remains divided between the open
      (surgical) and closed (wire assisted, or Seldinger) techniques. We feel that these two
      methods are not mutually exclusive and are proposing a novel "incision first" modification to
      the traditional Seldinger closed technique. Making a small (1 cm) incision prior needle
      insertion could facilitate localization of landmarks and may improve speed or success rate of
      the closed Seldinger procedure.

      Methods: Using concealed allocation, this randomized controlled cross-over trial will be
      performed in a laboratory setting. Outcome assessment will be blinded. Both staff and
      resident emergency physicians will be included in this trial. We will use a well-validated
      swine trachea model for this study.

      Results: Results will be collected using standardized Case Report Forms (CRF) and
      independently entered into a pre-constructed Microsoft ACCESS database. The primary outcome
      will be time to procedure completion. Secondary outcomes will be proportion of successful
      cricothyroidotomy, complications and ease of procedure and ability to increase clinical
      confidence using this model. Paired t-tests and Fisher's exact test will be used to compare
      the outcomes and due to multiple statistical tests, a correction will be used to adjust for
      multiple tests (p < 0.025) to indicate significance.

      Conclusions: This study will assess and evaluate both the incision first model and closed
      Seldinger cricothyroidotomy techniques. We will discuss the merits of each technique and the
      effectiveness of the model.
