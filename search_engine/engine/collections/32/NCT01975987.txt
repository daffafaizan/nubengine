      laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway
      characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined.
      Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental
      distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult
      situations. When direct laryngoscopy is strenuous, early conversion to an alternative
      technique might reduce the risk of airway compromise and associated morbidity.

      Many intubation devices are now available and part of the anesthesiologist's task is to
      select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features. Despite its
      use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria for
      successful airway management with the Bonfils fiberscope have not been proposed.

      The purpose of this study is to identify patients' features, if any, that could predict
      successful intubation when using the Bonfils fiberscope for perioperative orotracheal
      intubation in an elective surgical population.
