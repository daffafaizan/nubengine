      compared to a placebo-control group, the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (eASCs) from
      healthy donors for the treatment of complex anal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease
      over a 24-week period and an extended follow-up period up to 104 weeks. Subject with perianal
      fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120
      million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal
      fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions
      with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible
      complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is
      expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of
      the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent
      one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease
      and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula
      surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the "One Day
      Surgical" procedures (major ambulatory surgery).
