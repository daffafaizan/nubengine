      S-1 plus cisplatin. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either surgery followed by
      treatment with S-1 plus cisplatin or surgery followed by treatment with S-1 within 42 days
      after curative resection. To assess the efficacy, data on recurrence and survival will be
      collected from the time of enrollment until 5 years after surgery. To evaluate safety, data
      on adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until 1 year after surgery.
