      reducing subclinical target organ damage in hypertensive patients. In several patients,
      however, BP control is not sufficiently achieved by RA inhibitors alone, and a combination of
      two drugs is frequently required. It is unclear whether a combination of RA inhibitors and
      diuretics or CCB is more effective in reducing hypertensive target organ damage. Control of
      central BP has been shown to be more effective than peripheral BP in predicting
      cardiovascular events and target organ damage associated with hypertension. The J-CORE study
      is active controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison, prospective randomized open blinded
      end-point (PROBE) design study. The ARB plus CCB combination therapy group is administered
      olmesartan 20 mg/day and azelnidipine 16 mg/day and the ARB plus diuretics combination
      therapy group receives olmesartan 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day. At
      least 100 patients will be enrolled in each group and the follow up duration will be 24
      weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the changes in the central aortic BP and the
      ambulatory BP between the two groups. The secondary endpoint is to compare the changes in
      office BP, home BP, and hypertensive target organ damage between the two groups.
