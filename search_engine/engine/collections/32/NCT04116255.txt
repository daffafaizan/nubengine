      home exercises in increasing the quality of life and reducing somatic and neuropathic pain in
      patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and report long-term outcomes.

      One hundred and one patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction were included in the
      study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: The first group received a
      mandibular oral occlusal splint and the second group was given a home exercise program for
      the temporomandibular joint. The patients were evaluated based on their maximum mouth
      opening, visual analog scale, short-form McGill pain questionnaire, painDETECT, oral
      health-related quality of health and hospital anxiety and depression scale scores at the
      beginning of treatment and at the end of the first and sixth months.
