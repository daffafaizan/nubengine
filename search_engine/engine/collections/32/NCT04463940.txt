      blood locations may provide a scientific basis for understanding the source of them in
      preeclamptic women. Aim - detecting Xanthine oxidase and uric acid levels in both umbilical
      cord artery and vein as well as maternal blood (3 "locations"). Methods - samples will be
      collected from pregnant women with and without diagnosis of preeclampsia with blood uric acid
      > 6 mg/dL. Than the study population will be divided into groups matching the three
      "locations". The investigators will describe and compare outcome levels (including Xanthine
      oxidase, uric acid).
