      (RYGB) are the most frequently performed procedures worldwide. Though SG provides similar
      weight loss effect to RYGB in short-term follow-up, its long-term and very long-term weight
      loss effect was reported to be inferior to RYGB. Weight regain after SG remains the major
      concern after 2-year follow-up due to gradual loss of appetite suppression and lack of
      malabsorption function. SG plus procedures have been developed to strengthen the effect of SG
      on diabetes control. It has been reported that SG plus jejunojejunal bypass (SG - JJB)
      offered better weight loss than SG and similar weight loss to RYGB. The present study aims to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of sleeve gastrectomy plus uncut jejunojejunal bypass (SG -
      uncut JJB).

      For SG-JJB procedure, after SG was finished, the jejunum was transected 20-cm distal to Treiz
      ligament. After that, another 200-cm jejunum was measured and side-to-side jejunojejunal
      anastomosis was made. The anastomotic and mesenteric defects were closed by hand suture.

      For SG-uncut JJB procedure, the jejunum was not transected, only 200-cm jejunum 20-cm distal
      to Treiz ligament was measured and side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis was made. And the
      jejunum 3-5cm distal to the anastomosis was ligated with 10# suture.
