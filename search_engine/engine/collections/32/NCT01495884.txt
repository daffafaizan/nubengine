    
      Primary Objective:

        1. To determine the optimal dose for lapatinib plus Myocet™, in combination, in patients
           with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer following disease progression during, or
           after, treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes (Phase I).

        2. To evaluate the 6 month progression-free survival of patients with HER2-positive
           metastatic breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with
           trastuzumab and taxanes, who are treated with lapatinib plus Myocet™ (Phase II plus
           patients treated at MTD in Phase I).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the overall survival time, duration of progression -free survival, time to
           treatment failure, confirmed tumour response rate and duration of response in patients
           treated with this regimen (Phase II plus patients treated at MTD in Phase I).

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        3. To assess the incidence of cardiotoxicity in these patients treated with this regimen.
