      though dilated eye exams can detect eye diseases like glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy
      early, before significant vision loss has developed. Early detection can lead to earlier
      treatment, which can save sight by preventing or slowing the progression of these eye
      diseases. In this project we designed, implemented, and are now evaluating tailored and
      targeted print health messages to increase eye examination behavior in an African-American
      population 65 years of age and older, a group at increased risk of glaucoma and diabetes.
