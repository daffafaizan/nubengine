      health because it has been adapted to meet the possible weight loss needs of young men. Young
      men may experience reductions in body weight after enrollment in the intervention, but this
      is unknown.

      Study participation lasts approximately 3 months. Participants will be assessed by the study
      staff and fill out questionnaires about current lifestyle practices (diet, physical activity,
      sleep habits, risk behaviors). Weight, medical events, and medication use within the last 3
      months will be assessed. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a
      coin) to the control group or self-guided group.
