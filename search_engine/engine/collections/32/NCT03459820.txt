    
      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the differences in theoretical
      optimal clinical management afforded by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer patients as
      proposed by a central panel of experts.

      Primary endpoint:

      1. Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical,
      histopathological, biochemical and radiographic subject data both before and after 18F-DCFPyL
      PET/CT imaging retrospectively by a central panel of experts.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan positivity fraction in patients with biochemically recurrent
           prostate cancer, stratified by PSA.

        2. Immediate AE up to 90 minutes post-administration of 18F-DCFPyL.
