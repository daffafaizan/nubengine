      assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole. 360 patients were administrated 10 mg
      ilaprazole daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous infusion within 30min with first dose
      doubling. Other 180 patients were administrated 40 mg omeprazole twice daily (at day 1-3)
      through intravenous infusion for 30min. Since 4th day, both group taken oral ilaprazole
      tablets 10mg each day till 30th day; And the Patients who with helicobacter pylori infection
      were provided amoxicillin and clarithromycin as complimentary therapy for two weeks. The
      efficacy of ilaprazole and omeprazole was evaluated by the primary endpointthe-hemostasis
      rate at the end of 72 hours in the total population, high-risk groups and low-risk groups and
      secondary end points including ulcer staging changes within 72 hours, effective rate of
      hemostasis, hemostasis duration, average blood transfusion, the need to switch to other
      treatments (endoscopic treatment or surgery, etc.), the disappearance time of ulcer pain and
      rebleeding rate. This phase â…¢ clinical trial was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety
      of ilaprazole in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding and to pride a basis for
      registration.
