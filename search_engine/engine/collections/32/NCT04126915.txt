      of advanced prostate cancer. Heterogeneity exists in different lesions at the same location
      of the same tumor, between lesions at different locations, and in the same lesion in
      different processes of disease progression. Tumor heterogeneity causes different tumor
      patients to respond differently to different treatments; as patients progress, tumor patients
      gradually develop clonal evolution, and the original effective treatment will lose the
      therapeutic effect. And routine imaging examinations and PSA examinations are also difficult
      to respond to changes in the patient's condition in a timely manner. By Genetic testing of
      the primary tumor, metastases or blood of the patient, and according to the test result of
      the patient, the patient's medication treatment can be provided, and the patient's condition
      change can be monitored. Studies have shown that patients with different mutation types
      respond differently to the same treatment. Prostate cancer patients with AR-V7 mutations have
      a poorer response to abiraterone or dextrozamide than patients with prostate cancer without
      AR-V7 mutation; whereas for solid tumors with MSI-H or dMMR, PD-1 Inhibitors can also bring
      the desired results to such patients. Therefore, according to the genetic test results of the
      patient's tumor tissue, early diagnosis can also be given, and the patient's condition change
      and precise treatment can be predicted.In this study, the investigators hope to obtain the
      genome characteristics of advanced patients by performing whole exon sequencing on the
      patient's tissues, and to guide the patients' follow-up treatment through sequencing results,
      to observe the effects of different treatment methods on patients and find biomarker that
      predict patient prognosis
