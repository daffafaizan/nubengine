    
      Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated
      dose of SEL24/MEN1703 in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

      The clinical trial will investigate the safety profile and anti-leukemic activity of
      SEL24/MEN1703 in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and that have no standard therapeutic
      options available.

      The clinical trial encompasses two parts:

        -  Part 1, ascending dose levels: the main purpose of this part of the clinical trial is to
           determine the highest dose of SEL24/MEN1703 considered to be well tolerated.

        -  Part 2, expansion cohort: the main purpose of this part of the clinical trial is to
           assess the safety and anti-leukemia activity of SEL24/MEN1703 given at the highest
           tolerated dose in patient with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

      Patients participating to the clinical trial will take the study drug as oral capsules once
      daily for 14 consecutive days over a 21-day treatment cycle.
