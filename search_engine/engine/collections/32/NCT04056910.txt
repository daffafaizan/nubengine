    
      This study will describe the safety, response rate, progression free and overall survival,
      and summarize safety events of ivosidenib in combination with nivolumab in participants with
      advanced solid tumors (nonresectable or metastatic) or enhancing gliomas. Participants are
      required to have a histologically consistent diagnosis of IDH1 gene mutated tumor that is not
      eligible for curative therapy. Enrolled subjects will receive orally administered ivosidenib
      dosed daily on 28-day cycles and nivolumab will be infused every 28 days. Participants will
      be assessed at every visit for adverse events starting from the first dose of study
      treatment. Assessment (CT or MRI) for evaluation of disease response will be conducted every
      8 weeks (Â±7 days) from the first day of treatment cycle 1 and/or at any time when progression
      of disease is suspected. A Post-Treatment Follow-Up Visit for safety will occur 28 (+/- 5)
      days after the last dose of study drug.
