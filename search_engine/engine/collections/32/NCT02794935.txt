      for convenience. Subsequently, patients will be subjected to test respiratory muscle strength
      (manometer), respiratory muscle endurance, portable polysomnography, sleepiness, sleep
      quality, cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), motor task (execution of a
      sequence of digital movements), executive function, quality of life (SF-36), maximum exercise
      testing, chemoreflex sensitivity (peripheral chemoreflex by transient hypoxia and central
      chemoreflex by hypercapnic hyperoxia) and vagal modulation of heart rate (spectral analysis)
      before the start of the training protocol. Patients will be randomized to inspiratory muscle
      training or control group. Inspiratory muscle training will be performed for 30 minutes a
      day, 7 days a week, for 12 weeks with muscle training device (PowerBreathe). There will be a
      weekly monitoring in the Clinical Research Center of the institution where the maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) and respiratory training techniques will be reassessed and
      readjusted (30% of MIP). The control group will be submitted to respiratory training
      techniques with muscle training device (PowerBreathe) without load. After this period, all
      initial tests will be reassessed. A group study with 15 heart failure patients without
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be included.
