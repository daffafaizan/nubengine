      proven treatments include pain killers or surgery if there if patients experience progressive
      weakness or signs or spinal cord compression. Observations in both animal models and humans
      indicate that there is an inflammatory component to it. Corticosteroids (such as
      dexamethasone)are potent anti-inflammatories which may benefit people suffering from this
      condition. There is some evidence to support neck injections of drug directly onto the nerve
      root. This mmethod of drug delivery has been implicated with some serious complications such
      as paralysis and stroke. Delivering these medications in a pill form may provide a similar
      benefit without some of the serious complications.
