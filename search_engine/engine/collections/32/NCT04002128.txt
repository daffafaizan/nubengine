      study protocol by attending anesthesiologist on the day of the surgery and written informed
      consent was obtained. Patients with clinically or radiologically confirmed acute respiratory
      infections or those using antibiotics due to the respiratory infections a week prior to the
      surgery were not included in the study. Following risk factors were recorded in all patients:
      age, sex, weight loss in the last 6 months, comorbidities and operative time. Comorbidities
      were rated using ASA status and Charlson comorbidity index by 3 independent observers.
      Charlson comorbidity index was calculated after pathological examination. An advanced
      malignant disease was considered if tumor had infiltrated other organs or surrounding
      tissues, or when positive lymph nodes or metastases were confirmed.

      A group of 120 colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic cancer patients scheduled for surgery in
      the single centre were included in the prospective randomized study regardless of their ASA
      physical status. Nasopharyngeal smears were obtained in the preoperative area and tracheal
      aspirates were obtained in the operating room at the end of the surgery with a sterile
      suction catheter in a closed system.

      Postoperative Hgb; CRP and lung auscultation were done in all patients on the second and
      fourth postoperative day.

      Outcome measures registered were:

        -  Postoperative pneumonia

        -  Productive and difficult cough

        -  Dysphonia

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  postoperative complications, including hypertensive crisis, thromboembolic and infective
           complications were summarized one year after surgical treatment was finished & one year
           survival
