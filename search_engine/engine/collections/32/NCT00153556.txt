      eliminate Hib carriage in rural Alaska villages, with three villages to serve as a comparison
      group. WE performed community-wide surveys of Hib carriage by recruiting volunteers for
      throat cultures to establish a baseline rate of Hib carriage for each community. Then Hib
      carriers were offered chemoprophylaxis to clear Hib from their throats. In the vaccine
      intervention communities, a single dose of Hib conjugate vaccine was offered to persons of
      all ages. This was followed by a second community-wide Hib carriage survey after one year to
      assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
