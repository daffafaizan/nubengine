      over age 30 with a body mass index (BMI) between 27 to 35 kg/m2,and in good health by
      history, physical examination, and basic laboratory screening (complete blood count, serum
      chemistries, liver panel, and lipid panel) will be selected for study. Subjects with type 2
      diabetes or glucose intolerance will be excluded as will individuals who regularly drink more
      than one alcoholic beverage daily. Thirty-six men and women who meet the selection criteria
      below will be randomly assigned to one of three arms providing CH-19 at two dose levels per
      day vs. placebo capsules.

      This will be a prospectively randomized double blind study in which neither the subjects nor
      the clinical research personnel will be aware of whether the subjects will be assigned to
      placebo or dihydrocapsiate at two different doses. A total of 36 subjects will be divided
      among three groups.

      To keep the number of capsules taken by each subject constant, all subjects will take three
      capsules three times per day containing the appropriate number of active or placebo capsules
      and will be randomized after screening to one of three groups:

        -  Group 1: Dihydrocapsiate 1 capsule and 2 placebo capsules three times a day within 30
           minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner.

        -  Group 2: Dihydrocapsiate 3 capsules three times per day within 30 minutes before
           breakfast, lunch and dinner

        -  Group 3: Placebo 3 capsules three times per day within 30 minutes before breakfast,
           lunch and dinner
