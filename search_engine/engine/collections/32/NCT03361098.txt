      inhibition and GLP-1 receptor agonism on food intake, body weight and the activity within the
      central satiety and reward circuits in response to food-related stimuli and 3) wheter the
      combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist can prevent the increased intake observed with
      SGLT2- inhibition treatment.

      Methods: In four groups of obese patients with T2DM (n=16 per group), food intake and
      neuronal activity in relevant CNS circuits in response to food-related stimuli (using fMRI)
      will be investigated during 16 week treatment in a double blind placebo-controlled randomized
      trial with:1) SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin 10 mg/day in combination with placebo GLP-1
      receptor agonist exenatide twice daily, 2) GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide twice daily in
      combination with placebo dapagliflozin, 3) combination of dapagliflozin 10 mg/day and
      exenatide twice daily, or 4) placebo dapagliflozin and placebo exenatide twice daily. To
      correlate changes in brain activity with subsequent feeding behavior, the investigators will
      measure food intake, self-reported hunger, satiety and mood, during a choice-buffet after the
      scanning.

      Expected results: This project will gain insight into the CNS mechanisms underlying the the
      effects of seperate and combined treatment with SGLT2 inhibition and GLP-1 receptor agonism.
      Furthermore, this project will provide insight if combined treatment with a GLP-1 receptor
      agonist will prevent the increased intake, observed by treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor, and
      if so, in the underlying (CNS) mechanisms. These findings may increase the understanding of
      the development of obesity and weight loss problems in obese and T2DM patients and may
      support the development of a balanced SGLT2 inhibitor/GLP-1 receptor agonist combination as a
      treatment strategy for obesity and T2DM.
