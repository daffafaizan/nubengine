    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra™) in combination with
      fulvestrant based on clinical benefit rate (CBR, a combination of complete response rate,
      partial response rate, and stable disease for more than 24 weeks) in postmenopausal women
      with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after
      first-line endocrine therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median time to progression (TTP) and duration of response of tipifarnib
      (R115777, Zarnestra™) in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone
      receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To determine the median overall survival of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra™) in
      combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor- positive
      metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after first-line endocrine therapy.

      III. To determine the toxicity profile of tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra™) in combination
      with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone (from historical control) in postmenopausal women
      with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressive disease after
      first-line endocrine therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1 and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity*.

      NOTE: *Fulvestrant continues even if tipifarnib is held for toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
