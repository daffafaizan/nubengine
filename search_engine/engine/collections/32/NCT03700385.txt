      enrollment per protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients will then undergo
      ablation using the IOWA Approach Endocardial Ablation System (FARAPULSE, Inc.). Subjects will
      be followed at 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months with a blanking period for
      recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia of 3 months following the PEF catheter
      ablation procedure.
