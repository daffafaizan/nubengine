      Primary

        -  Compare the local progression-free interval in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma (NHL) treated with 2 different regimens of low-dose radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare acute toxicity at 4 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare late toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare tumor response at 12 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess the health economics of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I 4Gy: Patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy once daily on days 1 and 2.

        -  Arm II 24Gy: Patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15,
           and 16.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 5 years.
