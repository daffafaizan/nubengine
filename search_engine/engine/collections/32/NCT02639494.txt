    
      A prospective, open-label, single-arm feasibility study evaluating the Self-Centering Guide
      Catheter. All subjects who are candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
      of a native valve with a transcatheter aortic valve that is introduced percutaneously via the
      femoral artery using conventional catheterization techniques will be evaluated for enrollment
      in this study. The Self-Centering Guide Catheter is intended to facilitate delivery of a
      guidewire across a stenotic native aortic valve and into the left ventricle.
