    
      STEMI patients with mutivessel disease are, after successful primary angioplasty, randomized
      1:1 ratio to either in-hospital complete revascularization or after-discharge complete
      revascularization strategy.

      Eligible non-culprit coronary arteries must be >2.0 mm in diameter and at the discretion of
      the operator suitable for PCI. Only arteries with angiographically stenoses ≥70% or between
      ≥50% and <70 in proximal segments can be randomized.

      Patients in the in-hospital revascularization group will undergo to non-culprit percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) at least 24 hours after ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction. On the other hand, patients in the after-discharge group will undergo to
      non-culprit PCI within 4-6 weeks after STEMI.
