      airways and may cause a variety of inflammatory changes in the pharynx and larynx. The
      pathophysiology of the supraesophageal forms of GERD is widely unknown. Studies have
      suggested decreased salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations in patients with
      reflux esophagitis and laryngitis. It is however unclear if these abnormalities are primary
      or secondary. The aim of the current cohort study was to compare salivary EGF concentrations
      in adults with reflux laryngitis before and after treatment and control of the disease to
      that of healthy individuals. Methods: Twenty-one patients with reflux laryngitis were studied
      prospectively at a tertiary teaching hospital. Spontaneous whole saliva was sampled before
      and after a 16-week course of full dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily and compared
      to that of 13 healthy controls. Salivary EGF concentrations were established using a
      commercially available Elisa kit.
