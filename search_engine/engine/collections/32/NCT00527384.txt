      (systemic inflammation) as a index of major stress. The blood will be analyzed for the types
      of proteins that could alter immune system functions and affect organ functions, including
      cardiovascular effects due to blood vessel changes. This will be followed by analysis of
      stress effects on mice and mice that have been generated with human immune cells. The ability
      of stress to alter blood patterns will also be examined in mice with genetic modification of
      metallothionein expression, which is believe to influence oxidative stress.
