        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with
           recurrent or refractory platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer or primary
           peritoneal carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Correlate ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance with clinical response to this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular markers of drug responsiveness and cellular apoptosis with ex vivo
           measures of drug resistance in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-14
      months.
