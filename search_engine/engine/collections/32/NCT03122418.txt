      with cystic fibrosis over the age of 21.

      The primary outcome will be the overall change in the patient's Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire
      - Revised (CFQ-R) over a one year period. Secondary outcomes will evaluate (1) exacerbations
      of cystic fibrosis (through use of antibiotics), (2) change in subject's FEV1, (3) inpatient
      admission rates, (4) change in BMI and (5) change in 6 minute walk test

      This is a prospective single group non-blinded study. Participants will be asked to wear a
      personal fitness device for 11-13 months (this will be the duration of their enrollment in
      the study). Upon enrollment, subjects will be given information regarding the benefits of
      physical activity and encouraged to develop an initial individual fitness goal. Two specific
      handouts regarding the benefits and how to start and exercise routine will be provided.

      They will not be given a specific exercise program to follow, but instead will be encouraged
      to set personal fitness goals over the year and use the device to track these individual
      goals. Although they will be encouraged to have an individualized goal each participant will
      be asked to take a minimum of 5,000 steps per day during the first three months over the
      study and increase to 10,000 steps over the one year study period. This goal can be achieved
      by walking, aerobic classes or other exercise modalities, the method of exercise is expected
      to be variable for each participating subject and based on their personal preferences. Study
      participants individual goals will be noted by study staff during in the clinic visit in the
      electronic medical record. The personal fitness device to be used as part of this study is
      the Garmin Vivofit 2 fitness activity and sleep tracker.
