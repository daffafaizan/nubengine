      (TM) technology as compared to our laboratory measurement of Hb. We have been using the
      Masimo SpHb monitor on patients who underwent open heart surgery, hepatic resection, kidney
      transplant and aortic aneurysm repair since January 2009. These patients also had hemoglobin
      concentration measurements as part of the arterial blood gas analysis performed by our
      laboratory to evaluate intraoperative ventilation and electrolyte changes. We will collate
      the laboratory measurements with the Masimo SpHb values documented in the anesthetic records.
