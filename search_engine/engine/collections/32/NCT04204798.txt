      anti-anxiety properties. Unlike other sedative agents, dexmedetomidine exerts its sedative
      effects through an endogenous sleep-promoting pathway, producing a state like non-rapid eye
      movement sleep. For mechanically ventilated patients, sedative-dose dexmedetomidine infusion
      at night maintains circadian rhythm, increases sleep efficiency, and improves sleep
      architecture. When used for sedation in mechanical ventilated patients, it reduces the
      incidence of delirium.

      Dexmedetomidine may improve patient outcomes by improving sleep quality. A previous
      randomized trial found that, for elderly patients who were admitted to ICU after noncardiac
      surgery, nighttime infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine significantly improves the sleep
      quality and decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. A long-term follow-up of these
      patients showed that low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion significantly increased survival up to
      2 years, and improved cognitive function and quality of life in 3-year survivors.

      In the study mentioned above, dexmedetomidine was only infused during the night after surgery
      with a fixed dose. The investigators hypothesize that, for elderly admitted to ICU after
      surgery, nighttime infusion of individualized low-dose dexmedetomidine may improve long-term
      outcomes. This randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the effect of low-dose
      dexmedetomidine on 1-year survival and the quality of life of 1-year survivors in elderly
      patients admitted to the ICU after surgery.
