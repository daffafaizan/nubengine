    
      'Neglect' is a common neurological syndrome that affects approximately 50% of
      right-hemisphere stroke patients. It is a complex multi-faceted syndrome, but its core
      defining feature is that patients lose the capacity to voluntarily control attention in the
      left half of space. Neglect has a significant debilitating effect on patients' functional
      independence and everyday life and indicates a poor prognosis for long-term functional
      recovery.

      To date, there is no effective rehabilitation intervention available for routine clinical
      use. One of the most promising experimental strategies for neglect rehabilitation is prism
      adaptation, a form of motor training that induces short-lived improvements in a variety of
      cognitive domains. However, its major limitation is that the benefits are transient. The
      investigators aim to test the hypothesis that by combining prism therapy with transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), this will boost learning/memory processes, resulting in
      larger and longer-lasting therapeutic effects.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of
      multi-session prism therapy combined with real versus sham tDCS for the rehabilitation of
      chronic post-stroke neglect. Baseline neuroimaging data will be used as predictor variables
      to explain inter-individual variation in therapeutic response. Contrasts between pre- and
      post-intervention imaging data will be performed to identify neural structures that mediate
      therapeutic effects.
