      limited and minimally effective. Dacarbazine is currently one of the standard chemotherapy
      drugs used for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, it is associated with low
      response rates (10-20%) and median survival of less than 12 months (6-11 months in most
      studies). PI-88 is an antiangiogenic and antimetastatic drug that has already shown some
      evidence of efficacy when used alone in an intermittent dosage regimen (4 consecutive days
      per week) in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. The FDA has designated PI-88
      as an Orphan Drug for this indication, as well as for Stage III and high-risk stage II
      disease. The aim of this randomised pilot phase II trial is to determine whether PI-88 in
      combination with a standard regimen of dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) should be
      considered for further investigation in a larger-scale trial.
