      into intervention and control group. Participants in short-axis group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with short-axis approach and long-axis group received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided injection with long-axis approach. No additional treatment after
      injection through the study period. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale (VAS),
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as
      on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th month after the treatment.
