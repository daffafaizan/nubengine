      there are numerous solutions that can be offered to patients, but sometimes they are
      unsatisfactory as medical treatments are often insufficiently effective, surgical techniques
      are often invasive and indications can be limited.

      Rhizolysis or lumbar thermocoagulation is a therapeutic proposal for certain types of chronic
      lower back pain that is resistant to medical treatment and outside the field of surgical
      indications. This technique, which is minimally invasive, is low-risk for patients and is
      widely used. However, few studies have shown its effectiveness, so the level of evidence is
      not enough to make this technique accepted as a standard.

      A previous study has selected functional and physical signs for joint involvement in lower
      back pain. This selection was made by analysts and a group of experts from the modified
      "Delphi" prediction method. This study resulted in the creation of a questionnaire (DFL
      questionnaire) with 16 symptoms: 7 functional and 9 physical.

      The aim of this new study is to select the symptoms that have the best positive predictive
      value among the 16 symptoms, to predict a good result of rhizolysis, on the criterion of
      their mitigation or disappearance in case of effective rhizolysis.
