      THP(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab/Pertuzumab)regimens as
      Neoadjuvant Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer have been recommended by NCCN
      guideline. It is unknown which regimen is better. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety ofTCHP (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/Pertuzumab) and EC followed by
      THP(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab/Pertuzumab)regimens as
      Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2- Positive breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete
      response is used as a surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by
      number of grade 4 toxicities and hospitalizations.
