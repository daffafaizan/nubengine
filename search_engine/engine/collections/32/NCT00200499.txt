      follow-up phase to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of nebivolol administered
      orally once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (defined as an average
      sitting diastolic blood pressure greater then or equal to 95 mmHg and less then or equal to
      109 mmHg when untreated, based on entry into NEB 202, NEB 302 or NEB 305). Patients were
      permitted protocol-defined concomitant use of diuretic or calcium antagonist. After
      successful completion of one of the 3-month efficacy "feeder" studies, patients were eligible
      to continue nebivolol treatment in this 9-month extension study. Patients who completed the
      extension phase and received only nebivolol monotherapy during the extension phase were
      eligible to enter the 1-month follow-up phase.
