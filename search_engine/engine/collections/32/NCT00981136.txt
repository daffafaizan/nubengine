      hospital with non-perforated appendicitis. We will offer enrollment to several institutions
      provided they receive institutional approval.

      There are likely several parameters that will show small differences between groups, and this
      study will precisely quantify them to allow for adequate consultation from surgeons to
      families dealing with acute appendicitis. One theoretical concern over the SILS approach is
      that the exposure of the appendix to the wound could increase the rate of infectious
      complications; therefore, this is the primary outcome variable. The documented rate of
      infectious complications at our institution in patients with non-perforated appendicitis is
      0.6%. An unacceptable and clinically relevant rise to 5% may curtail enthusiasm for the new
      technique. Using a power of 0.9 with an Î± of 0.05, the sample size is 360 total patients or
      180 in each arm.

      After the procedure, both groups will be managed in the same manner per routine care. They
      will be discharged when tolerating a regular diet and their pain is well-controlled on oral
      pain medication. Cosmetic scores will be obtained at 6 weeks and 6 months.
