      locomotion in aging and preventing mobility disabilities. However, use of cognitive training
      programs to improve executive functions as a strategy to increase mobility has not been
      explored. Exciting results from the preliminary study support the efficacy and feasibility of
      the cognitive remediation approach to improve locomotion in older adults.

      The premise of this clinical trial is that disability among seniors is a potentially
      preventable chronic condition rather than an irreversible consequence of aging and disease.
      The investigators proposed novel approach to locomotion has the potential to shift treatment
      paradigms in the field of disability by introducing cognitive approaches to mobility that can
      be applied to prevention and rehabilitation in diverse settings. Through this 'proof of
      concept' secondary prevention trial the investigators will fill an important gap in knowledge
      for practicing evidence-based medicine and developing effective interventions for a major
      health outcome affecting a substantial proportion of the U.S. aging population.
