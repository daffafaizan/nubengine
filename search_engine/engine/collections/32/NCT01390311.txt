    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      -To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 5-AzaC (azacitidine) when given after
      chemotherapy and DLI in patients with AML/MDS who relapse after allogeneic stem cell
      transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the rate of Grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) in first 100 days
           after DLI.

        -  To determine the rates of complete remission (CR), partial remission, (PR) and complete
           remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and overall response rate (CR+ CRi +
           PR).

        -  To determine overall survival 100 days after DLI.

        -  To determine the effects of increasing dose of 5-AzaC on frequency and absolute number
           of resting regulatory T-cells (rTregs) and activated Tregs (aTregs) at baseline, 7 days,
           14 days, 21 days, and ~60 days after first dose of 5-AzaC.
