      health and are strongly linked. Despite marked improvements in the diagnosis of tuberculosis,
      there are difficulties in diagnosing and monitoring treatment outcome among TB patients. The
      use of immunological biomarkers alone or in combination with other clinical parameters could
      better predict the response to TB treatment. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the
      IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) concentrations significantly decrease within two weeks
      following TB treatment initiation in adults with active documented TB. This is a
      proof-of-concept study, among 100 patients (50 HIV positive and 50 HIV negative) with
      documented active TB, in Cambodge and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Patients recruited for this study will
      receive the standard TB treatment per their respective national treatment guidelines. Plasma
      samples will be collected at baseline (initiation of TB treatment), weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 to
      measure IL-1Ra, sCD163 and IP-10.
