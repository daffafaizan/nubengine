    
      This prospective randomised study aims to investigate the heterologous immunological effects
      of DTP and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccination in an elderly Tasmanian population and
      healthy adults. The study will assess whether prior or concurrent administration of DTP with
      seasonal Flu vaccination affects generalised inflammation / immune homeostasis and gene
      expression, with a particular focus of inflammation reactive cells. It will also analyse for
      effects of DTP on the induction of vaccine-specific immunity to seasonal influenza
      vaccination (antibodies and cellular). Volunteers will be randomised to one of three vaccine
      groups and serial blood samples taken for immunological assays for up to 30 weeks.

      The study is exploratory and will investigate vaccine effects on multiple immune parameters.
