      I. To describe the toxicities of the combination of arsenic trioxide in combination with
      pamidronate disodium at four dose levels.

      II. To assess the pharmacokinetics of pamidronate disodium when given in combination with
      arsenic trioxide.

      III. Utilizing 2-color immunofluorescence (IF) to determine if the treatment with combination
      of arsenic trioxide and pamidronate disodium affects the phosphorylation of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) IV. In patients with multiple myeloma utilizing western blot to
      evaluate the pre- and post-treatment levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in lysates of
      multiple myeloma cells.

      V. To obtain preliminary data for response to this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive pamidronate IV and over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and arsenic trioxide IV
      over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 15-19. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pamidronate and arsenic trioxide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
