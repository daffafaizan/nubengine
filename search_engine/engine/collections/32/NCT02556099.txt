      500 mg capsules or liquid (100 mg/mL). Hydroxyurea will be administered once daily by mouth.
      Participants will be monitored monthly to maximum tolerated dose and quarterly thereafter
      with periodic clinical evaluations, laboratory tests, and transcranial doppler examinations
      every 6 months.

      Hydroxyurea will be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose as defined by mild marrow
      suppression, even if the participant has clinical well-being at a lower hydroxyurea dose. The
      target absolute neutrophil count (ANC)on hydroxyurea therapy will be < 3.0 x 109/L, but the
      marrow suppression should also include reduction of the reticulocyte count. Hydroxyurea
      dosing will commence at 20 mg/kg/day. Dose escalation will occur in 5 mg/kg/day increments,
      adjusting every 8 weeks unless dose-limiting hematological toxicity occurs (defined as ANC <
      1.0 x 109/L, hemoglobin concentration < 5 gm/dL or 20% below baseline, absolute reticulocyte
      count < 80 x 109/L unless hemoglobin concentration >9.0 gm/dL, or platelet count < 80 x
      109/L) or the target neutropenia (ANC < 3.0 x 109/L) is achieved. Based on pilot data and
      experience in other clinical trials, most pediatric participants require hydroxyurea doses of
      20-30 mg/kg/day to reach this target absolute neutrophil count .

      After reaching maximum tolerated dose, minor hydroxyurea dose adjustments can be made
      periodically, as necessary based on weight changes and blood counts, to maintain the optimal
      laboratory response and to prevent dose-related toxicity. If the absolute neutrophil count
      (ANC) rises above the target range on 2 consecutive visits, compliance will be reinforced and
      the dose may be adjusted by 2.5 mg/kg/day at eight week intervals to a maximum of 35
      mg/kg/day or 2000 mg/day. For hydroxyurea dosing, the current body weight will be used, with
      dose escalations guided by hematological toxicity. Hydroxyurea will be reduced or even
      temporarily discontinued for hematological toxicities, e.g., ANC < 1.0 x 109/L, hemoglobin <
      5.0 gm/dL, or 20% below baseline, absolute reticulocyte count < 80 x 109/L unless hemoglobin
      concentration > 9.0 gm/dL, or platelets < 80 x 109/L.
