      smokers who are making a quit attempt. Retrieval will be initiated by a brief (5-min.) video
      with smoking-related content and the extinction will consist of protracted (1 hr.) exposure
      to smoking cues. A control group receiving the same treatment except that the retrieval video
      will have nonsmoking/neutral content will serve to demonstrate that retrieval is a key
      feature of R-E training. Effects of training on smoking craving and cue reactivity will be
      assessed 1-day, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training, whereas training effects on indices of
      smoking behavior/cessation will be preliminarily assessed 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training.
      It is expected that the R-E training will result in significant and enduring reductions in
      craving and reactivity to both novel and familiar smoking cues and have a favorable impact on
      smoking. Positive findings from this study could lead to a safe and effective behavioral
      intervention that will help smokers overcome the threat to cessation posed by cue-elicited
      craving and reactivity, and thereby reduce the burden levied against society by this most
      costly addiction. Additionally, this intervention could be modified to treat addiction to
      other substances.
