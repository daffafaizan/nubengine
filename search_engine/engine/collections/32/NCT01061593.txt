    
      Phase III, placebo-controlled trial, aimed to seek the therapeutic benefit of Immunoxel in
      combination with standard of care anti-TB therapy (ATT) at the end of the 1-month period
      (p<0.05) among subjects with sputum-positive pulmonary TB. The results will be compared to
      standard ATT therapy + placebo. The trial will consist of one stage with laboratory
      evaluation after one month. Two cohorts or arms of at least 150 subjects each (total 300)
      with pulmonary TB positive for sputum AFB smear will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      once-daily, honey lozenge of Immunoxel in combination with standard ATT for 1 month. Patients
      who receive standard ATT + placebo preparation will be used as a group of comparison.
