      To identify prognostic factors associated with a worse outcome following ankle fractures.

      Method:

      All operated or non-operated ankle fractures in a period of one year from three different
      hospitals will be included. The following data will be recorded:

      Civil registration number, age, rupture of the syndesmosis, use of alcohol, smoking,
      diabetes, characteristics of the ankle fracture (AO classification), type of treatment and
      complications.

      Study participants will at time of diagnosis and 6, 12, 52 and 104 weeks following the injury
      received a questionaire with Manchester foot and ankle questionnaire (MOXFQ), Self-reported
      foot and ankle questionnaire (SEFAS), Olerud Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) and Forgotten Joint
      Score (FJS).

      Which of the questionaire that should be used in the study will be determined when the
      questionaires have been compared in a different study.
