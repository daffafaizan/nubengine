      children's eating behaviors, and parent-child interaction during eating and their
      associations with BMI and dietary intake. It builds on earlier observational research which,
      like this research, had small experimental components used to classify children into
      different phenotypic groups based on different responses to the experimental conditions. The
      small activities and experiments of this follow up study constitute a trial as defined by
      NIH, registered here. The exploratory outcomes measured from these activities are not listed
      in this registration for reasons of scientific integrity. To be clear, the bigger structure
      of this research is essentially an observational follow up study with the same children who
      were previously studied as infants. The goal of the project is to identify potential future
      intervention targets.
