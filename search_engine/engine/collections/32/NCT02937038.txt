      concentration are associated with better overall nutrition, increased physical activity,
      improved mood state, and enhanced cognition; which is specifically related to superior
      attention and memory when compared to sub-optimally hydrated children. Separately, ancillary
      water is being investigated as a potential treatment possibility for pediatric obesity.
      Although, causality cannot be directly confirmed, it is apparent that ample water intake in
      children, above and beyond the body's compensatory mechanisms, is preferable for
      psychological and physiological health. However, the prevalence of failure to meet water
      recommendations and hypohydration in children remains high. Still it is unclear if elevated
      hypohydration reports within the pediatric population are due to a general failure of
      children to meet water recommendations, or due to inadequacy of the published guidelines
