      I. Determine the safety of ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-1 (M)/TRICOM vaccine with sirolimus at varying
      dose and schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of sirolimus on enhancing vaccine efficacy by assessing
      NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity: peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster
      of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies;
      peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells.

      II. Explore time to disease progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sirolimus.

      Patients receive ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-1 (M)/TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. Patients also receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-14 OR 15-28 OR 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive an
      additional course of ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-1 (M)/TRICOM vaccine only followed by ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-I
      (M)/TRICOM vaccine SC 8 weeks after completion of course 4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and 6 and 12
      months.
