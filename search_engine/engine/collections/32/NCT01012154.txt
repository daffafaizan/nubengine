      performed on living tissue in vivo. The procedure involves a small endoscope which is placed
      gently into contact with the tissue, providing significant in vivo magnification on a scale
      similar to that obtained by the pathology laboratory microscope. It is already in clinical
      use in the field of gastroenterological endoscopy, and investigational use in laparoscopy,
      dermatology and gynecology. Further, in recent pilot studies endomicroscopy has also been
      shown to be feasible in bronchoscopy, robot assisted prostatectomy and neurosurgery.The study
      will use both endomicroscopy and biopsy to document the histological appearance of a range of
      neurological tumour types and grades.

      In subsequent analysis, the confocal image data and corresponding histology data and images
      will be used to document reliably observable features in the confocal images that are
      relevant to histopathology interpretation. Relevant images will be selected and discussed by
      comparison to frozen or permanent section histology for compilation into an atlas documenting
      comparison for the tumors seen in the study.
