      is made. The results of previous trials using keyhole technique are partially unsatisfactory.
      Specifically designed PVDF mesh used in this trial showed promising results in previous small
      trial.

      Chimney trial is designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of mesh group to controls
      operated with no preventive mesh in parastomal hernia prevention after laparoscopic or
      robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection or low Haartman's procedure for rectal
      adenocarcinoma.
