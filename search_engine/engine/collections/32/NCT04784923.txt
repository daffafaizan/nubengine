      needs screws. Pedicle screws are often used. If the pedicle screws are mal-located, that is
      breaking the pedicle wall; the consequence may be injury of the spinal cord, or nerve root.
      Some lucky patients may have no symptom; however, broken pedicle will reduce the fixation
      strength which may reduce fusion rate.

      Detecting malposition screws, currently we use CT (computer tomography) method. The surgeon
      carefully read the CT slice by slice, looking for clues of screws malposition. However, CT is
      costly both price and radiation dose.We invented a plain radiograph method which has been
      pilot tested in one patient with good correction rate. The purpose of this study is to solve
      the following two clinical problems:

        1. What are the inter-observer and intra-observer reliabilities of CT method?

        2. The radiation dose for CT method is too high. Does our plain radiograph method has the
           same correction rate? Materials and methods We planned to collect about 100 patients
           received spinal fusion and instrumentation who has preoperative CT(or MRI) and
           postoperative plain radiographs and CT. We will firstly verify CT method's
           reproducibility by interobserver and intra-observer reliability test. With the same
           databank, we will use our plain radiograph method again, and test if the two methods'
           results are the same by Chi-square test.

      Conclusion:

      We hope our study can reduce some unnecessary CT examination. In the future,our method can be
      used in fluoroscopy, helping us detecting screw malposition efficiently during the surgeries,
      and hoping reduce complications.
