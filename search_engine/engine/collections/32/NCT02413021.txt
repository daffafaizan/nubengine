      regulation and metastasis in different cancer cell lines. It is also believed that Iron
      concentration will increase in cancer cells by enhancing expression of TFR-1 receptors and in
      case of receptor saturation, non-receptor-mediated pinocytosis would be a significant pathway
      for more iron intake. Iron deficiency may lead to increase P 53 which consequently will stop
      cell mitosis in G1-S state. It also increases expression of N-myc down-regulated gene 1 which
      can suppress metastasis in cancer. It has been suggested that Iron chelators may decrease
      leukemic tumor growth in animal models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some other case
      studies demonstrated the role of Iron chelators in relapse and/or refractory AML. Finally a
      phase 1 clinical study is undertaken for evaluate the role of Tiapine and cytarabine for
      adult AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. So in this study the investigators try to
      evaluate the role of iron chelating agent (deferasirox) for patients with acute lymphatic
      leukemia (ALL) and AML patients who cannot be treated with standard chemotherapy regimes .
