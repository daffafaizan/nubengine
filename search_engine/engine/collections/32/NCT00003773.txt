      patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this
      patient population. III. Obtain preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this drug in these
      patients. IV. Evaluate the effect of this drug in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth
      factor and transforming growth factor in this population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive IM-862 intranasally daily.
      Treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. At the physician's discretion, further treatment may be given if the patient is
      still responding after 6 months of treatment. The dose of IM-862 is escalated in cohorts of
      10-20 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 3 of 10 or 5 of 20 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-70 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within
      6-9 months.
