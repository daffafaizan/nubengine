      orotracheal intubation by FOB(group F) or DE(group D) after conscious sedation. The
      conditions of orotracheal intubation, the time needed to view the vocal cords and to complete
      the orotracheal intubation, the hemodynamic changes and the adverse events including
      bradycardia, respiratory depression during orotracheal intubation, throat pain, hoarseness
      and memory after surgery were recorded. The ease of view the vocal cords and passing the
      tracheal tube through the glottis were also evaluated by using a visual analogue scale (VAS)
      by operator.
