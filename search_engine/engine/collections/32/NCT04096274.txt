    
      This study will investigate the effects of LOCI on the implementation, fidelity, and
      sustainment of a digital measurement-based care (MBC) system called the Outcomes
      Questionnaire Analyst (OQ-A). Over two phases, the investigators will recruit a total of 20
      agencies with up to 2 first level leaders per site (max N of 40 total), a minimum of 3
      clinicians per site (60 total), and 72 caregivers per site (720 total). Agencies will be
      randomly assigned to the control condition (implementation as usual of the OQ-A system) or
      the intervention condition (the LOCI intervention).
