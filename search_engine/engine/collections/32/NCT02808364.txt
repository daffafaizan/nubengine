    
      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular vaccines for patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma (GBM). Recurrent GBM patients will undergo tumor resection. The tumors will be
      analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated antigens and immune-related
      genes. Patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect mononuclear cells for DC generation.
      Based on the expression profiles of tumor-associated antigens, in vitro transcribed mRNA will
      be generated to pulse autologous DCs. Patients will be conditioned with immune adjuvants
      before and during immunization. Patients will receive biweekly vaccines. The antitumor
      specific T cell responses will be measured. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The
      objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines and T cell responses.
      The efficacy of the vaccines will be evaluated using iRANO criteria, progression-free
      survival and overall survival.
