      cirrhosis with a high mortality when variceal hemorrhage (VH) occurs. Screening endoscopy for
      EVs is recommended for all patients with cirrhosis, and prophylactic treatments are proposed
      for preventing VH, which may be financially onerous. Therefore, noninvasive tools for
      diagnosing EVs and risk stratifying VH in cirrhotic patients are needed to decrease the
      number of unnecessary invasive endoscopic examinations of low-risk patients and avoid
      unneeded prophylactic treatment. This is a prospective, multi-center diagnostic trial
      conducted at 9 high-volume liver centers (Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University;
      Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University; 302 Hospital of PLA; Shandong Provincial
      Hospital; Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University; Chinese PLA General
      Hospital; Peking University People's Hospital; Xingtai People's Hospital) in China designed
      to determine the diagnostic performance of radiomics-based surrogate (rEndosc)
      (investigational technology) by CT imaging for noninvasive prediction of EVs and risk
      stratification of VH in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis using endoscopic
      examinations as reference standard.
