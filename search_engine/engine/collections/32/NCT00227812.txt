      dependent patients with comorbid unipolar depression. It is hypothesized that a
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy that targets both disorders, in combination with a
      pharmacotherapy, i.e., bupropion, is expected to provide the best coverage for dual disorders
      and thus maximize treatment outcomes. Specifically, we will conduct a double blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial involving the random assignment of participants into one of
      four treatment conditions according to a full 2x2 factorial research design. One independent
      variable will be pharmacotherapy (bupropion versus placebo); the other independent variable
      will be psychotherapy (integrated CBT versus clinical management). The study will enroll 140
      cocaine dependent patients with comorbid major depressive disorder. A secondary objective is
      to further elucidate "primary" and "secondary" paradigms of depressive illness symptoms in
      cocaine-dependent adults and better understand how this distinction influences treatment
      outcome. This will be accomplished by enrolling a subsample of patients with
      substance-induced mood disorder. Taken together, this proposal will examine the feasibility
      and relative efficacy of a novel integrated treatment model for dually-diagnosed patients.
