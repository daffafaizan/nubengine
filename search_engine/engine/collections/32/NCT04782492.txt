      and saphenous vein (SV) are harvested. After harvest, the patient is randomized to
      Y-composite group or aortocoronary group.

      For Y-composite group, SV is anastomosed to LITA as Y-composite fashion. Then, LITA is
      anastomosed to left anterior descending artery. SV is anastomosed to the rest of the target
      vessels with sequential anastomosis technique (e.g. diagonal branch, obtuse marginal branch,
      posterolateral branch and posteriori descending artery).

      For aortocoronary group, LITA is anastomosed to left anterior descending artery. Then, SV is
      anastomosed to ascending aorta using proximal anastomosis assist device without clamping the
      aorta. SV is anastomosed to the rest of the target vessels with sequential anastomosis
      technique (e.g. diagonal branch, obtuse marginal branch, posterolateral branch and posteriori
      descending artery).

      After completion of anastomoses, residual portion of distal SV is collected for microscopic
      evaluation and measurement of intima-media thickness.

      At the 1-year follow-up, IVUS study, in addition to coronary angiography, is performed to
      evaluate the morphologic changes and measure intima-media thickness of the saphenous vein
      graft.
