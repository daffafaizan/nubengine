      which population will suffer from sphincter tears and other pelvic floor trauma, the
      epidemiology is still poorly understood. Factors that have been implicated to include
      operative vaginal delivery, birth weight, and primaparity. Up to this point little focus has
      been placed on antenatal factors that would help predict and prevent sphincter disruptions.
      At the time of birth the infant's head is the largest part of the body. Thus, head
      circumference of the infant may be able to predict which subjects is more likely to suffer
      from sphincter disruption. Thus, this study aims to determine whether or not fetal head
      circumference measured antenatally is predictive of pelvic floor trauma.
