      clinical performance of Magmaris Drug Eluting Absorbable Metal Scaffold.

      A total of up to 110 patients with de novo lesions in native coronary arteries will be
      enrolled at up to 8 investigational sites in India.

      In-hospital clinical follow-up visits will take place at 1 and 6 months post procedure.

      The primary endpoint is target lesion failure (a composite of cardiac death, target vessel
      Q-wave or non-Q wave myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, clinically
      driven target lesion revascularization) at 1 month post procedure.
