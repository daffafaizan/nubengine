      best practices of MT should be. No specific force threshold necessary to achieve a
      predetermined translational distance within the joint has been quantified within the
      literature. The purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of force necessary to
      perform an inferior glide to the glenohumeral joint and reach to end-range. A secondary aim
      was to determine the impact of co-variables, such as gender, height, weight, and age, on the
      amount of force required to translate the humeral head within the glenohumeral joint.
      Musculoskeletal Ultrasound imaging using the GE LogiQe was used to measure the translation of
      the humeral head. The manipulation force was measured using the Novel Pliance Glove device
      and software.
