      average effect sizes of -1.01 on emotional distress (Ho and Shin, 2014). Power analysis
      showed that with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we needed a sample of 26 participants
      to detect effect sizes of 1.01 and higher.

      Plan for missing data: Occasional missing values were imputed by calculating, for each
      participant, the average score for each subscale and then replaced.

      Statistical analysis plan: We conducted a 2 (group) X 3 (time [pre-treatment vs.
      post-treatment vs follow-up]) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
      for a set of variables
