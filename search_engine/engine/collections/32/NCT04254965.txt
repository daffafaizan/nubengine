      anxiety, and development disorders in children. However, music therapy still lacks systematic
      research on chronic mental illness. Since negative symptoms are an important factor in
      preventing patients from returning to the community, we aim to assess the effect of music
      therapy on negative symptoms through this study. Additionally, Taiwan as many Asian countries
      have not yet established a certification system for music therapy. This study cooperates with
      licensed therapists abroad in the hope of promoting the systematic development of local music
      therapy in the future.

      Participants of integrated music therapy (Group 1, integration of active and passive music
      therapy) includes instrument playing, singing, lyrics modification/music organized play,
      listening to music and discussing each treatment process. The four stages of activities are
      warm-up, main activities, secondary activities, and the ending section. The participants of
      the music listening group (Group 2, background music listening), music selection based on the
      musical preference and background of subjects, for relax or boost the spirit of the subjects.
      Participants in the control group (Group 3) receive their regular occupational therapy during
      the experimental period. We plan to recruit 100 people in the wards: 40/20/40 (Group 1/2/3)
      under random assignment.

      To evaluate the effects of three groups, we measure their psychiatric symptoms, quality of
      life, social and interactive skills, and the differences in the physiological signals
      produced by skin, muscles, and heart assisted by a medical engineering scholar before, after,
      and two months after the music therapy.
