    
      The purpose of this study is to document normal and abnormal appearances of various shoulder
      structures (rotator cable and rotator cuff).

      This study will recruit healthy volunteers and patients who have been referred to Radiology
      for a symptomatic shoulder (a shoulder that is causing the patient pain, or is limited in its
      ability to move.) Both groups will undergo ultrasound imaging of the shoulder.
