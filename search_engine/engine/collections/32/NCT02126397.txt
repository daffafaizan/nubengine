      polyps using a visual analogue pain scale.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine if complete resection of polyps is achieved with both methods.

        -  Compare the time spent on the removal of the polyp in each of the hysteroscopic methods.

        -  To evaluate the safety of the laser diode with respect to the bipolar electrode (vagal
           syndrome, uterine perforation, infection, bleeding).

        -  Assess the recurrence of polyps after 3 months of resection (via hysteroscopy).

        -  Compare the degree of patient satisfaction with the different methods.

      Design: randomized single blind clinical trial corresponds to an experimental analytical
      study. The patients randomly into 2 groups will include: Group A bipolar electrode treatment
      Versapoint and Group B diode laser treatment. Randomization was performed using a random
      table with 2 groups, generated in Microsoft Office Excel. The sample size needed to detect a
      difference in visual analog pain scale of a point with respect to the laser diode bipolar
      electrode is calculated; assuming a standard deviation of 1.75, a sample size of 49 patients
      in each group (98 would be needed in total), to a level of significance of 5% (0.05 Î±) with a
      power of 0.80 (beta 0.20). Assuming a loss of individuals from 5 to 10%
