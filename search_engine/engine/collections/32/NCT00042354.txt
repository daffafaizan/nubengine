      with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Eligible patients must be in
      first or subsequent relapse or be refractory. Forty eligible patients will be enrolled in a
      Fleming 2-stage sequential study design in order to better assess the efficacy and safety of
      clofarabine in this patient population.
