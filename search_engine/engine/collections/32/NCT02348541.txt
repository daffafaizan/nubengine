      cause a range of severe clinical symptoms in women. IUA's can result in menstrual
      abnormalities, dysmenorrhea and infertility. In pregnancy, adhesions are related to
      miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, abnormal placentation, premature labor and delivery and
      possibly birth defects.

      CollaGUARD adhesion barrier is a transparent bioresorbable film approved in Europe for the
      prevention of postoperative adhesions in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic laparotomy or
      laparoscopy.

      This study will assess the feasibility of using CollaGUARD adhesion device in hysteroscopic
      surgery.
