        -  Medical prescription

        -  The pre-analytic phase (preparation of the material, completion of the sample, transport
           of the sample and preparation of it)

        -  The analytical phase

        -  The post-analytic phase (validation of the result obtained and the dissemination of it
           to the prescriber, usually the clinician, who is then able to make a medical decision)
           This succession of steps involves, as part of a classical journey, many stakeholders
           (doctors, nurses, couriers, laboratory technicians, medical biologists) in different
           places.

      Outsourced biology (care test point, POCT) refers to the analysis of biological samples
      outside the central laboratory. The sample is most often carried out, transported and
      analyzed by the same person on a machine near the patient or in the service and therefore in
      the absence of direct control of a specialized laboratory technician or a medical biologist,
      who remains however responsible for good practice, maintenance of the device and validity of
      the results.

      The completion of biological examinations is regulated by differents Articles. The outsourced
      biology (ADBD) sampling analysis can be carried out in the hospital, in most departments, and
      also outside the hospital (pharmacies, city offices or even in the patient's own home). On
      portable devices, usually highly specialized, and these fixed allowing a greater diversity of
      tests.

      Its development is booming with annual growth estimated in 2006 at 15.5% in the United
      States.
