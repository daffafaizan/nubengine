      locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma (except GIST and
      Kaposi's) from any site. A minimum of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen, including adjuvant and
      neo-adjuvant therapy for the treatment of sarcoma, must have been given. Patients eligible
      for an anthracycline should have received a prior anthracycline containing regimen. Patients
      who decline or are not eligible for anthracycline treatment may be considered for this
      protocol as a first line treatment. Patients with a diagnosis of liposarcoma should also have
      received eribulin.

      During screening, subjects will receive a test dose (15g) of ascorbate. If the test dose
      results in any toxicity >/= CTCAE grade 3 or a significant medical event in the opinion of
      the principal investigator, the patient will be considered a screen failure.

      Subjects who pass screening will then receive ascorbate, 75g, on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16
      of a 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15, after the infusion
      of ascorbate. Concomitant treatment will continue for at least 6 cycles. Patients whose
      disease has not progressed while receiving gemcitabine and ascorbate and who are tolerating
      therapy may continue either single agent gemcitabine or concomitant treatment beyond 6 cycles
      at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment will be terminated with progression of
      disease. Disease will be assessed by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or MRI of the lesion
      every 2 cycles for progression.
