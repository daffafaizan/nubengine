      and, after signing the informed consent form, will perform initial clinical evaluation and
      will be randomized into two groups, being: control group (CG) and intervention group (GI) -
      using the medium-frequency alternating current. Each group will consist of 15 subjects who
      will have as dependent variables, the evaluation of the following items: peak muscle torque,
      analysis of ventilatory anaerobic thresholds, running economy and maximal oxygen consumption.

      The intervention with the NMES will be considered as an independent variable. All groups will
      have the dependent variables evaluated before and after the intervention, which will consist
      of 18 sessions (6 weeks). The NMES training will be performed 3 times a week and will never
      be applied for two consecutive days, as shown in the flowchart All individuals, being they of
      the CG or the GI will perform a running training (TC), between 15 and 40 km per week and will
      be guided how to perform them, and the GI patients will perform a muscle strengthening
      protocol with NMES, which will be carried out in a specific place and prepared for
      intervention, in addition to the TC.
