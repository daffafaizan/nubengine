      However, this technique has limitations such as dark imaging of distant lesions because of
      narrow-band illumination. Blue Laser Imaging (BLI) was developed to compensate for these
      inherent limitations of NBI. BLI uses narrow-band laser light combined with white light. This
      combination results in a bright image of the digestive mucosa, enabling the detailed
      visualization of both the microstructure and the microvasculature. However, BLI still is not
      able to obtain sufficient brightness for distant lesions. The newly developed Linked Color
      Imaging (LCI) system (FUJIFILM Co.) creates clear and bright endoscopic images by using
      short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light on the basis of BLI
      technology. This system can obtain bright endoscopic images even at a distant view because
      LCI has more intense white light than the short-wavelength narrow-band laser light.
      Short-wavelength narrow-band laser light enhances the vessels on the mucosal surface and the
      patterns of the mucosa, which means that BLI enables a clearer visualization of microvascular
      structures than does LCI. In contrast, LCI enhances differences in hue, in the red region of
      the spectrum, through digital processing. This makes red areas appear redder and white areas
      appear whiter. Thus, it is easier to recognize a slight difference in color of the mucosa.
      Therefore, LCI may facilitate the detection of H. pylori infection and gastric atrophy.
      Further studies are needed to confirm the utility of LCI.
