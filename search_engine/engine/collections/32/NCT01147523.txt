      strategy for NAFLD. Currently, the management of NAFLD includes modification of underlying
      risk factors, detection of patients that have progressed to cirrhosis, management of
      cirrhosis-related morbidity and transplantation in patients with end-stage liver disease.
      Diet, exercise, bariatric surgery and pharmacologic treatment, including weight loss agents,
      insulin sensitizers, lipid-lowering agents, ursodeoxycholic acid and vitamin E have been
      investigated with some promising results.

      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      insulin resistance (IR) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, low-dose
      (25-50 mg/day) aldosterone antagonists in patients with heart failure diminish mortality,
      possibly by reducing cardiac and vascular fibrosis. Moreover, the beneficial effect of
      spironolactone in a mouse model with diet-induced diabetes and NAFLD has been reported.
      However, to our knowledge, the role of spironolactone in NAFLD patients has not been
      investigated yet.

      The primary aim of the study is the effect of spironolactone and vitamin E versus vitamin E
      on serum levels of adipokines 52 weeks post-treatment.
