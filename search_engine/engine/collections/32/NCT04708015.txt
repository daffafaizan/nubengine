      accessed and downloaded, stripped of patient-identifying information and provided to the
      contract research organization (CRO) to review prior to sending to the Sponsor for analysis
      of glycemic control. The CRO will ensure data shared with the Sponsor is de-identified and
      transferred over a secure file transfer platform. Further, Remote Site Specialists (RSSs)
      from the CRO will work with the healthcare providers (HCPs) from participating sites to
      obtain additional patient data including medical history, prescribed diet,
      cornstarch/Glycosade use and demographic data directly, if available, from the medical charts
      and will enter this information into an electronic data capture (EDC) system.
