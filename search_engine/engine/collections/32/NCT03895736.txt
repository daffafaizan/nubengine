      (OHCA) is still highly challenging. Beyond usual neurological markers, experimental and
      clinical studies have also shown that blood levels of several cytokines or miRNA could be
      significantly different after cardiac arrest in subjects prematurely died as compared to
      survivors with a good neurological recovery. Here the investigators propose to investigate a
      screening approach assessing simultaneously multiple targets of the post-cardiac arrest
      syndrome through analysis of the whole transcriptome of patients after OHCA. For this
      purpose, the investigators will collect blood samples from 60 patients after admission at
      hospital and then 1 and 3 days later. The Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category of each
      patient will be evaluated for each patient at day 60 after cardiac arrest. At the end of the
      collection period, the blood samples will be prepared for whole genome analysis and RNA
      sequencing. The primary analysis of the investigators will be the comparison of the
      transcriptome at day 0 after cardiac arrest in patients reaching Cerebral Performance
      Category (CPC) 1 at day 60 as compared to all other patients.
