        -  Compare the efficacy of whole breast radiotherapy vs observation with or without
           optional tamoxifen in decreasing or delaying the appearance of local failure (both
           invasive and in situ) and preventing the need for mastectomy in women with good-risk
           ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast.

        -  Compare distant disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (under 50 vs 50 and over), final path margins (negative vs 3-9 mm vs at least 10 mm),
      mammographic size of primary (no greater than 1 cm vs greater than 1 cm to 2.5 cm), nuclei
      grade (low vs intermediate), and tamoxifen use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation and may receive optional oral tamoxifen once daily
           (at the discretion of the physician) for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Beginning within 12 weeks after final surgery, patients receive radiotherapy to
           the whole breast once daily, 5 days a week, for 3.5-5.5 weeks. Patients may receive
           optional tamoxifen as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,790 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
