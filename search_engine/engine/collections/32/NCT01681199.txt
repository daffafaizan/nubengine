      accepted as a valid surrogate marker for atherosclerosis. The thickness of CIMT is
      significantly associated with the presence and the extent of coronary disease. Slower
      progression of atherosclerosis as measured by carotid ultrasound is also associated with a
      lower risk of nonfatal MI. In a meta analysis, for every 0.0 1-mm-per-year decrease in
      carotid IMT, there was a significant 18% reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI. Measurement of
      carotid IMT carries the advantage of being non-invasive and easy to use with a good degree of
      reproducibility.

      Statins have been shown to slow the progression of atherosclerosis or even to induce
      regression of atherosclerosis. Change of carotid IMT by statins have been found to correlate
      with the extent of LDL-C reduction and HDL-C increase however non-lipid effects (e.g. effects
      on inflammation, calcification ) may also play a role in the beneficial effects of statins on
      atherosclerosis.Osteopontin (OPN), an acidic phosphoprotein, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a
      member of the tumor necrosis factor-a receptor superfamily, have been recently demonstrated
      to modulate vascular calcification. Recent studies have shown an association of serum OPN and
      OPG levels with cardiovascular diseases and vulnerable carotid plaque .
