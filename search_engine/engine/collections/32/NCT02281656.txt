      (intrinsic hand muscle dysfunction) compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow treated with
      ulnar nerve decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone versus ulnar nerve
      decompression with subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar nerve reverse end-to-side
      transfer. The study objectives of this project are the following: 1. To prospectively compare
      the clinical outcomes of patients with severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow who receive ulnar
      nerve decompression with subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar motor reverse
      end-to-side nerve transfer versus decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone. 2. To
      prospectively compare the electrophysiologic outcomes (nerve conduction studies and EMG) of
      patients with severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow who receive ulnar nerve decompression with
      subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar motor reverse end-to-side nerve transfer versus
      decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone.
