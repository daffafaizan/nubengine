      to16 µg/kg/d subcutaneously or intravenously for up to 6 days with apheresis collections of
      PBPC on day 5 (and day 6 if required). The product will be collected by leukophoresis with a
      goal of ≥ 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, with a minimum of 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.

      The patient will receive a preparative regimen of Alemtuzumab to be infused on days -7 to -3,
      followed by 300 cGy TBI given as a single dose on day -2. Sirolimus at a dose of 5mg/day to
      maintain trough levels between 10-15ng/ml will be started on day -1. The PBPC graft targeted
      to deliver 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (at minimum, 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) will be infused on
      day 0 On days +14, +30, +60 and +100 the chimeric status of patients will be assessed by
      microsatellite analysis of the peripheral blood. More frequent monitoring may be required.

      Sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension will meet with a Pulmonary Medicine Consult
      to determine appropriate management prior to SCT.

      Patients with fever or suspected minor infection should await resolution of symptoms before
      starting the conditioning regimen.

      Iron chelation must be discontinued > 48 hours before initiating the conditioning regimen.

      Hydroxyurea must be discontinued one day prior to initiating the conditioning regimen.
