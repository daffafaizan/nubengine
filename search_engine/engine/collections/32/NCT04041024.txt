      questionnaires. Only the main task changes from one experiment to another. Within each
      experiment, the only difference between the two parts is that the main task is performed
      while participants are being scanned in an MRI scanner. Details of the tasks are provided
      below. Each part of each experiment is performed over one visit only and is a cross sectional
      study. The visit is dedicated to the tasks. Questionnaires may be filled during the visit or
      at participant's home within the week following the visit for questionnaires which are not
      assessing participant's state. Questionnaires assessing participant's state are filled during
      the visit at appropriate time. The total number of participants mentioned below is the sum of
      the planned number of participants within each group, i.e. patients and healthy participants,
      within each part of each experiment.
