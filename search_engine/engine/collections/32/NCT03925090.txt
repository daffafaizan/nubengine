      locoregionally advanced NPC, especially for the high risk NPC (plasma EBV DNA ≥ 1500
      copies/ml), the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Although concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve the treatment outcomes of these patients, approximately
      25% of locoregionally advanced NPCs still develop relapse and metastasis.

      Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve survival and reduce
      treatment-related toxicity in NPC patients. Accumulating evidence shows that PD-1 antibody is
      effective for treating recurrent/metastastic NPC patients. This is a Phase II randomized
      trial to study the effectiveness and toxicity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant PD-1 antibody
      Toripalimab combined with CCRT versus CCRT plus placebo in treating patients with high risk
      NPC (Stage III-IVa, AJCC 8th and EBV DNA ≥ 1500 copies/ml).
