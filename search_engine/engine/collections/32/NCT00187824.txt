    
      The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness,
      and temporal changes in the activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and
      consequent immune dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ
      failure in the Intensive Care Unit.

      This study will be undertaken using sequential blood sampling (until ICU discharge) and
      muscle biopsies (to a maximum of 5) in critically ill patients (a) with or (b) without sepsis
      plus a comparator group undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. A variety of hormonal,
      cytokine, immune and mitochondrial measures wil lbe then made to assess whether any
      relationship exists between alterations in these different pathways, and whether eventual
      survivors and non-survivors can be distinguished.
