    
      Primary objectives:

      â€¢ To study the biological effects of sorafenib 400mg BID on the mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
      (ERK) phosphorylation, and to correlate with clinical activity in patients with T-cell
      lymphoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To observe the clinical activity of sorafenib 400mg BID by determining response rate,
           and progression free survival in patients with T-cell lymphoma. Duration of response and
           duration of stable disease will also be measured.

        -  To determine the tolerability of sorafenib in patients with T-cell lymphoma.

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To observe the effects of sorafenib on T-cell subsets (CD4/CD8 ratio, and Tregs), and
           the effects of sorafenib on the monocytoid population.

        -  To observe the effects of sorafenib on the serum cytokine profile.

        -  To observe the effects of sorafenib on the T-cell receptor pathway, i.e. Lck, ZAP-70,
           and Syk.

        -  To observe changes in lymph node or skin morphology including tumor cell infiltrate,
           vasculature, and the tumor microenvironment in patients treated with sorafenib by
           performing serial biopsies of lymph nodes or skin.
