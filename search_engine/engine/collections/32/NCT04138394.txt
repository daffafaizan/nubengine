      illnesses, the relationship between nutrient deficiencies, altered immune status, and
      acquired infection has been recognized for many years. More than in any other injury, the
      inflammation and catabolism associated with severe burns can exacerbate nutrient
      deficiencies, thereby predisposing patients to impaired immune function and increased risk of
      developing infectious complications, organ dysfunction, and death. We aim to conduct a
      large-scale, multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the effect of high-dose (200mg/kg/day
      x 96 hours) intravenous vitamin C in addition to standard of care (SOC) on 28-days composite
      outcome of Persistent Organ Dysfunction (POD) and all-cause mortality compared to add-on
      placebo and SOC. Patients will be allocated to 2 groups, active or control: patients in the
      active group will receive intravenous vitamin C at 200mg/kg in divided doses, every 6 hrs for
      96 hrs. Patients in the control group will receive a similar amount of placebo (either D5W or
      saline) delivered in the same manner as the vitamin C. This study will be the first large
      international multi-centre trial examining the effects of high dose intravenous vitamin C in
      burn patients. It represents a unique collaboration of burn units worldwide that is
      coordinated by the Clinical Evaluation Research Unit, based in Kingston Ontario Canada, a
      coordinating center that has demonstrated the ability to run multi-center trials and
      translate findings into practice.
