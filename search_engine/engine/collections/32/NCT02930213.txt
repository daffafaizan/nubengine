      virations in electroencephalographic patterns. In normal subjects, the circadian rhythms of
      core body temperature is close to 24 h. When the interference of environmental and mental
      elements were eliminated, circadian rhythm shows the endogenous circadian rhythm of body
      acquiescently (>24h ), which is also called free-running period.

      Measuring the continuous external auditory canal temperature of 4 unresponsive wakefulness
      syndrome (UWS) and 3 minimally conscious state(MCS) on the fluorescent lamp surrounding every
      2 hours for 168 hours starting at 00:00 on the first day to address circadian capabilities.

      Researchers expected to see the difference between MCS and UWS.
