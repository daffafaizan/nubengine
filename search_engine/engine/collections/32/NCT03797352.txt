      due to rising life expectancy at birth combined with declining total fertility, and an
      epidemiological transition in the main source of disease burden from communicable and
      infectious conditions to non-communicable, chronic conditions. While acute care will always
      remain a crucial component of healthcare delivery systems, the increased healthcare burden
      centered on chronic diseases and the concomitant aging population is putting increased strain
      on healthcare resources. Frailty is reversible and progression to dementia can be delayed.
      From most recent study, prevalence of pre-frailty is 37% and mild cognitive impairment about
      15-20%. WHO's definition of healthy ageing is maintaining functional ability. Cognicise, a
      dual task exercise has shown to delay decline in cognition and there are many studies which
      shows aerobic exercise improves endurance. Patients seen in Geriatric, Medicine Clinic or
      polyclinics who are prefrail, frail but ambulant with / without cognitive impairment will be
      randomised to dual task exercise with/without cognitive stimulation therapy and health
      education. In addition, high protein diet has been shown to improve muscle protein synthesis.
      Therefore, the aims of the study are to assess: a) Assess the effectiveness of dual task
      exercise with/without cognitive stimulation therapy b) Effect of health education alone for
      delaying the progression to dementia and mobility decline c) Assess impact of exercise on
      inflammatory and bone health biomarkers eg IL, TNF, Osteocalcin, sclerostin and C telopeptide
      in a subgroup of older adults randomly selected.
