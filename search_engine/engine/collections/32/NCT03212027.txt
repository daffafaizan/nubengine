      biological tissue. The quantification of diffusion is described by the apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC),which largely depends on the number and separation of barriers.Thus, ADC
      can provide information regarding tissue microstructure.

      According to the literature, ADC is also related to cell membrane permeability for water
      molecules.It is well known that cellular water transport depends on aquaporins (AQPs).In
      general,the expression of aquaporins might differ in several pathologic disorders. With
      reference to this fact,we hypothesize that AQPs expression may influence ADC in thymic
      epithelial tumors(TETs).Therefore,the aim of the present study is to analyze possible
      associations between ADC from ultra-high b-values and AQPs expression(ADCuh) in TETs and to
      use ADCuh to identify the pathological type of tumor.
