      Primary

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine
           hydrochloride when administered with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy
           in patients with advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with irinotecan
           hydrochloride. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride in these patients.
           (Phase I)

        -  Assess overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the time to treatment failure, duration of response, and time to response in
           patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      followed by a phase II, open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8,
           oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
           Courses repeat every 21 days.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride at the MTD determined in phase I
           and capecitabine and oxaliplatin as in phase I.
