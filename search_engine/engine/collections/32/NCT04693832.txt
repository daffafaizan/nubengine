      While these protocols increase recovery rates, they may also cause some undesirable side
      effects. Nausea and vomiting is one of the most common toxic side effects associated with
      chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to develop an interactive mobile application and to
      investigate the effect of this application on the management of nausea and vomiting symptoms
      by using it during chemotherapy treatment.

      The study will be conducted with 61 children between 8-18 years of age who received
      chemotherapy in Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Clinic at Trakya University Health Research and
      Application Center. The study was planned as a randomized controlled study. Data will be
      collected with the "Information Form" and "Rhodes Adapted Rhodes Nausea and Vomiting Scale
      for Children". The interactive mobile application will be downloaded to the phones of the
      experimental group and the this device will be used from the first chemotherap' day to the
      seventh day. While the experimental group evaluates their nausea and vomiting via mobile
      application twice a day, every 12 hours during one week, the control group will record the
      their nausea and vomiting experiences in the "Nausea and Vomiting Diary". While the
      experimental group will be able to use the mobile application which consists of diverting
      attention, routine control will be applied to the control group.
