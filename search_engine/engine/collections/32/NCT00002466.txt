      peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors or Ewing's sarcoma treated with cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and ifosfamide, followed by surgery (if feasible) and
      radiotherapy. II. Determine the response to a uniform treatment regimen in order to clarify
      whether these disease categories each have a different prognosis.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease category (primitive neuroectodermal
      tumor vs Ewing's sarcoma). Patients receive treatment on regimen A as outlined below during
      courses 1-3 and 6 and regimen B as outlined below during courses 4, 5, and 7 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Each course lasts 3-4 weeks. Patients
      without metastatic disease after completion of course 3 undergo complete tumor resection, if
      feasible. Patients achieving complete response with or without microscopic residual disease
      after completion of course 7 undergo radiotherapy twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks.
      Patients with gross residual disease after completion of course 7 undergo radiotherapy twice
      daily, 5 days a week, for 3.6 weeks. Regimens A and B are defined below: Regimen A: Patients
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 2, doxorubicin IV continuously and
      vincristine IV continuously on days 1-3, and vincristine IV on day 9. Regimen B: Patients
      receive etoposide IV over 1 hour, followed immediately by ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days
      1-5. Patients are followed monthly for 18 months and then every 6 months for 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 5 years.
