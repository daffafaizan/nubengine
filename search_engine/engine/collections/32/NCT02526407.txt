      at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital as a psychosocial tool to reduce the occurrence and
      effects of postnatal depression. It triangulates psychological, physiological, and biological
      data in a randomised control design to provide a comprehensive insight into the
      intervention's effects in comparison to a more common psychosocial intervention for new
      mothers (play groups) and a control group of no psychosocial interventions. The study aims to
      recruit 50-80 women into each of the three interventions (150-240 total).

      The study will used a mixed-method methodology comprising validated psychological scales,
      in-depth qualitative interviews and observations and biomarker analysis. If results are
      promising, there are plans in place to scale the singing intervention to more hospitals and
      community settings.

      Phase B will be open to NHS sites within the region of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
      London from which women could travel to the sessions to take part.
