      30% of MDD patients are resistant to antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an
      FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only
      30-40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown
      that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but
      biomarkers for informing target site selection do not exist. Diagnostic heterogeneity has
      been an obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an
      approach to diagnose four novel MDD subtypes or "biotypes' defined by resting state
      functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns and predicting differing antidepressant responses at
      the individual level to rTMS. This pivotal trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment
      selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of
      responding to left DLFPC vs.DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1)
      the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific cerebral network
      targets comprising Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets
      can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405; 203 from this site)
      will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC;
      b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm
      receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 hertz (HZ) rTMS targeting the left DLFPC,
      regardless of biotype. All patients will be assessed before and after treatment on a battery
      of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of
      a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment
      resistant depression.
