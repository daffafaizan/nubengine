    
      Clinical protocol:

      Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts: (i) sepsis defined as suspected infection
      and systemic inflammatory response, (ii) septic shock defined as sepsis plus hypotension, and
      (iii) control defined as non-infected patients without systemic inflammatory response.

      Methods:

      Plasma levels of mtDNAs were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      Levels of mtDNAs were compared among each group, and linear regression was used to assess the
      association between mtDNAs, IL-6, TNF a and IL-1b in patients with sepsis. The correlation
      between plasma mtDNA and severity, systemic inflammation and outcomes will be analyzed.
