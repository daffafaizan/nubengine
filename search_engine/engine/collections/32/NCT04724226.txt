      cryoablation combined with Camrelizumab and Apatinib (C-couple Therapy) in patients with
      advanced HCC. Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Camrelizumab and
      Apatinib after cryoablation until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death,
      withdrawal of the patient or the researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.

      The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of C-couple
      Therapy for advanced HCC (BCLC C-stage). The secondary outcome measures include the duration
      of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival rate (PFSR) in 6-
      and 12-months, overall survival rate (OSR) in 6- and 12-months, the median progression-free
      survival time (mPFS) and median overall survival time (mOS) of C-couple Therapy for advanced
      HCC. This study also aims to assess the safety and adverse reactions of C-couple Therapy for
      advanced HCC.
