      progression free survival, and one year survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with prinomastat (AG3340) or placebo in combination with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin. II. Compare the disease response and duration of response in these
      patients on these regimens. III. Compare the quality of life of these patients on these
      regimens. IV. Evaluate the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      receive oral prinomastat or placebo twice daily beginning on day 1, followed by gemcitabine
      IV on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 420 patients will be accrued for this study.
