      production upon ingestion of similar meals. Since many of these microbiome-derived
      metabolites have enteric and systemic biological effects, these variabilities could in part
      account for the different responses to meals and diets.

      This project thus aims to improve the understanding the relationship between gut microbiome
      composition and the nature of dietary metabolites produced from similar bioactive
      precursor-rich meals.

      The investigators therefore propose to characterise the circulating microbiome-derived
      metabolite profiles in healthy individuals fed the same 2-day precursor-rich Mediterranean
      diet prior to and after a 2-week of habitual Canadian diet feeding.
