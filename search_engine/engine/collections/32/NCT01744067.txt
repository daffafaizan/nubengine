      acids in renal transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant
      recipients.

      This study is a randomized double blinded placebo controlled interventional study of 132
      Norwegian renal transplant recipients. It will investigate, on the one hand, the effect of
      omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and, on the other, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on
      cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.

      8 weeks after transplantation, if renal function has stabilized, patients with a eGFR>30 will
      be randomized to receive either 2,7 g eicosapentaenoic plus docosahexaenoic acid (3 capsules
      of Omacor a 1 g) daily or placebo. Baseline measurements will be performed before they start
      taking the study medication. The same measurements will performed again1 year after
      transplantation and the patients stops taking the study medication.
