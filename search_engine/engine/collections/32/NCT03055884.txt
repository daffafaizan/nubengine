      and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language. It is not only
      important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is
      impacted by aging and by Alzheimer×³s disease. For decades, neuroscientists have investigated
      associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and
      memory.

      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical
      stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some
      studies. Previous research has also emphasized the importance of repeated retrieval practice
      as a way to accelerate learning and enhance associative memory performance. Therefore, this
      study will examine the effect of repeated retrieval practice on associative memory
      performance by using two versions of an associative memory task.

      To investigate whether it is possible to accelerate learning and improve associative memory
      using tDCS and repeated retrieval practice, the performance in a Verbal Paired-Associate
      memory task during the first visit and 1 week after will be compared for four study groups.
      The first group will get active tDCS during a version of the verbal paired-associate learning
      task with repeated retrieval practice. The second group will get active tDCS during a version
      of the verbal paired-associate learning task without repeated retrieval practice. The third
      group will get sham tDCS during a version of the verbal paired-associate learning task with
      repeated retrieval practice and the fourth group will get Sham tDCS during a version of the
      verbal paired-associate learning task without repeated retrieval practice.
