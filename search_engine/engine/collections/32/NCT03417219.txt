      intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically translatable through mobile media
      devices (i.e., tablets), on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. Intervention effects
      will be examined longitudinally at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.

      Advanced statistical techniques will be used to determine the impact of the intervention on:
      quality of life in caregivers of Veterans with dementia (Aim 1), perceived stress and
      depressive symptoms in caregivers (Aim 2), and socialization and engagement in pleasant
      activities in caregivers (Aim 3).

      If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach to
      Veteran- and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff,
      resource, and cost burdens.
