      consectutive days. The accumulation of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI at the site of stricture will be
      determined by standard uptake value (SUV), molecular volume (MV), and total molecular index
      (TMI). In patients with a planned surgical resection of one or more stricture (s), the image
      results will be compared with histological findings.
