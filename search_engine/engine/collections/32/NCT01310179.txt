      with cancers primarily in the throat and neck and then give them the drug. This study is
      designed with two goals in mind: 1) assessing the overall safety of this approach for the
      patient; and 2) observing the effects of this anti-cancer strategy on the tumor itself. This
      will be accomplished in two parts. First, we will introduce a modest, fixed amount of the
      gene-carrying adenovirus into the tumors of three separate groups of patients and then
      administer small, increasingly strong amounts of the fludarabine phosphate to each successive
      group over a three-day period. Even in the group that will receive the highest amount of
      fludarabine, the total amount given to any individual patient over those three days will be
      significantly less than the dose approved by the FDA for patients with non-solid tumors.
      Finally, a more concentrated amount of the adenovirus (approximately 10 times more viruses)
      will be given to a fourth group of patients who will also receive the highest dose of the
      drug that was shown to be well tolerated in the prior three groups (the highest dose at which
      no serious problems were observed).
