      today. These diseases are also some of the most painful eye disorders. Two important areas
      for research on the cornea are 1) to explore and understand the molecular basis of corneal
      transparency and 2) to analyze the molecular nature of corneal inflammation and wound
      healing. We have developed a new clinical device to understand molecular changes that occur
      in the lens, called Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) device. Studies have shown its potential
      in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in the cataract, and have also shown good
      test retest reproducibility of the system. We now would like to apply this technique to study
      changes that occur in corneal opacification. In this pilot project, we would like to study
      the normal cornea in young and older persons (volunteers) as well as cloudy, opaque corneas.
      This will allow us to determine if useful data can be obtained, and if so, lead to further
      studies in various corneal disorders caused by trauma, infections, and dystrophies, as well
      as those caused by systemic or inherited disorders.
