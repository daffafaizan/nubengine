        1. determine if family dyads randomly assigned to either a brief or extensive family-based
           program of care have better proximal and distal outcomes from both a clinical and
           economic perspective than dyads randomly assigned to usual care

        2. determine if the brief or extensive program of care has a differential effect on patient
           and caregiver outcomes depending on the patient's baseline risk for distress status
           (high versus low).

      A longitudinal, randomized clinical trial is being used for patients with advanced lung,
      colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer and their caregivers.
