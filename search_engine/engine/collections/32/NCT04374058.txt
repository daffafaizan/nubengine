      Health Organization, is a rapidly evolving pandemic. The outbreak is expected to infect a
      large portion of the world population, and a case fatality rate of 1-3% represents a
      significant mortality and healthcare burden. In common with other viral diseases, mortality
      is higher in elderly patients with high comorbidity.

      The impressive figures of transmission in different communities underline the need for
      reorganization of efforts to limit contagion, particularly in crowded settings. Hemodialysis
      centres represents a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the
      same area at the same time.

      Dialysis patients constitute a susceptible population because of their older age, high
      comorbidity burden and their less efficient immune system. Therefore, they are more prone to
      develop severe infectious diseases than the general population.. Moreover, if infected, the
      requirements of specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for
      isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under additional strain.
      Therefore, all measures to slow and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be
      taken very seriously.

      The routine treatment usually requires three dialysis sessions per week Further, some
      patients must travel long distances to the dialysis centre. One option to reduce the higher
      risk of these patients is to reduce the frequency of dialysis sessions.However, the potential
      benefits of reduced risk may be associated with higher interdialytic weight gain and
      inadequate dialysis, Two factors that increase the risk of mortality. Furthermore, the impact
      of reduced frequency on Anemia and Nutrition have not been extensively studied.
