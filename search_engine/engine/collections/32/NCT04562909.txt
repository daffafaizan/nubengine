      premature babies has increased significantly in recent years. Neurodevelopmental
      abnormalities increase as birth weight and gestational week decrease and the presence of
      adverse biological conditions add up. Brain structures involved in fine motor control, such
      as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, amygdala, and hippocampus, are smaller in
      babies born preterm, even without premature brain damage. Many of the problems associated
      with these in children are often difficult to detect at an early age, so numerous symptoms
      may not be detected until school age. In this sense, making periodic assessments of the
      progress in each child's motor development is essential to identifying deficiencies and thus
      facilitates referral to early intervention programs.
