    
      A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled. The study consists of a screening period of up to 28
      days prior to initial treatment, followed by two double-blind treatment periods, each 12
      weeks long. A final follow-up visit or phone contact for safety is planned one week after the
      conclusion of Period 2.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a blinded, balanced (1:1) fashion to receive either
      25 mg BPN14770 capsules or matching placebo capsules during Period 1, followed by the
      opposite treatment during Period 2. One capsule will be taken twice daily during both
      double-blind periods.

      Subjects will return to the clinic at the end of Weeks 2, 6, and 12 of each study period.
      Cognitive and behavioral evaluations will be repeated at Weeks 6 and 12 of each Period.
      Additionally, patients will be monitored for adverse events via a telephone call at the end
      of Week 1 of each Period, and one week following completion of Period 2 or following early
      discontinuation.

      During clinic visits, adverse effects will be assessed, and laboratory measures, vital signs,
      and ECGs will be performed. Suicidality risk will also be evaluated at each clinic visit; if
      a concern is detected, the subject will be referred for further evaluation and treatment.
      Cognitive and behavioral assessments will be performed during each clinic visit.
      Pharmacodynamic measures of CNS function will be obtained to evaluated effects of the drug in
      the brain. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected to confirm that study drug is present
      and to estimate plasma exposure at Week 12 of each Period.
