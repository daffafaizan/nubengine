      asymptomatic, it may be related to bothersome or debilitating symptoms, such as uterine
      bleeding and pelvic pain or pressure. The standard treatment is surgical (hysterectomy or
      myomectomy), but there has been continued interest on medical treatments. Progestagens have
      long been used to control bleeding associated to leiomyomas, but they have not been able to
      decrease myoma volume. GnRH analogs are well stablished agents, capable of controlling
      symptoms and decreasing the tumorsÂ´volume, but their use is limited by bone loss and
      menopausal symptoms. A newly introduced progestagen, dienogest, has been studied to treat
      endometriosis, but its effects on leiomyoma are only starting to be assessed. The
      investigators are aiming to compare dienogest with the GnRH analog goserelin and the
      progestagen desogestrel in a randomized trial to see how this new treatment compares with
      previously used drugs and whether it is similar, inferior or superior to them on controlling
      leiomyoma associated symptoms and decreasing leiomyoma volume.
