      targeting human PD-L1 and 4-1BB. This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and
      cohort expansion phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ES101 in patients with advanced
      malignant solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or who has no
      further standard therapy, or who is unsuitable for available standard treatment options.
