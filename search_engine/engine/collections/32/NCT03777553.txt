      Therapy for Justice Involved Veterans (VETNET) in a pilot sample of justice-involved Veterans
      with PTSD, with a particular focus on obtaining data on feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention in a justice-involved veteran population, and determining what further
      adaptations are needed to tailor this intervention to justice-involved Veterans (JIV). The
      investigators are also interested in evaluating whether the intervention has the potential to
      have an effect on key clinical outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      symptoms, as well as on measures of moral injury, anger, depression, suicidality, and
      aggression.

      The following Specific Aims have been developed for this project:

      Aim 1: Evaluate study feasibility and treatment delivery procedures of Narrative Exposure
      Therapy for Justice Involved Veterans (VETNET) in justice-involved Veterans (JIV) with PTSD.
      Data gathered will include recruitment rates, drop-out rates, adverse event frequency and
      severity, and participant engagement in treatment. As necessary, identify further adaptations
      that are needed to tailor this intervention specifically to JIV.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of VETNET on PTSD symptoms, as well as on related outcomes
      including moral injury, anger, depression, suicidality, and aggression.
