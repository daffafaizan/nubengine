      cancer type in middle-aged (30-54 years) females and males, respectively, and the incidence
      has six-doubled during the last 30 years. Median survival for patients with metastatic
      melanoma is 6 months.

      Many agents have been investigated for anti-tumor effect in melanoma, but there is no
      accepted standard therapy. Biochemotherapy, combining cytotoxic drugs with Interleukin-2 or
      Interferon alpha, has not been shown to be superior to single agent Dacarbazine (DTIC), which
      is regarded to be the most active agent. Other biological approaches like vaccination are
      currently under investigation, but still no efficient treatment for metastatic melanoma is
      available. DTIC induces objective remission in 20% of the patients, but without significant
      impact on survival.

      The need of a new and effective treatment for the group of melanoma patients is urgently
      needed. This will be the first study to assess response rates of bevacizumab monotherapy in
      first line treatment of metastatic melanoma. In addition there will be a major focus on the
      identification of predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab efficacy.
