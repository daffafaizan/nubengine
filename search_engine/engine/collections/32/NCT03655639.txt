    
      The broad long-term objective is to use comprehensive state-of-the-art, high-fidelity
      monitoring to investigate physiological biomarkers of autonomic neurorespiratory maturation
      with integrated analysis of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses in preterm infants, and
      to evaluate their role in ventilatory instability, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and
      co-morbidities including neurodevelopment in the 1st year of life. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will
      establish the spectrum and developmental trajectory of ANS maturation/function using
      high-resolution physiologic recordings of ventilatory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular
      measures during typical daily activity (28, 32 and 36 weeks (wks) post-menstrual age (PMA)(up
      to 24-hour recordings) and at 3 and 12 months (mos) corrected age (CA)(4-hour recordings).
      Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that individual and integrated metrics of ANS function will
      demonstrate maturational patterns that impart resilience or vulnerability to environmental
      challenges. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will determine respiratory and neurodevelopmental morbidity
      throughout the 1st year of life using clinically applicable outcome measures and associate
      morbidity with ANS development and function using a Respiratory Morbidity Severity Score
      (RMSS), need for respiratory support, medications, or hospitalization, Bayley Scales of
      Infant Development III (6, 12 mos), Neurological, Sensory, Motor, Developmental Assessment
      (NSMDA)(3, 6, 12 mos), and early measures of evoked-auditory potentials (EAP)(28, 32, 36 wks
      PMA; 3, 12 mos CA) and General Movement Assessments (GMA)(28, 32, 36 wks; 3 mos). Aim 2 tests
      the hypothesis that infants demonstrating delayed ANS maturation or vulnerability to
      endogenous challenges will require more respiratory interventions and will demonstrate
      developmental delays in the 1st year of life. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will determine endotypes of
      autonomic neurorespiratory stability and maturation through trajectory analysis and
      integrated physiological modeling. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that trajectory analysis will
      reveal 3 autonomic maturation patterns [1) "normal" maturation with ability to withstand
      environmental perturbations; 2) "normal" maturation without ability to withstand
      environmental perturbations; and 3) delayed or disordered maturation with inability to
      maintain physiologic stability in absence of environmental perturbations] that will be
      associated with severity of respiratory morbidity and neuromotor impairment at 1 year. This
      novel approach will establish the role of autonomic neurorespiratory maturation in stability
      of oxygenation throughout the 1st year of life, provide insight into BPD pathogenesis, allow
      prospective identification of at-risk infants, and permit development of mechanism-specific
      interventions with potential to impact thousands of families and billions in healthcare
      cost/year in the U.S., alone.

      In addition to lung-independent mechanisms of respiratory dysfunction, this study aims to
      investigate lung-independent mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Typically thought to
      be a secondary effect of primary lung structural development and/or hypoxia, up to 40% of
      infants with chronic respiratory dysfunction develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) and
      increased risk for mortality. However, we and others found that 10-30% of premature infants
      who develop PH did not have clinical evidence of respiratory dysfunction, suggesting
      pulmonary vascular mechanisms that are independent of clinically apparent respiratory
      disease. Multiple molecular mechanisms are postulated by which hypoxia results in PH, but
      preliminary data from our group and others suggest a role for Fibroblast Growth Factor 2
      (FGF2) and FGF receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR1, FGFR2) signaling in the development of pulmonary
      vascular remodeling in PH. Thus, by serially using sensitive echocardiographic measures of
      Right Ventricular-Pulmonary Arterial (RV-PA) coupling, we can quantify hypoxic exposure and
      RV-PA axis dysfunction and we will couple these clinical measurements of FGF2 signaling. We
      hypothesize that recurrent hypoxic exposure of dysmature pulmonary vasculature in premature
      newborns results in RV-PA axis dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension that is mediated by
      FGF2 signaling and is independent of clinically apparent lung disease.
