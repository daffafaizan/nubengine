      realm of conventional medicine, which are yet to be validated using scientific methods". It
      encompasses a wide variety of behavioral (meditation, and spiritual practices) and clinical
      (herbal, acupuncture, and massage) techniques. Patients with chronic diseases including
      cancer tend to be very interested in these treatments and research involving CAM and their
      ability to improve quality of life are needed.

      Women transitioning from active treatment for breast or ovarian cancer to surveillance
      (QOL-T) can experience physical and psychological distress, related to both treatment
      (fatigue, alopecia, and menopausal symptoms), and the diagnosis itself. Intervention during
      the critical time of transition from active therapy to follow-up may help patients to adjust
      to life after cancer treatment.

      Essiac has been documented to be a popular form of herbal treatment in patients with cancer.
      Given its lack of reported side effects, we are interested in pursuing a formal evaluation of
      a Essiac in capsule formulation (ESIAK) in women surviving breast or ovarian cancers to
      evaluate its role in improving the overall quality of life following chemotherapy that often
      accompanies the end of adjuvant therapy.
