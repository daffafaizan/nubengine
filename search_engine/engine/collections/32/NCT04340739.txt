    
      The objectives are:

        1. To create a wireframe version of the Group Integrative Mindfulness over the Internet
           (GEMINI) website, based on feedback from previous projects, for further beta testing.

        2. To engage 8 patients with chronic pain in a focus group or individual meeting (utilizing
           the video-conferencing tool, Zoom) to obtain feedback on the wireframe version of GEMINI
           through a usability test and qualitative, semi-structured interview (Cohort 1).

        3. To create a prototype of the GEMINI system, using all previously collected feedback data
           (mentioned above), for further beta testing with both patients and providers.

        4. To engage 16 patients with chronic pain in focus group(s) to collect feedback on the
           patient portal side of the tool, through holding a non-intervention, GEMINI telehealth
           session using the prototype website. No personal health information (PHI) or medical
           record data will be collected or recorded during this faux session (Cohort 2).

        5. To engage 8 health care providers in evaluating the provider portal through asking them
           to conduct a GEMINI telehealth session with study staff role-playing as chronic pain
           patients (Cohort A).

        6. To end the project with a tested, active prototype of the GEMINI chronic pain
           management/education/telehealth tool.
