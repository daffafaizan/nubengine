      moment is the mRNA-based BNT162b2 and is given to Hospital employers.

      The investigators undertake this observational study to monitor antibody evolution after
      vaccination in a hospital setting. The primary endpoint is serum IgM and IgG at the first
      month of 2nd jab, and at 3, 6, and 12 months afterward.

      As secondary measures, nasopharyngeal swabs are included, at fortnight intervals to detects
      the spike protein antigen, in the event that putative vaccine inefficacy would expose the
      health personnel to Covid-19 disease with potential spreading to inpatients.

      Further, clinical signs and symptoms are monitored at the weekly interval in the context of
      adverse reactions/events.
