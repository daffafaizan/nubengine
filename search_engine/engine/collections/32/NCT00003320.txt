      surgical bed following excision of cerebral metastases, as an alternative to whole brain
      irradiation. II. Measure the local relapse rate at the surgical site after surgery and
      stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with cerebral metastases. III. Measure the regional
      relapse rate, in the brain but away from the treated site, following treatment in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo surgical removal of their cerebral metastases followed by
      adjuvant fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy daily for 5 days. Patients are given up to 5
      weeks following surgery to recover and reach the required performance status. Radiotherapy
      must commence within 6 weeks of surgery. Patients are followed at 2 weeks after treatment,
      monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for the next 18 months, every 6 months for the next
      year, and then annually for years 3-5.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-40 patients accrued into this study.
