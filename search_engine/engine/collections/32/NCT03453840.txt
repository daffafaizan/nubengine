      HIV-infected children on EFV-based ART and HIV-uninfected children not on ART. AL is the
      first-line treatment for malaria in Uganda. No change in standard of care treatment will be
      made for the purposes of this study except for the extension of AL to 5-day dosing. This
      study will enroll a) HIV-infected children, and b) HIV-uninfected children. All participants
      may be enrolled through Tororo District Hospital (TDH) or Masafu General Hospital (MGH) in
      Busia, or other referral centers the area. we will use a design where children will be
      randomized to either 3-day or 5-day AL and then for subsequent episodes of malaria, should
      they occur. Conservatively, assuming each enrolled child participates for only a single
      episode of malaria, up to 60 (30 HIV-infected on 3-day and 30 HIV-infected on 5-day) and 100
      (50 HIV-uninfected on 3-day and 50 HIV-uninfected on 5-day) subjects will be enrolled for
      each of the intensive study groups. Up to 100 (50 HIV-infected on 3-day and 50 HIV-infected
      on 5-day) and 120 (60 HIV-uninfected on 3-day and 60 HIV-uninfected on 5-day) subjects will
      be enrolled for each of the population study groups. Comparisons of AL PK exposure will be
      made among and between a) HIV-infected children with malaria receiving EFV-based ART and b)
      HIV-uninfected children who are not on ART. Comparisons will be based on an intensive PK
      design for AL area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) estimations. Population PK study
      will be combined with intensive PK studies to allow for optimal PK-outcomes assessments.
