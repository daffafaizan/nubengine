      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high-grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia, and early squamous cell carcinoma) in order to establish new
      molecular biomarkers with potential for early detection and surveillance of the disease using
      the minimally-invasive Cytospongeâ„¢ cell collection device. Firstly, tissue samples after
      endoscopic treatment (endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection) for
      squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and early squamous cell carcinoma will be analyzed with
      the use of the next-generation sequencing to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers.
      Afterward, patients with- and at risk- of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma will be
      recruited to undergo a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies (the gold standard) and Cytosponge
      procedure. The diagnostic accuracy of Cytosponge coupled with molecular biomarkers will be
      evaluated to compare with the gold standard.
