      Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). INSTILADRIN is a non-replicating adenovirus
      vector harboring the human IFN alpha2b gene. When combined with the excipient Syn3,
      intravesical administration of the rAd-IFN results in transduction of the virus into the
      epithelial cell lining in the bladder. The IFN alpha2b gene is incorporated into the cellular
      DNA resulting in the synthesis and expression of large amounts of IFN alpha2b protein.
      Clinical studies have confirmed that IFN alpha2b protein can be measured in the urine of
      patients treated with INSTILADRIN within 24 hours after dosing.
