      and the ability to make correct decision.

      Medical staff are at increased risk of getting 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome'(SARS), and
      wearing N95 masks is highly recommended by experts worldwide. However, dizziness, headache,
      and short of breath are commonly experienced by the medical staff wearing N95 masks. The
      ability to make correct decision may be hampered, too. The purpose of the study was therefore
      to evaluate the physiological impact of N95 mask on medical staff.
