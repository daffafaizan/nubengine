    
      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients
      with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC).

      Patients must either 1) have completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CTORZYNPC001 study
      or 2) meet the eligibility criteria of this study including a requirement of stable treatment
      with miglustat for 6 months (if on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment into the study.

      Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to
      placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed
      best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat.

      Randomisation:

      Patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio of
      1:2).

      Pharmacokinetic evaluation(age below 12):

      To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will undergo an arimoclomol
      single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation before randomisation and the start of continuous
      (multiple dosing) treatment.

      Early Escape Clause:

      In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the "early escape
      clause" will allow the Investigator to apply the escape route which implies that the patient
      can be treated with arimoclomol (as per blinded phase study schedule) and be followed up on
      an annual basis until arimoclomol has received EU MA or until the analysis of data from the
      controlled, 12 month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety
      of arimoclomol.

      Study duration:

      The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12 months.

      Following this, all patients will be offered to continue into the extension phase of the
      study where every patient will receive arimoclomol and be followed up and attend site visits
      at 18 months and 24 months (after randomisation) and then on an annual basis thereafter.The
      extension phase runs until arimoclomol has received Regulatory Approval or until the analysis
      of data from the controlled, blinded phase 12 month study period does not support the
      efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.

      The CT-ORZY-NPC-002 protocol has been updated to include a paediatric sub-study including new
      and naïve patients aged 6 to <24 months at study enrolment.

      Aim:

      The purpose of the paediatric sub-study, is to assess the safety and tolerability of 36
      months of open-label arimoclomol when administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's
      current prescribed best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include
      miglustat.

      The Paediatric sub-study will run at the open sites participating in the main study. A total
      of 3-5 patients are planned to be enrolled. All patients will be treated with arimoclomol.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of NPC1 or NPC2;

                in both alleles of NPC1 or NPC2, OR

             -  Mutation in only one allele of NPC1 or NPC2 plus either positive filipin staining
                or elevated cholestane triol/oxysterols (>2 x upper limit of normal).

             -  If a patient has been discontinued from prescribed treatment with miglustat, they
                must have been discontinued for at least 1 month prior to inclusion in the
