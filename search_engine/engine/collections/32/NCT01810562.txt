      of the brain. It is important for rehabilitation to take advantage of this compensatory
      qualities whit early intervention and mobilization. Only small gains can lead to big
      improvements.

      About half of stroke survivors gets reduced sensibility caused bye the stroke, and
      sensibility is considered to be an important part of rehabilitation of function and
      activities.

      A Norwegian guideline concludes that the scientific knowledge is to week to recommend this
      kind of treatment. There is some evidence for improvement of sensibility when specific
      training and stimulation is given. Achievements in sensibility can lead to some improvement
      in function.

      The project will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial. In this project, the
      intervention group receive tactile senses stimulated twice daily over a period of 3 months,
      while the control group receives standard treatment. The results from both groups are
      measured before and after treatment.
