      intervention sessions focused on HIV risk reduction. Small groups will consist of 10 men who
      will meet once-a-week for 8 consecutive weeks. Each meeting will last approximately 2 hours.
      In each small group session, staff will work with men to reassess their HIV risk behavior,
      re-prioritize their goals as appropriate, and provide motivational support for their risk
      reduction accomplishments. Participants will be asked to discuss ways they have successfully
      avoided HIV risk behavior since the previous session, as well as to discuss situations in
      which they found it difficult to avoid risk. Staff will reinforce successful risk avoidance,
      and problem-solve with men to overcome barriers to risk reduction.
