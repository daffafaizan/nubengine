      I. Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of induction therapy comprising
      cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab followed by consolidation
      therapy comprising docetaxel and bevacizumab, in terms of grade 4 or 5 hemorrhage, in
      patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      II. Determine response (confirmed, unconfirmed, partial, and complete) in patients with
      measurable disease treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (high*
      vs low).

      NOTE: *High-risk stratum closed to accrual as of 2/20/09.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients in each stratum are assigned to 1 of 3 sequential treatment
      groups.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36
      and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients undergo concurrent thoracic
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive cisplatin, etoposide, and thoracic radiotherapy as in group 1.
      Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 15, 36, and 57.

      GROUP 3: Patients receive cisplatin, etoposide, and thoracic radiotherapy as in group 1.
      Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, all
      patients receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover OR
      pegfilgrastim SC once on day 2.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed
      periodically for up to 4 years.
