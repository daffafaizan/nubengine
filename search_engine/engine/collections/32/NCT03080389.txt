      found via PCR and extended urine cultures, there is a microbiome that exists within the
      urinary bladder. In this study, 92% of the bacteria failed to be identified by a standard
      urine culture but 80% were identified with extended urine cultures. In further explorations
      of the significance of this microbiome, Pearce, Meghan et al. found that the female bladder
      consists of increased abundance of bacteria in patients with UUI; including Gardnerella and
      Lactobacilus gasseri. Then in 2015, a study by Thomas-White, Krystal et al. found that
      patients with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) who responded to treatment with Solifenacin had
      fewer and less diverse communities of bacteria when evaluated by PCR and extended urine
      cultures.

      The clinical significance of the bacteria identified is not well understood. However, these
      studies show that the presence of bacteria is being missed by standard cultures. Dune et al.
      found that of patients with UTI symptoms, 27.5% were standard culture negative but extended
      quantitative urine culture positive. This demonstrates that practitioners may be overlooking
      urinary tract infections in patients with frequency and urgency. Therefore, if bacteria
      within the urine can be detected with extended cultures, can this technique be used to
      improve detection and treatment of urinary infections in patients with symptoms of frequency
      and urgency?

      The hypotheses states that extended urine cultures are more sensitive in the identification
      of urinary tract infections in patients with symptoms of urgency and frequency. The secondary
      hypothesis is that treatment of the uropathogen identified on extended urine cultures will
      improve patient symptoms.
