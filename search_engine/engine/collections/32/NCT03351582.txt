      a parent has died from cancer between 2013 and 2015. This will be a randomized controlled
      trial where participants are assigned to one of three groups using a random number sequence
      generated by a computer program with approximately 25 families in each intervention group.

      Group one will meet with a family therapist for one 90 minute session where the main focus
      will be on providing information through psychoeducation on grief and communication to
      participants.

      Group two will participate in a family therapy intervention comprised of three 90 minute
      sessions. participants will receive the same psychoeducation as group one and will also work
      with the family therapist to enhance family communication and process their grief. The 3
      sessions are manual based.

      Group three will be the control group and will not meet with a family therapist.

      Participants will be asked if their sessions with the family therapist can be tape-recorded,
      but do not have to consent to this in order to participate. Approximately 6 participants need
      to be recorded in order to ensure that the family therapists are covering the same topics and
      giving the same information to all participants. In this way we can ensure that the method of
      intervention is the same no matter which therapist is delivering the intervention thereby
      validating the method of intervention.

      Follow up will occur 1 month and 6 months after the intervention has ended. Each participant
      will fill in a short questionnaire regarding grief and Communication. Validated instruments
      will also be included in the questionnaire.
