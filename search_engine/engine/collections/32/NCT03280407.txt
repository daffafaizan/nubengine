      rectum is preoperative radio-chemotherapy and in the upper part initial surgery. The clinical
      benefit from radio-chemotherapy is primarily through a reduction in local relapse but the
      treatment is associated with acute toxicity and long term functional dysfunction.
      Subsequently, it is important to select patients with high risk of local relapse. Intense
      systemic combination chemotherapy reduces the risk of distant relapse and increases survival
      in the postoperative setting. The biological rationale is eradication of micrometastases and
      hence it may be anticipated that earlier, i.e. neoadjuvant, combination therapy may improve
      systemic control.
