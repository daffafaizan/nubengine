    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin in patients with resectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer who
      are undergoing surgery.

      II. Determine the rates of R0 resection in patients treated with this regimen before surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the
      resectability in the subsets of patients defined as resectable preoperatively and treated
      with this regimen.

      III. Determine improvement in survival associated with downstaging based on metastatic
      colorectal prognostic score in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      V. Correlate drug-specific biomarkers with clinical response in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral
      capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Surgery: Four to six weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgical
      resection of the tumor.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients with satisfactory response to therapy receive 4 additional
      courses of oxaliplatin and capecitabine after surgery.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks after surgery, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
