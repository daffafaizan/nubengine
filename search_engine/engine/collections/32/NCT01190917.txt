      symptoms affecting individuals with ASD, treatments targeting social skills have been the
      subject of few controlled investigations. The available literature suggests that cognitive
      behavioral techniques are commonly used and may improve targeted social skills in individuals
      with ASD. However, drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of social skills treatment
      remains difficult, particularly with respect to maintenance of skills and generalization to
      natural settings, owing to methodological limitations of extant studies (e.g., small sample
      size, lack of manual-based curricula, minimal assessment of generalization or maintenance).

      Several neuroimaging studies have found that individuals with ASD underactivate key brain
      regions involved in social cognition. However, there is also evidence to suggest that factors
      that increase attention to or interest in social stimuli are associated with more normal
      brain activity.

      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the acute and sustained effects of social
      skills treatment on social cognition and the neural architecture that supports it.
      High-functioning children with ASD will be randomly assigned to a 12-week cognitive
      behavioral social skills group or a social play-based therapy group. For both types of
      groups, a parent session will be held concurrently. Functional MRI scans as well as
      behavioral assessments of social cognition, adaptive functioning, and symptom severity will
      be acquired at baseline, immediately following treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up.
