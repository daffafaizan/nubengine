      disease (GVHD). The impact of ocular GVHD on quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic
      GVHD has been studied in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, observational study and
      showed that ocular GVHD affects 57% of patients within 2 years of chronic GVHD diagnosis.
      Strong evidence suggested that ocular GVHD is associated with worse overall health-related
      QOL. Significant worsening of vision-related QOL in ocular GVHD has been reported. Ocular
      GVHD is devastating and there is no effective treatment available so far. The importance of
      this study is that for the first time in the nation, our institute will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of topical autologous blood product (PRP and PPP) to treat ocular surface
      disease associated with ocular GVHD.
