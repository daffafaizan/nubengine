    
      This multi-site study involves a sequence of trials (Pre-Post -> Effectiveness ->
      Implementation 3) to examine our primary, secondary and exploratory objectives.

        1. Pre-Post trial (secondary objective) - Screening for Opioid User Disorder (OUD) will be
           integrated into Mental Health Disorder (MHD) screening and electronic health record
           (EHR) data will be used to determine if screening improves the detection of new cases of
           OUD during the first six months of the trial compared to the six months prior.

        2. Cluster randomized Effectiveness trial (primary objective) - The primary objective of
           the trial is to test the effectiveness of delivering (Medication for OUD) MOUD in the
           context of Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) for MHD, hereafter termed the
           "intervention" compared to CoCM for MHD only hereafter termed the "control". All 24
           sites have previously partnered with the AIMS Center to implement CoCM for MHD. After
           monitoring CoCM for MHD fidelity during a three month "run in" phase, the investigators
           will categorize clinics into one of two cohorts and then randomize them.

             -  Cohort 1 (n=600) - Randomize clinics with high CoCM for MHD fidelity to
                sequentially adding MOUD for OUD (intervention group) or maintenance CoCM for MHD
                only (control group).

             -  Cohort 2 (n=600) - Randomize clinics with low CoCM for MHD fidelity to simultaneous
                implementation of CoCM for MHD and OUD (intervention group ) or CoCM for MHD only
                (control group).

        3. Cluster randomized Implementation trial (exploratory objective) - At the end of the
           Effectiveness trial, the intervention clinics will be randomized to receive a
           low-intensity or high-intensity implementation strategy to promote sustainability
