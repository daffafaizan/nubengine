    
      Chiropractic care is a commonly used therapeutic intervention for the treatment of pain
      disorders, and some smaller studies have shown that it might be helpful for migraines. This
      pilot study will use a comprehensive model of chiropractic treatment which can include soft
      tissue mobilization, spinal manipulation, and postural and spinal stabilization and
      correctional exercises.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim #1 - Determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) of
      chiropractic care in adult women with migraine.

      Aim #2 - To provide preliminary data on the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic care on
      migraine frequency, severity, duration, and medication use in adult women with migraine.

      Aim #3 - To provide preliminary estimates of the effects of chiropractic on disability,
      health-related quality of life, and psychosocial well-being.
