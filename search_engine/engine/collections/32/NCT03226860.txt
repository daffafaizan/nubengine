      palsy (HCP). Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has the potential to improve strength
      and functional gait for children with HCP. The investigators hypothesize that a new FES
      system stimulating the dorsiflexor (DF) and plantarflexor (PF) muscles alternately at the
      correct time during gait, would lead to a significant improvement (p<.05) in foot contact,
      gait symmetry and balance, compared to 12 weeks of a healthy lifestyle program called 5210.
