    
      This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a hardware/software system designed to
      integrate in-home sensors and devices, social connection, and Internet-of-Things (i.e.,
      devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create
      a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and people with dementia. The
      system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia (e.g., wandering), and targets
      mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with
      dementia with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is
      designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform
      for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of
           caregiving (lower burden, higher mental and physical health, higher well-being) than
           those in the limited home safety condition.

        2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.

        3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.
