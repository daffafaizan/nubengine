    
      The present study is designed to assess whether treatment with vaporized cannabis or
      dronabinol (oral Î”9-THC) reduces spontaneous and evoked pain more than placebo, and whether
      there are any differences between the two active treatments in terms of interference with
      activities of daily living. This study also aims to examine the effects of vaporized whole
      plant cannabis and dronabinol on mood, neuropsychological function, and psychomimetic
      side-effects (high, stoned, etc.) compared to placebo and to each other. In addition, we plan
      to examine the acute effects (after receiving stable treatment for 4 weeks) of vaporized
      cannabis and dronabinol compared to placebo and each other on driving skills.
