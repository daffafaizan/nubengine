      (HCT) is dependent upon stable T-cell engraftment and the success of this therapeutic
      approach is likely to be greatest when directed against a minimal rather than gross tumor
      burden. To this end, tandem transplants with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (AHCT) for tumor cytoreduction followed by non-myeloablative
      allotransplant have been conducted. In myeloma, this tandem approach results in greater
      efficacy compared to conventional AHCT.
