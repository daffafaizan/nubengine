      cumulative long-term risk of 20%-30% for colectomy. Remission rates following induction with
      corticosteroids and 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) range from 20% to 50%. 5-ASA is still
      regarded as first line induction and maintenance therapy for mild to moderate UC in both
      children and adults. 5-ASA is also indicated for maintenance therapy following successful
      induction with corticosteroids for moderate to severe disease. Still, steroid free clinical
      remission at 1 year under 5-ASA maintenance therapy is reported to range from 40% to 50%.
      Management of recurrent flares while taking 5-ASA medications involves repeated courses of
      corticosteroids and changing therapeutic regimes to include more potent medications such as
      thiopurines which carry an increased risk for significant adverse effects. Hence, improving
      efficacy of induction and maintenance treatment is of critical importance. Curcumin, an
      active phytochemical substance with anti-inflammatory properties was studied extensively
      in-vitro and in experimental models of colitis. In the only randomized controlled trial,
      performed in adults with quiescent disease, curcumin was shown to be an effective concomitant
      treatment (along with 5-ASA) for maintenance of remission. Therefore, our aim is to assess
      the efficacy of concomitant curcumin maintenance therapy for induction and maintenance
      therapy in pediatric UC patients with mild to moderate in a prospective randomized, placebo
      controlled trial. We hope that this study will further contribute to the understanding of the
      potential benefits of curcumin in pediatric UC patients.
