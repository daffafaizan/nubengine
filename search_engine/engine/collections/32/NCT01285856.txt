      will be recruited in accordance with the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki,
      during consultations at a center for addiction treatment. One hundred and ten patients will
      be included in each of the two populations. Written informed consent will be obtained from
      each patient. Anonymity will be respected at inclusion and throughout. Using a sample of
      hair, testing for and measurement of the principal drugs (opiates, cannabis, cocaine,
      amphetamines) and the specific marker of ethanol consumption, ethyl glucuronide, will be
      performed by chromatographic techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography and gas phase
      chromatography) together with detection by mass or tandem mass spectrometry. This
      non-invasive sampling is more informative than blood tests, as it gives a retrospective
      profile of an individual's consumption over several months. Treatment efficacy will also be
      assessed using Handelsman's subjective and objective opiate withdrawal scales. Lastly,
      polymorphisms of the metabolic enzymes of methadone and HDB will be sought by real-time PCR
      in a saliva sample, a method which gives similar results without the need for venous blood
      sampling.
