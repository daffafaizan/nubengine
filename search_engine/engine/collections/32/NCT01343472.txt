      is a program targeting high-risk parolees in Seattle, and is modeled after the HOPE program
      in Hawaii. The purpose of the evaluation is to test whether subjects assigned to WISP perform
      better than those assigned to parole-as-usual (PAU) on a number of outcomes, including drug
      use, missed appointments, recidivism, prison and jail stays, and parole revocations. WISP
      uses regular random drug testing and close community supervision, paired with swift and
      certain, but modest sanctions for every detected violation.
