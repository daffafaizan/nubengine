      numerous substances that act on the smooth muscle fibers. The release of these products is
      modulated, in turn, by various circulating molecules, by autonomic nervous system and by
      local mechanical factors such as shear stress.

      The type 2 diabetes leads to early vascular redesign with the onset of endothelial
      dysfunction and the worsening of the arterial stiffness.

      These anomalies, well correlated with the cardiovascular risks, are currently investigated in
      the department of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition at the Jean Verdier Hospital. The
      analysis methods allow identifying early modifications in response to various drugs,
      nutritional or physical stimuli.

      The aim of this study is therefore to evidence a peripheral microcirculation and endothelial
      function improvement in type 2 diabetic patient in comparison to a cross-over control
      session.
