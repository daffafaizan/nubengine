      internal jugular vein (OOP-IJV) and in-plane supraclavicular subclavian vein (IP-SSV)
      catheterization.

      For OOP-IJV cannulation, the transducer was placed on transverse position over the patient's
      neck at the level of the cricoid cartilage to identify IJV and carotid artery (CA) in
      short-axis view. The vein was then centered on the screen. The skin puncture was made in the
      center of the US image using a needle attached to a syringe. The needle was introduced at an
      angle of 60° to the skin surface, perpendicular to the transducer, and advanced under
      real-time US guidance toward the IJV until visualizing the tip of the needle inside the vein.

      For IP-SSV cannulation, a short-axis view of the IJV was obtained first. The probe was slid
      caudally following the IJV until the junction of the subclavian vein (SCV) and IJV was
      reached in the supraclavicular fossa. The probe was then turned slightly and tilted
      anteriorly to get the best long-axis view of the SCV and the brachiocephalic vein (BCV).

      Using an in-plane approach, the needle attached to a syringe was inserted at the base of the
      transducer at a 30° angle and advanced strictly under the long axis of the US probe from
      lateral to medial. The needle point was then guided under real-time US guidance targeting the
      SCV.

      In both groups, catheterization was done through Seldinger technique.
