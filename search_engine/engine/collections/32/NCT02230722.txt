      efficacy of a Collaborative Care intervention in which one of two Care Managers delivering
      both interventions will assist primary care providers (PCPs) by using Motivational
      Interviewing to communicate computer-based ATHENA-OT (opioid therapy) decision support
      guidelines to veterans with chronic pain. Specifically, after honing the intervention, the
      investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of Collaborative
      Care/Motivational Interviewing in 100 veterans (ages 18 and older) with chronic pain in
      primary care who are prescribed opioid pain medications and exhibit at least one "high-risk"
      opioid use behavior (e.g. obtaining early opioid refills, etc.). Using ATHENA-OT decision
      support, PCPs will make guideline-concordant recommendations to all enrolled study patients
      and initiate a Pain Care Plan. Veterans randomized to Collaborative Care, will have one MI
      session with their assigned study Care Manager followed by 3 Care Manager-delivered telephone
      MI/monitoring sessions; patients randomized to the Attention Control arm will have one brief
      session with their assigned Care Manager, followed by 3 Care Manager-delivered neutral
      telephone sessions
