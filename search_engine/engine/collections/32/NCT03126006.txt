      inflammatory disease of the soft tissues surrounding the tooth. It was demonstrated that
      periodontitis among pregnant women is significantly associated with preterm birth and low
      birth weight. Pakistan has a high prevalence of these adverse birth outcomes therefore;
      identifying an intervention is of prime importance and may have social and economic benefits.

      Non-surgical periodontal therapy is affordable and amenable to people and thus seems to be an
      intervention which may prove to be of benefit in a population where the dental services are
      available. It has been recommended in systematic reviews and Meta analysis that Randomized
      Controlled Trials are now required to establish whether the removal of inflammatory factors
      by scaling and root planning are effective in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes such as
      preterm birth and low birth weight.
