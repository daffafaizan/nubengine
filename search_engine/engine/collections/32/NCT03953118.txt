    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double masked trial of the effectiveness of oral
      azithromycin in treating symptomatic dry eye syndrome secondary to Meibomian gland
      dysfunction. Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a persistent feeling of ocular discomfort that
      encompasses dryness, irritation, foreign body sensation and burning. In the United States, it
      is the most common non-refractive cause of visits to eye care providers, and has been shown
      to have a significant impact on quality of life of patients who suffer from this condition.
      most common cause of DES is Meibomian gland disease (MGD). In the vast majority of cases, MGD
      is not binding, but rather causes persistant ocular discomfort.

      Oral antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines and macrolides, are frequently prescribed
      for the treatment of MGD. There is little good-quality evidence to support this practice.
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of oral azithromycin on patient-reported
      dry eye symptoms. Concomitantly, we will also study the composition of the ocular surface
      microbiome in MGD, and its response for oral antibiotics.
