      I. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 10-week application (app)-based
      intervention.

      II. To assess the impact of the intervention on depressive symptoms, spiritual well-being and
      quality of life.

      III. To examine the content of participants recorded narratives for salient themes related to
      weekly content areas (e.g. identity, meaning-making, hopes, fears) in order to better
      understand the unique experiences and challenges of adolescent and young adult (AYA)
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo Talking Pictures social media intervention for 10 weeks, receiving
      weekly assignments via email with requirements to use the Pixstori app to take and upload
      photographs with verbal narratives attached to a website. Participants can then share their
      pixstories to a group page and view and respond to others' pixstories.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 2 months.
