      Primary

        -  To estimate the rate of distant metastasis at 3 years in patients who have undergone
           transurethral resection of the bladder tumor for stage II or III muscle-invasive bladder
           cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising fluorouracil, cisplatin, and
           radiotherapy vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and radiotherapy followed by selective bladder
           preservation and adjuvant chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the treatment completion rate in these patients.

        -  To estimate acute and late grade toxicities (â‰¥ grade 3 genitourinary, gastrointestinal,
           and hematologic toxicities) of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To estimate the efficacy of these regimens, in terms of achieving complete response of
           the primary tumor, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the efficacy of these regimens, in terms of preserving the native,
           tumor-free bladder 5 years after completion of therapy, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the value of tumor histopathologic, molecular genetic, DNA content,
           metabolomic, and proteomic parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for
           initial tumor response and recurrence-free survival.

        -  To analyze for American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom scores at baseline and at 3
           years from patients on both arms.

        -  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for cystectomy-free survival.

        -  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for acute and late toxicities.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor stage (T2 vs
      T3-4a). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
