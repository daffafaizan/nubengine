      attention deficit. However the correlation between the severity of sleep disturbances and the
      degree of cognitive dysfunction was not demonstrated.We intend to study 80 patients with
      various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. All patients will undergo executive cognitive
      tests as well as tests to assess for levels of depression, anxiety and attention.
