      characterized by acute lung injury and hypoxemia, affects up to 10% of pediatric intensive
      care unit (ICU) patients and has a mortality rate of 18-27%. Because children who survived
      PARDS are still developing, long-term morbidities are highly relevant, although data on the
      outcomes of PARDS survivors is lacking. Previous studies were limited by their sample size,
      were outdated in PARDS management strategies, and used the adult ARDS diagnostic criteria.
      Some studies focused on pulmonary function but not on other patient-oriented outcomes such as
      respiratory symptoms, mental health issues, quality of life, and health care resource use,
      all of which have been identified as prevalent issues in adult ARDS survivors. Recently,
      adult studies have identified 2 distinct ARDS subphenotypes with differential responses to
      treatment using clinical and limited biological data, providing insight on the
      pathophysiology of ARDS. Whether these phenotypes are present in PARDS is unknown.
      Furthermore, integrating newer technologies such as transcriptomics in the identification of
      subphenotypes may improve our understanding of disease mechanisms. Finally, delays in ARDS
      diagnosis are common and compliance with current ARDS ventilation management guidelines is
      poor, ranging from 20-39% even in patients selected for clinical trials. Thus, novel methods
      such as decision support systems may play a role in the diagnosis and management of PARDS
      patients, although this remains to be evaluated.
