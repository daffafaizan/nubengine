      challenge for emergency physicians. Over eight million chest pain patients present annually
      and despite promising advances in diagnosis, over four percent of ACS patients are mistakenly
      discharged home. While the history and physical, cardiac risk factor assessment, ECG, and
      cardiac marker determination are all included in the assessment and risk stratification of
      patients presenting with possible ACS, this assessment is clearly far from perfect. Improved
      rapid and accurate means of assessment in this population in the ED are clearly needed.ED
      patients with chest discomfort will be screened and approached for study enrollment.
      Consenting patients meeting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.
      Point-of-care serial cardiac marker measurements will be performed. Based on a web-based
      computerized randomization system, half (50%) the patients willundergo routine central
      laboratory testing only. Half (50%) of the patients will undergopoint-of-care markers
      performed in the ED in addition to routine central laboratory testing.In this second group,
      central laboratory test results will be blinded from the ED physicianuntil the disposition
      time. BNP will be blinded and not reported to physicians for the first 500 patients (Phase
      I). After the first 500 patients have been enrolled, an interim analysis will be performed to
      determine the clinical utility of BNP in patient assessment. After physician education of
      these results, the trial will resume for the remaining 500 patients (Phase II). In Phase II,
      BNP levels will be provided to the physicians using the same time and randomization
      format.The patients and their medical records will be followed for a period of thirty days
      and sixmonths after enrollment.
