      very poor prognostic factor for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. We hypothesize that
      additional EBV DNA confirmation test could enhance diagnostic sensitivity of relapse
      detection and predict survivals.

      We screened 706 newly diagnosed NPC patients who finished curative RT with or without
      chemotherapy from March 2001 to December 2012. Additional EBV DNA blood test was performed at
      re-staging survey 2-3 months after RT. The association between treatment outcome (tumor
      relapse and patients' survival) and this additional blood test along with various clinical
      parameters were analyzed.
