      that includes a non-thrust force applied to the low back region, has an impact on patient
      centered-outcomes. Rehabilitation Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) will be used to determine MF
      muscle thickness (MT) at rest and during a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) immediately
      following application of the manual procedure.
