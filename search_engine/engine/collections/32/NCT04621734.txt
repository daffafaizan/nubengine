      provider at the time of nasoenteric tube placement. The tape will be placed around the tube
      and secured to the cheek on the side of tube. The tape will be replaced as needed per nursing
      discretion when soiled or the adhesive properties are failing and this information will be
      tracked. The AMT BridlePro will be placed by the nurse or provider at the time of nasoenteric
      tube placement. Placement will use the BridlePro system included in the individual BridlePro
      packaging. Placement and securement will follow manufacturer recommendations and teaching.
      The BridlePro encircles the vomer bone of the nasal cavity to secure the tube. Sedation
      medication may be given per standard of care for nasoenteric tube placement at the discretion
      of the provider team but no separate or additional sedation medication will be given for
      securement with adhesive tape or the BridlePro.
