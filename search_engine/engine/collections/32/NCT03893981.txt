      proprioception. There are studies showing that proprioceptive deficit is associated with the
      onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis leading to pain and disability. Because the
      proprioception provides a sense of power generation and allows the power output to be better
      regulated. When the literature is examined, studies investigating the effects of
      proprioception and balance exercises on muscle strength, function and pain are limited.

      In our study patients will be randomly divided into two groups: Group I (Proprioception and
      Balance) and Group II (muscle strengthening exercises). While Group I will be applied
      Proprioception and Balance training exercises, Group II will be applied closed and open
      kinetic strengthening exercises. Two group will perform exercise 3 times a week during 8
      weeks.
