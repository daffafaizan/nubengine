    
      Pre-clinical data on human skeletal muscle cells and mouse Type 2 diabetes model have shown a
      blood glucose lowering effect of the plant-based hydrolysates.

      The first objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a once daily administration of
      2 different cereal protein hydrolysates versus placebo, when consumed over a 12-week period,
      at reducing the preferred outcome measure identified by the European Food Safety Authority
      i.e. glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in pre-diabetic volunteers who are otherwise healthy
      subjects.

      The second objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a fixed daily administration
      of 2 different cereal protein hydrolysates versus placebo, when consumed over a 12-week
      period on further supportive measures like Post-prandial glucose/insulin levels, fructosamine
      level, fasting plasma glucose level, vital signs and blood pressure, weight and BMI.
