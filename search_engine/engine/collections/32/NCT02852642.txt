      mineral density, muscle volume, functional capacity and will show some improvement in their
      gait, as well as in their quality of life. Purposes: the main objective of this study was to
      propose a training model based in the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action and
      assess its effects on selected parameters of musculoskeletal morphology, functional capacity
      and quality of life of elderly women.
