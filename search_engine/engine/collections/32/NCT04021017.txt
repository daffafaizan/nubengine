      other than improving body mass. Transdermal estrogen is being investigated as to whether it
      has benefit to bone health parameters.

      While numerous studies have sought to orally replace estrogen in adolescents and women with
      AN, the replacement therapy suppresses IGF-1, and as a result oral estrogen studies have
      demonstrated no bone health benefit in AN. However, transdermal physiologic estrogen, due to
      no first-pass metabolism in the liver, is not IGF-1 suppressive. IGF-1 is known to be hormone
      that directly affects bone formation and is considered to be osteoanabolic (helps increase
      bone mass).
