      be divided into two groups. Experimental group will receive a particulated mixture of
      autogenous and lyophilized bovine bone, stabilized with a collagen membrane and pins over the
      vertical and/or horizontal defect, while Control group will receive a bone block graft,
      stabilized with fixation screws , covered with lyophilized bone and a collagen membrane.
      After a period of nine months, the volume increase will be measured trough the difference
      found between the initial computerized tomography and the final computerized tomography.

      Dental implants will be placed according to the prosthetic need and bone cylinders will be
      removed from the respective location. The cylinders will be histologically analysed in order
      to verify the quality of the graft osteointegration. After the prosthesis installation, the
      implant survival and the soft and hard tissues will be followed up for a minimum period of 24
      months.
