      aggravated and for disabling motor symptoms from severe motor fluctuation and dyskinesia in
      patients with Parkinson's disease. The study investigators experienced several open label
      cases who were benefit from intravenous amantadine in their parkinsonian motor symptoms and
      freezing of gait as well. In addition, there is a pilot open label trial in parkinsonian
      patients with refractory freezing of gait which showed marked benefit in patients with
      Parkinson's disease, but not in patients with parkinson-plus syndromes.

      This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous amantadine in both
      levodopa-unresponsive freezing of gait and disabling off state freezing of gait in patients
      with Parkinson's disease.
