      enrolled in each cohort (i.e., Single-Patient Cohorts). The initial patient will receive
      CPX-POM at a starting dose of 30 mg/m2. Doses will be escalated (doubling), until a â‰¥Grade 2
      toxicity (with the exception of alopecia), is encountered. Subsequently that and all
      subsequent cohorts will follow a classical "3 + 3" dose escalation design.
