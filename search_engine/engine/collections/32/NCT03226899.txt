      safety (with particular focus on renal and cardiovascular events) and efficacy of lesinurad
      200 mg QD in combination with an XOI for up to 24 months compared with XOI monotherapy, in
      participants with gout and moderate renal impairment who have not reached target sUA levels
      (<6.0 mg/dL) on an XOI alone.
