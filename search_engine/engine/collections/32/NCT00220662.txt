      with eating disorders, as evidenced by frequent treatment drop-out, refusal, and relapse.
      This research examines the efficacy of a 5-session intervention designed to enhance readiness
      and motivation for change in individuals with anorexia nervosa. A manualized treatment
      protocol of Readiness and Motivation therapy (RMT) has been developed. It is hypothesized
      that individuals randomly assigned to RMT will have improved readiness and motivation for
      change as assessed using the Readiness and Motivation Interview (RMI) at post-treatment,
      3-month, and one-year follow-up than individuals assigned to a no treatment control
      condition. If RMT proves to be effective, it could be added to the menu of treatment options,
      to permit for better tailoring of treatment to client readiness for change.
