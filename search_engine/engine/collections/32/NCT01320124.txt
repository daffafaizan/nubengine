      primary total knee arthroplasty. It is expected that about 1.3% of people will develop a
      contracture post arthroplasty. A second sample will be taken from those that require surgery
      for release of contracture or revision. We will study histological characteristics and
      compare gene expression between the primary sample and the contracture sample in the same
      patient. In order to determine whether intrinsic genetic factors influence the develpment of
      joint contractures in the osteoarthritis population, all specimens will be analyzed for
      differential gene expression between patients with and without knee contractures post
      arthroplasty.

      The remaining capsule tissue not used for this study will be banked and made available to
      other researchers.
