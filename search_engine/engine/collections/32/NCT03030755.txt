      characterize. Weakness in the cornea is thought to be one of the primary causes of corneal
      ectasia, a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Corneal weakness is also important to
      identify in refractive surgery candidates since such surgeries often involve tissue removal
      that could lead to corneal instability in certain predisposed patients.

      In this study, subjects will undergo imaging with an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based
      system to characterize corneal biomechanical properties. In addition, computational
      representations of the eye will be built from images and interventions will be simulated and
      compared to actual treatment outcomes. No investigational procedures or study-specific
      interventions other than imaging are involved.
