      (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing); clarification that blood samples for both
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma will be collected for repository
      storage; revision of volume of whole blood samples to be taken for parasitemia assessment;
      clarification that urine pregnancy tests will be conducted for all females and not just those
      of childbearing potential; deletion of visit at Day 1 post day of challenge; clarification
      that RNA sequencing and not deep sequencing will be performed in this study.

      Note that as a result of internal change in data standards terminology, the study data
      collected was converted to cDISC and the statistical analysis plan was amended accordingly.
      "Day 0" in the study design was replaced by "Day 1"; consequently, "Day n" was replaced by
      "Day n+1". Thus, the timeframes (Day 0, Day n) of Outcome Measures described in this study
      record are different to that denoted in the full protocol document posted.
