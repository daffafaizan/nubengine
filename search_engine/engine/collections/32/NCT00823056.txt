      indicate that probiotics might have an effect in preventing common infection diseases in
      children.

      Our hypothesis is: if young healthy children in the age of 6 month to 15 mdr. has a daily
      intake of a suspension containing probiotics( BB12 and TH4) in a period of 9 months, the
      incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced.
