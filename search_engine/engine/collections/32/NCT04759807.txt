    
      The study design is as follows

      Informed Consent: Before any study specific procedures are conducted or study requirements
      are expected of a patient, the patient must review and sign an IEC-approved informed consent
      form.

      Screening: Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study within 28
      days before randomisation (i.e. TP1, Day 1).

      Treatment Periods:

      Period 1: On Day 1 all subjects who are eligible for entry into the study will be randomised
      to 1 of 3 treatment sequences and receive either placebo or the lowest nominal dose of
      PUR1800 (PUR1800 250 μg) for 14 consecutive days.

      Period 2: Following a washout period of at least 28 days after the completion of Period 1
      dosing, subjects will receive a treatment other than what the subject received during Period
      1 for 14 consecutive days.

      Period 3: Following a washout period of at least 28 days after the completion of Period 2
      dosing, subjects will receive the treatment that the subject had not received during Periods
      1 or 2 (either placebo or PUR1800, 500 μg) for 14 consecutive days.

      End of Study (EOS): Subjects will return to the study site 28 days after the last dose of the
      last TP (or in the event of early withdrawal after the last dose received, if possible) for
      an EOS visit. Unscheduled visits are permitted at the discretion of the investigator.
