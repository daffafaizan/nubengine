      close 12 mm camera port sites and 12 mm stapler port sites upon completion of a robotic
      assisted laparoscopic gastric bypass. The procedure requires a 12 mm port site be placed in
      the midline approximately 3 cm cephalad to the umbilicus and a second 12mm port site in the
      right mid abdomen. Port sites will be closed as defined as the inability to palpate a fascial
      defect and the incision being air tight upon carbon dioxide insufflation.
