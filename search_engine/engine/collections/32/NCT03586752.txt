      cost-effective CPR training model. The training proctors will either instruct laypersons or
      healthcare providers to watch on-line video for 18 minutes at home then practice the skills
      for 30 minutes in the training scene or provide standard CPR program (90 minutes in the
      scene) and empower them with the life-saving skills of CPR. The American Heart Association's
      CPR with a DVD and laerdal QCPR manikin will be used to record. Participants will be randomly
      allocate into either the on-line or standard method of the training program. To assess the
      effects of training, the participants will receive written examinations before and after the
      course. The investigators will also follow up with the study participants and conduct CPR
      skills tests at 6 and 12 months from the time of training to assess whether the subjects
      retain their skills or if they have an opportunity to use the skills that they learned.
      Information about the willing of performing CPR and satisfaction to the training will also be
      collected.
