      and evaluated the capability of this detecting system. Samples of feces, blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid (the remainder of routine testing samples) from 500 children with
      suspected or confirmed enterovirus infection were examined using the CRISPR technique. To
      evaluate the CRISPR-enterovirus detection system, real-time PCR and traditional PCR as
      comparison method was implemented. The method of real-time PCR and traditional PCR were used
      to detect enterovirus and analyze the genotypes of enterovirus, respectively. According to
      the results of CRISPR-enterovirus detection system and the comparison method, the positive
      coincidence rate, negative coincidence rate and consistency of the two methods were
      calculated. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of the CRISPR-enterovirus detection
      system for detection of enterovirus were calculated.
