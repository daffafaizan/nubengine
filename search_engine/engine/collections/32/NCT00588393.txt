      folate receptor targeted therapies are being developed to target cancer cells that
      over-express the folate receptor. As with other targeted therapies, it is important to
      develop diagnostic tests that will provide accurate information on folate receptor status and
      aid in selecting patients that may benefit from folate-targeted therapy.

      EC20 concentrates in the extremities and liver and spleen of rats with adjuvant induced
      arthritis. The increased uptake is mediated by overexpressed folate receptor on macrophages,
      and the intensity of the uptake is greatly reduced by addition of excess folate, supporting
      the specificity of the uptake. Depletion of macrophages greatly reduced folate receptor and
      abolishes uptake of EC20. This suggests that EC20 may be useful in assessing macrophage
      involvement in the active inflammatory process of RA, and perhaps other systemic immune
      mediated disorders as well.

      FolateScan may allow the clinician to get accurate real-time data on receptor binding, in a
      less invasive manner, at all actively inflamed sites throughout the treatment regimen. This
      kind of information may help the physician make better clinical decisions regarding therapy,
      including folate targeted therapies.
