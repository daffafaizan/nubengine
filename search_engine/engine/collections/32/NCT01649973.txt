      enrolled and they will be randomly allocated into one of 4 groups; T10, T8, T6 or T4. The
      height of operating table will be adjusted prior to commencement of anesthesia induction to
      place the patient's forehead at one of four anesthesiologist's dermatome levels (T10, T8, T6
      or T4) depending on the group. The best laryngeal views will be graded before and after the
      anesthesiologist's postural change to improve laryngeal visualization of the patient during
      intubation. Subjective and objective measurement of anesthesiologists' joint flexion during
      intubation and discomfort ratings for the mask ventilation or intubation will be recorded.
