      patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are randomized at
      a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either Favipiravir 1600 mg twice a day (BID) on Day 1 followed by
      600 mg BID on Days 2-14 (1600/600 mg), or Favipiravir 1800 mg BID on Day 1 followed by 800 mg
      BID on Days 2-14 (1800/800 mg), or SOC.

      At the pivotal stage: additional 270 eligible patients are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either Favipiravir (the dose regimen depends of the subject's weight) or SOC.
