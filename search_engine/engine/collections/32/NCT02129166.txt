      procedures.

      Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcoholic beverages (24 hours), grapefruit products,
      herbal supplements/teas, and over-the-counter medications (48 hours) prior to the study
      visits. There will be two study periods in this study. During each period all the subjects
      are outpatients and there will be no overnight stay. During each study period, the subjects
      will come to the University of Florida Clinical Research Center (UF CRC) three times: on Day
      -1, Day 1, and Day 2, respectively. Subjects will report to the UF CRC the day before Day 1
      (i.e. Day -1) to have clinical lab test and urine pregnancy test (female only). Subjects will
      come to UF CRC at 6:30 a.m. on Day 1 and Day 2 of each study visit. During the morning of
      each study period (around 8:30 am) subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single
      oral dose of dasatinib 20 mg either with or without a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg
      administered one hour prior to dasatinib. After the first study visit, the subjects will
      return one to two weeks later for the second study visit, receiving the opposite treatment.
      The treatment order for the study visits will be assigned randomly. The end point measures
      for this study are plasma concentrations of dasatinib. A total of twelve (12) blood samples
      will be collected for a total amount of 84 ml (about 3 ounces or about 6 tablespoonsful) for
      each subject during each study period.
