      provides benefit to subjects with CLL in advanced stage or progressive disease. The primary
      objectives of this study are to assess response rate to the agent, as well as the safety in
      CLL, using different doses: Overall response (OR), complete response (CR) and partial
      response (PR) will be determinate according to the NCI criteria.

      The secondary objectives are to determine: duration of response, time to progression, overall
      survival, and the range of doses in which efficacy is seen and MTD not reached.

      This study will be done in parallel with other phase I-II studies conducted by Immunomedics.

      The study design will take into account that the high levels of circulating CD74expressing
      cells in CLL may affect both the acute (although probably not long term) toxicity and the
      efficacy of the study medication. This could translate to a different MTD and a different
      cumulative dose of Milatuzumab, needed to achieve response.(either a higher dose or longer
      treatment period.).

      The study will be divided into two treatment phases. In the first phase we aim to address
      whether the dose of 120 mg/m2 is effective in CLL, and also if it is safe. In the second
      phase we will assess the safety and possible efficacy of higher doses, in those patients that
      did not achieve a significant response in the first phase. This will be done by gradual dose
      escalations, not to exceed 600 mg, or the MTD reached in other studies.

      In addition, the study will aim at gaining further understanding of the effect of Milatuzumab
      on the biological in-vitro function of CLL cells.
