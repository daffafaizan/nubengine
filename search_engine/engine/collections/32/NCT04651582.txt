      the transfer of one cognitive training program to maintained cognition and everyday function.
      100 participants will complete three traditional assessments of cognitive, psychosocial, and
      lifestyle assessments on a study-provided laptop at baseline, post-test, and three-month
      follow-up. Across this study period, participants will complete daily cognitive,
      psychosocial, and health assessments using a study-provided smartphone. Between baseline and
      post-test, participants will be randomized to one of two arms: cognitive training or an
      active control. Both groups will complete 20 hours of activities on the study-provided laptop
      across a ten week period.

      A subsample of 40 participants will also complete three additional measures. First, they will
      be provided a FitBit and be asked to wear the FitBit across the study period. Second, sleep
      measures will be obtained across two nights at baseline and post-test using an at home sleep
      monitor, which is clinically approved, and evaluated by a physician specializing in sleep.
      Finally, this subsample will also complete a fMRI session at baseline and posttest.

      Except for the fMRI sessions, all data collection is complete remotely within the
      participants' homes.
