      water and soil habitats that exhibit high levels of intrinsic multi-drug resistance. They are
      recognised opportunistic human pathogens capable of causing chronic pulmonary disease
      (MABS-PD), predominantly in individuals with underlying inflammatory lung diseases

      Finding the Optimal Regimen for Mycobacterium abscessus Treatment (FORMaT) is a platform
      trial evaluating microbiological, functional, radiological and quality of life outcomes of
      currently used antibiotic therapies along with health care costs and cost effectiveness for
      treating MABS PD in all age groups in both Australia and Internationally.

      We aim to build an iterative, experimental clinical trial platform with adaptive properties.
      This will include two different cohorts recruited; an observation cohort and intervention
      cohort. Multiple treatment combinations will be evaluated in people with MABS-PD
      (intervention cohort) investigating different MABS subspecies, and strains with macrolide
      resistance. The platform will enable future novel treatments to efficiently enter the trial
      as they become available. The trial platform will include the current standard of care as a
      comparator arm; as evidence is accumulated new comparators may be incorporated. The trial
      platform will facilitate the evolution of optimal management for MABS lung disease with the
      primary outcome of microbial clearance with tolerance.
