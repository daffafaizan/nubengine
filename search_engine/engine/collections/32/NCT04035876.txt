      inclusion criteria. After screening and enrollment, patients will be administrated
      camrelizumab 200mg q2w iv and apatinib 250mg qd po regimen every 4 weeks as a cycle. Each
      patient will receive camrelizumab treatment for at least 2 cycles and discontinue
      camrelizumab 5 weeks before liver transplantation. Apatinib will be discontinued 1 week
      before liver transplantation. Once the tumor progression was detected, the program will be
      terminated and the appropriate optimal treatment will be given. The objective remission rate
      (ORR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), time to progress (TTP) and any
      adverse effect during the study will be evaluated in order to assess the primary effects and
      safety of camrelizumab (SHR-1210) plus apatinib for downstaging/bridging of HCC before liver
      transplantation.
