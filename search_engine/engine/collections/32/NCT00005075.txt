      device in providing control of disease for at least 12 months after treatment in patients
      with stage I or II prostate cancer recurring after external beam radiotherapy. II. Determine
      the safety of this treatment device in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. A probe is inserted into the rectum.
      Ultrasound energy is then delivered through probe to prostate tissue over 2-3 hours. Quality
      of life is assessed at study initiation; at 14 days and 3, 6, and 12 months; and then
      annually thereafter. Patients are followed at 14 days; at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
