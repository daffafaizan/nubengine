      monitoring general inhalational anesthesia was induced by face mask with sevoflurane (4-8%)
      in oxygen after IV cannula was secured patients received 1mic/kg fentanyl and intubation was
      facilitated by 0.5mg/kg atracurium. isoflurane 1-2% with oxygen was used for maintenance of
      anesthesia. after stabilization of the patient's hemodynamics and before skin incision
      erector spinae block or caudal block was performed with the patient in lateral position.
      after the block patients were flipped back to their normal supine position, surgery took
