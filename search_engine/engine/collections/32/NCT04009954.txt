      leading to increased patient morbidity and prolonged hospitalisation.

      The clinical manifestations include abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting and the inability
      to pass stools or tolerate a solid diet. In addition to the discomfort experienced by
      patients, postoperative ileus is also an important risk factor for complications such as
      wound dehiscence and pulmonary and thromboembolic complications. Ileus was found to be an
      important predictor of extended postoperative hospital stays and costs in patients undergoing
      colectomy.

      The mechanism of POI is not very clear until now. At the end of the 20th century, the
      inflammatory-mediated ileus hypothesis was introduced. But the initial trigger of the
      inflammatory cascade is unclear The innate immune system recognises two large classes of
      macromolecules: first, those related to pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns
      (PAMPs), and secondly, molecules released in response to cell damage or damage-associated
      molecular patterns (DAMPs). The prototype of PAMPs is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a constituent
      of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Translocation of microbial products into the
      intestinal tissue is a well-documented feature in POI. Previous study demonstrate a clear
      association between colonic transit time, gut microbiota composition and urinary metabolic
      phenotype. Here the investigators suggest that the perioperative microbiome may contribute to
      POI. This study apply NGS(next generation sequencing) technique to analyse the composition of
      the perioperative gut microbiota of CRC(colorectal cancer) patients, then analysis the
      relationship between the dynamic variation of gut microbiota and POI.
