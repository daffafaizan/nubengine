      Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.
      VELCADE is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and
      it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received
      at least one prior therapy.

      By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple
      signaling pathways. The anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct
      mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of
      apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration
      and angiogenesis. Thus, the mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its antitumor activity may
      vary among tumor types, and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the
      inhibition of tumor growth could also differ. Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity
      in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999). In
      addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a
      single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001;
      Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pink et al., 2002). Notably,
      bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers
      unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics (McConkey et al., 1999).

      Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear
      factor κB (NF-κB) activation, its attenuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a
      direct apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects.
