      participants. Patients on this ancillary will be consented prior to RadComp randomization to
      decrease the bias secondary to RT type and enhance internal validity. The study will define
      the early changes in biomarkers, imaging measures, and RT dose volume metrics and long-term
      (5-10 year) CV clinical outcomes using the RadComp parent study's infrastructure for clinical
      data collection and long-term follow-up. Blood samples, echocardiograms, and questionnaires
      are obtained at baseline (between end of chemotherapy and start of RT), immediately after the
      end of RT, and at 6 months and 12 months after the end of RT. An additional blood sample will
      be collected at 4 weeks after the start of RT. Clinical, demographic, and patient reported
      outcomes data are collected as part of the RadComp parent study. In addition to data
      collected by RadComp, we will collect a limited set of clinical data and two additional
      quality of life instruments for the ancillary study.
