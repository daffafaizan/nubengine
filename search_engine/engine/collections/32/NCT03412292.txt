      activated in about 30% of adult patients with AML. The mutations involve either an internal
      tandem duplication (ITD) (in about 25% of AML patients) or a point mutation in the tyrosine
      kinase domain (TKD) (in about 7% of patients). Patients with mutations in FLT3, particularly
      those with ITD mutations, have a worse prognosis, with lower rate of complete remission, and
      lower overall survival . Thus, inhibition of activated FLT3 kinase by a pharmacologic agent
      is an attractive therapeutic strategy in AML.

      The aberrant of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) might be a major reason fot
      resistance to targeted therapies, and FGFR inhibitors significantly suppress leukemia
      development in vivo.

      MAX-40279 is a dual inhibitor of FLT3 and FGFR. Our goal is to develpe this uqiue dual
      inhibitor to be a more effective and wider use for AML treatment than the current known FLT3
      inhibitors.
