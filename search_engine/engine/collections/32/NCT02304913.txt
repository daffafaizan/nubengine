      Dysguesia has prevalence rates of 16% to 1000% during CTX with sometimes also persistent
      courses. Impact of dysguesia on appetite, body weight as well as health-related quality of
      life was shown. Until now, evidence for adequate treatment options is limited to specific
      diary recommendations. Acupuncture in the treatment of side effects of chemotherapy was
      investigated for nausea and xerostomia, but not for dysguesia. Therefore, this randomized
      controlled trial aims to investigate hypoglossal acupuncture in comparison to sham
      acupuncture and standard medical treatment (dietary recommendations) in the treatment of
      dysgeusia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
