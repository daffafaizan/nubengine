    
      "Ready and Healthy for Kindergarten" is a bilingual family literacy program that uses
      anticipatory guidance on important health routines to introduce critical language and
      literacy skills to young Latino children entering Kindergarten and their families.

      The objectives of this study are 1) To assess the feasibility of implementing the bilingual
      family literacy program online via video conference by collecting information on family
      attendance and participation, 2) To examine the acceptability of the program, and 3) To
      explore preliminary effects of the program on the family health and language routines as well
      as child language and literacy skill acquisition.
