      may be brought about by fasting or ingestion of diets low in carbohydrate.

      We aim to employ both fasting and dietary manipulation in order to bring about a ketotic
      state in healthy human adults. During the study blood levels of key metabolic regulators will
      be monitored 1) during a 16 hour fast followed by re-feeding and 2) during dietary induction
      of ketosis followed by re-feeding with a standard meal.
