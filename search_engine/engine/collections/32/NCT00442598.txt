    
      Open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 dose escalation study. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either once every three weeks dosing regimen or the weekly dosing regimen.
      Randomization will utilize a 2:1 ratio with two-thirds of the subjects randomized to the
      weekly dosing regimen.

      In the weekly dosing schedule, treatment with glufosfamide 2,500 mg/m2 will be initiated only
      after the 1,660 mg/m2 treatment cohort has been enrolled and there is evidence that the dose
      of 1,660 mg/m2 has been well tolerated (See below Section on Pharmacokinetic/Statistical
      Analyses).
