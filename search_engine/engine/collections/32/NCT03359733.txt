    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested in
      participants with advanced solid tumors and/or lymphomas in order to determine the effect of
      food on the PK of single oral dose of TAK-659 tablet formulation. The study will enroll
      approximately 20 participants. Participants will be randomly and equally assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences following as:

        -  TAK-659 100 mg Fasted + TAK-659 100 mg Fed

        -  TAK-659 100 mg Fed + TAK-659 100 mg Fasted

      All participants will be asked to take single oral dose of TAK-659 tablet on Day 1 and Day 8
      of a 15-day food effect treatment period. Upon completion of the food effect treatment
      period, participants can continue in the optional post food effect treatment period to
      receive TAK-659 100 mg, once daily in a 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or the start of another anticancer therapy upon request by the
      investigator and agreement by the project clinician.

      This single or multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 58 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
      remain confined until Day 15 of food effect treatment period. Participants will make a visit
      to the clinic after 28 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
