      for up to a maximum of 14 days while under critical care, with additional collection of
      safety-related findings at 7 days and 14 days after the last infusion of SANGUINATE. Each
      patient will thus have up to 28 days participation in the trial.

      A minimum of 100 subjects are to be enrolled and to receive at least one infusion of
      SANGUINATE, with 14-day follow-up after the last infusion.

      Because of the life-threatening effects of severe anemia, it is expected that all patients in
      this trial will receive care within a critical care facility (may be called intensive care or
      some similar name), wherein all patients will have real-time monitoring of vital signs and
      ECG (e.g., by telemetry) before, during, and after all study drug infusions.
