      safe laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery. Perfect abdominal wall relaxation facilitates
      surgical working conditions, which makes surgery safer, faster and easier to perform. Besides
      this indirect advantage, there could be obvious benefit for patients. This is a result of
      decreased negative pathophysiological consequences of an increased intraabdominal pressure
      (capnoperitoneum) on important organ systems (cardiovascular, breathing system, kidneys etc.)
      Complete muscle relaxation during general anaesthesia can be achieved by using higher doses
      of rocuronium (non-depolarizing aminosteroid muscle relaxant) and special anaesthetic
      technique called deep neuromuscular block (DNMB). The primary focus of the project is to test
      the potential advantages of DNMB compared to standard relaxation technique. Safe and
      efficient use of NMBA is an important precondition in restoring a patientÂ´s full muscle
      strength at the end of anaesthesia, to prevent effects of residual block. Modern practice of
      anaesthesia offers an option for complete and immediate rocuronium induced block reversal by
      using its specific antagonist - sugammadex. Combination of DNMB approach and sugammadex
      reversal also provide potential benefits for perioperative course and patient recovery after
      surgery. Secondary objective of the project is to verify this facts.
