      people worldwide. Patients with chronic HCV infection may present with various hepatic and
      extrahepatic manifestations which lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. In contrast,
      the long-term health outcome improves following successful HCV eradication by antiviral
      therapies.

      Owing to the excellent efficacy and safety as well as the short treatment duration, the use
      of interferon (IFN)-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has become the standard-of-care for
      managing HCV. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue which acts as the HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain terminator by inhibiting HCV non-structural protein 5B (NS5B)
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase following intrahepatic activation to uridine triphosphate form.
      Dephosphorylation results in the formation of inactive metabolite (GS-331007) that undergoes
      extensive renal excretion. Clinically, SOF is administered once-daily with pangenotypic
      potency, well tolerability and a high genetic barrier to drug resistance. Furthermore, SOF
      can be used in combination with NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), NS5A inhibitors, and/or
      ribavirin (RBV) to achieve high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR). Therefore,
      applying SOF-based DAAs for HCV is welcome to most treating physicians.

      Following the widespread use of SOF-based DAAs for treating HCV in different populations, a
      large-scale real-world HCV-TARGET study enrolling 1,789 patients indicated that patients with
      a baseline eGFR â‰¤ 45 mL/min/1.73m2 were associated with a higher risk of worsening renal
      function than those with a baseline eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73m2 following SOF-based DAAs.
      Moreover, three retrospective studies showed that SOF-based DAAs negatively affected the
      on-treatment and off-therapy eGFR. On the contrary, other studies showed that the use of
      SOF-based DAAs did not worsen the eGFR. Because most studies were retrospective in nature
      without protocol-defined time point for eGFR assessment or patient election, and did not
      enroll patients receiving SOF-free DAAs as the controls, the investigators thus conducted a
      prospective study to evaluate the evolution of eGFR in patients with chronic HCV infection
      receiving SOF-based or SOF-free DAAs.
