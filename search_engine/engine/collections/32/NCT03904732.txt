    
      Observational Study Model is selected as "Other" - Reason: Individual-level state transition
      model simulating the number of events of CRC, CVD, safety events and deaths in hypothetical
      cohorts of 1 million adults aged 50-59 years and 1 million adults aged 60-69 years followed
      for 20 years or till death, whichever comes first. The hypothetical cohorts are reflective of
      a population eligible for taking aspirin for primary or secondary CVD prevention.

      Time Perspective is also selected as "Other"

      - Reason: Individual-level state transition model built mimicking the UK population using
      data published in scientific international peer-reviewed journals or published data from
      government agencies. In a second phase, the model results will be extrapolated to other EU
      countries, modifying the model parameters to reflect the other EU countries epidemiology.
