      of awareness or interest among both physicians and athletes. Task-specific dystonias or
      occupational cramps affect people while writing, typing, and or playing a musical instrument.
      Our group has previously shown that a subset of golfers who complain of the yips appear to
      have a task-specific dystonia or golfer's cramp. The yips are characterized by an inability
      to appropriately complete a golf stroke, most often putting and chipping strokes. Most
      individuals with the yips describe a jerking or shaking movement that interrupts their swing.
      In many cases the yips are disabling and the golfer, including professional tour players,
      give up golfing.

      Golfers who have evidence of golfer's cramp will putt a series of putts during which they
      will be monitored for arm movements and putter movements. They will then be treated with a
      low dose of propranolol to see if there is a change in these parameters.
