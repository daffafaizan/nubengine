      joint disease (DJD), osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Relief of patient pain and
      return of mobility are the primary goals that can be accomplished by this surgery. Currently
      available prosthetic designs accomplish these goals and the surgery has been defined as one
      of the most successful operations available to improve the quality of life for patients with
      DJD. This study will evaluate subjects who are candidates for a total knee replacement and
      meet the indications for use criteria for the 3DKneeâ„¢ System with vitamin E UHMWPE tibial
      inserts (VE).
