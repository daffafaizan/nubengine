      participants with VHL disease who have at least 1 measurable RCC tumor. Belzutifan will be
      administered orally and treatment will be continuous. Participants will be evaluated
      radiologically approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment and every 12 weeks
      thereafter while continuing in the study. Changes in VHL disease-associated non-RCC tumors
      will also be evaluated.
