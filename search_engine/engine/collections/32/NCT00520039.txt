      and 18 months, and is the most frequent reason for childhood illness visits to a physician in
      the US. By three years of age, 50-70% of children will have had one episode, while one-third
      will have had more than three. Persistence of middle ear effusion following an episode of
      acute otitis media is thought to predispose the child to recurrent infection. The standard
      care for recurrent acute otitis media includes long term antibiotic prophylaxis and surgery.
      The risks of standard care are recognized, and alternative means of treating acute disease
      and preventing recurrent otitis media are needed.

      For over a century, osteopathic physicians have reported favorable clinical outcomes in
      children treated with osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) in addition to standard medical
      care. To determine if a standardized OMM protocol will reduce the duration of middle ear
      effusion (MEE) after onset of acute otitis media, we outline a prospective, randomized,
      blinded, multi-center efficacy study of children ages six months to two years with a single
      episode of acute otitis media. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups:
      standard care plus OMM and standard care only. Subjects will be followed for one month to
      determine rate of resolution of middle ear effusion following onset of the acute otitis
      media. Statistical analysis will determine any differences between subjects in the two
      treatment groups.
