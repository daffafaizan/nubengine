      a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction. Treatment of diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is based on either pathogenetic mechanisms or symptomatic relief.
      A number of clinical trials have established symptomatic treatment but for pathogenetic
      mechanisms, the only proven treatment strategy is strict glycemic control. Clearly, it would
      be desirable to prevent, impede, or reverse the disrupting and often life-threatening
      manifestations of peripheral neuropathy by stimulating growth or regeneration of peripheral
      nerve axons. The results from previous studies suggest that VM202 provides the same magnitude
      of pain relief as reported with pregabalin or gabapentin.
