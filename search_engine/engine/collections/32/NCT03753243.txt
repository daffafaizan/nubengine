      androgen receptor (AR) targeting prior to prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node
      dissection in subjects with high-risk localized prostate cancer (HRLPC).

      Trial Design- single arm, single-stage, open label Phase II of neoadjuvant immune-hormonal
      therapy in high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      Objectives To evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab combined with intensive AR
      targeting prior to prostatectomy in subjects with high-risk localized prostate cancer
      (HRLPC).

      Primary Endpoint Pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as absence of detectable
      malignant cells in the prostatectomy specimen evaluated by standard histologic techniques.
