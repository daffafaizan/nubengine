      Key: To study the impact of bacterial communities on the risk of transmission of waterborne
      pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients hospitalized from a contaminated
      water source by this bacterium.

      secondary:

        1. Assess the role of communities on installing the water points in P. aeruginosa by
           comparing contaminated and uncontaminated water sources.

        2. To evaluate the effect of the quality of water and the conditions of use of water points
           network on the composition of bacterial communities associated or not with P.
           aeruginosa.

      Experimental Study conducted from 6 points of water, contaminated deliberately experimental
      backs onto the project to assess conventional and alternative measures decontamination
      network and water points
