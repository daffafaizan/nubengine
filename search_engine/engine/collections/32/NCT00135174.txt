    
      Specific objectives :

        -  To determine the incidence of complications occurring in the first year after
           implantation of a pacemaker.

        -  To determine the quality of life at one year after pacemaker implantation in comparison
           with the quality of life before implantation.

        -  To determine which baseline (patient and pacemaker related) characteristics measured
           during implantation are prognostic predictors for the occurrence of complications and
           quality of life after one year.

        -  To determine which characteristics measured during follow-up visits truly have added
           predictive value, and to what extent.

        -  To determine to what extent responsibilities for pacemaker check-up can be safely
           delegated to non-cardiologists (e.g. pacemaker technicians or manufacturers' delegates).
