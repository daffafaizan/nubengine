      inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled. They will undergo a baseline
      cardiovascular assessment including echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic
      resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), serum blood samples, brachial artery reactivity testing, and
      carotid intimal media thickness testing. Once they have completed their baseline testing,
      they will be randomized to either atorvastatin 80mg or placebo. They will complete 12 weeks
      of therapy and return at the end of 12 weeks to have a repeat brachial artery study and serum
      studies. There will then be a four week washout period where they take no medication. They
      will return for a follow up visit at the end of that four week period for repeat baseline
      brachial artery testing and serum studies. They then will be assigned to the opposite agent
      they were on previously (so if they originally were on placebo they switch to atorvastatin
      and vice versa). They will complete another 12 weeks of therapy and return at the end for a
      final brachial artery study and blood testing.
