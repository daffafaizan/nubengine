    
      This study will be a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled,
      double dummy, 2-part, 7-way crossover study to determine the abuse potential of orally
      administered nalbuphine solution and nalbuphine ER intact tablets relative to hydromorphone
      solution and placebo, in non-dependent, recreational opioid users. The study will be
      conducted in a single clinical research unit (CRU).

      The purpose of Part A is to find the appropriate doses (a low, intermediate, and high dose)
      of nalbuphine solution to use in Part B. Part A of the study has two visits to the research
      clinic: a screening visit and dose selection visit. The visits will involve a 2-night stay (3
      days total) in the research clinic.

      In the Main Study Treatment Phase in Part B, the total estimated duration between each dose
      of study drug is approximately up to 7 days, of which the subject will spend 3 days/2 nights
      in the research clinic and approximately up to 4 days at home.

      The primary objective of the Main Study is to evaluate the abuse potential of orally
      administered nalbuphine solution and nalbuphine ER intact tablets relative to hydromorphone
      solution (the active comparator) and placebo in non-dependent, recreational opioid users.
