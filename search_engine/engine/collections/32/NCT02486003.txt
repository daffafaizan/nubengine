      responses in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) athletes, as well as healthy individuals.
      These measurements will be recorded using a portable goggle system (IPAS). The goal is to
      determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at diagnosing mTBI. A secondary goal
      is to determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at ruling out the diagnosis of
      mTBI in athletes and non-athletes that do not have the condition.

      The IPAS is a portable 3D head mounted display. The IPAS goggles are programmed with a series
      of tests that track eye motions in response to a target. This device has been determined to
      be a Non-Significant Risk to study participants.

      There are three groups of interest in this study: athletes who suffer an mTBI, athletes who
      do have an mTBI, and healthy non-athletes.
