      approximately 66 subjects in up to 10 experienced clinical centers in the United States. The
      estimated enrollment period is 18 weeks (this includes the 2-week run-in period). After
      completing a 2-week screening period, the subjects will be followed for at least 16 weeks
      post-randomization.
