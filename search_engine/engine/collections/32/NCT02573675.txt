      no intervention or specified prescription.

      For the comparison of outcomes according to dialysis modality, we will adopt an
      intention-to-treat analysis, and consider the dialysis modality at day 90 to be the initial
      dialysis modality. However, the investigators will also regard the dialysis modality at day
      30 as the initial dialysis modality in order to evaluate and compare earlier mortality.
