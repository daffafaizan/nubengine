      after hitting a pothole) and while they do not reach the cerebrum simultaneously, the brain
      can synthesize them if they are interpreted as corresponding to a single event. This is
      critical because the central representation of an event is improved if two or more relevant
      cues are integrated but conversely is degraded if unrelated inputs are synthesized. Little
      research has focused on temporal binding of vestibular signals with other sensory cues, even
      though the vestibular system operates in an inherently multimodal environment, and virtually
      nothing is known about temporal binding abnormalities in patients with peripheral or central
      vestibular disorders. The investigators will use psychophysical tests (quantifying the PSS
      [point of subjective simultaneity] and TBW [temporal binding window]) to study vestibular
      temporal binding in normal people, patients with combined vestibular and cochlear prostheses,
      and patients with peripheral or central vestibular dysfunction. The researchers will
      investigate two fundamental aspects of temporal binding: its dependence on signal precision
      and adaptation driven by habitual exposure to sensory patterns. Furthermore, the researchers
      will investigate how and why temporal binding differs from normal in patients with peripheral
      and central vestibular dysfunction.
