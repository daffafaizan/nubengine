    
      This Phase IIa study is designed as a randomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-dose study
      for subjects with mild to moderate ALS. The study will evaluate 1) safety, 2) tolerability,
      3) changes in physical function measured using the ALSFRS-R, 4) two doses of ALZT-OP1a in
      order to determine an optimal and effective dose that could positively impact
      neuro-inflammatory biomarkers, and 5) to demonstrate preliminary evidence if this treatment
      could potentially slow down or arrest functional decline in subjects with mild to moderate
      ALS.

      Up to 80 evaluable subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Group I
      (n=40) will consist of low dose ALZT-OP1a, administered via dry powder inhalation; OR Group
      II (n=40), which will consist of high dose ALZT-OP1a, administered via dry powder inhaler.

      Subjects will dose for 12 weeks and will be asked to return to the site for scheduled visits
      and biomarker collection at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.
