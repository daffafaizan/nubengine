    
      This study is an open label Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of a single dose of CDX-0159 in patients with Cold Contact Urticaria,
      Symptomatic Dermographism, or Cholinergic Urticaria who remain symptomatic despite treatment
      with antihistamines. Ten patients with Cold Contact Urticaria, ten patients with Symptomatic
      Dermographism, and ten patients with Cholinergic Urticaria will be enrolled in three separate
      cohorts for a total of 30 patients.

      Prospective patients will be screened with tests in clinic as well as daily at home diaries
      for 2 weeks prior to enrollment. CDX-0159 will be administered intravenously on Day 1.
      Post-treatment, patients will be followed for 12 weeks.
