      with daily methods of contraception. The intrauterine device (IUD) provides safe, long-term
      protection and rates highly for patient satisfaction. It also does not require repeat
      prescriptions or clinic visits, making it a potentially attractive method among teens.
      However, in adolescent populations, there is both a lack of information about the IUD, as
      well as few studies that have examined the use of these devices. This study will examine
      whether a larger scale study on this topic is feasible. IT will address the feasibility of
      recruiting, consenting, screening, enrolling, randomizing, and retaining adolescents
      randomized to the LNG-IUS or Copper T 380a.
