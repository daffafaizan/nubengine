      care treatment in active lupus nephritis (LN), is able to reduce disease activity over a
      treatment period of 52 weeks. The background therapy will be MMF and initial treatment with
      IV methylprednisolone, followed by a reducing course of oral corticosteroids. Subjects with
      active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study. They are required to have a diagnosis
      of LN according to established diagnostic criteria and clinical and biopsy features
      suggestive of active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug
      combination to reduce the level of proteinuria (as measured by urine protein/creatinine ratio
      (UPCR)) while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.
