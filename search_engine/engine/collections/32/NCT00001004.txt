      causes AIDS and ARC in some laboratory studies, but may increase virus replication in other
      laboratory studies. Previous studies in humans showed no increase in virus cultures and some
      decrease in measurements of virus. Extensive preclinical data show that TNF and IFN-G are
      more effective together than separately in laboratory and animal studies. As single agents,
      both TNF and IFN-G have modest effect against HIV. Studies have demonstrated that TNF and
      IFN-G, in combination, can not only inhibit HIV infection of previously uninfected cells, but
      also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells.

      Patients with ARC who are positive for HIV antibody are randomized to receive one of three
      treatment arms: (1) TNF alone by intramuscular injection (IM); (2) IFN-G alone by IM; (3) TNF
      plus IFN-G. Patients receive IM injections 3 times weekly for 4 months (16 weeks). Repeated
      physical examinations and laboratory tests are used to monitor patients' safety. Serial HIV
      cultures and core antigen assays are employed to obtain evidence of antiviral activity and
      serial T cell and skin tests are used to measure immunologic effect.
