      position surgery. Among those apparatus, Jackson table has padded supports under the chest
      and pelvis, so that the abdomen can hang freely and prevent the abdominal compression. By
      reducing abdominal and thoracic pressure, Jackson table would reduce blood loss, and less
      effects on pulmonary mechanics. But few studies has known to compare IAP with other
      positioning apparatus such as Wilson frame or chest roll.
