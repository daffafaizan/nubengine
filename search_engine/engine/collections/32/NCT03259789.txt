      from the United States and Japan. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive bexagliflozin
      tablets, 20 mg, or bexagliflozin tablets, placebo, in a ratio of 1:1 once daily for 24 weeks.
      Subjects will continue to take metformin for the duration of the study. The study will also
      enroll 50 subjects with extremely poorly controlled T2DM on metformin to receive open-label
      bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, for 24 weeks.
