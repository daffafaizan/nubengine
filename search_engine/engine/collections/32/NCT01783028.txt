      usual-care control group. We attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in
      the "real world," rather than its ideal efficacy.

      The CHWs used protocols that specified education content, participant skill development and
      participant and CHW actions. The CHWs modified their approach to meet the priorities of
      participants using motivational interviewing techniques. They addressed asthma
      patho-physiology, reliever and controller medication use, self-monitoring, use of an asthma
      action plan, environmental assessment, trigger avoidance, effective use of the health care
      system, successful communication with health care providers, and weight control (obesity is
      associated with increased asthma symptoms). Participants also received low-literacy
      educational materials, in English or Spanish. The education concepts and environmental
      assessment activities were based on our prior healthy homes work modified for adults.
