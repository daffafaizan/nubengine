      brain linked to pain processing in people with SCI and neuropathic pain, in people with SCI
      but no pain, and in able-bodied persons. We will also investigate the relationship between
      these concentrations of neurochemicals and different aspects of chronic neuropathic pain,
      including the intensity of pain, quality of life issues, sensitivity changes in areas of the
      body that are both painful and non-painful, and neurological status.
