      healing data from the medical records of patients being treated with a Biomet® EBI Bone
      Healing System (BHS), the Biomet® OrthoPak® Non-Invasive Bone Growth Stimulator System, or
      the Biomet® SpinalPak® Non-Invasive Spine Fusion Stimulator System. This study will provide
      current data on the effectiveness of these electrical stimulation devices.
