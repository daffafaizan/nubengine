        -  To complete characterization of metabolic serotypes based on the metabolome, and to
           adapt these profiles for human epidemiological studies.

        -  To determine the extent to which metabolic profiles that are reflective of or
           independent of long-term caloric intake predict breast cancer risk in nested
           case-control studies.

        -  To identify critical serum metabolites.

      OUTLINE: Laboratory studies, including metabolome profiling by high performance liquid
      chromatography; and small molecule identification by mass spectroscopy, are performed on
      previously collected blood samples.
