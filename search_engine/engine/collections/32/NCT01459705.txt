      efficacious treatment for PTSD and holds the potential to improve access to care for Soldiers
      who would otherwise avoid treatment. Although PE is considered one of the most effective
      cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) for treatments for PTSD, there are reasons why it may
      not be the most viable option for many Soldiers. First, prolonged exposure requires a level
      of emotional engagement during exposure to the trauma that many patients are unable to
      obtain. Second, stigma and concerns about how Soldiers will be perceived by peers and
      leadership has a dramatic impact on whether a Soldier will seek care. VRET may address these
      concerns and may also improve treatment outcomes and access to care by augmenting the
      patient's re-living of the trauma with a sensory-rich environment and moderating stigma
      perceptions by offering non-traditional treatment that is a preferable option for many
      Soldiers who are reluctant to seek out traditional talk therapies. Despite its promise as a
      viable treatment option, few studies have examined VRET for combat-related PTSD and there are
      no published studies that have compared VRET to PE in the treatment of combat-related PTSD.
      Positive results may provide new treatment options for all Soldiers, but should prove to be
      an especially attractive option for Soldiers who either do not respond to, or are reluctant
      to engage in other established therapies such as PE.
