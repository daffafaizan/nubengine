    
      Primary Endpoint(s)

        1. Define the optimal timing of reconstruction in patients at a higher risk for developing
           breast reconstruction surgical complications through a randomized prospective cohort

        2. Compare immediate and delayed reconstruction outcome metrics through retrospective
           review

      Secondary Endpoint(s)

        1. Evaluate Quality of life of patients at a higher risk for developing breast
           reconstruction surgical complications undergoing immediate versus delayed
           reconstruction.

        2. Compare complications and reoperations between immediate versus delayed reconstruction.

        3. Compare the hospital costs between immediate versus delayed reconstruction

        4. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies
