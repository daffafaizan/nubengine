      the ultrasonic non-surgical therapy doesn't work in these defects and the guided tissue
      regeneration therapy with membranes also demonstrates an unpredictable improvement.
      Therefore, enamel matrix derivative proteins (EMD) have been proposed as a periodontal
      regenerative procedure due to their fundamental role in cementum development.
