      in young patients. Currently the investigators perform high tibial osteotomy under the
      guidance of computer navigation to achieve the required alignment. During conventional high
      tibial osteotomy the bone cut is done by free hand cutting, there are risks of cutting into
      the posterior proximal tibia compartment and transect the neurovascular bundles which is a
      surgical disaster and may then lead to loss of limb. And the accuracy of free hand cutting is
      limited by experience of surgeons. In our conventional high tibial osteotomy transection of
      neurovascular bundles has never happened given our meticulous surgical technique but the
      investigators believe an extra protection is always beneficial to our patients. Recently with
      our department advance of technology, the investigators performed computed tomography for the
      patient's lower limb and 3D reconstruct the image. Based on the 3D image, the investigators
      planned our planned osteotomy cut on computer software Materialize 3 and the investigators
      then 3D printed a metal jig that has a slot to produce the osteotomy and also protected the
      neurovascular bundles. Therefore these metal jigs are specific to each patients. The
      investigators have performed a few cases of HTO under this extra metal jig protection and
      guidance and noted it has improved accuracy and safety clinically. However, whether it has
      scientific significance difference in accuracy is not known.
