      B-cell lineage that lack the BCR-ABL1 translocation but show a pattern of the expression very
      similar to that seen in BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. Chidamide is a novel oral HDACi with promising
      activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Based on the pediatric-inspired,
      PEG-L-asparaginase-intensified and MRD-directed PDT-ALL-2016 protocol, this open-label,
      two-arm, multi-site trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and effect of oral histone
      deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) chidamide and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dasatinib for
      adult Ph-like ALL/LBL. HDACi chidamide and TKI dasatinib will be added to chidamide and
      dasatinib group, respectively, from induction therapy to consolidation therapy (total courses
      of chidamide treatment: 5 courses for allo-HSCT after Consolidation Module-3; 12 courses for
      patients non-allo-HSCT after Consolidation Module 1-9). Primary study endpoint is event-free
      survival and secondary study endpoints are complete remission and MRD after induction,
      adverse event and overall survival.
