      administered intravenously, antazoline exerts a strong antiarrhythmic effect on
      supraventricular arrhythmia especially on atrial fibrillation (AF) facilitating rapid
      conversion to sinus rhythm. Despite relative lack of published data antazoline is marketed in
      Poland and widely used in cardiology wards and emergency rooms due to its efficacy, safety
      and rapid onset of action within minutes of administration.

      To show superiority of antazoline over placebo a sample size of 80 patients was calculated
      based on following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0.01, a power of 90%,
      efficacy of placebo 5%, efficacy of antazoline 50% and 20% drop-out rate to fulfill the
      criteria of intention-to-treat analysis. Due to presumed lack of statistical power the
      secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.
