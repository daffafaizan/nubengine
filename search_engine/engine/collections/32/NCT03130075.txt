    
      CFUS was designed to assess caregivers' perceptions of how much and how well their child used
      the involved upper extremity.

      Children's upper extremity functions will be assessed with a Jebsen Taylor Hand Function
      Test. Their family will be asked to fill the CFUS.

      Compare the relationship between Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and Turkish Version CFUS.
      Investigate the internal consistency of Turkish-version of CFUS by using Cronbach's alpha
      coefficient.
