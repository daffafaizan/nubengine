      by focal brain ischemia lasting less than 24 hours. Once an individual has suffered a TIA,
      preventative measures can be taken to target modifiable risk factors, one of which is
      physical inactivity. The current proposal focuses on the use of an established model of care
      (cardiac rehabilitation (CR)) and applies it to those who have suffered a TIA in order to
      maximize physical activity and minimize risk of future cardiovascular events. This will be a
      one-group pre/post design study with a 3 month non-intervention period. Participants will
      undergo measures at baseline and 3 months (non intervention period) then after 6 months of
      cardiac rehabilitation (cardiovascular fitness, 6 minute walk test, cognition, and depressive
      symptoms).
