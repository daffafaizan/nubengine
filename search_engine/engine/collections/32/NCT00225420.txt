      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when
           administered in combination with androgen ablation therapy and adaptive external-beam
           radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 2-year biochemical progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

        -  Androgen ablation therapy: Patients receive leuprolide acetate or other luteinizing
           hormone-releasing hormone agonist beginning 2-3 months prior to the start of
           chemoradiotherapy and continuing for up to 2 years.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and high-dose
           external-beam radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 8 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
