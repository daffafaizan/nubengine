      study conducted at 10-15 investigational sites. Sixty subjects will be randomized to undergo
      treatment in an office setting, and 40 subjects will be randomized to undergo treatment in a
      hospital or ambulatory surgical center (ASC) setting. Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic
      tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids.
      Saline infused sonohysterogram images (SIS) obtained at three months post treatment will be
      compared to pre-treatment images, to determine the percent reduction in target pathology
      volume. Additionally, subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale) will
      compare pain occurring during the treatment procedure to the average pain level experienced
      during a PAP smear. Economic data will be collected and compared between the two treatment
      settings.
