      sustained facial burns or who have sustained a facial injury resulting in scarring,
      tightness, limited range of motion of facial skin or musculature, or fibrosis to complete the
      8 week treatment. Participants will need to be able to attend a weekly telehealth or in
      person session with the investigators and complete the entire 8 week prescriptive program.
      Participants will be outpatient. A facial injury can be any disorder that results in
      scarring, tightness, limited range of motion of facial skin or musculature or fibrosis.
      Facial burn injury or facial injury is defined as an injury to the midface or lower half of
      the face and may be unilateral or bilateral. Participants must be in the chronic phase of
      recovery. Chronic burns are defined as those burns that are not in the acute healing phase,
      ie., there are no concerns for injury to new or healing skin or wound dehiscence.
