      the secondary prevention of important vascular events. The use of COX-2 inhibitors may have
      the potential advantage vs. nonselective NSAIDs in reducing the probability of interfering
      with permanent inactivation of COX-1 platelet by low-dose aspirin, in this setting. In fact,
      recent studies suggest that the likelihood of COX-inhibitors to present this pharmacodynamic
      interaction is inversely related to their COX-2 selectivity. Thus, differently from the
      non-selective NSAID ibuprofen, prior administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor
      rofecoxib, does not antagonize the irreversible inhibition induced by aspirin in healthy
      subjects. Aim of this study is to determine whether celecoxib given at therapeutic dose at
      steady state alters the antiplatelet activity of low-dose aspirin, in comparison with
      ibuprofen.
