      team and clinical oncologists will allow more efficient utilization of supportive care by
      metastatic breast cancer patients, and will reduce the isolation of physicians involved in
      the management of these patients. Physicians will then be able to help the patients make
      realistic decisions for the best possible quality of life and in full accordance with their
      preferences.

      The DISSPO (Department of Interdisciplinary Supportive Care for Cancer Patients) focuses on
      psycho-oncology, pain evaluation and treatment, palliative care, social service, dietary
      guidance and physiotherapy. Usually, visits with the DISSPO are arranged when the patients
      need supportive care but are not included in routine care. In this study, contacts between
      clinical oncologists and supportive care staff will be formalized and systematized. A
      specific visit called "supportive care visit" will be organized to investigate the needs of
      the patient so that a personalized care plan can be proposed. Moreover, a consultation
      between the referring oncologist and the DISSPO will be organized at least once a month.

      Besides the main objective of this study (see brief summary), there are secondary objectives
      which are to evaluate the impact of systematic "Clinical cancer department/Supportive care
      department" consultation meetings versus standard care on:

        -  the use of supportive care

        -  symptom control

        -  anxiety-depression levels

        -  quality of life

        -  patient representations (adaptation to the disease and locus of control)

        -  patient perception of social support

        -  patient satisfaction with the care

        -  impact of disease on the family

        -  satisfaction of the referring oncologist
