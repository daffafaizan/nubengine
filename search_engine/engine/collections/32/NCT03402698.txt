      is very high (up to 90%). Vitamin D supplementation at a dose 600 -1000 IU/d is recommended
      in Polish children from September till April. However, there is shortage of studies in Polish
      children.

      Aims:

        1. Assessment of the impact of vitamin D intake at a dose of 1000 IU / day on vitamin D
           status in children aged 4-10 years.

        2. Evaluation of the effectiveness of supply of vitamin D at a dose of 1000 IU / day in
           preventing vitamin D deficiency and maintaining optimal vitamin D status ( 25OHD level
           >30ng/ml)

        3. Evaluation of vitamin D status depending on age, BMI and body composition.

        4. Assessing the safety and tolerability of mel ● tiki vitamin D in children. Material:
           Children aged 4-10 years Study desing: Prospective intervention trial Intervention:
           cholecalciferol at a dose 1000 IU/day for 3 months

      Methods:

        1. Analysis of clinical characteristics (attendance at kindergarten / school, consumption
           of products rich in vitamin D, exposure to sun, use of sunblock's, the overall child's
           health (chronic diseases, medications, vitamins, micronutrients)

        2. Anthropometric measurements (body weight, height, BMI, assessment of body fat content -
           body composition by bioimpedance method- TANITA)

        3. Assessment of vitamin D status (serum total 25OHD concentration in blood serum by
           immunochemiluminescence method)

        4. Collecting data on the tolerability and safety of meliki ● tiki vitamin D including
           possible symptoms of vitamin D overdose
