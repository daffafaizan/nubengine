      the central canal of the spinal cord. At present, the treatment of syringomyelia is mainly
      through surgical decompression to restore the disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation.
      Due to the heterogeneity of the etiology of syringomyelia, almost all published studies on
      the clinical outcome and prognostic factors of syringomyelia are relatively limited, and most
      of them are retrospective. It is not clear which is the most reliable predictor of clinical
      outcome. Therefore, the researchers conducted this prospective cohort study to identify the
      occurrence, development and outcome of syringomyelia and determine the main prognostic
      factors through clinical scales, biomarkers and electrophysiology.

      At study visits a standardized clinical examination will be performed including application
      of clinical rating scales. At all study visits, patients will be asked to donate biosamples;
      biomaterial collection is optional and participants can elect to participate in sampling of
      blood, urine, CSF, and/or a muscle biopsy.

      Optionally, additional examinations may be performed including imaging, neurophysiological
      examination, analysis of patient or observer reported outcomes and analysis to characterize
      molecular biomarkers.
