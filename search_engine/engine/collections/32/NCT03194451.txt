    
      This project aims to develop a new pre-vascularized tissue engineered bone construct, using
      human cells of a simple and non invasive tissue source: dental pulp.

      We will isolate mesenchymal stem cells from dental tissue of wisdom teeth, extracted from
      patients aged between 13 and 17 years old.

      The objectives are: (i) to assess in combination the endothelial differentiation and
      osteoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (immature third molar); (ii) to study
      the boosting effect of the conditionned medium on cell differentiation and production of a
      prevascularized bone construct.

      The differentiation will be monitored by evaluation of biosynthesized matrix, bone
      mineralization (immunohistochimie, Westen Blot), histological response (Von Kossa, Alizarin
      Red) and presence and quantification of pseudo-vascular structures (angiogenesis assay),
      compared to reference value (commercial differentiation medium).
