      optotypes" for the standardized examination of reading acuity and reading speed. Print sizes
      are logarithmically scaled (LogRAD) to permit statistical analysis, and the results obtained
      can be compared to other logarithmically scaled vision systems (e.g., LogMAR). To guarantee
      accurate, reproducible and standardized measurements of reading acuity and reading speed at
      every viewing distance, "sentence optotypes" have been created to minimize the variations
      between the test items and to keep the geometric proportions as constant as possible at all
      distances. Through interdisciplinary cooperation, a series of test sentences were developed
      that are highly comparable in terms of the number of words (14 words), as well as the word
      length, number of syllables, position of words, lexical difficulty and syntactical
      complexity. The most similar sentences were statistically selected for the Radner Reading
      Charts.
