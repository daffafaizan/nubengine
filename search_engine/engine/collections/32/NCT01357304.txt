      problems today and contribute substantially to poor health and diseases such as type 2
      diabetes and hypertension. An increased and systematic effort to increase physical activity
      in the Swedish population in general, and in patients with type 2 diabetes/hypertension in
      particular, is important. Written prescriptions of physical activity with follow-up (i.e.,
      PAR), is a cost-efficient way to increase physical activity in individuals.

      The aim of this trial is to study whether physical activity is increased by a group method
      involving PARs in patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes compared with a control
      group that receives usual care in the same primary care setting. Follow-up will be performed
      at 6 and 12 months.

      This trial is being conducted to determine whether it is possible to offer PARs to more
      patients in a way that requires less effort and resources. The intervention in this study
      requires 10 minutes of a health care worker's time per patient during a 6-month period. Each
      patient requires 100 minutes with an instructor who oversees the group intervention.

      Group treatment is given 3 weeks after baseline and at 6 months. Follow-up at 12 months
      involves data collection, but no intervention.

      An empowerment process, with the 5-A-model as framework, will be used in the clinical
      intervention.

      All participants will be required to fill in questionnaires and wear an ActiGraph GTM1/GTM3
      for 7 days at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
