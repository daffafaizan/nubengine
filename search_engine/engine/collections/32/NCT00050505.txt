      evaluate the safety of undiluted Dryvax and Dryvax diluted at 1:5 and 1:10 in adults between
      the ages of 32 and 70 years who were previously vaccinated but not since 1989 and to define,
      with very high precision (+/-3%), the proportion of individuals who respond with a "take" 6
      to 11 days after vaccination with undiluted Dryvax vaccine and Dryvax diluted at 1:5. A
      "take" is defined as the formation of a lesion at the site of vaccination that is consistent
      with the description of a successful vaccination described in the IB Secondary study
      objectives include defining with good precision (+/- 10%), the proportion of individuals who
      respond with a "take" 6 to 11 days after vaccination with a 1:10 dilution of Dryvax vaccine
      and exploring correlations between "takes"/ no-"take" and immune responses in all vaccine
      groups (antibody responses in all volunteers; and assays of cell-mediated immunity in a
      convenience sample consisting of 15 volunteers enrolled at each site (total N = 105) randomly
      distributed across the vaccine groups). Immunogenicity assays will include neutralizing
      antibody to vaccinia, vaccinia binding antibody, ELISPOT for gamma interferon [Assays of
      cell-mediated immunity will be performed only on a convenience sample consisting of 15
      volunteers enrolled at each site (total N = 105)] and intracellular cytokine production.
      Primary safety endpoints include safety data regarding the three doses of vaccine in
      previously vaccinated subjects as assessed by adverse events reported by the subjects and/or
      investigators and changes observed during the scheduled clinic visits. Specific attention
      will be paid to the following: local reactogenicity at the site of injection: pain,
      tenderness, erythema, induration, regional lymphadenopathy, limitation of limb movement;
      systemic symptoms: fever, myalgia, fatigue, and headache; anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity
      reactions; other reactions: dermatologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal (nausea/vomiting,
      diarrhea). The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial will be the proportion of vaccinees
      demonstrating a "take" 6 to 11 days after the first vaccination at each of the dose levels
      (undiluted and 1:5 and 1:10). Secondary endpoints are: immune responses as assessed by
      vaccinia neutralizing antibody measured on all subjects and binding antibody to vaccinia on
      all subjects and the size of the lesions observed in all subjects compared across the
      dilution groups. Tertiary endpoints of 15 volunteers at each site randomly distributed across
      the vaccine groups are cellular immune responses as assessed by: ELISPOT for gamma interferon
      in response to vaccinia antigens and intracellular cytokine production.
