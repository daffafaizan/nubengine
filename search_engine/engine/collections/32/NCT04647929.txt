      insufficiently treated. It is characterized by a loss of optic nerve fiber and a glaucomatous
      optic disc excavation and, a corresponding pattern of visual field loss. Newborn and children
      can be affected by two subgroups of this disease: (1) primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) or
      (2) developmental glaucoma (DG). PCG and DG are treated surgically, either by goniotomy or by
      trabeculotomy as first approach, and not with topical hypotensive medications. Whenever these
      procedures have failed, the subsequent surgical procedure is usually trabeculectomy with
      Mitomycin C or the implantation of a glaucoma drainage device. However, there is a lack of
      evidence regarding the "optimal" surgical approach after failed goniotomy/trabeculotomy.
      Optimal treatment in this young group of patients with a long life expectancy is crucial to
      prevent blindness, allow them to participate in a "normal" school and work environment, and
      to minimize disease burdens for these patients and their families as well as to minimize
      costs for society. Consequently, there is the desire to find a procedure with a superior
      success rate and even fewer or less severe complications compared to trabeculectomy.
      Recently, the Santen PRESERFLO was introduced. The results proved fewer complications and
      comparable efficacy to trabeculectomy, according results presented at scientific meetings.
      Yet, there are no published studies to compare the both procedures. The primary aim of this
      study is to compare the Santen PRESERFLO implant to trabeculectomy in PCG and DG patients.
