      (776C85) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has been demonstrated to be
      resistant to 5-FU. II. Assess time to progression and survival in this group of patients.
      III. Assess the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to relapse while receiving adjuvant therapy
      (relapse within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy vs relapse while receiving adjuvant
      therapy). Patients receive oral doses of ethynyluracil (776C85) and fluorouracil twice daily
      for 28 days followed by 1 week of rest. Treatment continues every 5 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months the first
      year, every 4 months the second year, and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-75 patients will be accrued for this study.
