      May 2017, teeth missing consecutive patients requiring implant treatment consented to
      participate in this study to investigate the correlation between implant stability and bone
      density.

      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used for preoperative radiological evaluation of the
      jawbone for each patient, and then bone density in Houndsfield units scale was assessed by
      SimPlant Pro 11.04 software. Immediately after the implant placement and 12 weeks later,
      stability measurements were performed with Osstellâ„¢ Mentor.The captured data was represented
      in a quantitative unit called Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) on a scale from 1 to 100 and
      averaged for each implant.

      The descriptive statistical methods were used to show the differences in bone density and ISQ
      values among location, gender, age and implant diameter variables. Mann-whitney test was used
      for comparison of HU values and ISQ values between different age and gender groups.
      Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison of HU values and ISQ values between different
      location and implant diameter groups. The changes of ISQ values over time were compared using
      Wilcoxon signed rank test. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to
      investigate the correlation between ISQ values and HU values.

      At last, to investigate the possible correlations between implant stability and bone density
      and to study the feasibility of predicting implant stability by using preoperative CBCT.
