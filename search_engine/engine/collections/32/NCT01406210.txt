      from eligible subjects at the time of clinical bronchoscopies and will be within 2 weeks of
      their esophageal study. The Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) samples will be assayed for bile
      acids; pepsin, pepsinogen I and II; trypsin; gastrin, and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content.
      Short-term clinical outcome measures including acute rejection episodes, and Forced
      Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV-1) at one year will be collected. Correlation
      between markers of reflux and aspiration will be analyzed.

      Retrospective Group: Up to 800 charts within the past 5 years will be reviewed for 1) subject
      outcome event rates for subjects with and without Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) for
      survival, Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS), acute rejection and Forced Expiratory
      Volume in the first second (FEV-1), 2) what is the estimated treatment effect of
      fundoplication on the above event rates, 3) is there a threshold effect such that events such
      as BOS and death are more likely to occur only at higher or more proximal acid or non-acid
      contact times. This review will better address the role of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
      (GERD) in lung allograft failure, the clinical utility of surgical fundoplication in
      preventing lung allograft injury, and the role that acid and non-acid reflux as related to
      aspiration causes lung allograft injury as it relates to a wider population.
