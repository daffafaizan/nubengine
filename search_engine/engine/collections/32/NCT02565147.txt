    
      The study will assess the effect of bivalirudin administration during primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) and for 4 hours (h) afterwards, looking at contrast enhanced
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) assessed infarct size and on circulating markers of
      thrombosis and cell injury in participants treated with PPCI for a large myocardial
      infarction (MI).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether bivalirudin, compared to heparin
      [unfractionated heparin (UFH)], for PPCI in large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) can:

      Primary Objective • Reduce infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days (defined as 5 days ±72 h from
      randomisation) after PPCI

      Secondary Objectives of this study are to determine the effects of bivalirudin compared with
      UFH treatment for PPCI in STEMI on:

        -  Other CMR derived parameters of myocardial recovery 5 days after PPCI (that is, left
           ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], myocardial salvage index [MSI], and micro-vascular
           obstruction [MVO])

        -  LVEF by CMR at 90 days

        -  Modulate markers of thrombin activity and cell injury after reperfusion

        -  Coronary flow and micro-circulation at the end of PPCI

        -  Survival at 90 days

      Approximately 200 participants will be randomized. Participants will be stratified prior to
      randomization: (a) according to total duration of ischemic pain (<6 h versus ≥6 h); (b) by
      site.

      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Selection: Adult participants (≥18 years) with an onset of
      ischemic symptoms of >20 minutes (min) and <12 h; a diagnosis of STEMI with ST segment
      elevation of ≥1 millimeter (mm) in ≥2 contiguous precordial leads, or presumably new left
      bundle branch block; had thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0 or 1 flow in the
      infarct related artery (IRA); fulfilled angiographic criteria/score for a large infarction;
      and were candidates for PPCI will be enrolled. All participants should receive as soon as
      logistically feasible: aspirin (150-325 milligrams [mg] orally or 250-500 mg intravenously
      [IV]) and a loading dose of any approved P2Y12 inhibitor unless already on maintenance dose.

      Bivalirudin will be administered at the time of PPCI at the approved dose of 0.75 mg/kilogram
      (kg) bolus followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion that will continue for 4 h after the
      completion of the index procedure.

      Participants randomized to UFH should be treated according to the standard institutional
      protocol (including the timing and dosing of the UFH bolus). A target activated clotting time
      (ACT) of ≥250 seconds (s) was recommended.

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Primary Endpoint:

      • Infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days post-PPCI

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  CMR MVO assessment at 5 days

        -  CMR MSI at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 90 days

        -  TIMI flow and Myocardial Blush Grade at end of PPCI

        -  In-hospital net adverse clinical events up to 5 days or discharge, whichever comes first
           (death, re-infarction, ischaemia driven revascularization, and Bleeding Academic
           Research Consortium ≥3 bleeding)

        -  Death at 90 days

      Exploratory assessments:

      • Assess patterns between comparator groups at various peri-procedural time points with
      respect to but not limited to: micro-particle release, thrombin anti thrombin complexes,
      myeloperoxidase

      Sub-study:

      • Index microcirculatory resistance
