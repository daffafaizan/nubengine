      early indicator of damage to particular regions of the brain caused by AD, including loss of
      neurons, synapses, and other changes. Many of these changes are reported among patients with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a group known to be at increased risk for AD.

      The overall goal of this study is to use FDG-PET
      (2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose/positron-emission tomography) to determine whether
      metabolic abnormalities in the hippocampus predict memory and brain deterioration in middle
      age, and to identify the brain glucose metabolism predictors of future MCI.

      Participants in the study will be grouped into 3 main groups of 35 each, including young
      individuals (20-40 years of age), 41-90 year-old normal, and MCI individuals with or without
      risk for memory decline. Participants will undergo baseline and 36-month follow-up exams to
      include comprehensive medical, neurologic, and psychiatric evalutions; lumbar puncture; a
      resting FDG-PET; an MRI scan; and a neuropsychological battery. A brief medical exam, full
      neuropsychological battery, and MRI scan will be administered at 18 months. Two subgroups
      (groups 4 and 5) of 15 each will be created from groups 1 and 2 at 18 months to participate
      in the evaluation of memory performance under acute hyperglycemia and saline challenges and
      effects on hippocampal formation and glucose metabolism.
