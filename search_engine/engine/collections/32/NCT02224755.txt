    
      The HM3 LVAS is intended to provide hemodynamic support in patients with advanced, refractory
      left ventricular heart failure; either for short term support, such as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation (BTT) or myocardial recovery, or as long term support, such as destination
      therapy (DT). The HM3 is intended for use inside or outside the hospital.
