    
      BIO-Precision is a post-market study investigating the utility of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      detection using BIOTRONIK's subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitor, BIOMONITOR. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of BIOTRONIK's BIOMONITOR for the detection
      and confirmation of AF prior to an ablation procedure. Study population includes patients
      with paroxysmal AF being evaluated for an AF ablation. Holter monitoring for 48 hours will be
      performed after insertion of the BIOMONITOR but prior to AF ablation. This study will enroll
      up to 100 subjects, to obtain 60 usable Holter recordings, at 5 study sites within the United
      States (U.S.). Study subjects will be followed for three months after the completion of a 48
      hr Holter monitor.
