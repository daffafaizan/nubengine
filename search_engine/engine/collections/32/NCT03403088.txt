      treatments for patients with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) that caused dentin
      hypersensitivity (DH). Casuistic and methods: 60 participants with NCCLs and positive for DH
      will be enrolled in the study to receive randomly the followed treatments: LA= 780 nm and
      70mW GaAlAs Laser/ 4 sessions; LAP= placebo laser/ four sessions; RGI= ClinproTM XT Varnish/
      in-office single session; RX= adhesive RelyXTM Arc/ in-office single session; DE= stannous
      fluoride dentifrice/30-days-home-use; DE-P= placebo dentifrice/30-days-home-use. Pain from DH
      is measured with visual analogue scale (VAS), pre-treatment and in accordance with each
      treatment, immediately after the end of the treatment (S1); one and two weeks (1S and 2S) and
      one and two months (1M and 2M) after the end of the treatments. Strategies of treatments are
      compared each other in each period of evaluation and along time with pre-treatments values of
      pain, using Kruskall-Wallis and Friedman Test (p<0.05).
