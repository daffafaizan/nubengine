      unit stay. Following discharge home patients often still suffer from reduced physical
      function, exercise capacity, health related quality of life and social functioning for at
      least 2 years. There is usually no support to address these longer term problems specific to
      critical illness for patients after hospital discharge. Little research has been carried out
      into interventions which could improve physical function and quality of life, or enhance
      speed of recovery in these patients. While there is evidence to support the rehabilitation of
      critically ill patients within intensive care units, there is a paucity of literature to
      support rehabilitation following discharge from intensive care and hospital. Therefore, there
      is a clear and urgent need to investigate interventions which could improve the recovery of
      patients discharged home after intensive care. This is emerging as a prominent therapeutic
      objective for the future for this population.

      This study will investigate whether a programme of exercise following discharge from hospital
      will improve outcome in patients following critical illness compared to standard care.
