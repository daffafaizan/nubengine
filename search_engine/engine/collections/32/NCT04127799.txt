      clinic follow up. In the program, participants were educated on the use of smart
      health-tracking devices and mobile application (APP) to collect and upload comprehensive data
      elements related to the risk of AF self-care management. They were also instructed to send
      text messages, view notifications, and receive individualized guidance on the mobile APP. The
      general practitioners viewed index of each participant on mobile APP and provided primary
      care periodically, and cardiologists in regional central hospital offered remote guidance and
      management if necessary. Outcomes assessed included accomplishments of the program, usability
      and satisfaction, engagement with the intervention, and changes of AF-related health
      behaviors.
