      adapt to the external environment, which is closely related to the human sleep-wake cycle.
      Patients after major surgery are prone to changes in sleep structure and sleep quality,
      called postoperative sleep disturbances (POSD), which are characterized by the total sleep
      time reduced, rapid eye movement sleep absent, slow wave sleep shortened, and shallow sleep
      phase increased, times of wakefulness increased, and highly fragmented sleep. Some studies
      have shown that POSD can aggravate postoperative pain and fatigue, increase postoperative
      delirium, cardiovascular adverse events, and even cause accidental death of patients. The
      investigators don't know whether the early postoperative sleep function and postoperative
      recovery quality of patients undergoing general anesthesia are affected by surgery in the
      morning or in the afternoon. The present study was conducted in laparoscopic hysteromyoma
      patients, aiming to compare the effects of morning surgery with afternoon surgery on early
      postoperative sleep function and postoperative recovery under general anesthesia.
