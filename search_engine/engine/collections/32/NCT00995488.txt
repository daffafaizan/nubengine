    
      On the basis of the known single agent activity of paclitaxel in urothelial cancer, the
      activity of combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine in advanced
      urothelial cancer coupled with the results from studies in breast cancer demonstrating
      improved clinical efficacy of ABI-007 over paclitaxel with a more favorable toxicity profile,
      we propose this phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      ABI-007, carboplatin, and gemcitabine in patients with advanced urothelial cancer.

      Carboplatin and gemcitabine dosing and schedule is based on our previous trial of paclitaxel,
      carboplatin, and gemcitabine which showed acceptable toxicity.

      Due to the extent of hematologic toxicities expected with this combination and reported with
      weekly schedules of ABI-007 based combinations as well as our experience on UMCC protocol
      2007.061 which originally utilized a weekly ABI-007 with gemcitabine and carboplatin, we do
      not feel continuous weekly dosing will be feasible. Therefore this trial is designed with
      ABI-007 on a D1 only schedule every 21 days. The starting dose of ABI-007 will be 220 mg/m2,
      because of the risk of significant bone marrow suppression, with the option of a dose
      escalation in patients who tolerate therapy well after the first cycle to 260 mg/m2 every 21
      days.
