    
      68-Ga-fibroblast-activation-protein-inhibitors (68-Ga-FAPI) are novel Positron emission
      tomography (PET) tracers that were recently introduced for the imaging of patients with
      various cancer diseases. The fibroblast-activation-protein (FAP) is highly expressed in
      carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the stroma of various tumor entities. The aim of
      this registry study is to collect data on FAPI expression, positive predictive value,
      detection rate, reproducibility and impact on clinical management of 68-Ga-FAPI PET/CT or
      PET/MRI on patients receiving this imaging modality at initial diagnosis or restaging as part
      of clinical care.
