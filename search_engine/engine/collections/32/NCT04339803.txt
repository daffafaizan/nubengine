    
      Procedure:a 3+3 rule-based, dose-escalation design (Colucci et al,2017). recruitment process:
      the study will begin with a cohort of three participants (n=3). Each of the subsequent
      cohorts will also be of three participants. The start dose will be set at 15 minutes (cohort
      one). Participants will do ankle dorsiflexion exercise at the set dose with the mirror for
      two weeks. The second and subsequent cohorts will exercise at dose set in accordance to the
      nine preset rules and the modified Fibonacci sequence (mFBS) .

      Sample size: The target sample size is not usually predefined for a dose-finding study. The
      final sample size will be determined by the response of consecutive cohorts to the set dose.
      Usually, in pharmaceutical dose-finding studies, the sample size lies between 12 and 40.

      Data analysis : The data for each cohort will be analysed using descriptive statistics. No
      significance testing is involved.
