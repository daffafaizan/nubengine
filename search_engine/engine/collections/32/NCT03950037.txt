    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) related to intervention in
      asymptomatic SANCC; these include drug-related side effects, moderate/severe intracranial
      hypertension, hydrocephalus requiring shunting or endoscopy, stroke, status epilepticus, or
      unexplained death.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be hospitalized for approximately 15-30 days while they receive treatment
      with the antiparasitic drug albendazole, as well as additional drugs (dexmathesaone and
      omeprazole) to address potential treatment complications. Participants will have continuous
      monitoring for adverse events while in the hospital. After participants are released to home,
      they will monitored for adverse events for an additional 12 months through home visits,
      telephone contact, and monthly clinical evaluations with serologic and radiologic assessment.
