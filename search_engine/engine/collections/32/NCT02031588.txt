      commensal flora is the main reservoir for antibiotic resistance. Understanding the factors
      (environmental, patient-related, dosis-related, drug-relatedâ€¦) involved in the emergence of
      resistance to fluoroquinolones in the commensal flora of patients treated with a FQ, may help
      prevent it and preserve the efficiency of these important antibiotics. Samples of digestive
      flora will be collected from hospitalized patients before receiving a FQ or Ceftriaxone, at
      the end of the treatment and 3 month after the end of treatment. Clinical data will be
      collected.
