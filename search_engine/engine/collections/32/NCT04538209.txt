      chronic liver disease and is responsible for numerous complications.

      Gastric and oesophageal varices are two of common portosystemic collaterals, patients usually
      presented with hematemesis, melena, or both, ultimately 20% is the mortality during the first
      attack.

      Although both band ligation and sclerotherapy are effective modalities of treatment in
      controlling acute variceal bleeding, in preventing future variceal bleeding as well as in
      eradicating varices with very few complications , their effects on portal circulation have
      raised concerns among hepatologist.

      Information about collateral pathways is especially relevant when interventional procedures
      or surgery is indicated because inadvertent distribution of these vessels can cause
      significant bleeding.

      Few studies pointed on development of new portosystemic collaterals post variceal eradication
      depending on abdominal computed tomography (CT ) compared to pre-variceal eradication as
      showed paraoesophageal varices, retro-gastric varices not visualized with endoscopy ,or large
      deep gastric collaterals that may increase risk for rebleeding.

      Also, liver stiffness measurement and indirect markers of portal hypertension have been
      correlated with the severity of portal hypertension and have been used to predict the
      presence of varices, and there is rising question what about effect of variceal eradication
      on liver stiffness.

      The Child-Pugh and MELD scores were significantly higher for patients with gastric variceal
      bleeding , and the question here is variceal eradication can improve Child-Pugh and MELD
      scores or there is no effect.
