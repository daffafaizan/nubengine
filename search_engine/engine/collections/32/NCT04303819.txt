      analyzed. Plasma total bile acids in fasting state (FTBAs) and other parameters were tested
      at baseline. Then exenatide were applied to the T2DM participants for 12 weeks. FTBAs and
      glycemic parameters were measured again after exenatide treatment, and correlation analysis
      between changes of FTBAs and glycemic parameters were conducted to investigate the role of
      BAs in the glycemic control effect of exenatide.
