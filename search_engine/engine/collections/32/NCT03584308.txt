      patients. 75 in each therapeutic arm. The sample size was calculated with parameters of phase
      III studies, but establishing an early stop rule, with an intermediate analysis. For the
      calculation it was taken into account that the expected percentage of elimination of the
      virus by spontaneous remission in immunocompetent patients, reported internationally is on
      average 35%. It is intended that in the group of patients to whom VIUSID® plus GLIZIGEN® will
      be administered, this figure is ≥ 65%. In other words, it is desired to reach a minimum
      difference of approximately 30% between both groups. Considering a type I error of 5%
      (adjusted to 2.5% by an intermediate evaluation), a power of 90%, plus 5% of dropouts or
      losses to follow-up, the minimum number of patients to recruit is 150 patients in total , 75
      in each therapeutic arm.

      However, by decision of the promoter the study was stopped with 55 patients in each arm, 110
      patients in total. And established as a phase II trial.
