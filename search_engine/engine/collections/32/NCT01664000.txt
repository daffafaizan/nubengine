      and was reasonably well-tolerated at therapeutic doses in the non-clinical animal studies.
      Kevetrin was also effective in multi-drug resistant tumor models; therefore, Kevetrin has the
      potential to treat tumors that have become resistant to standard chemotherapy. This trial
      will determine tolerance in humans and, possibly, efficacy with a Phase I, open-label,
      dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of Kevetrin, in adult
      patients with solid tumors.

      The primary objectives are the following:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Kevetrin.

        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Kevetrin.

        -  To establish a safe dose level of Kevetrin that can be used for future studies.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the following:

        -  The pharmacokinetics of Kevetrin in humans.

        -  Observe for evidence of antitumor activity following administration of Kevetrin.

        -  If Kevetrin induces changes in the biomarker p21 in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

        -  If there is a pharmacodynamic relationship between the plasma concentrations of Kevetrin
           and a clinical or cellular effect.

      During each 4 week cycle, each patient will receive three weekly doses of Kevetrin given as a
      1 hour intravenous infusion followed by a 1 week off-treatment period. Following each dose,
      each patient will be monitored. If the patients have acceptable safety and tolerance,
      Kevetrin will be given once weekly for a total of 3 weeks. During each cycle patients will be
      evaluated for safety, tolerance, and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) that occur during a cycle.
