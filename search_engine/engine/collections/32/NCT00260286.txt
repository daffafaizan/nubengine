      attributed to the gradual "maturation" of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, but the
      mechanism of this "maturation" is not known. Ovarian function critically depends on the
      pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus and on the
      consequent and more readily assessed pulsatility of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the
      pituitary. LH pulsatility has been shown to depend on energy availability, operationally
      defined as dietary energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure. The effects of energy
      availability on LH pulsatility are thought to be mediated by certain metabolic substrates and
      hormones.

      Comparison: By manipulating diet and exercise regimens, contrasting energy availability
      treatments of 10 and 45 kilocalories per kilogram of fat-free mass per day are being
      administered to adolescents with 5-8 years of gynecological age and to adults with 14-18
      years of gynecological age for five days in the early follicular phase of separate menstrual
      cycles. Effects of low energy availability on LH pulsatility and on selected metabolic
      substrates and hormones are being measured.
