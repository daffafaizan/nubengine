      implant performance and patient clinical outcomes of the patients who are eligible for a
      either a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) replacement surgery involving the Scorpio NRG or
      Triathlon Total Knee System or Triathlon PKR Partial Knee Resurfacing (unicompartmental knee
      arthroplasty, UKA), all of which with X3 inlay. The register will follow the standard
      clinical procedures used by the institutions for patient selection for knee arthroplasty
      surgery, patient surgery and patient follow-up. Therefore there will be, with regard to this
      register, no additional assessment, examination, procedure or follow-up visits compared to
      those usually performed in the institution (routine standard normal procedures).
