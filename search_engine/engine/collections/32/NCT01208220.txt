      for the treatment of chronic pressure ulcers and determine whether the addition of
      Collagenase Santyl ointment has a positive effect on wound healing. Through volumetric
      changes and histological evaluation, we wish to test the hypothesis that the application of
      Collagenase Santyl ointment in conjunction with NPWT facilitates improved wound healing and
      mitigates some potentially harmful effects of NPWT alone (e.g. pain with dressing removal and
      tissue ingrowth
