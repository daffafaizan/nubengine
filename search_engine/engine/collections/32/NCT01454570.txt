      informed consent process will begin for those participants who have been determined to meet
      the inclusion criteria. After the potential participant's signed consent has been provided,
      further evaluations for eligibility will be performed (e.g., there are several medical and
      physical exclusion criteria). Those potential participants who meet both the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into the ReWalk-I study. Baseline evaluations
      and personalized measurements for fitting to the ReWalk-I will be performed over one week,
      before the training sessions begin. The ReWalk sessions will consist of a Learning Phase (12
      sessions in 4 weeks) and a Training Phase (18 sessions in 6 weeks). These times may vary by
      each participant's ReWalk learning curve. Training will begin with sit-to-stand,
      stand-to-sit, and standing balance activities. Progression to walking will occur as skills
      advance. Each session will be an average 50 minutes, with 3 sessions per week. The skills to
      be learned include 1) sit-to-stand, 2) stand-to-sit, 3) 2-arm standing balance, 4) 1-arm
      standing balance, 5) walking, and 6) stair climbing. The study evaluations will be repeated
      after the Learning Phase, after the Training Phase and 1-month post training follow-up.
