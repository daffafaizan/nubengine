      in care are essential to HIV program effectiveness in terms of prevention of HIV;related
      morbidity and mortality and prevention of HIV transmission. Linkage and retention rates in
      HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are suboptimal, with less than half of patients who
      test positive successfully linking and remaining in care at 1 year. This study is a two-arm
      cluster site;randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel combination package of
      evidence;based interventions, the combination intervention strategy (CIS), compared to
      standard of care (SOC) on linkage and retention of HIV;positive patients from point of
      testing to retention in care. CIS will include 1) point of care CD4+ count assays at HIV
      testing sites; 2) accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for eligible patients;
      3) provision of a basic care and prevention package (BCPP); 4) short message service (SMS)
      reminders for clinic appointments; and 5) financial incentives for linkage and retention. The
      primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of CIS as compared to SOC on the combined
      outcome of rapid linkage to HIV care within 1 month and retention in care at 12 months among
      adults testing positive for HIV. Secondary aims include evaluation of the effectiveness of
      CIS compared to SOC on each of linkage to HIV; retention in care; time to ART initiation; HIV
      disease progression and mortality; patient acceptability; association between baseline
      characteristics and outcomes, and comparison of cost effectiveness.
