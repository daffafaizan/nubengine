    
      SYNRINSE is osmotically balanced and also contains soluble chitosan-argininamide, a modified
      natural glycopolymer that has a number of properties important to relieving the symptoms of
      mucus build up and bacterial biofilms. First, SYNRINSE reduces the viscosity of biofilms, the
      protective environment of infective bacteria that prevents topical antibiotics and other
      rinses to penetrate to reach the bacterial. By disrupting biofilms, SYNRINSE allows them to
      be cleared from the sinuses. Second, SYNRINSE has been shown to interact with the polymers
      comprise mucus, loosening thick, sticky layers and reducing their ability to adhere together
      and to mucosal surfaces. Third, all of the components in SYNRINSE are biocompatible and
      soothing to sensitive nasal cavities.
