      tumor and normal tissue with safety and efficacy outcomes but there are no validated methods
      to consistently measure dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissue. In contrast to the
      standard clinical approach based on average dose to one target volume, this trial, sponsored
      by Biocompatibles UK, will explore an alternative two-compartment TheraSphere dosimetry
      methodology to calculate absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue
