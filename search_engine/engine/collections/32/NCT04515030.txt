      degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. There are different opinions on the
      pathogenesis of glaucoma, which further reflects that the mechanism of glaucoma optic nerve
      injury is still in the exploratory stage, and there is still a long way to go to develop
      effective drugs to prevent or reverse the visual function damage in patients with glaucoma.
      Therefore, on the basis of previous studies, our research group explored and expanded whether
      there were similar pathological changes in patients with clinical glaucoma not only in
      aqueous humor, but also in blood and tear samples, and further studied the mechanism. Three
      kinds of samples (aqueous humor, blood and tears) were collected from patients with primary
      glaucoma and age-related cataract treated in Sun Yat-sen Eye Center of Sun Yat-sen
      University. Normal people with matched age and sex were recruited as normal control group
      (normal control group only collected blood and tear samples). Three methods of inductively
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-ICP-MS), metabonomics and genomics were used to study
      the concentration changes of patients with primary glaucoma in three kinds of body fluid
      samples, and the related factors were analyzed combined with clinical data, so as to provide
      a new theoretical basis for studying the pathogenic mechanism and new prevention pathway of
      primary glaucoma.
