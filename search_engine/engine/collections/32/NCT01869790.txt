      diabetes self-management. Prior to admission the the clinical research center the basal rates
      and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of the subjects will be optimized using standard clinical
      procedures.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center in mid-morning following a light
      breakfast at home. Subjects will have several admissions and, in random order, will receive
      lunches with identical carbohydrate content but different fat content: lunch A will minimal
      fat content, lunch B will contain added butter, lunch C will contain added olive oil, and
      lunch D will contain added cheese. Total fat content in lunches B-D will be the same.
      Subjects will receive identical insulin doses (calculated using the subject's usual
      insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) for the meals. Blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose
      and insulin levels will be drawn for the subsequent 6 hours. We hypothesize that postprandial
      glucose levels 3-6 hours after start of the meal will be higher following lunches B and D,
      compared to lunches A and C.
