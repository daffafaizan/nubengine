      knee extensor muscles, which results in rapid fatigue and ultimately compromises elapsed
      standing time. The primary objective of this study is to improve the performance of
      neuroprostheses for standing by developing and implementing advanced stimulation paradigms
      that use multi-contact peripheral nerve electrodes to delay fatigue onset and prolong
      standing duration. The new stimulation paradigms will take advantage of the ability of
      multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes to selectively activate independent portions of a muscle,
      or independent muscles that perform the same action. Such a capability will allow one or more
      muscles (or parts of the same muscle) to rest while the others continue to contract to keep
      the knee extended and the user upright. Stimulation waveforms that alternate activation to
      multiple muscles performing the same function, rather than continuously activate the entire
      muscle group constantly, should allow muscles to rest and recover from fatiguing
      contractions.

      In addition to these important clinical benefits, the project is also of high impact and
      significance because the methods to be developed will not be specific to any single electrode
      technology or stimulation system. Any clinical or therapeutic application that requires a
      sustained muscular contraction or the production of constant joint torques for prolonged
      periods of time will benefit from the successful completion of this project.
