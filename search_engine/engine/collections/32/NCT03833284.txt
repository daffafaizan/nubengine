      represents an important health disparity in the United States, and especially across the
      state of Kentucky. The best biomarker for the prediction of preterm birth is transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVU) measurement of cervical length. However, several unique provider and patient
      related barriers for implementation of this screening limit the widespread uptake of this
      evidence based practice in Appalachian KY. The investigators propose to adopt a dissemination
      and implementation science approach using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
      Research (CFIR) as the guiding framework for identification of key areas of knowledge
      deficits as well as attitudes, practices and perceived barriers among prenatal care providers
      and patients in eastern KY towards TVU cervical length screening using a mixed - methods
      design. This will be utilized to develop a multifaceted implementation strategy best suited
      for addressing and overcoming barriers identified by the target population in eastern KY. The
      investigators anticipate that such an implementation strategy will likely include an
      educational component targeting obstetric care providers and patients in addition to hands-on
      TVU cervical length evaluation as well as telemedicine support and surveillance. Three
      community based sites (Hazard, Morehead and Ashland, KY) will be recruited for implementation
      of this multi-component pilot program focused on community engagement and outreach targeting
      obstetric providers and their patients. At the end of the pilot implementation phase,
      acceptability of the study intervention and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated
      along with a preliminary assessment of effectiveness of implementation.
