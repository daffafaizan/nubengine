        -  Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of 6-month survival, in patients with
           advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine median survival time and the 1-year survival rate of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete), response duration, and
           time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perifosine daily for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
