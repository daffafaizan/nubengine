      after surgery. Physical capability testing assesses the ability to perform a number of common
      tasks: the distance a subject can walk comfortably in 6 minutes; the amount of weight a
      subject can lift, push, pull, and carry; and the ability to squat and work bending forward in
      the kneeling and standing positions. The results of this testing will be evaluated to
      determine whether the subject's physical capability meets the physical requirements of their
      job, based on their responses to a pre-study questionnaire. Each physical capability testing
      session will require from 1 to 1 Â½ hours of the subject's time. Physical capability testing
      will be provided without charge.
