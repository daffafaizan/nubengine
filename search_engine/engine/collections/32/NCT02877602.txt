      having a liver MRI, what information patients would like to receive after their MRI, and how
      patients would like this information communicated to them. Each individual will receive at
      least an MRI scan (LiverMultiScan), with many also receiving a FibroScan (Transient
      Elastography). Patients will then undergo a focused qualitative interview, as well as filling
      out a questionnaire. The interviews will be thematically analysed and trends identified by
      significance.
