    
      This randomized crossover study consists of an evaluation of either type of control algorithm
      (MPC or PID) as a part of the Artificial Pancreas (AP) device during two periods of 27.5-hour
      closed-loop control in a minimally supervised setting (outpatient research area at the
      William Sansum Diabetes Center, Santa Barbara, CA) separated by a minimum of 5 days and a
      maximum of 2 weeks. The 27.5-hour period includes: 2 announced meals (dinner and breakfast of
      65g and 50g CHO respectively) preceded with a dose of rapid-acting insulin equivalent to 100%
      bolus based on each subject's Insulin to Carbohydrate (I:C) ratio and 1 unannounced meal
      (lunch of 65g carbohydrates, same meal content as dinner); complete night from 12:00 am to
      7:00 am. The goal is to demonstrate that the AP device is able to maintain the subject blood
      glucose within a safe range at all times.
