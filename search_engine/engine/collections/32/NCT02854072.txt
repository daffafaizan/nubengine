    
      This study is designed as a phase III, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter
      clinical trial comparing GV1001 concurrent with Gemcitabine/Capecitabine versus
      Gemcitabine/Capecitabine alone in treating locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer
      patients. Patients will be treated until disease progression and will be subject to follow-up
      until death.

      Patients will be randomized equally between the two arms:

        1. Gemcitabine and Capecitabine

        2. GV1001+ Gemcitabine and Capecitabine
