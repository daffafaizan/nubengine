      The study will consist of:

        -  Placing a rectangular dosimeter film (dimensions: 21 x 30 cmÂ², 1mm thick) on the
           examination table under the sheet before installing the patient. This film is then read
           using a desktop scanner and specific software to determine the absorbed dose to the
           patient's skin. The film is not in direct contact with the patient and will not modify
           the standard procedure of interventional radiology.

        -  Collecting the weight and height of the patient

        -  Collecting the dosimetric information indicated in the dose report (RDSR) generated by
           the radiology equipment and automatically sent to the RDM DACS server at the end of the
           procedure (air kerma at the interventional reference point, dose area product,
           fluoroscopy time, X-ray tube, table and detector positions, field size, beam filtration,
           high voltage kV and mA current). This data is currently archived in a regulatory way,
           without modifying the usual patients' care pathway. This dosimetric information in
           addition to the technical information related to the equipment (radiology equipment
           brand and model, kerma calibration factor, examination table and mattress thickness)
           will be used as input data to the RDM software for skin dose calculations.

      These last two points are realized in the classic framework of the patient care pathway and
      do not modify the standard procedure.

      The comparison between measured and calculated absorbed dose for the validation of the
      calculation software will be done anonymously. The information collected does not permit the
      patient identification.
