      intensive care units (NICUs) in Turkey. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
      each participating centre and Turkish Ministry of Health, Turkish Medicines and Medical
      Devices Agency.

      Non invasive ventilated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and gestational
      age from 241/7 weeks to 296/7 weeks were enrolled within 6 h of birth. Infants with major
      congenital malformations, need of mechanical ventiation, need of entubation in delivery room
      and lack of parental consent were excluded. Enrolled infants will randomize into two study
      groups (NIPPV group and CPAP group). The short binasal prongs will use as interface. For all
      the groups, if the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) requirement is persistently higher than
      0.30 target SpO2 90-94%.

      For all groups Surfactant by "LISA" technique and with special catheter (LISAcath, Chiesi
      Pharmaceutics) of surfactant (Curosurf, Chiesi Pharmaceutics) 200 mg/kg.

      The primary end-point, need of mechanical ventilation within 72 hours following surfactant
      treatment, will compared between the groups. Short and long-term neonatal outcomes will also
      evaluate.
