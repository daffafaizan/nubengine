    
      Allergic rhinitis patients sensitized to at least one common aero-allergen who completed a
      three or five year period of allergen immunotherapy in our outpatient clinic between
      2002-2013 were enrolled in the study and patients with allergic rhinitis who received only
      medical treatment were chosen as the control group. Patients were separated in two groups
      according to sensitization patterns including pollens or house dust mites. All patients were
      evaluated before immunotherapy, in the first and the fifth years of treatment and two years
      after the treatment.
