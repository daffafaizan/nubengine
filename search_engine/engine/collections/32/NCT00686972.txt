      sugar load, as well as to a hormone called Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is released
      from your gut to maximally stimulate your pancreas. The release of this hormone increases
      when you eat food and it causes the pancreas to release more insulin than does sugar alone.
      Volunteers will have 22 visits over a two year period. Only people having Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass surgery, gastric sleeve surgery, duodenal switch gastric surgery or lap-band/gastric
      banding surgery may join. Seventy volunteers will be recruited to take part in this study.
