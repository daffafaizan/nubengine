      ResearchMatch (www.researchmatch.org) with 600 tobacco users across the country. The survey
      will ask participants for their preferences regarding hypothetical tobacco treatment
      programs. Participants will be randomized to 12 conditions (n=50 per condition). Each
      condition has a different combination of treatment options. The survey will also assess
      sociodemographics and tobacco use behaviors. All participants will be asked if they would
      like to receive information about the state's smoking cessation quitline. Participants who
      would like to receive information will be given the 1800-QUIT-NOW number and smokefree.gov
      website address.
