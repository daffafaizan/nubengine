      the second open label phase II trial the efficacy of Oleogel-S-10 alone was similar compared
      to a more invasive treatment with cryotherapy. Response rates of 85% with a clear-ance of
      more than 75 % of the lesions of the patients treated with Oleogel-S-10 over three months
      were reported. These encouraging results led to the present randomized, multicenter, double
      blind phase II trial. The efficacy of the treatment shall be tested in a double blind placebo
      controlled (petroleum jelly) fashion in order to obtain more reliable results for the
      planning of a phase III study.
