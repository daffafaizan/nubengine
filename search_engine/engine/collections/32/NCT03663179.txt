      inattention, and hyperactivity that emerge in childhood and frequently persist into
      adulthood. These symptoms are accompanied by deficits in cognitive control and risky decision
      making that can lead to negative psychosocial and health-related outcomes. With advances in
      the neuroimaging field, researchers are learning where and how self-control over decisions
      and behaviors is executed in the brain. This work points to the central role of neural
      activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) in self-control processes that
      contribute to healthy choices. Emerging evidence shows that activity in the prefrontal
      cortices and cognitive control circuits can be modulated using a noninvasive and safe
      intervention: repetitive TMS. This within-subject proof of concept study will investigate
      whether 20 sessions of TMS (versus sham stimulation) can enhance executive cognitive function
      in adults with ADHD.
