      advanced GIST. Each cycle lasts 28 days. There will be two treatment arms. On both arms,
      patients will continue the dose of imatinib mesylate taken during the period of disease
      progression. Patients will be randomized to one either a weekly or a daily perifosine
      treatment regimen at the time of registration.
