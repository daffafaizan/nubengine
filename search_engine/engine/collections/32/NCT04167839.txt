      settings to manage manifestations of sensory processing disorder. However, very few studies
      have investigated the effectiveness of sensory diets, and the results of these studies were
      mixed. Past studies also had methodological limitations. Therefore, this study investigated
      the effect of sensory diets on children's sensory processing skills, psychosocial skills, and
      engagement in classroom activities. This study used a single-subject ABCA design. Five
      children between the ages of five and eleven years participated in the study. The study
      consisted of an initial baseline phase A1, the control intervention phase B, sensory diets
      intervention phase C, and the second baseline phase A2. Each phase lasted for seven days. The
      PI videotaped each participant for fifteen minutes each school day during all phases to
      collect the data. The participants were videotaped during classroom group activities. Visual
      analysis of the data showed that sensory diets had a positive effect on participants' sensory
      processing, psychosocial skills, and classroom engagement.
