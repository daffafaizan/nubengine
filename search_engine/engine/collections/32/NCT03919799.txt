    
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes widespread microvascular
      damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Limited
      cutaneous systemic sclerosis is primarily cutaneous, affecting the hands, arms, and face.
      Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) is a more serious manifestation of the disease
      and is often rapidly progressive, not only involving the skin, but also involving internal
      organs including kidney, heart, and lungs.

      Subjects who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee-approved
      informed consent form and met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A
      total of 60 subjects will be randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive orally administered
      belumosudil 200 mg once daily (QD; n = 20 subjects), belumosudil 200 mg twice daily (BID; n =
      20 subjects), or matched placebo (n = 20 subjects) for 28 weeks. The study will be
      double-blinded for the first 28 weeks followed by an open-label extension of 24 weeks. After
      unblinding, the subjects in Group 1 and 2 will continue on the same belumosudil dose whereas
      the subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized to either belumosudil 200 mg QD or
      belumosudil 200 mg BID in 1:1 fashion.
