      to 100 new cases per year in dermatology consultation of the CHU of Bordeaux. Hemangiomas
      have a characteristic clinical course marked by early proliferation during 3 to 12 months
      followed by slow and spontaneous involution from 3 to 7 years. Occasionally, as well as
      esthetical damages, hemangiomas may impair vital structures, ulcerate, bleed, or cause
      high-output cardiac failure or significant structural abnormalities. Standard treatments
      (corticotherapy, interferon, vincristine…) lead to a stagnation of hemangiomas in some cases,
      but with frequent side effects.

      We observed that Propranolol, a beta-blocker usually used in neonates could lead to a
      decreased in volume of serious haemangiomas of the face (article published in New England
      Journal of Medicine).

      In this study, we proposed to determine the efficiency of 1 month-early treatment of
      propranolol in neonates aged less than 4 months affected by non alarming hemangioma and not
      justifying corticotherapy. This is a double blind randomized placebo controlled study of
      propranolol.

      Infants will be recruited from the dermatology consultation of CHU Bordeaux. After
      verification of eligibility criteria and informed consent of legal surrogates, infants will
      be randomized to receive either propranolol or either placebo. The infants will be observed
      during 1 month according to the following visits.
