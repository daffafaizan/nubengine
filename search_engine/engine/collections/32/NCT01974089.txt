      elderly patients. Risk factors are many including oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). Systematic
      screening of OD is recommended for at-risk popolations, however these resommandations do not
      specifically address elderly patients hospitalized with CAP.

      In this study OD is assessed in all patients by Volume-Viscosity Swallowing Test (V-VST) The
      study is registered by the Danish Data Protection Authority (2008-58-0028)
