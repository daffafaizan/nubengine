      overweight and their parents; 2) integrate TLC-HEAT with an electronic health record to
      provide child- and parent-reported behavior summaries combined with evidence-based decision
      support to primary care providers (PCPs) at the point-of-care (PC-HEAT); and 3) conduct a
      pilot study of the combined HEAT system to explore the appropriateness of conducting a
      larger, randomized clinical trial in the future.
