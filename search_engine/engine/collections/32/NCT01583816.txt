      trial with patients suffering from AK. Patients were observed for efficacy, local
      tolerability and safety. A total of 14 sites in Switzerland and Germany enrolled male and
      female patients over 18 years of age with clinically diagnosed AK lesions Patients were
      randomized to receive resiquimod gel (Treatment Arms 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) or matching vehicle
      (Treatment Arms 1-Pla, 2-Pla, or 3-Pla):

      Treatment Arms 1, 2 and 3: The patient was randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups
      and within each group there was one randomly assigned placebo patient for every two treatment
      patients (parallel-group randomization; 2:1 active vs placebo).

      Treatment Arms 4 and 5: The patient was randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups
      (parallel-group randomization, 1:1).
