      purpose of screening patients for treatment protocols, and evaluating the natural history of
      arthritis and related conditions. Patients will be evaluated clinically, radiographically and
      serologically, and standardized data will be uniformly collected on all patients. Additional
      imaging using sensitive MRI methods will be obtained in some patients. The collected blood
      and tissue will be utilized for laboratory studies to continue research on the pathogenic
      mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis and related autoimmune joint diseases. Data from the
      history and physical examination as well as several disability questionnaires in the adult
      and pediatric population will be used to phenotypically characterize these patients and
      assess outcome and functional status. Any medical care recommended or provided to the
      patients will be consistent with routine standards of practice and provided in consultation
      with the patient's referring physician.
