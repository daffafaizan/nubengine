      strategies to increase institutional deliveries and improve childbirth outcomes. Second, the
      study will analyze one of the first implementations of direct rewards to providers for health
      improvement in a developing country. Third, the study will provide critical new insight into
      dynamics between demand and supply-side incentives in improving population health outcomes as
      either complements or substitutes.

      The study uses household survey to collect data from mothers on socio-economic, human
      capital, quality of life variables (including below poverty line [BPL] index components) and
      as well as information about deliveries, fertility histories, morbidity and mortality (for
      mothers, infants, and children), birth related complications, health service use and
      spending. Additionally, provider surveys will collect data on infrastructure, staffing,
      provider qualifications, provider knowledge and process measures of provider performance.
