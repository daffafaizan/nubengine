      factors still have many uncertainties. These uncertainties have hampered road to the clinical
      application. As the importance of in vivo environment has aroused more awareness, the
      investigators validated the hypothesis that the feasibility of self-regeneration
      prefabricated unaided by any in vitro culture process or exogenous elements.
