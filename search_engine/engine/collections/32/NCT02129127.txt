    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study. Symptomatic lower extremity Peripheral
      Arterial Disease (PAD) patients presenting for endovascular revascularization will be
      enrolled in the study if they meet all entry criteria. The study will include patients from
      New Zealand and the European Union. The endpoints were designed to establish safety of the
      DCC and to identify long-term clinical benefits of this technology.

      The patients treated in this study will be designated into the above the knee (ATK) follow-up
      schedule if they are treated with the DCC in the SFA or Popliteal vessels. This schedule
      calls for clinical visits with duplex ultrasounds at 1,6 and 12 months. Patients will be
      designated into the below the knee (BTK) follow-up schedule if they are treated with the DCC
      in the Peroneal, Anterior Tibial, Posterior Tibial or Pedal vessels. These patients will have
      clinical visits at 1, 3 and 6 months with duplex ultrasound at the 1 and 6 months visits
      only.
