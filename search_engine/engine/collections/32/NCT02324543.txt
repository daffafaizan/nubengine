      the study where the dose of irinotecan is increased until the highest safe dose of irinotecan
      is defined that can be given with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and cisplatin.

      After the safe dose of irinotecan in combination with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and
      cisplatin is defined, the second part of the study (Phase 2) will use these defined doses to
      look at how effective these drugs are against advanced pancreatic cancer.
