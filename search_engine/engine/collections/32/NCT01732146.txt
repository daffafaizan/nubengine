      impairments in neonates. Yet, therapies for birth asphyxia are currently limited. Hypothermia
      when applied within 6 hours after birth demonstrate partial improvement in outcome of
      newborns specially those with moderate form. Erythropoietin and its receptors are upregulated
      after brain injury in ischemic conditions. Systemically administered erythropoietin is
      neuroprotective in animal models of birth asphyxia. To date, one study demonstrate
      improvement neurologic outcome in asphyxiated term newborn under erythropoietin treatment but
      no reports evaluating beneficial of erythropoietin associated with cooling. This is a large
      randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of high dose erythropoietin on outcome
      at two years of asphyxiated term newborns undergoing cooling.
