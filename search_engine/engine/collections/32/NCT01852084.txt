      are identical with the exception of the addition of toric optics and axis marks on the
      posterior optic surface for the correction of astigmatism on the Model MX60T. Both lenses
      have an aspheric biconvex optic with a modified C haptic monoblock, single-piece design. The
      design and material of both the MX60 and MX60T allow them to be folded and inserted through
      small incisions to minimize the possibility of surgically induced astigmatism (SIA).
