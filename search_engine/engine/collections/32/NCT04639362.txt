      active in clearance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in peripheral blood (PB) and
      bone marrow (BM) but less so in lymph nodes (LN), probably due to the abundant expression of
      additional anti-apoptotic proteins within the LN compartment. The investigators hypothesize
      that due to the forced egress from the LN by ibrutinib, leukemic cells cannot escape from the
      apoptosis initiating effects of venetoclax, making combination of these drugs highly
      effective. Preliminary data from multiple ongoing trials on this combination are indeed
      promising, with not only superior rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) than
      other ibrutinib combinations but perhaps more important, achievement of complete LN responses
      in the majority of patients. Yet, also with this combination, a significant subgroup of
      patients are expected to remain with detectable MRD. A recent study showed that 6 cycles of
      obinutuzumab when given after at least 1 year of ibrutinib did result in MRD conversion in a
      significant proportion of patients (50%). The precise influence, timing and interplay of
      venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab on clearance of CLL cells in different compartments
      (PB, BM, LN), and achievement of uMRD and complete remission (CR) are not well known.

      Therefore, the investigators set out a study to evaluate whether patients who are not in CR
      or who have detectable MRD after 12 months of combination treatment with ibrutinib and
      venetoclax (15 months total treatment including three months ibrutinib lead-in) could be
      converted into uMRD CR with an additional 6 cycles obinutuzumab in combination with
      ibrutinib. In addition to efficacy, as measured by undetectable MRD rate, emphasis of this
      trial will be on clearance of different compartments (PB, BM, LN) at different time points on
      protocol and in follow up. In addition, the toxicity profile is taken into consideration.
