      I. Determine the efficacy of fenretinide, in terms of complete and partial response rates,
      duration of response, and survival, in patients with recurrent small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the induction of
      apoptosis or the expression of molecular mediators of apoptosis in tumor cells with response
      rates, response duration, and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment continues every 21 days
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.
