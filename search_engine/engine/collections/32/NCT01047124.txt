    
      A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a specialist mood disorder intervention versus
      treatment as usual will be conducted. Patients will be individually randomised with
      stratification by mental health trust to either treatment by a specialist team offering
      tailored psychological and pharmacological treatment or treatment as usual.

      The specialist mood disorders team will include a psychiatrist and health professionals
      providing cognitive behaviour therapy. Together the team will assess participants and then
      provide a co-ordinated and supervised combination of pharmacological and psychological
      treatment according to guidelines developed by NICE and the British Association of
      Psychopharmacology. Each participant will receive a treatment plan that is tailored to
      his/her specific needs. The participants in the treatment as usual team will have their usual
      access to the same treatments. The outcome in terms of improvement in depressive symptoms,
      function and costs will be examined after one year in service users with chronic depression.

      Eligible patients will be followed for 12 months and the primary outcomes will be observer
      rated depressive symptoms and cost effectiveness from a health and social care perspective.
      Along side the RCT, implementation analysis and audit of the standard care and specialised
      care for depression will be carried out.
