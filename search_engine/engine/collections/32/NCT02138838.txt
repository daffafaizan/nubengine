    
      This was a 24-week, randomized, multicenter, open-label, controlled study. Participants were
      randomized into one of two treatment arms; oral administration of cinacalcet daily in
      addition to standard of care treatment, or standard of care alone. Randomization was
      stratified by age group (6 to < 12 and 12 to < 18 years of age). All participants received
      standard of care which could include therapy with Vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation,
      and phosphate binders.

      Participants in both treatment groups who completed the 20-week treatment period and those
      who ended the study due to study closure were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension
      study (20140159; NCT02341417) for further safety follow-up.
