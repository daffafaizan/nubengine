      malignant and refractory benign hematologic disease, but is associated with life-threatening
      complications in the same time, among them, hemostatic disorders are not uncommon and
      presenting an increasing morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients. Bleeding and thrombosis,
      two of controversial disorders, have been posing a great threat to patients in the setting of
      transplantation, and early hemorrhagic complication after HCST is more frequent and subject
      to more concern by clinical physicians, previous studies have shown the risk of bleeding in
      HSCT recipients is more than 10-fold higher than neoplastic patients receiving chemotherapy.
      Meanwhile, thrombosis events, which is characterized by hepatic veno-occlusive diseases
      (HVOD), transplantation related thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), and venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) can not be imprudently ignored with its fatal threat to patients.

      Over the last two decades, it has been recognized that the relatively increasing incidence of
      bleeding and thrombotic complications correlating to the prognosis and quality of life for
      HSCT recipients. Previous studies have shown that conventional risk factors including
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, thrombocytopenia, the anticoagulation therapy,
      damage of endothelial cell and conditioning regimen can contribute to the onset of hemostatic
      disorders in HSCT recipients or can even exacerbate the process. Nevertheless, their roles
      and detailed pathogenesis in the development of bleeding and thrombosis remain undefined and
      limited data in Asian population was known about the competing risks of thrombosis and
      bleeding.

      Given the current understanding of hemostatic complication and many unknown mechanisms of
      relation between thrombosis and hemostasis，we undertook this prospective study to determine
      the incidence, predictor factors, specific pathogenesis, and survival specially for patients
      with thrombotic and bleeding complication to better improve outcomes.
