      to conduct a study of consecutive cases, including all patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria during the time of the study.

      Until now, there has not been an easy and convenient method to determine fetal cardiac
      function. Recently a new Software (Automated Cardiac Motion Quantification aCMQ) has been
      developed, and it seems that allows an easier analysis of this one.

      This study aims to analyze fetal heart function with the Strain method in healthy patients
      and then compare it with fetuses with risk factors for cardiac dysfunction.

      Initially, healthy pregnant patients who agree to participate in the study will be cited,
      after signing the informed consent, in order to evaluate the normal fetal cardiac function
      and see how it is modified in the different weeks of gestation.

      To do this, a fetal echocardiography will be performed by the investigators at week 24, 28,
      32 and 36 of pregnancy, using the aCMQ-Strain method.

      Once the investigators have established normality curves, fetuses with risk factors for
      cardiac dysfunction of women who agree to participate in the study will be analyzed. For this
      purpose, a fetal echocardiography at week 24, 28, 32 and 36 of gestation, using the
      aCMQ-Strain method will be performed.

      All tests will be carried out in the same study center and will be carried out by independent
      scouts.The data obtained in each test will be collected in an anonymized database for further
      study.
