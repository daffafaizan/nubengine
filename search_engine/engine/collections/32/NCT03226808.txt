    
      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events.

      Performance will be determined by assessment of the overall pain and functional performances,
      survivorship, health status and radiographic parameters of all enrolled study subjects who
      receive the Vivacit-E HXPE Liner with the Continuum acetabular shell.

      In addition, the implanted Vivacit-E HXPE Liners will be evaluated for bedding in, and linear
      and volumetric wear by the Martell 2-D method at 6 weeks and 1, 2, 4, & 5 years
      postoperatively.

      Pain and functional performance will be measured using the Harris Hip and High Activity
      Arthroplasty Scores. Survivorship will be based on removal or intended removal of the device
      and through analysis of radiographs, and health status will be determined by evaluation of
      the EQ-5D.
