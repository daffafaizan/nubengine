      ensure potential benefits gained are not harmful to that which we know to be of significant
      benefit to the patients, that being the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft (one of
      the main coronary arteries supplying your heart with blood). We are therefore proposing a 5-7
      year CT-Angiography (CTA) and Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS-MIBI) to assess the
      patency rate of the LITA graft and the stented graft in patients that have already undergone
      robotically assisted Hybrid CABG.
