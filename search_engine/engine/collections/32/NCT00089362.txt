      I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of
      17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Determine the effects of this drug on the expression of Hsp90 client proteins in normal
      and tumor tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-2 patients receive accelerated escalating doses of alvespimycin hydrochloride
      until at least 1 of 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cohorts are then
      expanded to 3-6 patients who receive escalating doses (in a standard manner) of alvespimycin
      hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is
      determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose.
