      implement cost-effective and scalable behavioral interventions to reduce risky drinking
      behaviors such as drinking and driving. Prospect theory proposes that messages framed in
      different ways can elicit different responses from individuals. Loss aversion refers to
      people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it's better to not
      lose $5 than to find $5. People are more motivated to avoid losing something than they are to
      win something. Studies have found that delivering messaging framed as a loss are also
      effective in motivating certain behaviors. On the other hand, gain-framed messages have been
      shown to have a positive effect on preventative healthcare. By using automated remote
      monitoring, innovative loss aversion and gain-framed messaging strategies incorporating
      insights from behavioral economics could be more easily implemented by delivering effective
      messaging prior to a risky behavior taking place. The investigators hope that the use of loss
      aversive and/or gain-framed messaging will lead to individuals improving planning behavior
      around drinking, especially in regards to drinking and driving. The objective of this project
      is to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable intervention using loss- gain-framed
      messaging to reduce drinking and driving, compare the effectiveness of each type of
      messaging, and to increase the use of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) monitors as a way to plan
      safer strategies when drinking. The investigators' long-term objective is to secure federal
      funding for research that leverages insights from behavioral economics supported by
      smartphone technology to reduce risky drinking.
