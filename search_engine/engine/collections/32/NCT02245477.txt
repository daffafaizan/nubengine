      circumference (AC) less than the 10th centileand severe SGA as an EFW or AC less than the 3rd
      centile. Foetal Growth Restriction refers to failure of the foetus to achieve its
      predetermined growth potential for various reasons.Foetus with foetal growth restriction
      (FGR) greatly contributes to perinatal mortality and short- and long-term morbidity. There is
      a 3-10 fold increase in perinatal mortality in pregnancies complicated by this FGR .The
      incidence of FGR in newborns ranges between 3 and 7% of the total population .FGR is thought
      to stem from placental hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction of the fetoplacental vessels, leading
      to placental hypoperfusion and thus fetal undernutrition. However, the effects of hypoxia on
      the fetoplacental vessels have been surprisingly little studied.Vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) is one of the factors that take part in placental angiogenesis. It is highly
      expressed during embryonic and foetal development..Angiogenesis involves the branching of new
      microvessles from pre-existing larger blood vessels.Angiogenesis plays a role in the
      development of the villous vasculature and the formation of terminal villi in human placenta.
      IUGR occurs as a result of the failure of elongation, branching and dilatation of the
      capillary loops and of terminal villous formation.
