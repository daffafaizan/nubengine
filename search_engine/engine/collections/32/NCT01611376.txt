      diameter of aorta. Great vessels in thorax has the lowest resistance, and their diameter
      changes by the beats of the heart. As their diameter increases, their resistance decreases.
      ICG measures the difference between the resistances caused by heartbeats, and calculates
      cardiac output.

      But during the surgery, there are many interfering electrical currents made by electro
      cautery, patient positioning, and internal organ handling. Therefore, it has been thought
      that ICG is not a valid tool for measuring cardiac output during the surgery.

      The investigators validated ICG's usefulness during the surgery, by comparing it with
      Floctac/Vigileo.
