      their mid to late 20s and often mirror the experiences of older adults (50+) living in the
      U.S. While evidence for successful population-specific health promotion programs and
      training, such as the 12-Week HealthMatters Program has been documented, an urgent need
      exists for continuous, readily available, on-demand training in these programs. Online
      training can substantially aid the widespread translation of evidence-based programs into
      practice and policy. Consistent with the mission of the Midwest Roybal Center for Health
      Promotion and Translation, our proposed study, HealthMatters@24/7 eLearning, is guided by the
      RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance
      of the HealthMatters Program for maximal positive impact on the health of people with IDD.
      The goal of HealthMatters@24/7 eLearning is to develop a low cost, readily accessible
      comprehensive staff training that will improve staff job performance, satisfaction, and
      organizational commitment to the provision of health friendly services while creating a
      productive and competitive workforce. These conditions will enable more community-based
      organizations to offer the program efficiently, thereby increasing access to HealthMatters
      among older adults with IDD.
