      marked post-operative hemodynamic failure (shock) due to the inflammatory reaction generated
      by the surgery and the extracorporeal circulation associated with the viral infection. In
      addition, in the absence of infection, 30-50% of patients will experience acute
      post-operative respiratory failure due to the combined effects of extracorporeal circulation
      and general anesthesia. The pulmonary tropism of the virus therefore is susceptible to
      increase in post-operative respiratory impairment.

      Thus, the infection is likely to favor the occurrence of post-operative shock but also to
      aggravate respiratory failure and other post-operative organ failures.

      Therefore, the investigators designed an observational study that aims at comparing two
      groups of patients:

        -  Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a negative Covid-19 PCR pre-operatively and in
           the 15 following days

        -  Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a positive Covid-19 PCR in the 15 days before
           surgery
