      12-month premium access Lumosity accounts. Study participants must be â‰¥18 years of age, and
      currently members of the Achievement Center participating in the cognitive wellness program.
      Those who consent will be provided with an account activation code and instructed on how to
      sign up for Lumosity.

      (Information About You, which includes age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, occupation) and
      two additional short surveys: a Computer Experience Questionnaire and a Perceptions of Brain
      Training questionnaire. In addition, participants will be assessed with the Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and be directed to take the Brain Performance Test (on a laptop
      or desktop computer) within the first 7 days of creating their account. If not conducted
      within the previous 3 months, participants would also be required to have the following
      assessments at baseline (i.e., within the first 7 days): Multiple Sclerosis
      Neuropsychological Questionnaire (MSNQ), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), and
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). After one week of using Lumosity, and then every other month
      for 12 months, participants would be asked to complete a short questionnaire about their
      experience with Lumosity. Every 3 months, participants would repeat the BPT, MSNQ, and BDI;
      and every 6 months, they would repeat the MSIS. Finally, at the end of the study, the end of
