      electronic decision aid to improve AML patients' understanding of their illness, prognosis,
      and treatment options. The objective of our program of research is to ultimately improve
      understanding about what patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) know and understand about
      their disease, as well as what kind of information AML patients want or need to further
      inform them about the treatment decisions they face.

      The AML Decision Aid tool consists of ten video modules, approximately 3 minutes each,
      containing content regarding key areas such as an explanation of what AML is, treatment
      choices, and things to consider when determining a treatment path. Recruited subjects will
      complete a series of surveys, both before viewing of the videos and after
