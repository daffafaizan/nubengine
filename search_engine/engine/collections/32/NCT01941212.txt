      upon gynecologic abdominal surgery. The literature search revealed studies reporting that
      participates who had pre-operative session of music intervention for relaxation experienced a
      greater level of reducing pain levels both pre and post their operation than in the
      participates in the control group. It is therefore a decision to include one pre operative
      session of intervention with music therapy in the design.

      The study will carry out at the Gynecologic Unit, in Rambam Hospital, Israel.
