      I. Evaluate the non-inferiority of patient health related quality of life (HRQOL) using the
      Global Health Score from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) in the 2 arms
      one month after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare treatment-related symptoms on HRQOL using European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Endometrial Cancer Module (EORTC EN24), question 48 between the two
      treatment arms.

      II. Compare cost effectiveness between the two treatment arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Report vaginal, bowel, and bladder symptoms on HRQOL using the EORTC EN24 the two
      treatment arms.

      II. Evaluate toxicities between the two treatment arms. III. Compare local recurrence and
      document patterns of recurrence between the two treatment arms. There will be two analyses: A
      single interim evaluation of patterns of recurrence will be performed after a minimum of 75
      patients have been accrued, and the second evaluation will be performed at the end of the
      study.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo short course vaginal cuff brachytherapy for 2 fractions with 1 week
      apart.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care vaginal cuff brachytherapy for 3-5 fractions over
      no more than 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months.
