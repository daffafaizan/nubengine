    
      Human donor lungs allocated to a participating study transplant center (Study Center) for a
      specific recipient and meeting study EVLP donor lung inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      assessed by SPONSOR for inclusion into the study.

      Upon retrieval, donor lung(s) will be packaged and transported on ice to the SPONSOR's EVLP
      facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, no differently than when lungs are recovered, packaged,
      and transported to any transplant center for implantation.

      The EVLP procedure will be performed by Certified Ex Vivo Lung Specialists using the Toronto
      EVLP System™ for up to 6 hours, collecting and relaying lung function assessment data hourly
      or as requested by the Study Center transplant surgeon. Additionally, the Study Center
      surgeon will have the capability to evaluate lung function data and monitor the procedure
      remotely through a dedicated video link.

      Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lung by the Study Center, the single lung or lung block is
      cooled down by the Toronto EVLP System™ to 10 degrees C. Thereafter, perfusion and
      ventilation are stopped and the lung is prepared for hypothermic storage and transport to the
      accepting Study Center.
