      I. Central nervous system (CNS) objective response rate at 12 weeks: defined as either a
      complete response or partial response provided there is no progression of extra-CNS disease,
      increasing steroid requirements, or worsening of neurologic signs and symptoms (NSS)^34
      Lesions will be measured using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability. II. Median progression free survival. III. Median overall
      survival. IV. CNS objective response rate and clinical benefit rate (complete response,
      partial response and stable disease lasting at least 6 months).

      V. Extra-CNS objective response rate according to RECIST1.1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and everolimus PO QD on
      days 1-21, and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment or treatment discontinuation, patients will complete 2
      follow up visits within 7 days and at 30 days and then will be followed for survival every 3
      months for up to 12 months.
