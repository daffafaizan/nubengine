      randomized into three groups: Group 1. Treatment as usual; Group 2. PRECIOUS system; Group 3.
      PRECIOUS system and Motivational Interviewing counseling. Researchers of this study will
      contact telephonically with potential participants and will ask for voluntary participation.
      Among those who agree, a face-to-face appointment at the reference hospital will be
      scheduled. In this appointment, general information on the study objectives and procedures
      will be offered.

      The length of intervention will be 3 months with the following scheduled follow-up
      appointments: week 2 (considering baseline as week 1), week 5, week 8 and week 12. In the
      follow-up appointments 2, 5 and 8, only doubts and questions regarding system use will be
      addressed (not specific measures will be collected). Two types of measures will be assessed:
      1) Primary outcome measures (at the end of the test) to assess usability, satisfaction,
      user's acceptance, and effectiveness of PRECIOUS system; and 2) Secondary outcome measures
      (baseline and final assessment) to assess different aspects of lifestyle and health habits.
      In addition, all patients will use a device to record heart rate during 3 consecutive days
      (week 1 and 12).
