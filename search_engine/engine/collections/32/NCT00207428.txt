      leading specialists, asthma is an inflammatory disorder. But asthma also is a paroxysmal
      disorder: many specialists underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. According to some
      authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma mechanism. But migraine
      and trigeminal neuralgia are also neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal diseases, and some
      antiepileptic drugs, like carbamazepine and valproates, are very effective in therapy of
      these diseases - more than in 80% of cases. If bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal
      inflammatory disease, we can suppose a possibility that some antiepileptic drugs also may
      show high efficacy in asthma therapy. Taken in consideration this hypothesis, we performed a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of carbamazepine efficacy in
      treatment of patients with mild-to-severe bronchial asthma.

      Comparison: Patients received investigational drug in addition to their usual routine
      antiasthmatic treatment, compared to patients received placebo in addition to their usual
      routine antiasthmatic treatment.
