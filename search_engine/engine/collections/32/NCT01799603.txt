    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      2-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a
      clinical trial) and randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance) study to assess the
      effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of TMC435 after a single dose in Japanese healthy
      adult male participants. The study duration will be of 44 days per participant, which is
      divided into 3 parts: Screening (from Day -28 to Day -2); Treatment (consists of 2 treatment
      periods of 5 days each [that is, Day -1 to 4, in-patient period], wherein all participants
      will receive TMC435 in the respective period, and the period will be separated by washout
      period of 9 days); and Follow-up (on Day 7 of Period 2). Participants will keep upright
      position from the time of study drug administration until 4 hours after study drug
      administration. Participants will not be allowed to ingest meal until 4 hours post-dose.
      Participants will have standardized lunch and dinner at 4 hours and 10 hours post-dose,
      respectively. Drinking water will not be allowed from 1 hour before the administration up to
      1 hour after administration except for the water served with the study drug and meal.
      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed in blood samples which will be collected up to 72 hours
      after administration of study drug. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
