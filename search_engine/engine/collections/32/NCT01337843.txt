      Wellness Workbook, for individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Wellness Workbook
      is an interactive online intervention that uses evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) strategies, behavioral activation and mindfulness training to increase chronic pain
      patients' quality of life. 198 patients with chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned
      to use the Wellness Workbook or alternative self-help materials for 10 weeks. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and at follow-up (18 weeks).
      Outcome measures include pain-related disability, pain severity, physical activity,
      mindfulness and pain-related attitudes and beliefs.
