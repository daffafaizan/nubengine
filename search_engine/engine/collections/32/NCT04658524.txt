    
      Cross-sectional study to be carried out on patients with stages 3, 4 and 5 in a Nephrology
      outpatient clinic. Thyroid function is evaluated by measuring thyroid stimulating hormone
      (TSH), free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine and antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb)
      levels. Free Thyroxine (FT4) will be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in order to compare methods in this
      population.

      The glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) by the Chronic Kidney Disease
      Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI), and the CKD stages were defined according to
      the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes directives (KDIGO).
