      combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. They will receive
      intratumoral injection of SPIONs every other day for 3 times, followed by SMF for 2 hours
      every two days, and up to completion of 30 days, and conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      from day 1. The sponsor hypothesizes that SPIONs/SMF will act synergistically with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase the cancer cell killing, to increase the local efficacy
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to improve the ratio of limb retention. Then, all patients
      will be followed every 8 weeks, for the safety evaluation and cancer disease status until the
      end of the study.
