      pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. Evidence from observational
      studies suggests that elevated driving pressure is the main independent determinant of
      ventilator-induced lung injury, however clinical trials are needed to establish whether
      targeting low driving pressures can improve clinical outcomes in patients without acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

      Thus, ART-3 pilot is a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of a
      driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to a conventional strategy
      in patients without ARDS. Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical
      ventilation for less than 72 hours without diagnosis of ARDS. We will exclude patients with
      less than 18 years old; contraindication to hypercapnia such as intracranial hypertension or
      recent acute coronary syndrome; patients in which a high probability of death within 24 hours
      is anticipated and patients under exclusive palliative care. Eligible patients will be
      randomized to the driving pressure limited ventilation strategy or conventional strategy
      (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight). The primary outcome is driving pressure
      between days 1 and 3.
