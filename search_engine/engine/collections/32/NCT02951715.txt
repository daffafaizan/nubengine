      complaint of tinnitus. A full medical history assessment was performed, and each patient
      underwent an otoscopic examination, a basic audiologic evaluation. We selected the patients
      whose audiogram data met the inclusion criteria for NIHL: 1) bilateral typical NIHL audiogram
      and type A tympanogram; 2) hearing threshold above 4 kilohertz (kHz) was greater than 25 dB
      hearing level (HL); 3) audiogram showed the characteristic 4 kHz or 6 kHz notch (average
      hearing threshold was 10 dB HL higher than the baseline); 4) up-turn phenomenon appeared
      above 6 kHz or 8 kHz, and 5) symmetrical hearing loss threshold over bilateral ears and the
      disparity was less than 10 dB HL. Patients with other otologic diseases were excluded.

      A full medical history assessment was performed, and each patient completed the NIHL
      questionnaire (Supplementary S1), audiogram, tympanogram, speech discrimination test,
      distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) testing, pitch and loudness match of the
      tinnitus, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and serum zinc level analyses. All tests were
      repeated after 2 months of treatment with zinc gluconate (Zinga 78 mg, 10 mg elemental zinc),
      two tablets twice per day (40 mg per day).
