      time to progression, in women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. II. Determine
      the toxicity of letrozole in these patients. III. Determine the relationship between tumor
      receptor status, histologic grade, tumor aromatase activity, and tumor response in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive an oral letrozole tablet daily. Treatment continues for patients
      with complete or partial response until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with stable disease may discontinue therapy after 24 weeks. Patients are followed at
      1 month and then every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
