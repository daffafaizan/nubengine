        -  Develop a data repository for clinical and health-related quality of life outcome
           measures in patients with hepatic malignancies treated with image-guided therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, prospective, longitudinal study.

      Patients complete a standard questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life at
      baseline, during routine follow-up care after image-guided therapy, and then annually
      thereafter. Health and disease status and the development of other illnesses are assessed by
      medical record review.
