      expansion of extracellular volume, which corresponds to about 5% of body weight in absence of
      peripheral edema. In particular, sodium retention increases exponentially as glomerular
      filtration rate declines and is of primary importance in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
      Therefore, reduction of salt intake in renal patients allows a better blood pressure control.
      Despite the evidence collected on the beneficial effects of salt restriction in CKD,
      compliance with dietary prescription is generally poor in patients followed up in the real
      world of clinical practice. In the presence of poor adherence to salt restriction, diuretics
      agents become the cornerstone of treatment of hypertension secondary to CKD. Disappointingly,
      nephrologists are reluctant to "adequately" use loop diuretics in their hypertensive CKD
      patients, probably because of the fear of side effects and of the amazing absence in medical
      literature of studies of middle-long term on diuretic efficacy. Therefore, the primary aim of
      this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of loop diuretics on blood pressure control in
      patients affected by CKD.
