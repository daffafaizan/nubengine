      worsening of symptoms until fatigue or dyspnea at rest, low cardiac output defined by the
      clinical-hemodynamic profile, dobutamine dependence, and ejection fraction < 0.45,
      spontaneous breathing and receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The patients
      could have jugular ingurgitation, lower limbs edema, ascites and rales. Dobutamine dependence
      was defined by infusion for more than 15 days or an unsuccessful attempt of withdrawal.

      The exclusion criteria were serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL, serum potassium > 6.0 mEq/L,
      systolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg, aortic stenosis, and acute coronary syndrome in the
      previous 2 months. The patients were randomly assigned by permuted block of 4, stratified by
      sex, to losartan or placebo.

      The endpoints were change in B-type natriuretic peptide levels, cardiac index, pulmonary
      wedge capillary pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and successful withdrawal of
      dobutamine.
