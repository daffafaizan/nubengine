    
      The Primary Objective of the study is:

        -  Prospectively estimate the incidence of Respiratory virus (RV) infections in children
           with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory tract
           infection (LRTI) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital(SJCRH).

      The Secondary Objectives of the study are:

        -  Study the association between RV infections and clinical variables.

        -  Prospectively estimate the duration of RV infections in symptomatic children at SJCRH.

        -  Compare the sensitivity and specificity of the current molecular method of analysis of
           respiratory viruses with the FilmArrayTM method.
