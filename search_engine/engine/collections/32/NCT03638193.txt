    
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy with
      CART-meso cells in dose escalation design. The trial will begin in Cohort 1 and progress to
      Cohorts 2, depending upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment .

      Subjects will be enrolled serially, but infusions will be staggered to allow assessment of
      DLTs for determination of cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.

      Cohort 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso
      cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 2 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso
      cells cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Dose limiting toxicity is defined as any adverse reactions at level 3 or above that may be
      associated with CART-meso within 4 weeks after infusion.
