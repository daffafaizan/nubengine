      turmeric curcumin intake on the genomic landscape of NCCN very low and low risk patients
      managed with Active Surveillance. This will be measured by using genomic signatures in
      Decipher GRID and using the mixed effect linear model that tests for the interaction of
      treatment arm and time (base-line, 6 month and 12 month time points) with gene expression as
      the response variable.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness pre and post
      intervention by looking at genes and gene signatures associated with vitamin D and omega-3
      fatty acids pathways. Prognostic performance of GRID gene signatures will be evaluated using
      Active Surveillance 'Failure' (deferred treatment) as an additional endpoint.

      The exploratory objective is to be able to use predictive genes and/or genomic signatures to
      assess benefit from vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid and turmeric curcumin intake. This will
      only be possible once sufficient patient follow up is available.
