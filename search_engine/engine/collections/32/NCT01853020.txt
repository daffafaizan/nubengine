      administration mediates cerebellar versus forebrain-dependent associative learning in humans
      as assessed with eyeblink conditioning (EBC). In addition, a battery of motor function tests
      will also be administered (the CANTAB motor screening test, Grooved Pegboard Motor Task,
      paced finger tapping).
