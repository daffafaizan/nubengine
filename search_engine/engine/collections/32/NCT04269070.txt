      cardiometabolic biomarkers (measured via gut microbiome, blood draw) can be improved via
      regular intervals of standing and light-intensity physical activity (i.e., leisurely walking)
      in real-world office environments. This trial is meant to generate pilot data which will lead
      to additional clinical trials.

      Primary Hypothesis: Increasing both standing and light-intensity physical activity will
      improve biomarkers of metabolic function, as measured by blood metabolites and differential
      abundance of gut microbiome composition, compared to a control condition of normal workplace
      behavior.
