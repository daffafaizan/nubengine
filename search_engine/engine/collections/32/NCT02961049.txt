      process characterized by loss of dental hard tissues near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).
      The aim of this study is through a randomized clinical trial, double blind, splith-mouth,
      evaluate the retention rate of restorative protocols of Non-carious cervical lesion. The
      presence of gingival displacement with a retraction cord and the category of adhesive system
      will be evaluated. Two hundred and twenty teeth, with NCCL of depth greater than 1.5mm, of 55
      healthy patients of both sexes will be select. The teeth will be randomly divided into 4
      different groups according to the gingival displacement with retraction cord (yes or no) and
      adhesive system category (etch-and-rise and self-etching). Data will be collected, tabulated
      and submitted to statistical analysis.
