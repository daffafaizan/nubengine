      lowest levels of H3 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers that meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and have signed an informed consent. Subjects will be rank
      ordered from low to high based on their HAI titer. Subjects will then be assigned treatment
      based on a randomization to either active vaccine or placebo. The first two subjects dosed in
      each dose cohort will serve as sentinels and will receive active IP (not randomized).

      Subjects will receive a single dose inoculation of the H3N2 M2SR seasonal monovalent
      influenza vaccine administered intranasally as a liquid formulation, or placebo (saline). The
      sentinel subjects will be vaccinated in dose cohort 1 and a safety monitoring committee (SMC)
      will conduct a review of safety data, tolerability, reactogenicity, and clearance of
      infectious virus prior to dosing the remaining subjects of the cohort with active or placebo.

      After the last subject in the cohort has been followed for at least 7 days the SMC will
      conduct another review of safety data prior to proceeding to the next higher dose level:
      Cohort 2. The same processes of sentinel subject dosing and SMC review will be conducted for
      Cohorts 2 and 3.
