      nutrition resulting in the current epidemics of obesity, the metabolic syndrome and type 2
      diabetes mellitus (DM). Results from clinical trials such as the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) have demonstrated a significant potential for prevention of type 2 DM through lifestyle
      interventions to promote physical activity, a healthy eating pattern and weight loss. Yet
      these approaches are not being applied in practice. In fact, whether these approaches can be
      successfully implemented in the community is an unanswered question. The Healthy Living
      Partnership to Prevent Diabetes (HELP PD) was designed to address this knowledge gap in a
      community setting. It incorporates key translations of prior research to enhance logistical
      and fiscal feasibility and long term dissemination, including the use of a group-based,
      rather than an individual-based, intensive lifestyle behavioral intervention employing
      professionals and community health workers (CHWs), and delivery of the intervention in the
      community setting via expansion of an existing Diabetes Education Program (DEP). The trial
      has been continued for an additional 5 years, and the primary goal of the continuation is to
      test the long-term glucose lowering effects of the HELP PD intervention by randomizing the
      lifestyle group to continued group maintenance or a self-directed maintenance condition and
      to follow the UC group for additional comparison purposes. Demonstrating the longer term
      effectiveness of HELP PD will represent a key step in establishing the value of this approach
      to translation of DM prevention into the community. This crucial evidence will be used to
      support reimbursement policy for DM prevention, dissemination of the HELP PD CHW approach and
      generalization to other behaviorally influenced chronic diseases.
