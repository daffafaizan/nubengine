    
      The EKG pattern and medical records from the school survey from 1999 to 2002 in Taipei city
      will be reviewed, and the basic data of those with CRBBB, IRBBB and rsR' pattern will be
      recorded. Interview will be made and the echocardiographic measurements will be performed to
      identify associated cardiac defects. EKG parameters and QT, QTc, QT dispersion, QTc
      dispersion and HRV parameters will be obtained from a semi-automated system. Time domain and
      frequency domain measures will be calculated and expressed as SDNN, triangular index, SDNN
      index, total power, low frequency power and high frequency power. Mutational analysis and DNA
      sequencing will be conducted in those with CRBBB or Brugada pattern EKG, especially those
      with positive family history.

      Based on these data, the clinical significance of altered bundle branch conduction identified
      from a school survey may be defined. For those with isolated CRBBB or IRBBB, the adjunctive
      value of HRV and QT parameters will determined the high risk group, and 24 hour Holter
      recording and Treadmill exercise test will then perform in these patients to define
      association with ventricular arrhythmia.
