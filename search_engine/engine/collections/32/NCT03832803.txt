      envelope technique 1:1 into 2 groups. Group A followed the conventional drinking protocol at
      our centre (200ml prior to treatment) and group B were treated with an empty bladder.
      Baseline, end of treatment and 6 week follow up scores were prospectively collected for
      International prostate Symptom Score(IPSS), Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force -
      Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT SOMA) bowel toxicity and quality of life
      questionnaires. The investigators also looked at bowel and bladder Dose Volume Histogram
      (DVH) to ensure constraints were met.
