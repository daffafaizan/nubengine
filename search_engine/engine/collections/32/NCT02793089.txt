    
      This is a retrospective cohort study of 578 patients who had no risk of EP (672 fresh
      transfer IVF cycles) between January 2005 and December 2014. Few studies have reported the
      relation between hormonal levels and ectopic pregnancy (EP) in IVF. Investigators describe EP
      incidence according to estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels on hCG day and seven days
      later (hCG+7) or their variation between both days.
