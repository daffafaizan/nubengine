      terms of its fundamental and biochemically apparent effects and potential benefits. Most
      commonly, proponents of the application advocate that it may be beneficial for improving
      patient outcomes and for decreasing complication rate by attenuating postoperative insulin
      resistance. To date, however, no study with a sufficient sample size has been able to
      demonstrate that it has a marked value in clinical practice. Almost all of the clinical
      benefits ascribed to the application have been based on subjective well-being, which can also
      be provided with non specific simple beverages. A study conducted to show whether or not the
      application has direct influence on patient outcome, therefore, could significantly
      contribute insights on this topic. The present study was planned to consist of three study
      arms, namely: 1.Study group, which will be given high-carbohydrate beverage (Nutricia preOpÂ®,
      Numico, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) 2. Placebo group, which will be given flavored water,
      and 3. Control group (surgery after overnight fast). The revised power analysis shows that an
      accrual of 74 patients in each group would allow detecting a 15% difference in the rate of
      complications with 80% power at the 5% level of significance (two tailed). We hope we will
      have recruited at least 220 subjects at the end of a two-year course. Once the data recording
      is complete, this study will be the largest one ever conducted to investigate this topic.
