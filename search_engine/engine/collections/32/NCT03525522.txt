      which significantly influences the quality of life of the affected patients. Large majority
      of LS lesions is located in anogenital region where initial white flat papules usually
      develop into large, white patches of thin, itchy skin causing fusion of labia minora,
      narrowing of the introitus and burying of the clitoris. Most common symptoms are itching,
      pain, soreness, burning, dyspareunia and dysuria all strongly interfering with sexual
      function and patient's self image. Existing treatment options with systemic and topical
      medications (oral retinoids, topical steroids) have some drawbacks and recently the use of
      laser was proposed for treatment of LS. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of
      Nd:Yttrium Aluminum Garnet Laser (Nd:YAG) Treatment of Lichen sclerosus in comparison with
      topical corticosteroid treatment. Half of participants will receive laser treatment and the
      other half corticosteroid treatment and the results will be followed for 6 months.
