      statin in muscles by studying 7T MRS findings in patients who are currently experiencing
      statin-related muscle complaints or who have a history of severe reactions to statins (i.e.
      rhabdomyolysis, anti-HMGCR-associated autoimmune myopathy, or CK elevation > 10 times the
      upper limit of normal). We anticipate enrolling roughly 5 such patients. The protocol
      involves a single visit for a blood draw and MRS of calf muscle. The data will be compared to
      historical controls provided by the Advanced Imaging Research Center.

      Second, we will study the effect of short-term statin administration in 5 patients with a
      history of statin related muscle complaints and 5 controls with no statin related muscle
      complaints . Controls will be matched for age, weight, and body mass index. Patients will
      undergo a wash-out of lipid lowering drugs followed by a challenge with simvastatin 40 mg
      daily (similar to a statin withdrawal and rechallenge). We chose simvastatin since it is the
      most common statin that caused myopathy according to our preliminary data (as well as most
      other published reports). Each patient will have 5 visits. The screening visit will involve a
      review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, blood draw, questionnaire, and instructions to
      withhold all lipid lowering drugs until visit 1. Any patient with known antibodies to HMGCR
      will be excluded from the remainder of the study.

      Visit 1 will occur 2 weeks after stopping all lipid lowering drugs. A minimum 2 week period
      off lipid lowering drugs is required to allow clearance of any medication from the systemic
      circulation. Patients will undergo MRS of the calf muscle and a blood draw. Patients will
      then start simvastatin 40 mg daily.
