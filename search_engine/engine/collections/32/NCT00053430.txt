      persist following treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Specifically,
      costimulatory T cell interactions are impaired. The immune modulatory drug thalidomide was
      recently found to costimulate T cells. Pharmacologic T cell costimulation may compensate for
      the T cell deficiencies in people with HIV disease and improve immune function. This study
      will test whether thalidomide treatment enhances HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific
      immunity in patients with HIV and CMV, and will evaluate the effect of thalidomide on HIV
      replication.

      In this study, 40 HIV and CMV infected patients on HAART and 40 HIV uninfected CMV
      seropositive controls will be randomly assigned to low dose thalidomide or placebo treatment
      for 28 days. T cell responses and HIV replication and genetic diversification will be
      assessed.
