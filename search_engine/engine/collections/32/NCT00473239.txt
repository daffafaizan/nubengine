      at baseline and days 1,3,5,7 and then weekly for 3 weeks and then every other week for 6
      visits (total 14 visits in 4 months). The group not receiving supplement will be scheduled
      for short visits at baseline and in 4 months. At the beginning of the study we will measure
      your height, weight, skin color, and draw blood to measure your blood levels of Vitamin D,
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone. At each visit we will draw blood to
      measure your blood levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There will be fourteen blood
      draws for a total of 280 cc of blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons drawn each time) in the
      supplemented group. There will be 2 blood draws in the group not receiving supplements for a
      total of 60 cc of blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons drawn each time).
