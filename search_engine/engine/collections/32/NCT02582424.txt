      screening visit will be divided into two parts, a "pre-screen" in-clinic rapid lipid test
      (Cholestech) followed by a full screening blood draw to be sent to the central reference
      laboratory (CRL) for subjects meeting the Cholestech inclusion values for TG and LDL (see
      inclusion criteria below) on the pre-screen test. Subjects who do not meet the pre-screen
      criteria will be discharged from further participation in the study. Subjects must have
      pre-screen lipid values of LDL >/=70 mg/dl and triglyceride (TG) >/=180 and </=499. Subjects
      who meet these Cholestech criteria will have blood drawn for central reference laboratory
      (CRL) screening testing. For randomization, 80% of the subjects must have TG>/=200 mg/dl to
      proceed to the next screening step while up to 20% will be allowed to proceed to the next
      screening step with TG=150-199 mg/dl as long as the LDL is>/=70 mg/dl. Subjects who meet the
      CRL pre-screen lipid inclusion criteria will return 2-14 days later for the remainder of the
      full screening procedures. Subjects who meet all screening criteria will be randomized at
      this visit. Thus, the prescreening and screening-1 visits will occur at the same time and the
      screening 2 visit will also be the baseline visit. BMI will be calculated but is not a
      criterion for participation.

      Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion requirements at the screening 2/baseline visit
      will be randomized to receive one of the two (2) study products. Randomization will proceed
      in groups of 5 with 4 subjects having TG between 200-499 mg/dl before randomizing a subject
      with TG between 150-199 mg/dl. Subjects will return for evaluation 4 and 8 weeks after the
      baseline visit at which times adverse events (AEs) will be recorded, blood lipid studies will
      be done and subjects will complete a VAS for product tolerability. Laboratory studies will be
      drawn after subjects have been sitting for at least 5 minutes.
