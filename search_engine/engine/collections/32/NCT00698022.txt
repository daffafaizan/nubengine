    
      This is a 28-day, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient study of the
      administration of risperidone alone or in combination with mifepristone in healthy adult male
      volunteers. The primary study objective is to determine the mean change in absolute weight at
      Day 28 compared to baseline in normal healthy male volunteers treated with risperidone plus
      mifepristone or risperidone alone. The secondary study objectives are to determine the mean
      percent change in baseline body weight; and the proportion of subjects that gain less than 5%
      and less than 7% of their baseline body in the treatment groups.
