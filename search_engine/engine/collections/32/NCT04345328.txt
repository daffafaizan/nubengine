      surgery patients (Roux-en- Y gastric bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy) and in a control group a
      cross-sectional study with a single test day. On the test day, the study participants will
      consume a test meal that contains intrinsically labelled egg proteins and will take a capsule
      with 14C-glycocholic acid and a capsule with 3H-labelled polyethylene glycol. Participants
      will record a food diary 72h before and after the test day and during the test they will
      collect breath samples for 6h. Urine and stool will be collected respectively up to 24h and
      72h after consumption of the test meal.

      For the 1-year follow up study, the three patient groups (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Sleeve
      gastrectomy and control group with traditional weight loss therapy) will have 5 visits, a
      baseline visit and 4 visits after surgery or after starting traditional therapy. The time
      points after baseline include 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Each visit, a blood
      and stool sample will be collected, a 7-day food and stool diary will be registered and also
      weight loss will be recorded.
