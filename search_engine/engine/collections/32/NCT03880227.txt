      visual tasks, typically spending less time on salient features of the stimuli (e.g. core
      facial features or body movement in social tasks), and instead focusing on idiosyncratic
      features of an image or video. Poor visual attention in schizophrenia has been directly
      linked to poorer social cognitive performance (e.g. recognizing emotional expressions or
      social cues) which can impact an individual's day to day functioning.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive neurostimulation
      which has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in numerous psychiatric disorders. TDCS in
      schizophrenia has been demonstrated to improve a wide range of cognitive processes, and in
      healthy adults, tDCS has been demonstrated to improve aspects of social cognition. TDCS thus
      appears to be a promising therapeutic technique that may be useful for improving visual
      attention in patients with schizophrenia, and potentially impact social cognitive performance
      via an underlying mechanism tying the two. This study will compare visual performance in
      individuals with schizophrenia across two conditions: active anodal tDCS and sham tDCS, while
      also comparing between brain stimulation sites: rTPJ and dmPFC.
