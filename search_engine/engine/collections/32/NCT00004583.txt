      efficacy that is at least as good as (or superior to) nelfinavir when used in combination
      with reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

      Patients are equally randomized to one of two treatment arms. In one arm, approximately 330
      patients receive ABT-378/ritonavir plus nelfinavir placebo. In the other arm, approximately
      330 patients receive nelfinavir plus ABT-378/ritonavir placebo. In both arms, these protease
      inhibitors are blinded to the investigator, patient, and sponsor. Both arms receive
      open-label stavudine and lamivudine. Vital sign measurements, physical examinations, ECGs,
      routine clinical laboratory evaluations, and determinations of antiviral and immunologic
      activity are performed at intervals throughout the study.
