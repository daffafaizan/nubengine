      priority. IVRs have previously been approved as a delivery method for various medications,
      and this study will evaluate IVRs containing HIV antiretroviral medications. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a combination IVR called MK-2048A
      that contains vicriviroc (MK-4176) and MK-2048, compared to IVRs containing vicriviroc alone
      and MK-2048 alone.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected women, 18 to 45 years old. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive an IVR containing either vicriviroc, MK-2048, MK-2048A (which
      contains vicriviroc and MK-2048), or placebo. Participants will receive their assigned IVR at
      the enrollment visit, and the IVR will be removed on Day 28. Participants will attend study
      visits at screening, enrollment (Day 0), and Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 35.
      Study visits may include behavioral assessments, adherence counseling and assessments,
      medical history reviews, physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, pelvic
      specimen collection, and rectal specimen collection (optional).
