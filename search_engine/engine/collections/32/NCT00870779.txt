      test the overall hypothesis that there is a high degree of spatial correlation between local
      tissue FI signal and coregistered conventional imaging and corresponding histopathology.
      Additionally, coregistered probe measurements and biopsy specimens will be acquired
      intraoperatively. Biopsy specimens will be processed post-operatively (via fluorescence
      microscopy and chemical spectrofluorimetry) to assess PpIX concentration which will allow
      direct comparisons of FI signal strength with PpIX production (based on both in vivo probe
      data and ex vivo histological quantification) as a function of histological grade. The study
      protocol is outlined below. Because of the overall interest and importance of relating this
      data to the existing body of literature and the excellent safety record of oral
      administration of ALA reported in these trials [1, 33-36], we will use the same dose/time
      schedule described in [1, 33]. The operative procedures will follow existing practice at
      Dartmouth for image-guided resection of meningiomas, pituitary adenomas and metastases with
      additional acquisition of FI and biopsy data at predefined time points that are related to
      the expected volume of tumor tissue. In this first phase of the study, resection decisions
      will not be made based on FI data alone. Should residual fluorescence remain after the
      intended resection volume has been removed further excisions will require biopsy confirmation
      in the OR. It is anticipated that 234 patients will be enrolled in Stage I.
