      closure in return of bowel function, ventilator dependence, or length of stay.

      The primary outcome variable between the two techniques will be length of hospitalization.
      The likely variables will be length of time to meet discharge criteria, length of
      hospitalization, time to full feedings, time on mechanical ventilation and total hospital
      charges.
