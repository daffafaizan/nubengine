      by persons with MS. Persons with MS often use acupuncture as a way of controlling the
      symptoms of the disease. However, there is little research on whether or not acupuncture has
      any effect on MS symptoms related to movement. This study intends to look at the effects of
      acupuncture treatment on walking, balance, and mood in persons with MS.
