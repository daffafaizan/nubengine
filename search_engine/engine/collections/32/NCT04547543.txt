      positive air pressure (CPAP) aims to maintain an optimal level of care while offering to the
      patients a combined management of their pathology. This management aims to reduce the risk of
      cardio-metabolic pathologies.

      However, the high prevalence of OSA in the general population reduces the ability to explore
      undiagnosed patients. The contribution of videoconsultation is now available and allows the
      management of OSA patients treated by CPAP.

      The objective of this study is to compare the videoconsultation to a face-to-face
      consultation during the follow-up of apneic patients treated by continuous positive pressure
      (CPAP) .

      The results of this study could provide very important new data on the impact of
      videoconsultation on the monitoring a chronic respiratory pathology such as sleep apnea.
