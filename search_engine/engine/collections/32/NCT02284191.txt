    
      DESIGN: Open parallel group randomised controlled trial of early computed tomography coronary
      angiography (CTCA) in patients presenting with suspected/confirmed acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) to Emergency Departments (ED) and Medical Assessment Units.

      SETTING: 37 EDs, radiology, cardiology and acute medical services in tertiary/district
      general National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.

      TARGET POPULATION: Inclusion Criteria: Patient ≥18 years with symptoms mandating
      investigation for suspected or confirmed ACS with at least one of: ECG abnormalities e.g. ST
      segment depression >0.5 mm; History of ischaemic heart disease (where the clinician assessing
      patient confirms history based on patient history or available records); Troponin elevation
      above the 99th centile of the normal reference range or increase in high sensitivity troponin
      meeting European Society of Cardiology criteria for 'rule-in' or myocardial infarction (NB
      troponin assays will vary from site to site; local laboratory reference standards will be
      used). Exclusion Criteria: 1.Signs, symptoms, or investigations supporting high-risk ACS: ST
      elevation MI; ACS with signs or symptoms of acute heart failure or circulatory shock;
      Crescendo episodes of typical anginal pain; Marked or dynamic ECG changes e.g. ST depression
      of >3 mm; Clinical team have scheduled early invasive coronary angiography on day of trial
      eligibility assessment. 2. Patient inability to undergo CT: Severe renal failure (serum
      creatinine >250 µmol/L or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min); Contrast allergy;
      Beta blocker intolerance (if no alternative heart rate limiting agent available/suitable) or
      allergy; Inability to breath hold; Atrial fibrillation (where mean heart rate is anticipated
      to be greater than 75 beats per minute after beta blockade). 3. Patient has had invasive
      coronary angiography or CTCA within last 2 years and the previous investigation revealed
      obstructive coronary artery disease, or patient had either investigation within the last 5
      years and the result was normal. 4.Previous recruitment to the trial; 5.Known pregnancy or
      currently breast feeding; 6. Inability to consent; 7.Further investigation for ACS would not
      in the patient's interest, due to limited life expectancy, quality of life or functional
      status; 8.Prisoners

      HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED: Early use of ≥64-slice CTCA as part of routine assessment
      compared to standard care.

      MEASUREMENT OF COSTS/OUTCOMES: Primary end-point will be one-year all-cause death or
      subsequent type 1 or type 4b MI at one year, measured as time to first such event. Secondary
      endpoints: Key Secondary Endpoints : 1. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) death or subsequent
      non-fatal MI; 2. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) death or subsequent non-fatal MI; 3. Subsequent
      non-fatal MI; 4.Coronary Heart Disease death; 5. Cardiovascular death; 6. All-cause death.
      Other Endpoints; Coronary

      Heart Disease (CHD) death or subsequent non-fatal MI (type 1 or 4b);Subsequent Non-fatal MI
      (type 1 or 4b); Non-cardiovascular death; Invasive coronary angiography; Coronary
      revascularisation; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Coronary artery bypass graft;
      Proportion of patients prescribed ACS therapies during index hospitalisation; Proportion of
      patients discharged on preventative treatment or have alteration in dosage of preventative
      treatment during index hospitalisation; Length of stay for index hospitalisation;
      Representation or rehospitalisation with suspected ACS/recurrent chest pain within 12 months
      after index hospitalisation; Chest pain symptoms up to 12 months; Patient satisfaction at 1
      month; Clinician certainty of presenting diagnosis after CTCA; Quality of Life (measured by
      EQ- 5D-5L up to12 months). Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events; Proportion of patients
      with alternative cardiovascular diagnoses identified on CTCA; Proportion of patients with
      non-cardiovascular diagnosis identified on CTCA; Radiation exposure from CTCA as trial
      intervention. Cost effectiveness:

      Estimated in terms of the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
      gained.

      SAMPLE SIZE: 1,749 patients.
