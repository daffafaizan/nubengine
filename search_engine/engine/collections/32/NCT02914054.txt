      Introduction :

      Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by platelet
      destruction leading to decreased platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Mechanisms
      including autoantibody- mediated platelet destruction, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte platelet lysis,
      impaired platelet maturation and production has been identified in the pathogenesis of
      ITP.(1)The first line treatment of ITP is still corticosteroid therapy. Prednisone(PDN) is
      the standard corticosteroid therapy in ITP practical guideline usually given at 1 mg/kg per
      day for 4 weeks and then tapered.(2) Recent studies suggested pulsed high-dose dexamethasone
      given at a dose 40 mg/day to a 4-day course treatment as an alternative corticosteroid
      instead of prednisone to reduce the duration and the adverse effect of corticosteroid
      therapy.(3-5) A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared the 2 corticosteroid therapy
      and suggested that HD-DXM has more effective and better tolerance than PDN.(4) Another
      multicenter cohort study using repeated courses of HD-DXM (from 6 to 4 cycles, repeated each
      cycle 28 days to 14 days interval) confirmed the benefit as compared with conventional
      therapy and proposed as a first-line treatment for patients with ITP. Also there was no
      difference in overall response rate between the third and the fourth cycles of HD-DXM pulses
      therapy, using 3 therapy cycles with 14 days interval between each cycle, has been proposed
      for better safety and efficacy.(5) In this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial
      investigators' aim was to compare the efficacy and the adverse effect of 3 therapy cycles of
      HD-DXM versus conventional treatment with PDN for untreated adult patients with ITP. In this
      study standardized criteria and definitions were used according to consensus international
      working group guideline for ITP(6) to compare clinical outcomes of the two corticosteroid
      treatment regimens and determine the superior regimen as a first line strategy for new
      primary ITP in adults.
