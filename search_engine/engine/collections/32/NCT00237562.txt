      cancer project. Large loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed on SVP
      subjects with either a diagnosis of HGSIL/AGUS or suspicion of carcinoma. All other subjects
      with abnormal Papanicolaou smears were referred to our abnormal cytology clinics or received
      care in the community.
