    
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), Phase 3 study comparing the combination
      of trabectedin + DOXIL with DOXIL monotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (who
      were previously treated and for whom first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen has
      failed). Approximately 650 patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the treatment arms
      (DOXIL and DOXIL + trabectedin) over 2 years. At the time of randomization, patients will be
      stratified on the basis of platinum sensitivity of disease (sensitive or resistant) and
      baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (0 to 1 or 2. Safety
      will be evaluated on the basis of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical
      examination, vital signs assessment and cardiovascular safety assessment. An interim analysis
      of overall survival will be performed in conjunction with progression-free survival analysis
      during the study. Treatment will be continued until disease progression occurred or until
      patients experienced a confirmed complete response for at least 2 cycles. Continuation of
      treatment in select individual patients beyond this study end date will be allowed if the
      investigator determined that the patient is benefiting from treatment, is eligible to receive
      further therapy, and consents to treatment. If disease progression has not occurred at
      treatment termination, then disease assessment will continue every 8 weeks until there is
      evidence of disease progression or death, or until the clinical data cutoff date, or until
      the start of first subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
