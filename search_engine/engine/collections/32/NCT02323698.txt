      therapeutic intervention to promote functionally useful motor recovery. In this sub-study,
      the investigators will assess changes in leg motor function in response to repetitive AIH
      with and without caffeine.

      Participants will receive caffeine+AIH, placebo+AIH, caffine+SHAM in a randomized order.
      Before each intervention round, subjects will be asked to avoid caffeine-containing
      substances for 48 hrs (> 5* half-life of ~7 hrs) prior to arrival to control for baseline
      plasma levels of caffeine. Subjects will then ingest capsules containing either placebo
      (dextrose) or caffeine (up to 6mg/kg). Capsules will be prepared by Johnson Compounding &
      Wellness. Blood samples will be collected before and after the breathing intervention to
      assess caffeine concentrations within the body.

      During and after each intervention, both the rate and extent of magnitude changes in
      voluntary and involuntary muscle response behaviors important for walking will be compared
      between interventions within participants. Repeated measurements will be collected on all
      subjects that participate in the multiple interventions.
