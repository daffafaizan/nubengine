      local failures.

      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma management includes maximum safe resection followed by radiotherapy with
      concurrent temozolomide, followed by maintenance temozolomide for 6 - 12 cycles. This
      postoperative chemoradiotherapy approach has resulted in a significant increase in median PFS
      (5.0 vs. 6.9 months) and OS (12.1 vs. 14.6 months) compared to radiotherapy alone (Stupp
      2005). However, despite such multi-modality therapy, the median survival for GBM remains poor
      at approximately 15-16 months in contemporary series (Grossman, Ye et al. 2010, Gilbert, Wang
      et al. 2013 vs 2010).

      Recently, a randomized trial of tumor-treating fields (TTF or Optune) plus temozolomide
      demonstrated the benefit of this treatment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma that led to FDA
      approval of the device (Stupp 2015, Stupp 2017). However despite these advances, most
      patients still have a poor prognosis with median survival of 16-21 months. Although adjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy has been shown to increase survival, a predominant pattern of failure
      remains local (Chan, Lee et al. 2002, Milano, Okunieff et al. 2010). Therefore, better
      therapeutic options are needed for this disease.
