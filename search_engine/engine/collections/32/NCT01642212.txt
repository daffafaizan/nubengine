    
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory disorder of the esophagus and is a
      recognized clinical entity. Symptoms include feeding problems, heartburn, regurgitation,
      vomiting, abdominal pain and food impaction. The symptoms of EoE may be similar to
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but do not resolve with gastric acid suppression. EoE
      is defined histologically as the presence of > 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high power
      fields on one or more esophageal biopsy specimens.

      This Phase II study is comparing oral budesonide (OBS) to placebo to demonstrate that OBS
      induces a histologic response and a symptom response using a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire
      over a 16 week course of therapy.
