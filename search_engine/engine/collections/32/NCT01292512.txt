      200.000 bereaved close relatives. International studies show that 10-15% of bereaved persons
      develop complications following the death of a close relative. If those studies hold true,
      approximately 20 - 30.000 individuals annually will develop complications as a result of
      suffering a loss, and there is hardly any knowledge of how bereavement is treated or even
      legitimized in primary care and referred on to specialized (psychological or psychiatric)
      care. The field of bereavement is in need of studies that validate the theoretical
      underpinnings of the research area, enhanced assessment of predictive risk factors and
      updated intervention methods: in short a scientifically valid management programme.
