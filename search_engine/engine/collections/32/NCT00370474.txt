    
      MAGNET CRT is designed to compare magnetic navigation to manual (i.e., traditional)
      navigation in placing an over-the-wire (OTW)left ventricle (LV) lead at a target site
      identified by the investigator. This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial in which
      randomization (2:1, magnetic: manual navigation) will occur after the patient-specific target
      site is identified on two hardcopy x-ray images of the coronary venogram. The target area
      will be identified upon review of a venogram of the patient's coronary venous system taken
      during the current procedure.

      Other variables such as navigating through the vasculature to a potential target site
      (especially if the path is tortuous), achieving good contact with the myocardium, providing
      repositioning if needed, countering heart motion, retrograde blood flow, and maintaining a
      stable delivery system during the release of the lead, are all determinants in the success of
      LV lead placement.

      The Magnetic Navigation System (MNS) may thus aid in coronary venous vasculature navigation
      of guidewires for over-the-wire (OTW) left ventricular (LV) pacing lead placement by
      assisting in directing the tip of the guidewire, regardless of the tortuosity of a given
      patient's anatomy.

      No investigational products will be used in the conduct of this study. The NiobeÂ® Magnetic
      Navigation System and all Stereotaxis guidewires and other disposable products to be utilized
      have received US marketing clearance, and the protocol applications are within their
      specified intended use.
