      conditions such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis. Ischemia Reperfusion
      Injury (IRI) is a known problem that can happen during the first few days after a lung
      transplant. IRI can cause swelling of the lungs and low levels of oxygen. The most serious
      type of IRI can cause the transplanted lung to not work properly, it can even cause death.
      While new treatments and practices have been put into place to lower the chances of IRI, it
      is still a difficult problem to overcome after a lung transplant.

      Molecule called Adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) have been studied in animals with IRI for many
      years. Some of these studies suggest that with the use of A2AR agonist, the chance of IRI may
      be lowered or prevented. Regadenoson is a selective A2AR agonist.
