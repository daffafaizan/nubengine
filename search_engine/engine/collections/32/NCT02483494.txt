      hospitalisation in Singapore. Epidemiological data shows that the incidence of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) stands around 7000 plus in Singapore. In United States, nearly
      20% of patients with AMI are readmitted within 30 days of discharge causing the healthcare
      system a huge financial burden. These readmissions have been shown to be associated with
      lower patient satisfaction and less inefficient healthcare.

      Cardiac rehabilitation has been proven to be an effective strategy in improving quality of
      life and reducing readmission. However, this structured programme which comprise of clinical
      review, education and exercise, has poor uptake rate for varied reasons. It is important that
      newer strategies are being explored and developed to cater to the changing needs of the
      patient population. One of which is to utilize telemedicine with combination of Advanced
      Practice Nurse delivering the care remotely.

      This is a substudy of IMMACULATE STUDY (NCT02468349) where more details can be found.
