      repletion with saline is preferred used for initial therapy. However, administration of
      normal saline (0.9%NaCl) usually provokes sodium and potassium diuresis, thus, it might delay
      reversal of the hypokalemia.

      Object of this study : to evaluate efficacy and safety of IV administration of potassium
      chloride (KCl) plus 0.9%NaCl compare with KCl plus half-strength normal saline solution
      (0.45%NaCl) in correcting hypokalemia.
