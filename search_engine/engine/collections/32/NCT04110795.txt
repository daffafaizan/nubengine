      osteoporosis-related fractures. However, their long-term use has been associated with rare
      but serious atypical femur fractures (AFFs). Fear of these side effects has caused a
      substantial decline in the use of these effective drugs and rising fracture rates. The
      investigators propose to compare 330 cases of people with AFFs to 660 matched controls to
      explore similarities and differences in (1) clinical findings, such as type of ART and length
      of use, prior fracture, bone density, femur geometry, etc., and (2) genetic variants, and
      then (3) to validate the top few genetic variants to see if they are indeed present in an
      additional group of 100 AFF patients and not present in 100 control subjects. This study will
      determine clinical and genetic risk factors for these debilitating atypical fractures such
      that at-risk patients in the future can be treated differently to avoid them.
