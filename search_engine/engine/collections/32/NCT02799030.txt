      ingredient (ALA) in a nanoemulsion formulation in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK)
      with topical PDT and to assess the efficacy of topical PDT with a new nanoemulsion
      formulation of ALA in the treatment of AK. The efficacy of BF-200 ALA was calculated by the
      AK clearance rate, defined as the proportion of AK lesions showing complete remission 12
      weeks after PDT treatment.

      Subjects of two study centres provided plasma and urine samples for the quantification of ALA
      and its metabolite, the active photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX).
