      recovery and shorter postoperative hospital stay and no pneumoperitoneum complications occur
      after the operation. To our knowledge, there have been no reports about GSLS applied to the
      treatment of gastrointestinal cancer in the world. To explore the safety and effectiveness of
      GSLS in rectal cancer patients, this project plans to evaluate the operation time,
      cardio-pulmonary function, postoperative pain, immunologic function and restoration of bowel
      function after the operation.
