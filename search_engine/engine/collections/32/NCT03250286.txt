      patients with intermediate-risk choledocholithiasis. In other words, this results obtained by
      not performing ERCP in patients without choledocholith in the EUS examination. However, to
      the best of our knowledge, no prospective study has been conducted on the role of EUS in
      patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis. Therefore, we investigate the role of EUS
      screening in patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis. We compare the negative outcomes
      (including false negative and procedure-related complications of EUS and ERCP) of the
      'EUS-ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed when necessary after the EUS examination and the
      'ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed in all patients.
