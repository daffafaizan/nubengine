      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of parsaclisib in combination with R-CHOP in
      newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase I) II. To assess the complete
      metabolic response rate by positron emission tomography (PET) (PET complete response [CR]) of
      combining parsaclisib and R-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. (Dose Expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with parsaclisib in combination with R-CHOP. (Phase
      I) II. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of parsaclisib in combination with R-CHOP.
      (Dose Expansion) III. To assess the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS),
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). (Dose Expansion) IV. To further
      describe the toxicities associated with parsaclisib in combination with R-CHOP. (Dose
      Expansion)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of parsaclisib.

      Patients receive parsaclisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10 or 1-14, rituximab
      intravenously (IV) or biosimilar substitute, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      prednisone PO on days 1-5 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or biosimilar substitute on
      day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months during year 1
      and every 4 months during year 2. Patients who experience disease progression before the end
      of year 2 are followed up every 6 months until 5 years after registration.
