    
      Meniscal allograft is done through United States and Europe since the last fifteen years.
      Operative technique has regularly improved, especially because of new arthroscopic devices.
      The meniscal allografts to be used are taken from dead donors and then frozen according to
      all the reglementary aspects of tissue bank.

      The graft has to be ordered as soon as the patient is randomized ; the sizing of the graft
      ordered is important depending on the gender size and height of the patient and on the
      measures of the tibial plateau on X Rays.

      The arthroscopic procedure is done under general or loco-regional anesthesia. The graft has
      to be prepared with bone blocks attached to the anterior and posterior horn of the meniscal
      graft. These bone blocks will be fixed through bone tunnels and the meniscus itself will be
      sutured on the peripheral meniscus synovial rim.
