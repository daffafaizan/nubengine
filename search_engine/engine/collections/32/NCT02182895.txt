      for hospitalized patients. It is recommended that most critically ill patients should receive
      insulin infusion therapy and non-critically ill patients should receive basal bolus insulin
      therapy in the hospital.

      The study will test the hypothesis that treatment with saxagliptin is non-inferior to
      treatment with basal bolus insulin in this group of patients during their hospital stay. The
      study will evaluate the effect of saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, on glycemic control in
      non-critically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

      The primary outcome will be mean daily blood glucose levels during hospital days 2 to 5. The
      study is designed to detect a non-inferiority margin of 20% in the saxagliptin group as
      compared to the control group
