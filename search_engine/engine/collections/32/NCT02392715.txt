    
      Prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial

      80 COPD patients will be randomized into two groups. One group will receive general exercise
      training combined with inspiratory muscle training, 3 times a week, for a total of 36
      sessions. The other group will receive general exercise training combined with shame
      inspiratory muscle training, 3 times a week, for a total of 36 sessions.

      We will assess the difference of improvement in exercise capacity between the 2 groups with
      the 6 minute walking test. We will also assess the difference of improvement in quality of
      life with St-George's respiratory questionnaire. Finally the difference of improvement in
      maximal inspiratory pressure will be determined.

      Patients and investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group allocation.

      Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject. The data will be treated
      anonymously.
