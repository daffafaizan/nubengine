      cardiovascular medicine.

      Several patients with chronic heart failure also has Cheyne Stokes respiration pattern.
      Earlier studies have shown that this respiration pattern improves with Adaptive servo
      ventilator. We wish to investigate wether this leads to improved cardiac function.
