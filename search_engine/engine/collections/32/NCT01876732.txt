      (ESRD) patients on maintenance hemodialysis, and may increase erythropoietin stimulating
      agent (ESA) resistance, yet little is known about its prevalence in this population.

      METHODS: Serum vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels were drawn from ESRD patients
      prior to hemodialysis. All patients with MMA levels greater than 800 nmol/L had peripheral
      smears evaluated for B12 deficiency. Those with confirmatory smears were considered to be
      deficient and received intramuscular vitamin B12 injections for 4 months. Post-treatment MMA
      levels and smears were obtained. Erythropoietin dosages were monitored throughout the
      treatment period.
