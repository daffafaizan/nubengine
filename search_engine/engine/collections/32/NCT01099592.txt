      syndrome and who have major depression will all receive 12 weeks of treatment with the
      antidepressant citalopram and regular clinical management visits from a mental health
      professional. The objective is to examine the characteristics of depressed cardiac patients
      who do and do not show an improvement in depression with citalopram treatment. There is
      evidence that the causes of depression may be different in some people with cardiac disease
      than in individuals who do not have heart problems, and these differences may be at least
      partially involved in determining response to antidepressant treatment. Inflammation, one of
      the body's responses to the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries and
      blockages in the heart) may be particularly important in producing depression in cardiac
      patients. There may also be changes in the body's metabolism of tryptophan, a protein that is
      involved in making serotonin, and levels of serotonin are often low in depression. Other
      factors thought to influence the development of depression include childhood experiences and
      personality factors. Heredity and family history also seem to play a role in some people with
      depression and heart disease. Finally, some patients experience sleep apnea, interruptions in
      breathing while they are asleep, that can contribute to both cardiac disease and depression.
