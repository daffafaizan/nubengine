      to 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the primary tumor. Patients in the experimental arm receive
      triple therapy of induction, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy
      consists of docetaxel 75 mg/m², D1 and cisplatin 25 mg/m², D1-3 every 3 weeks for 2 cycles.
      Concurrent chemotherapy in the experimental arm consists of cisplatin 25 mg/m², D1-3 every 3
      weeks and Xeloda 2000mg/m², D1-14 for 3 cycles. Adjuvant chemotherapy consists of Xeloda
      2500mg/m², D1-14 for 2 cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy in the control arm consists of
      cisplatin 100 mg/m², D1 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.The primary endpoint is failure-free
      survival (FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free
      survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and the incidence of grade 3 or
      higher acute toxicities. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat
      population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly
      assigned treatment.
