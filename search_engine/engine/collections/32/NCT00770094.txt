      consecutive eyes scheduled to undergo excimer laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for the
      correction of myopia with or without astigmatism will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will
      have a different Excimer laser system performed in each eye. There will be 30 subjects (60
      eyes) in each group.

      Group 1: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront guided excimer laser treatment in one eye of
      the subject and the AMO/VISX CustomVue™ wavefront guided Excimer Laser System performed on
      the contralateral eye Group 2: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront guided excimer laser
      treatment in one eye of the subject and the Bausch and Lomb Zyoptix™ wavefront guided Excimer
      Laser System performed on the contralateral eye Group 3: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront
      optimized excimer laser treatment in one eye of the subject and the Bausch and Lomb
      Planoscan™ Excimer Laser System performed on the contralateral eye The choice of treatment
      will first be randomized into one of the three groups and then will also be randomized to the
      dominant eye prior to LASIK procedure according to the randomization schedule
