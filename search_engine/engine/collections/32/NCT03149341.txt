      disease and their associated operations as they pertain to real-life situations (i.e. upright
      and non-sedentary, rest and exercise). With this knowledge, investigators would look to
      optimize the geometry and physiology of the patients, potentially reducing several of the
      long-term complications found in congenital heart disease patients such as cardiomyopathy,
      pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, thrombosis and heart failure.
