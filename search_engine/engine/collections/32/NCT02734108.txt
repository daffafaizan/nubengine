      the cathode on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of 2 milli-Ampere is
      applied for 25 minutes each session.

      20 sessions will be conducted twice a day respecting a period of four hours between sessions.

      The tDCS sessions will start maximum 15 days after the inclusion visit.

      Two intermediate control visits will be conducted. One after the first week of tDCS, the
      other immediately after the last session of tDCS.

      The main assessment visit will be carried out one month (+/- 5 days) after the last session
      of tDCS. Finally a reminder visit will be performed 6 months (+/- 3 weeks) after the last
      session of tDCS to assess the stability over time of the potential effects observed.
