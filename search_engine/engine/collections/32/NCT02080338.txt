      slot sizes (0.018-inch and 0.022-inch). Both systems are used by clinicians worldwide with
      many orthodontists claiming clinical advantages and superiority of one system over the other.
      However, the scientific evidence supporting this area is scarce and weak. This leaves the
      clinician's choice of bracket slot system to be based mainly on empirical clinical
      preferences.

      Aim: To compare the 0.018-inch and 0.022-inch conventional ligation pre-adjusted orthodontic
      bracket slot systems in terms of the effectiveness of treatment.

      Methods/Design: Prospective, multi-centre randomised clinical trial, undertaken in the
      secondary care hospital environment in NHS (National Health Service) Tayside in the United
      Kingdom. Two hundred and sixteen orthodontic patients will be recruited in three secondary
      care centres in NHS Tayside, United Kingdom. The participants will be randomly allocated to
      treatment with either the 0.018-inch or 0.022-inch bracket slot systems (n= 108 for each
      group) using Victory conventional ligation pre-adjusted bracket systems (3M Unitek, Monrovia,
      California). Baseline records and outcome data will be collected both during and at the end
      of orthodontic treatment and will be assessed as follows:. Primary outcome measures: The
      duration of orthodontic treatment for the maxillary and mandibular arches. Secondary outcome
      measures: The number of scheduled appointments for the maxillary and mandibular arches,
      occlusal outcome (Peer Assessment Rating index), orthodontically induced inflammatory root
      resorption using periapical radiographs and the patient perception of wearing orthodontic
      appliances.
