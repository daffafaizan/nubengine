      that combines non-invasive measurements of oxygenation and perfusion in two ways. The first
      will use current equipment without automated interpretation and the second will require
      additional software/device but will automate the interpretation. To work towards development
      of those two algorithms in this stage of the study, the study team will download oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) and perfusion index (PIx) measurements from newborns with and without
      congenital heart disease (CHD) and apply statistical tests to the data afterwards to identify
      parameters to include in the newly developed screening algorithms. The overall objective is
      to create an automated screening algorithm to improve acyanotic CCHD detection, preventing
      morbidity and mortality associated with diagnoses missed by SpO2 screening. The central
      hypothesis is that the addition of non-invasive perfusion measurements to SpO2 will be
      superior to SpO2-alone screening for detection of acyanotic CCHD. The data collected during
      this study will be used to develop the two algorithms and the algorithms will be compared to
      the standard of care using statistical tests on the data after the fact (k-fold validation).
      The newly developed algorithms will not be tested in-situ on patients during this study.
