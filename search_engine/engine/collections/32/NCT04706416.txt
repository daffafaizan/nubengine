      novel coronavirus (COVID-19) positive will be recruited. Presenting to the emergency room of
      the study site, these cases will be treated with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) (700 mg every 12
      hours) as first-line treatment for 30 days. Standard of care (e.g., Remdesivir approved for
      emergency use in severe cases, ventilator for patients with respiratory failure, etc.) will
      be provided based on the patient's clinical needs, which will be at the discretion of the
      treating physician. The results of the patient's blood work (e.g. complete blood count,
      C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT], IL-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR],
      etc.), symptom progression, clinical severity, and outcomes will be collected on a daily
      basis during hospitalization until. The primary outcomes of interest are rates of intubation,
      mortality, and length of stay (LOS) following rapid administration of 700 mg NAG for
      COVID-19-related symptoms. Secondary outcomes of interest include: change in COVID-19 disease
      severity as assessed by the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement; symptom duration; ICU
      admission; supplemental oxygen use and duration; and change in inflammatory biomarker levels
      (CRP, PCT, IL-6, ESR). Finally, the safety profile of NAG was evaluated using patient medical
      records from Day 1 through discharge.
