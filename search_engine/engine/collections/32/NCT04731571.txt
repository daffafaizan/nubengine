           the different uncertainties on patient-specific planning margins. We determine the
           dosimetric uncertainties for patients during planning and delivery through the daily
           adaptive process. In so doing, we will determine the relationship between the dose
           distributions and the associated treatment outcomes.

        2. To perform retrospective clinical studies using patient data, we determine the
           relationship between dosimetry from plans developed using the optimized patient-specific
           margins (plans from (1) that are robust to uncertainties) and retrospective, clinical
           outcomes. This data will be used to inform daily adaptation and plan quality criteria
           for a prospective clinical protocol.

        3. To develop (with our clinical collaborators) a first-of-kind study to measure the
           efficacy of daily adaptive treatment with individualized planning margins, using
           clinical and quality of life (patient reported) outcomes, and to compare these against
           the conventional treatment approach, where a single treatment plan with population-based
           treatment margins is utilized for all treatment fractions.
