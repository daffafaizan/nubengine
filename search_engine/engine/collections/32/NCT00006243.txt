    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the immunological effects of immunization protocols utilizing MART-1:27-35
      (MART-1:27-35 peptide vaccine), tyrosinase (tyrosinase peptide) or gp-100 (gp100 antigen)
      peptides suspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) in the presence of two different
      concentrations of sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      II. Define the safety and toxicity profile of an immunization protocol utilizing varying
      concentrations of MART-1:27-35, tyrosinase and gp-100 peptides suspended in IFA in the
      presence of two different concentrations of GM-CSF.

      III. Collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy as it relates to parameters of immune
      function in patients with stage IV malignant melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tyrosinase peptide, MART-1:27-35 peptide vaccine, and gp100 antigen
      admixed in incomplete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12,
      and 24.

      ARM II: Patients receive tyrosinase peptide, MART-1:27-35 peptide vaccine, and gp100 antigen
      admixed in incomplete Freund's adjuvant SC and lower-dose sargramostim SC on day 1 of weeks
      0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24.

      ARM III: Patients receive tyrosinase peptide, MART-1:27-35 peptide vaccine, and gp100 antigen
      admixed in incomplete Freund's adjuvant SC and higher-dose sargramostim SC on day 1 of weeks
      0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24.

      In all arms, treatment may repeat every 3 months for up to 18 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
