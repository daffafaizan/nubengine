      used cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy in several kinds of
      cancer types in animals. OGX-011 is being studied in the treatment of cancer patients in
      combination with chemotherapy. In humans, OGX-011 in combination with hormone therapy has
      been shown to decrease the tissue levels of a protein called clusterin, which can be
      overproduced in cancer cells. Clusterin has been found to block cell death and makes cells
      more resistant to cancer therapy. Gemcitabine (GEM), cisplatin (CIS) and carboplatin (CARB)
      have been approved by Health Canada and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States
      for the treatment of patients with lung cancer.

      OGX-011 was administered as a 2-hr intravenous (IV) infusion on Days -7, -5, and -3 prior to
      Cycle 1, then weekly on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 21-day cycle; GEM was infused IV after OGX-011
      on Days 1 and 8; either CIS or CARB was infused IV after GEM on Day 1 of each cycle. Six
      cycles of treatment were planned. Most patients received OGX-011 at 640 mg, but 3 patients
      received OGX-011 at 480 mg dose; OGX-011 dose groups were combined due to the small number of
      patients who received 480 mg.
