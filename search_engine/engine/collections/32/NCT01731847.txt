      (FEES) are both promising approaches to enhance swallowing recovery for dysphagic patients.
      However, there is no literature on the effectiveness of combined application of these
      modalities in the treatment of patients with poststroke dysphagia. The purpose of this study
      was to prospectively investigate whether combined NMES, FEES and traditional swallowing
      rehabilitation can improve swallowing functions in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia
      after stroke.
