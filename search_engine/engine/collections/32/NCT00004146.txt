      I. To evaluate overall survival rate in patients administered CAI (carboxyamidotriazole) and
      radiation therapy to adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      II. To determine the toxicity of CAI when combined with cranial irradiation. III. To estimate
      correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters, including steady state CAI concentration,
      with toxicity and/or drug activity in this patient population.

      IV. To estimate duration of disease free progression with this treatment regime.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction therapy consisting of radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week plus
      oral carboxyamidotriazole once daily for 6 weeks followed by carboxyamidotriazole alone daily
      for 4 weeks. Patients continue on oral carboxyamidotriazole once daily as maintenance therapy
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly
      for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study over 1.5 years.
