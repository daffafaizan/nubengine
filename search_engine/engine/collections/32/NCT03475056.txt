      receive the investigational cAd3-Marburg vaccine at a dose of either 1x10^10 particle units
      (PU) (Group 1) or 1x10^11 PU (Group 2). The dose escalation plan included daily review of any
      new safety data by a study clinician, regular review of safety data by the protocol team and
      a staged enrollment plan with required interim safety reviews. The study began with
      enrollment of 3 participants into Group 1 (1x10^10 PU) at a rate of 1 participant per day.
      After at least 7 days of follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated participants, an interim safety
      review occurred before enrollment of additional participants into the group. No safety issues
      were identified; therefore, an additional 17 participants were enrolled to complete Group 1.
      When there was a minimum of seven days of follow-up safety data from the last enrolled
      participant in Group 1, an interim safety review occurred. Once no safety issues were
      identified, enrollment of participants into the next dose level began with the enrollment of
      3 participants at a rate of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of follow-up for the
      first 3 vaccinated participants in Group 2 (1x10^11 PU), an interim safety review occurred
      before the enrollment of additional participants into Group 2. No safety issues were
      identified and an additional 17 participants were enrolled to complete Group 2. Participants
      were followed for approximately 48 weeks.
