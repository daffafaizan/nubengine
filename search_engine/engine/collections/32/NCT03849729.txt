    
      This is a randomized, control trial to investigate the effect and safety of Phentermine in
      patients with obesity who need a bariatric surgery (BMI >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities or BMI >
      40 kg/m2).

      Screening will be made to select eligible participants before intervention. Participants were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups (low-calorie diet + phentermine 15 mg or low-calorie
      diet + placebo) for therapies during 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements (weight, body
      composition, body mass index and waist-hip index), serum metabolic profile (glucose, total
      cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR) markers of inflammation (IL-1, IL-6
      and PCR) and hepatic ultrasound will be measured 2 times for each participant. Surgical
      complications (anastomosis filtration, intestinal obstruction or stenosis, need to perform
      open surgery and mortality) will be evaluated. Adverse events associated with phentermine
      (blood pressure, cardiac frequency, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, euphoria, anxiety
      and insomnia) will be collected.
