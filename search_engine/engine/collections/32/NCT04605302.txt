      symptoms to try to resolve whether they have gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional
      dyspepsia, if they are older than the age of 60 with symptoms, or have alarm symptoms such as
      unexplained weight loss, persistent nausea and vomiting or if they have symptoms that are
      refractory to acid suppression therapy. Given the increasing burden of digestive disease in
      the US, the use of EGD is increasing in volume nationwide. EGD usually requires either
      conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia sedation, which has put an additional cost burden
      on the healthcare system. Since MCC or MCC-T does not require sedation, it offers an
      attractive option for both patients and clinicians alike.

      The aim of this study is to compare in the same patient the accuracy of the MCC and MCC-T and
      EGD in patients presenting with upper abdominal symptoms.
