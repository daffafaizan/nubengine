      future exacerbations or severity of asthma exacerbation is relatively unexplored. A Phase 2A
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving the use of one dose of the
      intravenous formulation of Benralizumab (0.3 mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg) in patients presenting with
      acute asthma exacerbation did not demonstrate difference in the proportion of subjects with
      >/=1 asthma exacerbation at 12 weeks when compared to placebo (33.3% vs. 38.9%; P=0.67).
      However, compared with placebo, Benralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59
      vs 1.82; P=0.01) and exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P=.02)
      in the combined groups at 12 weeks (secondary outcomes).

      The purpose of this study is to look at whether Benralizumab, an anti-IL5 receptor Î±
      monoclonal antibody given subcutaneously compared to placebo given subcutaneously, can
      increase time to first exacerbation, reduce health care utilisation and improve other asthma
      outcomes in patients presenting with acute severe asthma exacerbation requiring
      hospitalisation. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial design was chosen to reduce
      selection bias by randomisation and concealment of allocation, reduce analysis or
      interobserver ascertainment bias by blinding, and reduce bias introduced by exclusion after
      randomisation by using Intention- to-treat (ITT) analysis. In addition, biomarker stratified
      approach using spot BEC < or >/= 300 cells/microL during an acute exacerbation will be used
      to evaluate its role as a predictive biomarker for response to Benralizumab.

      The study aims to recruit 128 patients over a 2-year period at Singapore General Hospital and
      Changi General Hospital.
