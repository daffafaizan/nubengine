      chondrocytes diluted in hyaluronic acid, to be included in groups of 2, 4 and 4 participants.
      Only two participants will initially be included. If these two treated participants do not
      present adverse effects in 3 months, we will start a second stage with 4 participants. Again
      we will analyze the group over 3 months and if there are no problems we will include the 4
      final participants, totaling the 10 participants.
