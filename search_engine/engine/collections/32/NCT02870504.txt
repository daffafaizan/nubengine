      simple and effective treatment for angle closure glaucoma. LPI can widen or reopen an
      existing angle close or angle adhesion in order to reduce the risk of attack of the angle
      closure glaucoma. However, there are very little research on the laser site, laser
      wavelengths, laser energy and laser spot intervals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum laser site of LPI. Before and 7days, 1
      month, 3 months after LPI, the structure of anterior chamber, including angle anterior
      chamber depth(ACD), angle of anterior chamber (AA), anterior chamber angle opening distance
      750(AOD750) are measured with ultrasound biomicroscopy. Before and 7days, 1 month, 3 months
      after LPI, the outflow resistance of aqueous humor are evaluated with C value. Before and
      1hour, 1days, 3day, 7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, intraocular pressure are measured
      with Goldmann tonometry. Before and 3 months after LPI, retinal nerve layer thickness and the
      optic disc cup disc ratio are measure with optical coherence tomography.
