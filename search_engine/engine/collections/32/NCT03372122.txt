    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the ability of two test materials to
      remove Clostridium difficile (ATCC #700057) spores with a tripartite soil load from subjects'
      forearms. For this study, removal of Clostridium difficile and the associated organic soil
      load will be used as an indicator of potential removal efficacy for difficult-to-remove
      microorganisms and associated organic matter from human skin.

      All test materials are currently marketed products
