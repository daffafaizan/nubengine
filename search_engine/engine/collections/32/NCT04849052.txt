    
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of a multipronged intervention to promote
      physical activity in midlife adults (MASTERY), compared to an attention-matched control
      condition. In MASTERY, participants will have interactive, two-way text message 'sessions'
      (5-10 minutes of two-way text communication with an automated text-message program) once
      weekly for 12 weeks. The messages will focus on 3 distinct areas in the same order each week:
      (1) well-being-based skills and assigned activities, customized for midlife adults, (2)
      physical activity content focused on setting and reaching weekly activity goals, and (3)
      specific skills to manage midlife-related stressors that act as barriers to activity. The
      primary outcome is objectively measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
      Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability and other activity-related,
      psychological, and functional outcomes at 12 weeks.
