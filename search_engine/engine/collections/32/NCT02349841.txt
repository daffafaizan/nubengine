    
      A single-centre, open-label clinical trial including a total of 45 male or female
      participants (2 groups of 15 participants receiving an IMP and 1 group of 15 participants
      receiving Rifafour e-275), aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive), with newly diagnosed,
      smear-positive, pulmonary tuberculosis will be enrolled into this trial.

      Treatment will be administered for 14 consecutive days in the following dosing schemes:

        1. Meropenem 2g intravenously 8-hourly; plus amoxycillin/CA 500mg/125mg orally 8- hourly on

           guidelines (Rifafour e-275) and is included as a control for the EBA quantitative
           mycobacteriology and to evaluate whether HRZE gives similar EBA results to that
           demonstrated in prior studies with this combination. The mycobacteriology laboratory
           will remain blinded until closure of the EBA results.

      Participants will be admitted to the in hospital facility for a period of up to 24 days.
      During this period they will await their screening results after which they will receive 14
