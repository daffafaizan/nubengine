    
      This study will evaluate the predictive validity of a game-based screening system based on
      child self-report measures.

      The core study hypotheses are that (1) in-game assessments will predict problematic recovery
      (child pain and PTSS) and (2) parents in the intervention group will report greater
      confidence in managing child recovery.

      Study Design:

      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will examine validity of eScreen measures
      (primary aim) and assess the impact of the eScreen system on parent confidence in managing
      child symptoms and recovery (secondary aim).

      At T1, after baseline assessment (questionnaires), children will be randomized to the usual
      care plus eScreen (eScreen) or usual care alone (Usual Care) groups. In the eScreen group,
      children will use the game-based screening component and parents the parent information
      component for 6 weeks. All participants will complete follow-up research assessments by
      phone, online, or mail at T2 (6 weeks) and T3 (12 weeks). Following their T3 research
      assessment, child participants in the Usual Care group will have the option to play and
      provide feedback on the game (with no in-game assessment and no parent information
      component).
