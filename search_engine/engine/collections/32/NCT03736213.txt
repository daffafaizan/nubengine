      auditory and oral somatosensory acuity than typically developing (TD) speakers, but
      individuals differ in the extent to which each sensory domain is impacted. The objective of
      this aim is to evaluate how distinct sensory profiles mediate relative response to different
      types of biofeedback, with the goal of optimizing treatment through personalized learning.
      This study will test the working hypothesis that visual-acoustic biofeedback will produce
      larger gains in children whose deficit primarily affects the specification of the auditory
      target, while ultrasound biofeedback will produce larger gains in children with a primary
      somatosensory deficit. The main approach to testing this hypothesis is to select, from the
      larger population of children with RSE evaluated as part of C-RESULTS-RCT, a subset of 8
      children who show asymmetric sensory profiles (strong auditory and weak somatosensory acuity,
      or vice versa). These children will be enrolled in a single-case experimental design where
      individual treatment sessions are randomly assigned to feature visual-acoustic or ultrasound
      biofeedback. Participants will complete 20 hrs of treatment (10 days, 2 sessions per day)
      over a 5 week period. Acoustic measures will be used to evaluate /r/ production accuracy
      within each session. Randomization tests will be used to evaluate differences in accuracy
      between ultrasound and visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment conditions.
