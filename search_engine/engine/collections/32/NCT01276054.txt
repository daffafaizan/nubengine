      the incidence of lymphedema (LE) following axillary nodal staging. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.
      To document the use of a standardized LE screening and LE level-specific management protocol
      on the outcome of LE among patients who develop LE. II. To document the relationship between
      limb volume measurements assessed by infrared laser perometry and bioelectrical impedance
      spectroscopy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients
      undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) and/or axillary lymph node biopsy (ALND) using
      technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid followed by methylene blue or indocyanine green solution
      tracer for localization of the arm lymph node. Patients then undergo and axillary reverse
      mapping. ARM II: Patients undergo SNB and/or ALND using technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid
      followed by methylene blue or indocyanine green solution tracer for localization of the arm
      lymph node. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks, 3
      months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
