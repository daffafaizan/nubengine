    
      Prospective dual-arm, multicenter observational study to explore the predictive factors of
      checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) and to establish predictive models by combining
      imaging information.Patients will receive work-up, treatment and follow-up exclusively as
      routinely done except monitoring and evaluation of CIP. Necessary tests will be required,
      such as lung function tests, lymphocyte subsets, and thin-section CT of the chest during
      evaluation of the disease.This study mainly included patients with malignant tumor who
      received immune checkpoint inhibitors for the first time.Fasting venous blood was taken
      before treatment and before cycle 3,5...2n+1 of treatment. Then the blood samples were
      centrifuged and frozen in a refrigerator at -80℃ for later mass spectrometry analysis. IrAEs
      of patients was strictly recorded according to CommonTerminology Criteria Adverse Events V4.0
      (CTCAE V4.0). The main objective was to explore the relationship between various indicators
      and the occurrence of CIP, including pulmonary ventilation and diffusion function at
      baseline, C-reative protein(CRP), cytokines, interleukin-6(IL-6), CD4+ T lymphocyte count and
      percentage, CD8+ T lymphocyte count and percentage, NK cell count and percentage, total T
      lymphocyte count and percentage, neutrophil counts and percentages, eosinophilic cell count
      and percentage, white blood cell count, blood platelet count, serum albumin(ALB), alanine
      aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptadase（γ-GGT),
      body mass index (BMI), serum procalcitonin(PCT), smoking index and various inflammatory
      cytokines.

      Primary study endpoints: The predictive factors and the predictive models of CIP.

      Secondary study endpoints: The incidence and clinical characteristics of CIP.
