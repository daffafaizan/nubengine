      and atrophy typically involve facial and shoulder girdle muscles, and progressively anterior
      forearm and foreleg muscles and pelvic girdle muscles.

      The physiopatholgical mechanism of this disease, due to a deletion of repeated units named
      D4Z4 located on 4q35, is still controversial. Up to date, no curative therapy is available
      for these patients. We proposed in the present study to test feasibility, clinical and
      biological tolerance and efficacy of shoulder muscle training by electrostimulation in a
      group of FSHD patients. 10 patients displaying classical FSHD phenotype participate to this
      study consisting in daily session of shoulder girdle and quadriceps muscles
      electrostimulation of 23 minutes for a period of 5 months.

      We evaluated: clinical tolerance by daily pain and fatigue analogic scales, biological
      tolerance by measuring CK; feasibility: by measuring the monthly score of participation to
      sessions; the efficacy by manual muscle testing, quantitative muscle assessment, fatigue
      severity scale.
