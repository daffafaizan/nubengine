    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage exploratory
      study in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery.

      Stage 1) Patients will be randomized to receive either 4975 or placebo. The dose of 4975 will
      be escalated in a protocolized manner based on safety and tolerability.

      Stage 2) Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the selected dose of
      4975 or placebo. All patients will be observed in the hospital for at least two days
      following surgery for safety, tolerability, and efficacy assessments. In addition there will
      be two planned follow-up visits after hospital discharge.
