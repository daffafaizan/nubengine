      fibrosis can be seen in the post-transplant population. However, amelioration of inflammatory
      activity, and deceleration of fibrosis progression is a gradual process over the course of
      many years. This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the effects of IDN-6556,
      compared to placebo, on markers of apoptosis and inflammation, and liver histology.
