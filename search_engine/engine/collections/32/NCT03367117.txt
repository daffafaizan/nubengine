      and myelomas in the first line if they have bad prognostic factors or second-line cases of
      relapsed or relapsed patients. The essential condition for performing an autograft is the
      existence of a graft sufficient for this procedure. The European Society of Marrow
      Transplantation (EBMT) recommends to inject a minimum of 2 × 10 6 CD34 + cells / kg.

      Although in terms of conventional products (Neupogen® and Granocyte®), the literature is very
      rich, there is no data on the use of biosimilars in this indication. A PUBMED search using
      the terms "peripheral blood stem cell harvest, OR Zarzio® biosimilars" did not produce any
      results.

      Zarzio® has a tolerance and efficacy profile equivalent to "classical" products when used in
      post-chemotherapy, primary or secondary prophylaxis.

      It therefore seems important to compare its efficacy and tolerance in mobilization situations
      for peripheral stem cell sampling.The Investigator therefore propose a retrospective
      mono-centric study, to compare the results obtained in patients with myeloma or lymphoma,
      mobilized with Zarzio® to obtain a graft, with the results obtained in our study.
      retrospective cohort of mobilization by Granocyte®.
