      subjects are necessary. Each subject will have a clinical examination with measurement of
      height and weight. Personal medical history will be recorded and gonadal status evaluated.
      Biological standard workup will be performed and 80 ml of blood will be sampled and serum
      will be aliquoted, frozen and stored at -80Â°C. IGF-I level will be measured with all the
      assay methods available (sera kept in bank will be used in the future when new methods will
      be available) For each assay method and each age group (Four 3-years groups between 18 and 30
      years and six decade age groups between 30 and 89 years) IGF-I will be measured.

      Results will be expressed as mean, median, standard deviation, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles,
      in mass units. Modelisation according to age and other factors will be performed in order to
      allow the reporting of IGF-I results for a given individual expression of IGF-I as Z-score.
