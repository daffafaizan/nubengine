      overhead athletes with chronic shoulder pain participated. The effects of a 9-min, AP
      mobilization of the glenohumeral joint were compared with manual contact and no-contact
      interventions. Pressure pain threshold (PPT), range of movement (ROM), muscle strength,
      self-reported pain, and disability were measured immediately before and after each
      intervention.
