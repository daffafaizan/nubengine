      established but it is unknown what metabolic changes occur in 1-carbon metabolism to provide
      sufficient nucleotides for DNA/RNA synthesis. Periconceptual folic acid (FA) supplementation
      and fortification of the food supply have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancies with
      neural tube defects but conversely expose women to high FA intakes for extended periods of
      time. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to establish if physiological adaptations
      occur in folate metabolism in response to pregnancy or higher intakes of FA typically
      consumed among women during the reproductive period. A convenience sample of thirty-two women
      (n=8/group) were recruited to compare the total concentrations and forms of folate
      (tetrahydrofolate [THF], 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF and 5, 10-methenylTHF) in red blood cells
      in four groups: a) pregnant women (PW, 30-36 weeks gestation) taking 1.0 mg of FA b)
      non-pregnant women (NPW) taking 0 mg of FA c) NPW taking 1.0 mg FA and d) NPW taking 5.0 mg
      FA. Blood samples were taken at a single time point and compared across groups. Total red
      blood cell concentrations were measured using both microbiological assay and liquid
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was used to
      determine folate form concentrations.
