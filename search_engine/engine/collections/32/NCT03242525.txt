      treatment of coagulopathic emergency patients, knowledge of the hemostatic potential is
      necessary.

      After taking blood samples for coagulation diagnostics, they are sent to the central
      laboratory. After the analysis and validation the electronic provision of the results takes
      place. The loss of time by sample transport, analysis and breadth of the results extends the
      duration until therapy can be started.

      The period of time until these analysis results are determined depends on several factors
      like daytime, day of week and location of the sample consignor and the availability of the
      laboratory. Not every clinic is connected to an internal tube mail system so that the samples
      have to be sent partly with a transport service.

      In recent years, Point of Care (POCT) devices have become an increasingly important tool for
      diagnosing coagulopathic patients.
