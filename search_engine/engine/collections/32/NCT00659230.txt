      veterans with PTSD will have significantly reduced PTSD hyperarousal symptoms as defined by
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS], subscale D (CAPS-D).

      Secondary Hypotheses: Compared to placebo, nepicastat-treated OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD will
      have:

        -  Significantly reduced PTSD symptoms (total CAPS)

        -  Significantly reduced PTSD reexperiencing symptoms (CAPS-B)

        -  Significantly reduced PTSD avoidance symptoms (CAPS-C)
