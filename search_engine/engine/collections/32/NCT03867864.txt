      Eligible subjects are diagnosed migraine or tension-type headache nurses who are working in
      the critical care units and also have nurse license. Before conducting this study, the study
      has been approved by the institutional review board (IRB). The researcher (co-PI) and
      research assistances will approach potential participants during the ward meeting and invite
      them to participate in the study. Potential participants would be informed of the study
      purposes and interventions process, and be assessed and confirmed their type of headache.
      After completing the written-informed consent, the interventions will be arranged. In order
      to control the quality of data collection, PI and co-PI have trained the research assistants.
      Research training included standardized research process and ethical concerns about
      collection of research data, methods of approaching eligible subjects, interviewing
      techniques of data collection.
