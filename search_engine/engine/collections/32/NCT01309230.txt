      75% of women with Stage IIIC ovarian cancer who achieve a complete clinical response will
      relapse as will 50% of those achieving pathologic complete response at a median time of 18-24
      months. Phase III studies of both maintenance and consolidation therapeutic interventions
      have not translated into an overall survival advantage. Preliminary studies of immunotherapy
      in patients with ovarian cancer suggest target accessibility (potential immunogenicity) to
      immune mediated approaches. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer
      vaccines, we designed a novel autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil™, incorporating the
      rhGMCSF transgene and the bifunctional shRNA^furin (to block proprotein conversion to active
      TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, 2)
      effect antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen→immunogen), 3) enhance effector
      potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance. A Phase I assessment of
      Vigil™ vaccine in 33 advanced solid tumor patients (1 of them being a pediatric patient 15
      years of age) receiving ≥1 vaccination (at a dose of 1.0 x 10^7 or 2.5 x 10^7
      cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) demonstrated safety of the Vigil™
      vaccine. Furthermore, proof of principle was established in the manufactured vaccines with
      increased mean GMCSF expression post-transfection to 1135 pg/10^6 cells/ml and knockdown of
      furin, TGFb1 and TGFb2 at 78%, 93%, and 95%, respectively). In addition, although a Phase I
      study, the data suggested an overall survival benefit.
