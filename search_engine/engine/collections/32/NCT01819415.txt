      levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in exudative age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) in patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment. Patients are
      randomized to receive either Age-Related Eye Disease Study 1(AREDS-1) supplements formula
      with the addition of Lutein or AREDS-2 supplementation that adds Omega-3 metabolites (DHA and
      EPA) to the formula. Our goal is to take a limited volume of vitreous sample from these
      patients previous to their regular anti-VEGF injection and perform a comprehensive cytokines
      and lipidomic profiling. We hypothesize, based on our previous basic science discovery of a
      potent anti-VEGF action of an Omega-3 metabolite (4-HDHA), that lipid metabolite composition
      and metobolite levels will significantly vary according to VEGF levels.
