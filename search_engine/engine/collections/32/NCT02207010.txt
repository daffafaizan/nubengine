      There will be 2 portions of this trial, referred to as Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will involve
      a dose escalation strategy where 3 separate doses (100, 200, and 400mg) will be evaluated.
      Each dose cohort will involve 4 patients. Surgery, with tissue harvest for determination of
      both tissue drug level and biomarker evaluation, will occur at 8 hrs post drug
      administration.

      Part 2 will determine the potential tumor drug level and PD effects at various time intervals
      after drug administration of a single select drug dose. Currently, we are planning to use a
      dose (200 mg) that has been deemed safe when used in combination with cytotoxic therapy.
      However, if results from Part 1 suggest an alternate dose may be preferable, we will consider
      using that alternate dose in Part 2. Dosing will be followed by surgical resection at 2-4 hrs
      and at 22-26 hrs post dose.
