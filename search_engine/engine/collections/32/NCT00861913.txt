    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of single agent Pazopanib (pazopanib
      hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of Pazopanib on circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF).

      II. To examine the association between tumor response and B-Raf and N-Ras mutations.

      III. To examine pre/post-treatment expression levels of VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and Ki67.

      IV. To correlate baseline and changes in p-ERK levels in the tumor with response.

      V. To determine pazopanib steady-state trough plasma concentrations (Css,min) and the
      relationships between Css,min and the PD effects and toxicities of pazopanib.

      VI. To examine the associations of common polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, ABCB1, and
      ABCG2 with the PK and PD of pazopanib.

      VII. To Assess Progression Free Survival. VIII. To Assess Overall Survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsy at baseline and blood sample collection at baseline and
      on days 14, 28, and 42 for research studies. Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by DNA
      sequencing, ELISA, western blotting, and immunoperoxidase staining. Blood samples are
      analyzed for pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenetics by high-performance
      liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
