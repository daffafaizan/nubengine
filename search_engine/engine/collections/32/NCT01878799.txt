      180 million people infected worldwide. In the US an estimated 4.1 million people are infected
      with HCV which is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading indication for
      liver transplantation. Significant advances have been made with the approval of directly
      acting antivirals (DAA) namely the protease inhibitors, telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC)
      which have been shown to significantly improve rates of sustained virologic response (SVR).
      Response rates to these new combinations in HIV/HCV are also very promising, however
      treatment has been characterized with high rates of toxicities.

      Recently several trials have confirmed the efficacy of potent DAA therapy without concomitant
      IFN in the treatment of HCV monoinfected individuals. Given the improved response rates
      achieved with a combination of DAAs with fast HCV suppression and improved side-effect
      profiles; and the need for better therapy for HIV/HCV co-infected subjects, we propose a
      study to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with a
      fixed dose combination of GS-7977 and GS-5885 in HIV/HCV Genotype 1 (GT-1) subjects. We
      hypothesize that anti-HCV therapy that does not rely on the host immune system will provide
      an enhanced rate of SVR among HIV/HCV GT-1 coinfected subjects. The findings from this study
      will aid in our understanding of determinants of response to an IFN-free regimen in HIV/HCV
      coinfected individuals.
