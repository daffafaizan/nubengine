      obtained using the application of the smartphone (APP-Sleep Cycle®), polysomnography and
      questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-IQSP and Johansson). Subjects (n = 40) between
      19 and 60 years old will be submitted to polysomnography from January to December 2019. The
      questionnaires will be applied before the polysomnography, and the APP will be used together
      with the polysomnography. The data will be tabulated and a descriptive statistical analysis
      performed. Specific statistical tests will be determined after preliminary analysis of the
      data (α = 0.05).
