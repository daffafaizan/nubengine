      Anesthetic (numbing) drugs can be used to cause a loss of feeling in or around a wound but
      the effect of the numbing medication can be undone.Pain relieving drugs such as acetaminophen
      (Tylenol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioid (narcotic) medications
      can also be taken by mouth or through a vein in your arm (intravenous IV.) However, both
      NSAIDs & Opioid drugs can produce negative side effects such as serious difficulty breathing,
      stopping breathing altogether, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, itching, and
      constipation.

      Bupivacaine is one of the commonly used longer-acting numbing medicines (anesthetics). The
      effect of Bupivacaine or other anesthetics is limited to usually no more than 12 hours when
      injected around the area of the incision during surgery. Liposomal Bupivacaine (Exparel)
      could provide good, continuous and longer pain relief than current therapies/treatments
      commonly used. This can possibly improve patient satisfaction and time to normal activities
      such as walking.
