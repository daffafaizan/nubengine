      with a higher rate of male sexual dysfunction compared with the open approach. But these
      reports are studied retrospectively.

      We examine the frequency of bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction prospectively in patients
      who received laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      We examine before operation, 7 days after, 3 months after, 6 months after and 12 months after
      operation, by questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) 、Short Form-8
      (SF8)、International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short
      Form(ICIQ-SF)、International Prostate Symptom Score(IPSS)、Gastro-Intestinal Functional
      Outcome(GIFO)) and function tests (uroflowmetry and US).
