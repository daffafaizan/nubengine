      plus Varenicline program, designed specifically for early stage lung cancer patients and
      patients with a potential lung cancer diagnosis pre and post-surgery. The study population
      will be approximately 80 smokers who have upcoming lung resection surgery scheduled at

      either a lung cancer diagnosis or a potential lung cancer diagnosis, and 2) had a cigarette
      in the past 2 weeks, 3) is willing to make a pre-surgical quit attempt. Patients will be
      excluded from the control group if they are 1) non-English speaking, 2) determined medically
      ineligible by their surgeon/oncologist, 3) suffering from psychosis or dementia 4) is
      currently on Varenicline has been on Varenicline for more than 3 weeks, or 5) is otherwise
      unable to participate in the intervention. Patients will be excluded from the intervention
      group if they are 1) non-English speaking, 2) determined medically ineligible by their
      surgeon, 3) suffering from psychosis or dementia 4) have been taking Varenicline for longer
      than three weeks 5) have been taking Bupropion (for smoking cessation purposes) for more than
