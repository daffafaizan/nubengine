      mechanisms and ways. Hypertension as one of coronary artery disease risk factors and early
      indicator of future cardiovascular events with high blood viscosity and elevated blood
      cholesterol levels with immune-pathological basis became necessary issue to be handled. Low
      Level Laser irradiation effects on blood is very essential way in revealing the mechanisms of
      the action of laser radiation on biological tissues by means of changes in metabolism,
      leading to molecular, cellular and systemic changes.
