      spondyloarthropathies, is conducted In spondyloarthropathy's patients with refractory
      inflammatory buttock pain (fulfilling inclusion criteria), we performed outpatient guide-free
      sacroiliac injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in each joint. Patient (pain,
      stiffness, sleep disturbance) and Clinician assessments (sacroiliac tenderness, Finger to
      floor and Schober tests ) are recorded at baseline and every 4 weeks until the end of the
      study. MRI scoring of sacroiliac joint is recorded according to the Spondyloarthritis
      Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index for scoring
      inflammatory lesions in the sacroiliac joints, at baseline and in the end of the study.
