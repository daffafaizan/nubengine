    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of intrathecal delivery of
      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with
      ALS using a dose-escalation study. The trial will include 25 adult, non-ventilator-dependent
      patients with clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated
      from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous
      delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients
      each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2
      doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients
      will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding
      group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant
      toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2
      years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with
      scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations. After 1 month,
      patients will have clinical evaluations at 3 month intervals, or earlier if indicated by
      clinical status.

      Addendum: Five subjects from the Group 5 dosing level will received additional injections of
      MSCs in an extension of the original study, if tolerated.
