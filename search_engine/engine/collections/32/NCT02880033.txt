    
      The study collection of PBMC and platelets from 30 patient having Parkinson's disease 30
      patients having Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 30 healthy controls.

      The collection will be performed either by cytapheresis for half of the patient and by
      collecting the whole blood for the other half.

      PBMC and platelets will be stored at minus 80Â°C. PBMC of patients and controls are exposed ex
      vivo to different pathological condition (mainly Hydrogen peroxide, menadione, hypoxia...)
      with and without deferiprone to analyse whether the level of oxidative stress (Reactive
      Oxygen Species and notably hydroxyl radical with hydroxypethidine probe with flow cytometry)
      is reduced under deferiprone (primary criterion. Secondary analyses will concern the level of
      iron, the energy metabolism (aerobic versus anaerobic and the level of Adenosine triphosphate
      production), the type of cell death (apoptosis, autophagy and new programmed cell death:
      Ferroptosis) and inflammation. Finally, the level of growth factors and their effectiveness
      will be studied from platelets.
