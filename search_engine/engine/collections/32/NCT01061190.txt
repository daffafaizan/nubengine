      middle cerebral artery stroke patients. The primary hypothesis is as follows: Early
      administration of propranolol reduces the frequency of cardiovascular and/or neurological
      complications including vascular death in the first 30 days after acute ischemic stroke.
      Secondary hypotheses are as follows: Early administration of propranolol improves
      neurological and functional outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Early
      administration of propranolol reduces post-stroke immunodepression and therefore lowers the
      rate of pneumonia after acute ischemic stroke, without increasing the frequency of
      auto-aggressive, CNS antigen-specific T cells. Early administration of propranolol influences
      alterations in cardiologic, electrophysiologic phenomenons as a reaction to autonomic
      dysregulation after acute ischemic stroke. Early administration of Propranolol reduces growth
      of infarct as determined by MRI examinations in the first 6 days.
