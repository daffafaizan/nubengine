      including respiratory, hemodynamic, and peripheral muscle weakness. Bronchiectasis is
      characterized by irreversible widening of the medium-sized airways, with inflammation,
      chronic bacterial infection and destruction of the bronchial walls. In addition to pulmonary
      function worsening, extra pulmonary features such as reduced peripheral muscle endurance can
      be a significant physical problem which causing a decrease in physical activity levels.

      Despite physical activity is considered to be essential for the management of chronic
      respiratory diseases, there is a lack of scientific study, which compares physical activity
      levels between patients with bronchiectasis and healthy subjects.

      This study will assess physical activity level, exercise capacity, quality of life and
      peripheral muscle strength in patients with bronchiectasis compared to healthy subjects.
