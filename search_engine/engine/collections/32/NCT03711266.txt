      Mental Health and Wellness commission priority to provide "better access to high quality,
      coordinated and consistent service and care between agencies, service providers and across
      geographical boundaries."

      The project goals are to evaluate the delivery and sustainability of a brief trauma-focused
      treatment, Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE-PC), an evidence-based intervention for
      PTSD, when delivered via telehealth to patients enrolled at CHCs in Michigan. CHCs serve
      680,000 Michigan residents across 260 delivery sites. Ninety-two percent of CHC patients have
      incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Approximately 16 percent of CHC
      patients are uninsured, and more than 53 percent rely on Medicaid for their insurance. Thus,
      providing PTSD treatment to CHC patients will improve care to Medicaid enrollees and promote
      Mental Health and Wellness commission priorities of developing a trauma informed system that
      includes implementation of evidence-based trauma-informed care.

      To address the high burden of PTSD in Medicaid enrollees in Michigan CHCs, we plan to deliver
      PE-PC to patients in CHCs. This treatment consists of four 30-minute sessions of in-vivo and
      narrative exposure, with content drawn from the PE model. Recently published efficacy data
      from a randomized controlled trial showed that PE-PC significantly reduced PTSD and
      depression symptoms as compared to usual primary care treatment. These changes were
      maintained at 6-month follow-up.
