      issue for the past 30 years, and abundant data are available regarding its effects on
      patients. Several clinical guidelines have specified the criteria to be considered before
      initiating artificial nutrition or hydration. If these guidelines appear consensual in
      theory, the situation is much less straightforward in practice. The attitude of physicians
      appeared very variable when it came to prescribing or withholding artificial nutrition or
      hydration, and the lack of training, among other parameters, seemingly encouraged health care
      professionals to prescribe artificial nutrition or hydration. Furthermore, the decision of
      the care provider is unconsciously complicated due to figurative representations associated
      with food regarding, among other aspects, the mother-child relationship, social cohesion, or
      religious beliefs.

      These differences are more important since the opinion of physicians and nurses is the one
      that carries the most influence on the patients' decision when deciding to initiate
      artificial nutrition and because artificial nutrition and hydration are a common source of
      ethical dilemmas in health care teams. Furthermore, stopping artificial nutrition or
      hydration could be misconstrued as euthanasia.
