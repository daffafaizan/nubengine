    
      The optimal timing of cervical cerclage removal is yet unclear.

      In the present study we will evaluate maternal and neonatal outcome variables after elective
      removal of the cerclage, and may suggest a gestational week cut-off for optimal cerclage
      removal/

      Primary outcome:

      Neonatal respiratory morbidity after cerclage removal. The respiratory outcome will be
      compared across each gestational week of delivery after cerclage removal, that is; group 1
      (36-36.6 weeks), group 2 (37-37.6 weeks), group 3 (38-38.6 weeks), group 4 (beyond 39 weeks).

      Secondary outcomes:

      Time interval between cerclage removal and gestational age of delivery.
