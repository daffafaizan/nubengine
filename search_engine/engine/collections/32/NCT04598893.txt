    
      This study is the long-term extension of the PRV-031-001 (PROTECT) study. PROTECT is a Phase
      3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multi-center study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of teplizumab, a humanized, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, in
      children and adolescents ages 8 through 17 recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (within 6
      weeks of diagnosis). Approximately 300 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to
      the teplizumab or placebo and will receive two courses of treatment administered 6 months
      apart with final follow-up at approximately 18 months (78 weeks) after the first dose.

      Participants who complete the PROTECT study are invited to enroll in this observational,
      extension study to collect long-term safety and other clinical data. The decision to
      participate can be made within 6 months of completing the PROTECT study.

      No study drug will be administered during this extension study. Participants will continue to
      receive standard care for type 1 diabetes from their primary physicians.

      Participants will return to the study sites for assessments once every 6 months through Month
      42. Therefore, the combined duration of the PROTECT and PROTECT Extension studies will be 60
      months.
