      flu"). Bird flu is a potentially deadly disease that is caused by influenza virus from birds.
      It is not the same as the common seasonal flu for which there is a seasonal vaccine released
      around March each year. To date, bird flu due to the H5N1 strain of influenza virus has
      infected over 500 people mainly in Asia resulting in death in more than half the cases. More
      recently there has been an outbreak of another bird flu virus in China known as H9N7 that is
      also highly lethal when it infects humans. Vaccination is the single most effective measure
      to prevent infection from bird flu viruses such as H5N1 or H9N7 should such a pandemic occur.
      In the event of a major bird flu pandemic outbreak, vaccine supplies are likely to be very
      limited, as there is not currently sufficient manufacturing capacity to provide enough
      vaccine quickly for the whole population. Research is needed on how to make the pandemic flu
      vaccine more effective but also how to stretch vaccine supplies using a strategy called
      'antigen-sparing'. This can potentially be achieved by using an important ingredient called
      an 'adjuvant'. Adjuvants act by stimulating the immune system to make vaccines more
      effective. This study will test Advax adjuvants which are based on delta inulin in
      combination with recombinant hemagglutinin from the H5N1 influenza virus serotype.
