      underwent a dental implant surgery. Subjects were excluded from study enrollment if they had
      systemic diseases which affect bone metabolism, history of allergy to amoxicillin, refused
      study enrollment or failed to return for follow-up.

      Subjects were randomly divided into three groups : In group 1, subjects received prophylactic
      antibiotic orally (Amoxicillin 2mg ,1 hour before surgery) and post-surgical antibiotic
      (Amoxicillin 500 mg , q8h for five days), subjects received only prophylactic antibiotic
      (Amoxicillin 2mg ,1 hour before surgery) in group 2 ,and in group 3, subjects received
      post-surgical antibiotic (Amoxicillin 500 mg , q8h for five days) . An independent researcher
      made random allocation cards using computer-generated random. Then, allocated cases were
      placed in a sealed envelope. All subjects used 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash in the treatment
      period. All implants were placed with a two-stage protocol.

      All subjects were followed up for 3 months to assess any infection signs and symptoms.
      Infection was diagnosed based on clinical findings such as pain, redness of the area, and
      discharge around the fixture.An independent dentist who was blind the study groups, evaluated
      all subjects.
