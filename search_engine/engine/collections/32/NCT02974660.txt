      based on expert consensus from 2012, which recommends use of UFH in order to achieve
      activated clotting time (ACT) > 300 seconds as well as UFH reversal with PS in case of TAVI
      via transapical access as well as transfemoral access with the exception of cases with
      minimal bleeding risk. However, the clinical practice varies between centers - some use PS
      routinely, others - only in selected cases. The actual impact of PS on bleeding complications
      reduction is unknown. Furthermore, a pro-thromboembolic effect of the PS cannot be excluded.
      Both bleeding (major and life-threatening according to Valve Academic Research Consortium
      [VARC] criteria) and thromboembolic complications increase mortality after TAVI. The
      occurrence of these complications in international TAVI registries in 30-day observation
      ranges from 9.7% in case of major bleeding, 4.7% in case of life-threatening bleeds and 5% in
      case of strokes. There are no randomized studies assessing impact of PS on frequency of
      bleeding and thromboembolic complications after TAVI, its side-effects and influence on
      mortality. Randomized trial is required in order to assess impact of protamine sulfate on
      prevalence of bleeding and thromboembolic complications.
