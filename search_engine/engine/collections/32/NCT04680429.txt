      each cohort, six eligible healthy volunteers will be randomized to receive either RP7214 or
      placebo in 2:1 ratio. Within each cohort, two sentinel subjects (RP7214 and Placebo) will be
      dosed first for assessment of safety and tolerability. The safety data of at least 48 hrs
      will be reviewed to confirm safety of sentinel subjects after which the remaining four
      subjects will be dosed. Food effect study is a randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence,
      crossover study in 12 HVs.
