      an 8-week mindfulness based intervention, or wait for 8 weeks before receiving the
      intervention. MRI and a battery of self report questionnaires will be administered before and
      after the intervention; subjects on the waiting list will undergo the same research
      procedures at the same time as subjects in the intervention group. Primary hypotheses include
      improved hippocampal plasticity, increased mindfulness and reduced stress and related
      psychological symptoms.
