      inflammatory airway response in respiratory diseases, including COPD. PDE3 inhibitors act as
      bronchodilators whilst PDE4 inhibitors have anti-inflammatory properties and there is also
      evidence to suggest that combined inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 can have additive or
      synergistic anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects. PDE4 inhibitors (administered
      orally) have, however been associated with unfavorable gastrointestinal side effects such as
      nausea, emesis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Dual PDE3/PDE4
      inhibitors (administered by inhalation) have exhibited both bronchodilator and
      anti-inflammatory actions, with a more favorable side effect profile. It is plausible that
      increased efficacy with reduced side effects may be achievable with administration of a dual
      PDE3/4 inhibitor by the inhaled route compared to orally administered PDE3 or PDE4
      inhibitors.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the dose response of RPL554 in patients with COPD
      over 4 weeks. This length of time should allow for study of the bronchodilator response,
      measured predominantly by the peak forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the
      anti-inflammatory response, as measured predominantly by trough FEV1.
