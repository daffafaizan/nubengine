      disorder (OCD). This electrical stimulation has been tested on, and shown to be effective at,
      different targets (subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus & nucleus accumbens). However, the
      efficacies of each target have never been compared directly.

      Therefore, bilateral subthalamic and caudate electrodes will be implanted in severe OCD
      patients. Efficacy of stimulation at the different targets will be assessed using a
      double-blind randomised crossover design.
