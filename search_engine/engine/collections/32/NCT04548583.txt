      delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the
      submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.

      Patients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs
      (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical
      remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients
      observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will
      proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control
      patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be
      retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.

      There will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150
      million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control)
      receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24
      participants.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic
      injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory Crohn's colitis.
