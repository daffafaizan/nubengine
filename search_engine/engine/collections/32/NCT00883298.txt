      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Avastin is administered intravenously at a dose of 10
      mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days and temozolomide is administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2
      on days 1-5 and 15-19 every 28 days (one cycle). Patients will have a baseline MRI, an MRI
      scan after the first cycle and every other cycle after that. If there is no evidence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients will receive one year of therapy. If
      there is evidence of added benefit (eg: tumor regression), patients can stay on treatment
      longer than one year, per investigator discretion.
