    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, parallel study
      of participants with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD), comparing the efficacy and safety
      of olanzapine and fluoxetine Combination (OFC) versus fluoxetine in relapse prevention of
      stabilized participants with TRD. The study will consist of 4 phases: a screening phase; a 6-
      to 8-week open-label acute treatment phase; a 10- to 12-week open-label stabilization phase;
      and a 27- to 29-week double-blind relapse prevention treatment phase. Participants who
      demonstrate response to open-label OFC during the acute treatment phase will continue into
      the stabilization phase. Participants who remain stable while receiving open-label OFC during
      this phase will be randomized to receive either OFC or fluoxetine during the double-blind
      relapse prevention phase. Investigators and participants will be blinded to the precise
      duration of the stabilization period, the definition of remission, and the criteria for entry
      into the relapse prevention phase; this information is described in a supplement given to
      Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) and regulatory authorities.
