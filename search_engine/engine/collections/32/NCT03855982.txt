      of myocarditis. Those are poorly described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and
      the recent recognition of several of these adverse events. This study investigates the main
      characteristics of patients affected by myocarditis side effect imputed to drugs. A causality
      assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center)
      is systematically applied.
