      periacetabular osteotomy has been performed there is fine contact between the osteotomised
      acetabulum and the rest of the pelvis and the potential for healing is good. However, it has
      not been investigated how much the blood flow in acetabulum is changed after surgery. The
      blood flow is considered to be vital for how the pelvis heals after surgery. Most likely, the
      blood flow is important in relation to which degree osteoarthritis can be prevented after
      periacetabular osteotomy.

      It is possible to estimate the blood flow by Positron Emission Tomography of the dysplastic
      hip joint pre- and postoperatively. In this study the blood flow and fluoride uptake is
      quantified by Positron emission tomography based on measurements of O-15 water and F-18
      fluoride.
