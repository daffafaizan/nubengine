    
      In this single blind randomized clinical trial, 90 women with a clinical history of
      hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism who stopped any treatment with gonadotrophins >1 month before
      study, with a negative progesterone challenge test, low serum gonadotrophins (Luteinizing
      Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) less than 5.0 IU/l) and oestradiol (less
      than 100 pg/ml) and normal serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
      testosterone and prolactin within 6 months before the start of treatment are studied in the
      Royan Institute. Other causes of infertility are excluded from the study. All patients
      receive treatment with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (Gonal-F) and recombinant
      luteinizing hormone (Luveris). When at least one follicle reaches 14 mm in diameter, 4mg/day
      oestradiol is administered and patients are randomly divided into two groups: Luveris alone
      (intervention group) and continued treatment with both drugs Gonal-F and Luveris (control
      group). When at least one follicle detects a mean diameter of â‰¥18 mm and serum estradiol
      level reaches 500-2000 pg/ml, ovarian stimulation is stopped and injection of 10000 IU Human
      Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) is administrated.

      At the end, the number and size of ovarian follicles, endometrial thickness on the day of
      injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG), the number of oocytes retrieved, the number
      of good quality embryos, chemical and clinical pregnancy rate, fertilization rate and
      implantation rate will be compared between the two groups.
