      Fresenius Karbi), which is used in clinical application for liver conditioning. It is mainly
      based on the branched-chained amino acid leucine (13.09 g per 1000 ml). The investigators
      will combine this with a daily subcutaneous injection of Liraglutide. Liraglutide is a GLP-1
      analogue, which achieved meanwhile the FDA approval for weight loss treatment. Initial
      Liraglutide dosage is 1.2 mg for three days, boosted to 1.8 mg consecutively. Participants
      receive energy reduced nutrition with 1000 kcal/d.
