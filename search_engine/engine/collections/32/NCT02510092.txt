      ultrasound and optical coherence tomography and assess the efficacy and safety of new
      generation fully bioresorbable vascular scaffolds in a systemic autoimmune and coronary heart
      disease patient population.

      The following four well defined systemic autoimmune entities are linked to increased
      cardiovascular risk: rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, systemic
      sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. One of the main causes of death in systemic
      autoimmune subjects is cardiovascular disease. In-vivo intracoronary anatomy and pathology
      regarding systemic autoimmune diseases is unknown. Furthermore, all forms of
      revascularization in such patients yield sub-optimal results, with poor outcomes using even
      the most modern drug eluting metallic stents. This may be linked to a long term exaggerated
      chronic inflammation response to the metallic components. Thus, fully bioresorbable vascular
      scaffolds may prove more efficacious in systemic autoimmune subjects.
