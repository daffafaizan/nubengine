      using a syringe-like delivery system. In the wound, XSTAT® sponges expand and swell to fill
      the wound cavity, within 20 seconds of contact with blood, facilitating compression of
      bleeding structures. XSTAT® can be applied through skin wounds. The system can readily access
      deep vascular structures. While rapidly hemostatic, the hemostatic sponges are also
      relatively easy to remove. In the setting of junctional bleeding, XSTAT® may allow for
      hemostatic pressure generation from within the wound tract rather than from external
      compression (as with a tourniquet or manual compression).

      Hemorrhage should be controlled as early as possible, ideally before reaching a trauma center
      or medical treatment facility. Given its small size, low weight, and ease of application, the
      XSTAT® device is well-suited for prehospital use, in both the civilian and military setting,
      and this is probably where the device's applicability lies.

      The investigators anticipate that a full-scale trial will be conducted based on the questions
      this pilot study addresses, including the following:

        1. the number of penetrating junctional zone injuries encountered in the prehospital
           civilian setting.

        2. the feasibility of randomizing patients in the prehospital setting.

        3. usability.

        4. safety.

        5. validation of the proposed primary outcome of an efficacy trial.
