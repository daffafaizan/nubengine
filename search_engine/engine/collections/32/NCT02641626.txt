    
      Prospective, multicenter and randomized clinical trial. Survivors from Out-of-Hospital
      Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) who do not show ST elevation in their EKG will be recruited in the
      present study. Potentially non-cardiac ethiology of the cardiac arrest will be ruled out
      prior to randomization. Afterwards, patients will be randomized to emergent or deferred
      (performed before discharge) coronary angiography. Both groups will receive routine care in
      the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, including therapeutic hypothermia.

      The randomization will be in a 1:1 ratio to urgent or deferred coronary angiography.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of an urgent coronary
      angiography and angioplasty if necessary versus a deferred coronary angiography in survivors
      from OHCA who after recovery of spontaneous circulation do not fulfill criteria for
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of in-hospital survival and six-month survival
      free of severe dependence, which will be evaluated by using the Cerebral Performance Category
      (CPC) Scale, being good prognosis represented by the categories 1 and 2.The safety endpoint
      will be a composite of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events) including: death, reinfarction,
      bleeding or ventricular arrhythmias.

      A total of 166 patients will be included. The estimated duration will be 36 months, with a
      target follow-up of 6 months. Periods will be divided as follows:

        -  Inclusion Period (selection of the population and data collection): 30 months.

        -  Monitoring, data analysis, statistical and clinical report: 6 months.
