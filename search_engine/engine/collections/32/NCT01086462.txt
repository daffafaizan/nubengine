      GSK2239633 in rat and dog make it difficult to reliably predict the human PK profile. This
      microdose study will provide an early readout on the distribution and clearance profile of
      the drug in man and will be used to model potential clinical oral doses. The study will be
      conducted using an open-label, single dose design in one group of healthy male volunteers.
      Each subject will receive a single intravenous infusion of 100ug GSK2239633 (containing
      approximately 10kBq of [14C]-GSK2239633), administered over 15 minutes. Subjects will attend
      for a screening visit within 30 days prior to Day 1 and receive a single dose infusion of
      study drug on Day 1. Blood and urine samples will be taken over 48 hours for pharmacokinetic
      and total radioactivity analysis, and safety and tolerability will be monitored. Subjects
      will be discharged on Day 3 and a follow-up telephone call will be made 4-10 days post-dose.
