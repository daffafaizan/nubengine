      patients with diabetes mellitus. The visual loss of interest to be investigated is that
      associated with macular edema (prior to and following laser photocoagulation treatment) and
      that associated with panretinal photocoagulation. The evaluation will be performed with
      psychophysical testing, i.e., static perimetry and contrast sensitivity function. Of
      particular interest, the mechanisms of visual loss associated with macular edema (prior to
      and following laser photocoagulation) will be further investigated. Photoreceptor-mediated
      visual loss will be assessed by measurements of the Stiles-Crawford effect. Visual loss
      mediated by post-receptoral retinal changes will be assessed by measuring the Westheimer
      spatial desensitization/sensitization effect.
