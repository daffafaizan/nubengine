    
      Visceral Leishmaniasis, which is progressive and fatal if not treated, is an insidious,
      chronic disease that is characterized by irregular fever, anorexia, weight loss, cough, gross
      enlargement of the spleen and liver, mild anemia and emaciation. This may be preceded by
      rigors and vomiting. If untreated, Kala-azar, which is the most severe form of Leishmaniasis,
      has a mortality rate of nearly 100%.

      The goal of the project is to establish that a single dose of AMPHOMUL® can be used to
      achieve a Definitive cure for Visceral Leishmaniasis leading to a short course therapy. The
      project will also seek to establish that AMPHOMUL ® is safe, at least as effective and more
      affordable than current treatment, and is without the risk of drug resistance.

      The trial is a Prospective, Multicentric, Randomized, Two Arm, Open label Phase III study to
      Assess Efficacy and Safety of Infusion of Amphomul® (Amphotericin B Emulsion) as Compared to
      Liposomal Amphotericin B in Patients of Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala azar)who are either
      treatment naive or treatment resistant to other antileishmanial drugs.
