      platinum and taxane chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis over 75% of patients present with
      stage III or IV disease that has spread into the peritoneal cavity or distally. Despite a
      number of new chemotherapeutic regimens survival has improved only modestly over the
      preceding two decades. While overall 5-year survival has improved from 30% to 50%, 5-year
      survival remains only 25% for women with advanced stage disease. Given these findings it is
      clear that improved strategies for the delivery of cytotoxic and biologic agents are needed
      for women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

      A newer drug, called bevacizumab, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, lung cancer,
      and some types of breast cancer that have spread to distant sites in the body. A critical
      question which will need to be answered is whether or not it is feasible to administer a
      combination of bevacizumab with standard cytotoxic therapy using a neo-adjuvant approach for
      patients with epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum.
