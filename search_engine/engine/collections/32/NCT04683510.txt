      awareness-enhancing intervention (AWEI) or to the comparison condition in which they do not
      receive AWEI intervention but only the Adapting Multiple Behavior Interventions that
      Effectively Improve Cancer Survivor Health (AMPLIFI) basic recruitment strategy (No AWEI).
      Randomization for the AWEI Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will occur soon after the
      AMPLIFI recruitment letter is sent, and AWEI interventions will be delivered over a two-week
      period between the AMPLIFI recruitment invitation letter and the AMPLIFI recruitment call.
      Survivors randomized to AWEI intervention will be exposed to 8 different combinations of the
      AWEI components according to different types of strategies and type of information reflecting
      the survivor voice or not. Subsequent to the AMPLIFI recruitment call, a 20% random sample of
      cancer survivors will be surveyed over the phone to assess intervention fidelity.
