           pathology according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) / Union for
           International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging
           classification.

        2. Sample size: single arm design was used in this study and 52 participants were estimated
           to be enrolled.

        3. Research content: In this study, within 4-6 weeks after the completion of the operation,
           the participants were selected and qualified for this study, and were scheduled to
           receive 200mg camrelizumab once intravenous infusion on the first day (q3w), then
           130mg/m^2 oxaliplatin on the first day (q3w), and tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium
           capsule was taken as follow: surface area is less than 1.25, 80mg per day, twice a day;
           ≥1.25 ~ <1.5, 100mg per day, twice a day; ≥1.5, 120mg per day, twice a day, and oral
           administration for 1-14 days every 3 weeks. Three weeks as a course of treatment, a
           total of 8 courses, after treatment, safety visit and survival follow-up will be carried
           out. A total of 3 years follow-up time is scheduled since the first medication, and the
           frequency is once every 3-6 months within 2 years, and once every 6-12 months for the
           third year.

        4. Adverse events (AEs) management: To minimize the risk of AEs, the investigators will
           monitor carefully to determine whether or not they are within the expected range. The
           degree of AEs is evaluated according to The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
           Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v 4.0). Investigators will also conduct a
           thorough examination and adopt an appropriate system to take any necessary measures to
           deal with AEs.
