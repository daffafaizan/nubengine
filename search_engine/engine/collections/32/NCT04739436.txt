        1. To compare the hearing-aid benefit of unilateral versus bilateral fittings of
           commercially-available hearing aids that incorporate a dome coupling (open or closed
           dome as required by degree of hearing loss, or custom coupling if clinically indicated),
           which represents the most popular style used for mild to moderate hearing loss.

        2. To compare other multi-dimensional outcomes including hearing-related quality of life,
           hearing aid satisfaction in patient-nominated goals, ecological hearing aid outcomes,
           and hearing aid use.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To compare performance outcomes for unilateral versus bilateral hearing aid fittings

        2. To explore the differences in long-term patient reported outcomes for their final
           hearing aid configuration choice

        3. To explore patient experiences in each group (unilateral vs bilateral), and patient
           preference in regards to their choice of final hearing aid configuration.

      This study is being conducted at Duke and Vanderbilt Medical Centers, with Duke functioning
      as the main coordinating center. Study participants will pay out of pocket for the hearing
      aid(s), but will be able to extend the hearing aid fitting trial period from 60 days
      (standard of care) to 180 days (6 months). Participants will be given the opportunity to
      change their hearing aid configuration and/or return their hearing aid(s) for a refund after
      3 months, and again at the end of the 6 month study period.
