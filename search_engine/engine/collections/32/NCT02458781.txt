      (GHB) testing who meet inclusive and exclusive criteria will be randomized to receive either
      ciprofloxacin 500mg by mouth twice daily, metronidazole 500mg by mouth twice daily, or
      placebo by mouth twice daily. Subjects will complete a baseline symptom questionnaire and be
      treated for 14 days. Response will be assessed at end of treatment. The Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and GHB testing will be performed at the end of treatment.
      Subjects with a negative GHB at the end of treatment are considered as cured, or treatment
      success. Patients with treatment success will be reassessed for long-term response to
      treatment or disease recurrence at 30 days, 4 months, and 9 months using GHB. Symptoms will
      also be re-assessed at the 30 day, 4 month, and 9 month intervals with GSRS-IBS symptom
      questionnaire done prior to GHB testing.
