      and mortality. However the pathogenesis of the diseae is poorly understood and as yet no
      treatment exists. We believe that both myostatin and FHL-1 will be important in the
      development of this disease. This is based recent research and that both these proteins are
      likely to be regulated by sepsis and immobility (two major risk factors for ICUAP. There is
      evidence from invitro work that the two are likely to interact. We have designed an
      interventional trial to investigate the above hypothesis. Patients admitted to ICU and at
      risk of developing muscle wasting will be selected and receive electrical muscle stimulation
      of the quadriceps muscle for 1 week. Physiological measurements of peripheral and respiratory
      muscle strength and quadriceps size will be made pre and post intervention. And muscle
      biopsies, blood and urine collected from both legs pre and post intervention. The relevant
      molecular pathways can then be examined.
