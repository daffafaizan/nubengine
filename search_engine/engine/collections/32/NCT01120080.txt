      25 Quitline callers and 2) train Quitline Specialists to provide an alcohol intervention
      using at least 100 pilot Quitline callers to ensure that Specialists in the alcohol
      intervention + standard care condition provide counseling that addresses hazardous drinking
      with a high level of alcohol intervention strategies and skill. After this phase of the study
      is complete, a developmental randomized clinical trial will be conducted with 1,948 NY
      Quitline callers who drink at hazardous levels to compare practical counseling + smoking
      cessation print materials added to standard care (PC + SC condition) to alcohol intervention
      counseling + alcohol-focused print materials added to standard care (AI + SC condition).
      Efficacy data from this trial will be used to determine effect size estimates for both
      quitdate and 7-month self-reported point prevalence abstinence rates. Reduction in alcohol
      consumption and reduced drinking as a mediator of smoking cessation outcome will be secondary
      outcomes. Other mediators and moderators of alcohol intervention effects will also be
      examined as an exploratory outcome. If the effect size estimates are sufficiently large and
      medically important to pursue a definitive trial, these data will be used to propose a full
      scale multi-site large study. If an alcohol intervention is shown to enhance treatment
      outcome in a large-scale study, alcohol interventions with quitline counselors could be
      translated for use by the entire NY state quitline and other quitlines across the country.
      This may increase the effectiveness of quitline interventions and thus has the potential to
      reach millions of smokers, thereby bolstering tobacco and cancer control efforts across the
      United States.
