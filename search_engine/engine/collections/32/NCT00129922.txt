      Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic
      and predictive value of clinical and molecular markers. Associations and interactions will be
      assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following
      covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy,
      tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical
      tests will be two-sided.
