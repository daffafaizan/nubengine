      adding interoceptive exposure (e.g., hyperventilation) in PD/AG patients. By comparing the
      fear augmentation group with the therapist-guided CBT exposure, and by measuring autonomic
      arousal during and between exposure sessions, it will be possible to study the mechanisms of
      exposure based learning. A second aim is to disentangle effects of specific interoceptive
      exposure exercises (e.g., respiratory vs. vestibular stimulation). Finally, by including
      patients without agoraphobic avoidance it will be possible to investigate whether
      interoceptive exposure alone will have any effect. This might open the door for early
      interventions for individuals after experiencing an initial panic attack to prevent the
      development of a severe panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance.
