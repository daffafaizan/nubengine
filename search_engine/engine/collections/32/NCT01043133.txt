      clinical documentation workshop, embedded with 7 persuasive social-marketing based messages,
      on medical student response using a targeted asthma template. Stated differently, whether a
      physician-educator could "persuade" medical students to use an evidence-based EMR asthma
      template to document an outpatient mild persistent asthma encounter with a patient.
