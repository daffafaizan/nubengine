    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV can be reduced to less than
      the historical rate of 70% with the triple-immunosuppressant combination of cyclosporine
      (CSP)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with sirolimus in human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I or
      class II mismatched related or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using
      nonmyeloablative conditioning. The evaluation will be carried out separately among class I
      and class II mismatched patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of non-relapse mortality before day 100.

      II. To evaluate the incidences of grades III-IV acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -4 to -2. Patients also undergo total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -3 to 180
      with taper to day 365; cyclosporine PO twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day
      180; and mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-30 and then BID to day 100
      with taper to day 150.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and every year
      thereafter.
