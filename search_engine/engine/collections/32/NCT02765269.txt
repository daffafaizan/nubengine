      known as a major reason leading to lower quality of life of the patients.In this present
      study, the investigators aim to design, develop, and test the feasibility of a low cost,
      conveniently implemented mobile application to facilitate real-time pain recording and timely
      intervention among Chinese cancer patients with pain. This system evaluate real-time pain and
      Karnofsky Performance Status（KPS）scores for quality of life, and to generate an action plan
      to visit the physician or to adjust pain medication dosage when the pain threshold is
      reached. The investigators study is to test this system's effectiveness.
