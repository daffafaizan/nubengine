    
      In the 25 participating centers: patients with septic shock and persistent peripheral
      hypoperfusion despite hemodynamic optimization (skin mottling and/or finger skin recoloration
      time > 3sec, and/or knee skin recoloration time > 4sec), after 6 to 24 hours of
      norepinephrine onset will be eligible for randomization.

      Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be included and randomized by the
      intensivist in two groups:

      *Experimental group: The patient will receive treatment with intravenous Ilomedin (blinded)
      therapy at a dose of 0.5 ng/kg/min with increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes up to a
      maximum posology of 1.5ng/kg/min for 48h.

      Placebo group: The patient will receive treatment with intravenous NaCl 0.9% (placebo-double
      blinded) with increments of infusion rate every 30 minutes for 48h.

      Primary outcome will be Delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score between
      infusion onset and day 7.

      *within the 12 first hours after randomization : blood samples : 15 ml of blood will be
      collected at the same time as the sample routinely collected, within the 12 first hours after
      randomization in ICU, when the patients are perfused.

      The blood will be drawn and worked as follows:

        -  2 x EDTA tubes of 5 ml : After centrifugation each tube will be directly divided into 4
           aliquots of 500 µL (8 aliquots per patient)

        -  1 x aprotinine tube of 5 ml : After centrifugation, it will be directly divided into 4
           aliquots of 500 µL

      The aliquots previously will be stored locally, and will be transported to the "Centre de
      Ressources Biologiques" (CRB) of the Lariboisière Hospital.
