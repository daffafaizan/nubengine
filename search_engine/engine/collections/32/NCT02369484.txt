      gene mutations (changes) in the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) showed better results after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      (TKI), like afatinib (tradename GiotrifÂ®) , compared with classical treatment with
      chemotherapy. The treatment with TKI has become a new standard-of-care for patient with
      advanced lung cancer and EGFR or ALK changes. Several novel mutations, which are candidates
      as targets for specific medication have been discovered. Human epidermal growth factor 2
      (HER2, erbB-2/neu) is a protein of the so called ErbB family (including HER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3
      and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Mutations
      in HER2 are found in about 2% of the NSCLC.

      Afatinib works by blocking the activity of the ErbB family proteins and can inhibit growth
      and spread of cancer cells. Afatinib is approved by the European and the Swiss Medicines
      Agencies for the treatment of adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung
      (non-small cell lung cancer) that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR
      as first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.

      A total of 22 patients from centers around Europe are expected to be enrolled in this study
      over a period of 24 months.

      All patients will be treated in the same way. The study will take approximately 40 months to
      be completed.

      This clinical trial is conducted according to the applicable national laws and international
      guidelines.
