      lung disease) have a worse prognosis compared to patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (IPAH). The investigators have discovered through a previous protocol that
      patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension (SSc-PAH) have intrinsic right
      ventricular (RV) contractile dysfunction compared with patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      hypertension (IPAH) despite similar afterload imposed by the pulmonary vasculature. Patients
      with scleroderma or presumed/known IPAH who are clinically referred for right heart
      catheterization (RHC) will undergo, in addition to a clinically indicated RHC,
      state-of-the-art Pressure-Volume (P/V) Loop Assessment and RV biopsy for research purposes.
      The investigators will also do a standard pathologic assessment of the RV tissue (H&E,
      special staining, electron microscopy), microvascular density measurements using
      immunohistochemistry techniques and isolated skinned myocyte experiments. Additional
      experiments will include proteomics, genomics/genetics, and RV protein and microRNA
      expression. The investigators will compare these findings in both groups (IPAH and SSc-PAH),
      before and after standard treatment for 6 months, in order to fully understand the
      differences in how the RV adapts to pressure overload and reasons for impaired RV function in
      SSc-PAH as well as identifying potential therapeutic targets.
