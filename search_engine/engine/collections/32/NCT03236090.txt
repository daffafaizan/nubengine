        -  Decompensated patients with cirrhosis:

             1. Outpatients with refractory ascites (substudy 1) (n=20)

             2. Patients hospitalized because bacterial infection (substudy 2) (n=30)

      Study Product:

      Vivomixx®sachets containing 450 x 109 bacteria, 2 every 12 hours (n=25), or placebo (n=25)

      Duration of administration:

      30 days Follow up The following patients' assessments will be performed: in substudy 1 at
      baseline and at the end of the treatment (30 days), and in substudy 2 at baseline, on day 1,
      day 2, day 3, day 7, at infection resolution, and at discharge or day 30.

      Clinical and analytical assessments will be performed every three months after the end of the
      study Comparator Placebo (we evaluate the probiotic Vivomixx® vs placebo as adjunctive in
      addition to the standard of care) Statistical Methodology Fisher's exact test for categorical
      variables and Student's "t" test and Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests for quantitative
      variables. Correlations will be assessed by Spearman test. A two-sided p value <0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant
