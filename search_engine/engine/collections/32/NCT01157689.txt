    
      Children from the Bandim area in Bissau who are seeking medical advice and who are
      recommended treatment for malaria in accordance with the current routines will be included as
      follows:

      All children getting the clinical diagnosis of malaria will be registered and basic
      information collected. Of theses, children fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be included
      in a follow-up study.

      The children included in the follow-up part of the study will be visited on day 7, day 14,
      day 21, day 28, day 35 and day 42. At each visit the condition of the child will be
      evaluated, a questionnaire will be filled in and a malaria film and approximately 100 µl
      blood on filter-paper (for PCR analysis in case of re-parasitaemia) will be taken.
      Furthermore, on day seven 100 μl blood on filter-paper will be taken for drug-analysis.

      Children with parasitaemia detected by only one of the following methods will be excluded
      from the final analyses of the effectiveness: 1) malaria film, 2) RDT, and 3) PCR.

      If the parents do not ensure that the children get the correct medication resulting in a high
      rate of recrudescence and/or a low drug-concentration on day seven the policy of the National
      Malaria Programme should be re-evaluated. If the health staff do not follow the guidelines of
      the National Malaria Programme the reasons why should be elucidated in order to ensure a
      better adherence.
