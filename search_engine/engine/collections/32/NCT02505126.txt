    
      340 patients are expected and randomized in two groups: 170 patients with active tDCS and 170
      patients with placebo tDCS

      Visit 1 : Patients will received one daily session (13:20:13) during 5 consecutive days:
      current flows continuously twice for 13min with a rest interval (no stimulation) of 20 min.

      Visit 1 to 7 : Change from baseline to week 24 in Total Alcohol Consumption (TAC) and Number
      of Heavy Drinking Days (HDD) will be evaluated in each group.

      Evaluation on alcohol consumption (daily drinking diary, alcohol craving and severity) and
      other assessments like mood, quality of life, safety.

      The co-primary outcome of change from baseline in total alcohol consumption AND reduction in
      number of heavy drinking days at 6 months after treatment and its association with tDCS will
      be analyzed under the intention-to-treat principle using a mixed model repeated measures (8
      times).
