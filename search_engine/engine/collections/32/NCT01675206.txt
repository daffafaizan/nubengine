      of the most powerful inhibitors of vascular calcification (Shurgers LJ et al. Thromb Haemost
      2008; 100: 593-603). MGP is a Vitamin K dependent protein. This means that he presence of
      Vitamin K2 is required to promote the gamma-carboxylation process turning MGP in its
      carboxylated and active form. Recent data show that dp-uc MGP correlates well with Vitamin K
      status (Cranenburg CM et al. Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2010; 104/4: 811-822).

      It is widely recognized that patients with renal insufficiency treated with hemodialysis are
      prone to accelerated vascular calcification resulting in excess cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality (Goodman WG et al. N Engl J Med 2000; 342: 1478-1483).

      Consequently, the administration of Vitamin K2 supplements may protect hemodialysis patients
      against accelerated vascular calcification by enhancing the gamma-carboxylation process of
      MGP. However, the optimal dose of Vitamin K2 required to achieve these results remains to be
      defined
