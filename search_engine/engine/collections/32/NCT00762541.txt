      Currently the MEL 80 Excimer Laser System is approved for the elimination of myopia of less
      than or equal to -7.0 D with or without refractive astigmatism of less than or equal to -3.0
      D, with a maximum MRSE of -7.00 D. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness information on the treatment of moderate to high magnitudes of myopia.
