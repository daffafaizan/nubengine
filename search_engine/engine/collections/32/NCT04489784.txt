      ballerinas) may lead to reduced functional performance. The use of photobiomodulation may
      improve functional performance in ballerinas that are affected by foot pain. An aluminum
      gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) diode laser device was uded. Infrared laser (808 nm) was applied on
      ballerina's feet twice a week during three months. Thermography, algometry and unipodal
      static standing balance test were performed. There were pain relief and improvement of
      functional performance in ballerinas.
