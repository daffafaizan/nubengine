      Skelton and Dinan).

      The goals:

      Skilling up: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of
      large muscle groups of the lower extremity.

      Training Gain: improvement of functional abilities. Maintaining the Gains: muscle growth,
      improvement of bone density and multi-sensory exercises.

      First, a pilot study was conducted with untrained elderly ("Effects of stochastic resonance
      therapy on postural control in the elderly population" (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Clinical Trial
      Registry: NCT01045746). Following, a second pilot study was conducted with frail elderly
      (Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects
      on Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01543243).

      It was found that the selected chosen form of recruitment (presentation and advertisement)
      and the measurements methods are suitable for untrained elderly. But for frail elderly the
      chosen form of recruitment and the measurement methods are not sufficient.

      For this study, adapted measurement parameters for balance, strength and cognition will be
      used.

      The goals of this study:

      Evaluate the effects of

        -  functional lower extremity

        -  dynamic balance

        -  reaction time

        -  mobility

        -  muscle strength and cognition.

      This is a one-group pre-post design study and the participants will be recruited in Canton
      Bern - Switzerland.
