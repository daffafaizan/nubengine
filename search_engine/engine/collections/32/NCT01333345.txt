    
      Anomalies include, but are not limited to:

      Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) (pathological condition) - delayed clouding of the lens
      capsule after cataract surgery.

      Glistenings - fluid-filled micro-vacuoles that form within the intraocular lens (IOL) optic
      when the IOL is in an aqueous environment. They may appear to be on the lens surface.

      Artifacts - glares, halos, starbursts and/or shadows caused by IOLs.

      Fibrosis - the formation of fibrous connective tissue, as in a scar.

      Glare - undesirable sensation produced by brightness that is much greater than that to which
      the eyes are adapted. Causes annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance.

      Halos (symptom) - the appearance of hazy ring(s) around light.
