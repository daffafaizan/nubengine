      the m.3243 A>G mutation. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are controlled by
      nuclear genetic material (DNA) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutations impair
      mitochondrial function, and cause cellular energy failure. These mutations, when present in
      high abundance, cause neurological signs and symptoms that are clinically obvious. The
      investigators hypothesize that these mutations, when present in lesser abundance, will cause
      measurable alterations in the patient's neuropsychological profile and cerebral energy
      profile. This study does not involve any experimental or approved therapy. The investigators
      will evaluate the patient's condition with blood/urine tests, neurological exam, MRI/MRS,
      questionnaires, motor skills functioning, serum and urine biomarkers, and genetic testing.
