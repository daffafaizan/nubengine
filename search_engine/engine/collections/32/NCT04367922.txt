    
      The goal of the proposed program, PARK, is to reduce feelings of anxiety, depression, and
      social isolation, as well as increase well-being and a sense of meaning and purpose through
      the practice of positive emotion skills via a self-guided online platform. We will compare
      baseline scores on PROMIS measures of Anxiety, Depression, Social Isolation, Meaning and
      Purpose, and Positive Emotion to scores after completing the online course (approximately 8
      weeks later), and again at 6 months post-baseline.

      Research will be based in Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine through the Department
      of Medical Social Sciences (MSS), with all study procedures conducted online. Eligibility
      screening, consent, and assessments will be conducted on REDCap. For the positive skills
      course (including weekly lessons and daily skills practice) and daily emotion check-ins,
      consenting participants will receive access to the online PARK platform, hosted by
      BrightOutcome.

      The skills will be delivered over approximately 6 weeks, and individuals can participate from
      any device and location with internet access.
