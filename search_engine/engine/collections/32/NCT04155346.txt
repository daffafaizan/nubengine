      surgery-related deconditioning, and facilitate postoperative recovery. Compared to the
      postoperative setting, initiating health interventions preoperatively is proposed as an
      important strategy to improve health outcomes because: i) it targets modifiable risk factors
      for surgical complications; ii) patients may be more physically and/or psychologically
      capable of affecting change in health status compared to the early postoperative period; iii)
      wait times prior to surgery may be several weeks thus representing an opportunity to
      proactively invest in their recovery; and iv) patients may be sensitized to the importance of
      adverse health behaviours that may have contributed to the need for surgery (i.e. a
      'teachable moment'). The potential benefit of prehabilitation extends beyond potential gains
      in health from baseline to surgery, but also includes the prevention or attenuation of
      deconditioning that patients experience during the postoperative period. The findings of
      recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the benefits of prehabilitation
      interventions in surgical oncology provide support for their efficacy in improving physical
      fitness, length of stay, surgical complication rates, and health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL).

      While previous interventional studies have demonstrated promising findings, little is known
      about how feasible it is to integrate prehabilitation into standard of care for people with
      cancer awaiting surgery. This study intends to employ intervention design features previously
      shown to be feasible and efficacious and employs a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
      design model to assess feasibility of clinical integration.
