      tumors grow. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma. It is also approved for
      the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), another blood cancer.
      Other research studies using lenalidomide in combination with other drugs in subjects with
      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma also show good response rate.

      High dose melphalan is approved by the FDA and is commonly used in multiple myeloma treatment
      prior to stem cell transplantation. This combination of lenalidomide, high-dose melphalan and
      stem cell transplantation has not been studied in newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple
      myeloma, so it is considered experimental. In research studies, "experimental" refers to a
      drug or procedure that has undergone basic laboratory testing and received approval from the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be tested in human subjects. A drug or procedure may
      be approved by the FDA for use in one disease or condition, but be considered experimental in
      other diseases or conditions.

      In this study, lenalidomide will be given together with melphalan (chemotherapy) with the
      hope that more disease will be killed before the stem cell transplant. Three months after the
      transplant, patients will take lenalidomide again with the hope that this will help prolong
      the time when the disease is in remission.
