      composed of receptors (ex: CB1), of endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids (ex: anandamide
      and 2- arachidonoylglycerol) and of enzymes implied in the synthesis and the degradation of
      the endocannabinoids. Researches resulting from our group highlighted anomalies of the
      plasmatic concentrations of endocannabinoid, in obese subject compared to normal-weight
      subject. Those being higher in obese subject with a flatness of post prandial reduction of
      AEA, so maintenance of elevated levels which can facilitate the food catch and create a
      metabolic vicious circle. In addition, prestigious research resulting from our collaborators
      highlighted in the animal that exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, ligand exogenic of CB1)
      induced the synthesis of pregnenolone (neurosteroid) which, by an autocrine effect on the
      CB1, inhibited the effects of the THC. In particular one of the principal behavioural
      effects: the food intake.

      We want to measure pregnenolone and endocannabinoid concentrations in men blood samples, to
      observe if this association exists in fasting conditions and over a meal in normal-weight and
      obese subjects. Obese subjects will be recruited during an hospitalization, while normal
      subject will be recruited by a poster at Bordeaux university and Haut-Leveque hospital. They
      will be included at Haut-Leveque hospital during morning at hospital.
