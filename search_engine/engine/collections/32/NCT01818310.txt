      older than 30 years of age, with a dose of insulin exceeding 0.7 U/kg/day or 50U/day will
      result in decreasing the insulin dose in the course of 6-month follow-up and in an
      improvement of the glycHBA1c levels, improvement of the liver and kidney function, decrease
      of the cholesterol levels and improvement of the immune response parameters, i.e. parameters
      of lymphocytar blastic transformation, more than in case of patients with intramuscular or
      intraarterial application of BMAC.
