      spastic foot after stroke using ankle foot orthosis with or without selective injection of
      BTA (Botox) into the tibialis anterior and/or posterior and/or the long toe flexor, and/or
      medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and/or soleus muscles [300 BTA U per injection (Botox -
      Allergan), diluted with saline to a concentration of 5U/0,1 mL, with electromyography guided
      injection]. The patients are followed for one year after treatment.
