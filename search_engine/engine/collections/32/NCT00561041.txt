      weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy group sessions. 144 completers were randomized into the 3
      individual aftercare (AR) conditions noted above. Manualized active interventions were
      composed of 5 sessions of integrated motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral
      therapies. Outcomes assessments were done at end of aftercare, 3-6-and 12 months post AC
      completion.
