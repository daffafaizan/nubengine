    
      A baseline assessment is conducted, including a computer questionnaire assessing personality
      characteristics, attitudes toward and experiences with sex, alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes,
      among other things. The participant also meets with a therapist to conduct a brief
      motivational interview at this time. A "Time-Line Follow-Back" is conducted; this notes
      incidences of sexual intercourse, alcohol use, marijuana use, and cigarette use in a 30-day
      period. An fMRI is conducted, and a saliva sample is gathered. During the second session of
      the study, participants are randomly assigned to either a sex and alcohol risk reduction
      intervention, or a sex risk reduction intervention. After the intervention, participants are
      contacted at 3 month intervals (3 months later, 6 months later, 9 months later, and 12 months
      later) to meet. At these "follow-up" meetings, another Time-Line Follow-Back is conducted,
      along with another computer questionnaire (again assessing attitudes toward and experiences
      with sex, alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes).
