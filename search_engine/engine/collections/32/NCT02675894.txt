      local tumor progression rate) of recently introduced cooled-wet electrode in eligible
      patients who are indicative for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for liver tumors in comparison
      with currently used separable clustered electrode in our institution. Owing to tissue cooling
      effect of internally cooled-wet electrode can be used in switching bipolar mode. Patients
      would be randomized into two groups (cool-wet electrode group and separable clustered
      electrode in switching monopolar mode). The results from this preliminary study would be used
      for main study to compare the efficacy and safety data between two electrodes in the future.
