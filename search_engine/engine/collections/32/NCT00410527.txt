      fourth day of hospital stay), who have new pulmonary infiltrates during their ICU stay and
      who are at low risk of having pneumonia, as determined using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection
      Score (CPIS). The study is designed to determine whether 3 days of antibiotic treatment with
      meropenem (with or without coverage for MRSA) can reduce the risk of colonization with
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or the isolation of a potential pathogen compared to a
      standard antibiotic therapy (minimum of 8 days of therapy with antibiotics of the primary
      care team's choosing). The study will also examine whether short-course therapy reduces
      length of ICU and hospital LOS and costs based on ICU and hospital LOS, antibiotic treatment,
      and standardized costs related to the treatment of infection-related adverse experiences,
      without having a negative effect on subject mortality or the incidence of clinically
      significant infection.
