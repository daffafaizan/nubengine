    
      Study participants will be asked to use a newly developed web-based symptom self-management
      program, called the My MS Toolkit, for 12 weeks. Participants will also be asked to complete
      online surveys throughout the study.

      The My MS Toolkit includes 8 modules that describe symptom self-management strategies.
      Participants will explore the My MS Toolkit on their own, following the prompts and guides
      built into the program, and are encouraged to practice and apply the skills learned.

      The study can be done from participants' homes using a reliable internet-connected device. No
      travel is required.
