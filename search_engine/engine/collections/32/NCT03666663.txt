      disability worldwide according the WHO.

      SPG block is a treatment for migraine that has been used for two decades. It can be done by
      needle injection of anesthetic to the region of the SPG. However, there are now multiple
      catheter devices that can be used to non-invasively administer anesthetic topically through
      the nasal cavity to the region of the SPG where the anesthetic is then absorbed through thin
      membranes covering the SPG.

      Various anesthetic agents have been studied however currently, to our knowledge, there is no
      head to head comparison of the various anesthetics used. Studies of SPG blocks in the setting
      of chronic migraine are few as compared to the use of SPG as acute treatment for migraine.

      With the use of an RCT, we aim to determine the overall efficacy of SPG blocks used at longer
      intervals than have been studied in the past as compared to placebo, as well as to examine
      the relative efficacy of the anesthetics used most commonly and studied for SPG blocks.

      We will be using an FDA cleared device, the Sphenocath which was developed and registered
      with the FDA for this specific population and purpose. The study intervention is the standard
      practice in the UCSF Headache Center to perform SPG blocks for our patients with chronic
      migraine. The frequency we use in clinical practice and that we plan to study is less often
      than in previous studies of this intervention in this population.
