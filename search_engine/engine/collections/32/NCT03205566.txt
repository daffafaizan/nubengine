      trial whereby 36 individuals (18 women and 18 men) will be randomised according to gender
      1:1:1:1:1:1 to one of 6 arms (A 1 A 2 A 3 B 1 B 2 B 3). The result being 3 women and 3 men
      will be in each arm. The letter dictates the ART regimen order and the number dictates the
      time points that tissue sampling will occur on and off ART. Two ART regimes will be
      investigated and all individuals will receive both regimes separated by a one month wash out.

      Arm A (A 1 A 2 A 3): will start with 7 days Raltegravir 400mg bd and then have a one month
      wash out before then starting 7 days Raltegravir 400mg /lamivudine 150mg bd.

      Arm B (B 1 B 2 B 3): will start with 7 days Raltegravir 400mg /lamivudine 150mg bd and then
      have a one month wash out before then starting 7 days Raltegravir 400mg bd. This will remove
      sequential selection bias. All individuals will receive tissue sampling at baseline for ex
      vivo analysis to ensure biopsies are infectable on challenge assays. Sampling from women will
      avoid menstruation and if possible focus on the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.
      Individuals will receive another set of tissue sampling during and after ART in phase 1, have
      a 4 week wash out period and then have another set of sampling during and after ART in phase
      2. Individuals will therefore have 5 sets of sampling during the trial.
