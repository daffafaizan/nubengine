    
      Selected subjects will include males and females age ≥18 years; histologically confirmed
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with archived tumor sample from the primary,
      recurrent or metastatic disease with documented MAPK pathway mutation or pathway
      hyperactivating mutations; advanced or recovered from all acute toxicities (≤ Grade 1) due to
      prior therapy; adequate renal and hepatic function; and no known history of significant
      cardiac or retinal disease.

      Part A (Monotherapy Dose Escalation): Following screening, a total of up to 42 subjects are
      anticipated to establish the MTD of JSI-1187 monotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors with MAPK pathway mutations, including hyperactivating pathway
      mutations or gene fusions, refractory to or relapsed on prior therapy. JSI-1187 will be
      administered orally twice daily (BID) at doses of 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 mg (total daily
      doses of 4, 8, 16, 32, 48 and 64 mg), repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle). Subjects will take
      their BID doses in a fasted state, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If 2 of 3 subjects
      at a given dose level experience a Grade 2 adverse event, or a single subject experiences a
      Grade 3 adverse event, further JSI-1187 dose increases will not exceed 50%. A total of 6
      subjects will be treatment at the MTD before starting Part B.

      Part B (Combination Dose Escalation): Following screening, a total of up to 24 subjects are
      anticipated to establish the MTD of JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Twice daily doses of both drugs will be taken in the
      fasted state. A 3+3 dose escalation schema will be followed to establish the MTD of the
      JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib combination. A total of 6 subjects will be treated at the JSI-1187
      plus dabrafenib combined MTD before beginning Part C.

      Part C (Expansion Cohorts): Following screening, a total of 58 subjects in 3 cohorts are
      anticipated to expand the disease treatment settings of JSI-1187 in combination with
      dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      Cohort 1: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma after two prior
      therapies for metastatic disease, including anti-PD1 therapy, with or without ipilimumab, and
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. (n=21).

      Cohort 2: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma after adjuvant
      therapy for Stage 3 disease followed by therapy for metastatic disease, including anti-PD-1
      therapy, with or without ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. (n=21).

      Cohort 3: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in either BRAF V600E-mutated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) or BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors after 1 or 2 prior therapies. (n=16).

      JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib will be administered at the MTDs established for both drugs in Part
      B, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle).

      Subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) will be allowed to continue therapy
      with JSI-1187 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events,
      intercurrent illness or changes in the subject's condition that prevents further study
      participation.

      Disease response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST v.1.1).

      Blood for hematology, coagulation parameters and serum chemistry determinations will be
      collected, ECGs will be taken and ophthalmologic exams will be conducted during the study.

      Blood will be taken for PK assessment of JSI-1187 and dabrafenib and PD assessment of
      pRSK/RSK ratio determinations.

      Tumor biopsies will be taken from consenting subjects at Screening and on-study for pRSK
      determination. Results will be correlated with clinical outcome.
