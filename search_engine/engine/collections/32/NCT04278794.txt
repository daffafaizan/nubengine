      implement and evaluate a novel person- and family-centred Transitional Care Stroke
      Intervention (TCSI) for older adults (> 55 years) with stroke and multimorbidity (>2 chronic
      conditions) and their caregivers. The TCSI is a theory- and evidence-based 6-month
      intervention designed to improve the health, experience, and quality of transitioning from
      hospital-to-home for this vulnerable population. An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type
      I design will be used, which will focus primarily on examining the effectiveness of the TCSI
      on quadruple aim outcomes: (i) patient and caregiver health outcomes, (ii) patient and
      caregiver experience, (iii) provider/manager experience, and (iv) patient healthcare service
      use costs, and will also evaluate implementation outcomes (e.g., barriers, facilitators,
      fidelity). Our earlier pre-post study provided evidence to support the feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the TCSI on reducing hospital readmissions and
      emergency department visits (for any cause). These improvements were achieved at no
      additional cost. The key components of the TCSI in this earlier study included home visits
      supported by telephone calls by an interprofessional team (IP), patient-centered care
      planning, and care coordination/recruitment. The following enhancements to the TCSI will be
      included in the trial: 1) integrating the navigator role across the care continuum, 2)
      testing the TCSI with a larger sample and more rigorous (RCT) design, 3) enhancing patient
      self-management, and 4) evaluating the impact of the intervention on caregiver health
      outcomes and experience. These improvements alongside the inclusion of additional evaluation
      measures will enable rigorous evaluation of the TCSI and position it for future scale-up and
      spread
