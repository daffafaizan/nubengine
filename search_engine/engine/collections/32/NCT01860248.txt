      inconsistent results. There was only one prospective open labeled controlled study on
      arterial blood gas sampling with ethyl chloride which did not show effectiveness. This study
      will assess the efficacy and tolerability of a topical alkane vapocoolant spray for arterial
      puncture in adults in comparison to control spray.
