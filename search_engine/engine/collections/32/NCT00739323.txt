      MRI; microcirculation tests (two noninvasive tests: 1) a procedure that measures the resting
      blood flow of the skin and 2) a technique that introduces acetylcholine and sodium
      nitroprusside in the skin and measures the ability of the skin's vessels to dilate and
      increase blood flow); and macrocirculation tests (noninvasive ultrasound of arm). This study
      also involves 2 Visits to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA.
