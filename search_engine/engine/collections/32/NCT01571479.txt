      surgical options for LC have been developed. Recently, single port LC (SPLC) has been
      increasingly performed to minimize tissue trauma, improve cosmesis and decrease postoperative
      pain for patients. Some surgeons suggest that the four- or three-port LC using mini-ports
      could be as safe, effective, economical and cosmetic as SPLC. For this reason, the
      investigators started M-LC for patients with benign gallbladder disease in April 2010.

      Prospectively collected data from 133 patients who underwent LC for benign gallbladder
      disease between April 2010 and April 2011 were retrospectively reviewed.

      The patient's selection for M-LC was determined by surgeon's judgment based on 'laparoscopic
      surgical view' after inserting the laparoscope in the operating room.
