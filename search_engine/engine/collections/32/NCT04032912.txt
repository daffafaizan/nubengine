      the required quality benchmarks and studies evaluating optical biopsy have not shown
      diagnostic test performance results that meet standards set by society guidelines in order to
      promote its widespread clinical adoption. Optical polyp diagnosis and the current resect and
      discard approach are too complex for clinical adoption. Thus, clinical implementation of this
      valuable concept has not been achieved to date and its cost-saving potential has not been
      realized. In order to effectively operationalize a resect and discard strategy, one must find
      a different way to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps. There exist differences
      in the proportion of polyps found to be adenomatous in the left and right colon. One recent
      study reported that 30% of left-sided polyps and 76% of right-sided polyps were found to be
      adenomas on histology. Since polyps located in the proximal colon are more likely to be
      adenomas and polyps in the recto-sigmoid colon are more likely hyperplastic we hypothesized
      that a model based on polyp location might be able to replace optical biopsy and
      histopathology. Such an approach would be very simple to adopt by every clinician and would
      allow for easy adoption into clinical practice.
