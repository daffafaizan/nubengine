      acuity, but there is not much study on the impact of SBL-3 position on postoperative visual
      acuity.The regional refractive design of SBL-3 means it could be affected by pupil center
      shift (described by angle kappa: the difference between visual axis and pupil axis), the
      investigators assume that maintaining the ideal ratio of distant and near segment(50% vs 42%)
      in the pupil center could yield both good distant and near postoperative visual acuity
      postoperatively. Therefore, the investigators designed the implantation by placing the IOL
      based on angle kappa to make sure the ratio of distant and near segment exposure in the pupil
      center close to 50:42. In this study, the investigators assessed the optical quality in
      patients with SBL-3 implantation based on angle kappa and 0 to 180 degree to provide surgeons
      with information for choosing appropriate implantation position for optimum postoperative
      satisfaction of SBL-3.
