      determine individuals' 2D6 isoenzyme genotype, an enzyme belonging to the hepatic cytochrome
      P450 oxidase system. The 2D6 isoenzyme is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of many
      drugs including the anti-malarial drug primaquine (PQ). By knowing the genotype, the
      investigator can then categorize each volunteer by CYP2D6 phenotype i.e., expected impact on
      drug metabolism. In order to further substantiate the relationship between CYP2D6 activity,
      inadequate metabolism and subsequent primaquine failure, the investigator proposes to assess
      the effect of 2D6 genetic polymorphisms on PQ metabolism by measuring the PQ pharmacokinetics
      (PK) over 24 hours following a single 30 mg oral dose in a subset of these Active Duty
      subjects.
