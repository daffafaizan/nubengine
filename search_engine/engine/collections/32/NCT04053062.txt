      cells co-expressing LIGHT in a 3+3 dose escalation design. Cohort 1 subjects (N=3 or 6) will
      receive a tolal dose of 3x 10^6/kg body weight (KgBW) LIGHT-PSMA-CART cells at split doses
      after a conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen(Cy+Flu). If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, the study
      will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level. If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6
      subjects occurs, the study will advance to Cohort 2, with a total dose of 6 x 10^6/ KgBW.
