      approach to rehabilitation in people with progressive MS. Cognitive rehabilitation and
      aerobic exercise will be evaluated individually and in combinations to address cognitive
      dysfunction as the primary outcome variable.

      Over 20 years have passed since the introduction of the first disease modifying treatment,
      interferon beta-1betaseron (b), for multiple sclerosis (MS).Since then 13 treatments have
      been approved and made it onto the market. All are for relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS),
      apart from mitoxantrone which is limited to progressive disease with relapses,
      Interferon-beta-1b, which is for secondary progressive disease (SPMS), but does not delay
      disability progression and Ocrelizumab for primary progressive MS only. Thus, for a sizeable
      proportion of people with MS there is no therapeutic option to slow progression. This raises
      the question, how are patients with primary and secondary progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS) to
      be helped? While research is underway to find a medication that holds promise of halting
      further deterioration in a disease that has already entered a progressive stage, patients and
      their clinicians are left with basically symptomatic treatments.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that CR and aerobic exercise are effective
      treatments for cognitive impairment (processing speed deficits) in people with progressive
      MS. In particular a combination of these two treatment given twice weekly over 12 weeks is
      more effective than each individual treatment given alone or as sham. The investigators
      further hypothesize that improvements in processing speed will be matched on functional MRI
      (fMRI) by enhanced neural activity in networks associated with information processing speed.
