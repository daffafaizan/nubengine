    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, biodistribution and dosimetric properties of
      18F-alphavbeta6-binding peptide (BP) in normal tissues and malignancies in cancer patients
      and correlate concordance with alphavbeta6 expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-alphavbeta6-BP intravenously (IV) and then undergo positron emission
      tomography (PET) scans over 30 minutes each at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post-injection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.
