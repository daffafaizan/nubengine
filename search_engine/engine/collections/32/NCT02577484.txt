      to assess the differences, if any, between FFR measured by the Navvus catheter and a
      commercially available 0.014-inch pressure guidewire (St. Jude Medical, Volcano, hereafter
      referred to as the PW) in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing coronary
      angiography. This will be accomplished by comparing the FFR measurement obtained with the
      ACIST Medical Systems RXi System and Navvus catheter with the FFR measurement obtained by
      using a PW within the same subject across the same target lesion at the same time.
