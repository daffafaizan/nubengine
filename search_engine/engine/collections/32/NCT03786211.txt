      patients of the dental clinic indicated for bilateral extraction or filling.

      The randomization method is block balanced randomization. All patients will ask to fulfill
      the ethical Form. This form acquired demographic information (e.g. age, sex) about patients.
      A panoramic radiograph will take from those who matched the inclusion criteria and signed the
      agreement. Then a tooth from one side will be treated and the tooth from the other side of
      the mouth will treat at least 2 weeks later by the same dentist.
