      The study will consist of escalating multiple (three) doses in sequential groups.
      Approximately 40 subjects with plaque-type psoriasis will be enrolled into approximately 4
      planned dose cohorts.

      Each cohort will study a different CC-90006 dose level and have ten subjects; eight subjects
      will receive CC-90006 and two subjects will receive placebo. Subjects will be dosed according
      to a computer-generated randomization scheme. Dosing will occur on Days 1, 15 (Week 2), and
      29 (Week 4). During the study, blood samples and punch biopsies will be collected to
      determine the amount of CC-90006 in the body and to evaluate its effect on the subject's
      condition. Subjects will return to the clinic for regular follow up visits for safety, PK,
      and PD. A follow up phone call to each subject to determine general health will occur on Day
      141 (week 20).
