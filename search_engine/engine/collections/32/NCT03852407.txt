      comparing 2 conditioning regimens. A total of 114 eligible patients with HLA-matched donors
      will be randomized 1:1 between the FM-PTCy arm and the FM-ATG arm, with stratification for
      donor type (related or unrelated). The recruitment period is 3 years with a 5-year follow-up
      plus a 10-year additional long-term follow-up (for GVHD status, disease status, second
      malignancy and QOL). The whole study will be completed within 18 years.
