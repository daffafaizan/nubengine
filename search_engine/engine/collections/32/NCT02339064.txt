      of continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD)
      patients whose motor fluctuations remain unsatisfactory with levodopa (or levodopa/carbidopa)
      and at least one other class of drugs or mode of therapy for PD.

      Further, this study will assess the clinical effectiveness of continuous apomorphine
      subcutaneous infusion in reducing "off" time in advanced PD patients and to assess the
      clinical effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine in improving "on"
      time without resulting in an increase in troublesome dyskinesias.
