      due to the inhibition of acetylcholine and other pruritic factors, such as substance P and
      glutamate. For instance, subcutaneous BoNT/A improves itch accompanied to hand eczema,
      dermatitis, lichen simplex, and rhinitis. Furthermore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study showed that BoNT/A reduced histamine itch intensity in healthy men. Since acetylcholine
      has been shown to mediate itch in atopic dermatitis, this study aims to test the itch
      relieving effect of BoNT/A on a non-histaminergic model for chronic itch. This
      non-histaminergic model using the plant cowhage induces itch by activating protease activated
      receptor 2 (PAR2) receptors, which play a role in the itch of atopic dermatitis, also making
      this model better suited to test the efficacy of BoNT/A to relive chronic itch.
