      leads us to believe there are significant factors that lead to fracture in Type 1 DM other
      than BMD. Very little longitudinal data exists on BMD in adults with Type 1 DM and the
      effects of glucose control on BMD. No longitudinal data exists on pQCT in adults with Type 1
      DM.

      Hypothesis: Adult subjects with diabetes and poor glucose control will lose bone mineral
      density (BMD) as measured by DXA compared to age and sex matched healthy controls.
