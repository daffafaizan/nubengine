      been written in 1990. The CAM is riddled with logical fallacies such as 1) Circular reasoning
      about hearing loss causing delirium - hearing loss causes incorrect answers to questions on
      orientation and attention, leading to false positive diagnosis of delirium; 2) Circular
      reasoning on dementia causing delirium - dementia often does cause delirium but behavioral
      and psychological symptoms of delirium (BPSD) are the most common false positive diagnosis of
      delirium. CADIS (Central Coast Australia Delirium Intervention Study) will compare CAM+ to
      CAM- age 65+ in emergency department (prevalent delirium). Paul Regal has already shown that
      the 8% of 630 elderly he admitted from January 2011 to June 2012 who were CAM+ had the same
      survival (hospital, 90 day, 180 day and 12 month) and return home rate (65%) as 580 CAM
      negative elderly. The Regal criteria for delirium are completely novel. For every error in
      questions, the Regal system forces the examiner to determine if the error is due to poor
      hearing or cognitive impairment. A portable amplifier with headphones is used. The Regal
      methods uses recent records as the baseline for attention, memory and orientation questions.
      For example, an 83 year-old woman was assessed in memory clinic and had digit span forward
      5/5 and 5/6; 5-word recall at 5 minutes in MoCA was 4/5; orientation was 10/10. Two months
      later she is admitted for RLL pneumonia and confusion. Digit span declined by 40% to 3/5,
      5-word recall at 5 minutes declined by 100% to 0/5 and orientation declined by 40% to 6/10.
      There was no event during the two months such as stroke to explain this decline.

      Another novel feature of CADIS is follow-up by a blinded clinical nurse consultant at 30 and
      90 days, 12 and 24 months for MoCA, Addenbrooke Cognitve Assessment and four tests from
      CANTABeclipse (Cambridge Cognition) touchscreen laptop. The hypothesis is that "persistent
      delirium" is due primarily to irreverible brain events such as ischemic stroke.
