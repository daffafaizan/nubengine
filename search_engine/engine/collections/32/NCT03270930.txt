      duration has been studied in various studies as a risk factor for predicting morbidity and
      several other post-operative complications like pneumonia. However, the direct effect of
      operative duration on mortality has been studied sparingly and that too mainly in elective
      setting and other authors. Thus, operative duration is an under-studied risk factor in
      predicting mortality in emergency laparotomies. No study was found during literature review
      which predicted mortality as a function of operative duration in emergency laparotomies. Most
      studies focused on pre-operative factors and post-operative management for predicting
      laparotomy outcomes like the use of POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for
      the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity) score. Thus, no clear-cut recommendation exists
      regarding the optimal time duration for an emergency laparotomy in pediatric population
      beyond which a laparotomy must not proceed as it would significantly increase the mortality
      rate.

      The primary objectives of the study were to quantify the effect of duration of emergency
      laparotomy in children on mortality and to identify a rough cut-off duration of laparotomy to
      serve as a guide so that such a laparotomy can be planned to optimize pediatric surgical
      patient out come in terms of decreased mortality. The secondary objectives included
      identifying factors that increase the time of emergency laparotomy and identifying measures
      that could be applied to reduce the time of laparotomy significantly and improve outcome.
