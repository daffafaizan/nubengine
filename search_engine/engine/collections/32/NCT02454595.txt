    
      This is a prospective open registry to measure the impact on first-line therapy of genomic
      testing of biopsy tissue from recently diagnosed treatment-naïve patients with early stage
      localized prostate cancer . Physicians, using standard clinical-pathological parameters (PSA,
      Gleason score, clinical stage and percent positive cores), will complete a questionnaire that
      will record their recommendation for first-line therapy from among various treatment options.
      A sample of the biopsy tissue will then be tested using the Prolaris® genomic test and a
      relative cancer aggressiveness score will be shared with the physician. After reviewing and
      considering the results of the genomic testing but prior to the patient consult, the
      physician will then complete a second treatment decision questionnaire and VAS again. The
      physician will then discuss the recommended treatment plan with the patient and record the
      agreed treatment plan on a third questionnaire. After the initial treatment has been
      initiated, the physician or research staff will record the actual treatment administered in
      the fourth questionnaire (preferably recorded within 3 months of the patient consultation).
