    
      This Phase 1 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor and
      pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 and identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended
      Phase 2 dose for future development (RP2D). Subjects eligible for enrollment are required to
      have platinum-ineligible ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. The study
      design consists of dose escalation cohorts, an optional pharmacodynamic cohort, and an
      optional dose expansion cohort. In the dose escalation phase of the study, subjects will be
      enrolled into sequential dose levels. The study may also enroll a pharmacodynamic cohort to
      obtain additional pharmacodynamic data at one or more dose levels that have completed
      evaluation for safety without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects enrolled
      in the pharmacodynamic cohort will not inform dose escalation decisions. A dose expansion
      cohort may be opened to further characterize safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity,
      and pharmacodynamic data to inform the selection of a RP2D.
