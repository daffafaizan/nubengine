    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of booster vaccination with the gp100 (gp100:209-217(210M) peptide
      vaccine) and human papilloma virus (HPV) peptides in Montanide ISA 51 or Montanide ISA 51 VG
      administered >= 12 months after the last immunization.

      II. To measure the T-cell response to the modified gp100: 209-217 (210M) peptide and the
      unmodified native gp100 peptide following booster vaccination >= 12 months after the last
      immunization.

      III. To measure the T-cell response to the control human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2
      restricted clusters of differentiation (CD)8 epitope of papilloma virus HPV16E7:12-20
      following booster vaccination >= 12 months after the last immunization.

      IV. To perform detailed studies of the memory T cells persisting >= 12 months after
      immunization.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine and HPV 16 E7:12-20 peptide vaccine with
      Montanide ISA 51 VG or Montanide ISA 51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and between days 25-30.
      After 6 months, patients free of disease receive booster injections every 6 months for 3
      years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, every 6 months for
      5 years, and then annually thereafter.
