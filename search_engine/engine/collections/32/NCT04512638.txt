      yields highly variable mucosal healing rates ranging between 20 to 50%. In an effort to
      improve these suboptimal outcomes, many adjunct treatment modalities have been studied, of
      which the use of minimally invasive surgery with autologous platelet rich plasma (LPRF) to
      improve wound healing has attracted considerable attention, with reported mucosal closure
      rates of up to 86% in single arm case series. More recently, improved understanding of the
      need for pre-operative infection control and adaptation of surgical protocols has renewed the
      interest in the primary surgical treatment of MRONJ with mucosal closure achieved in up to
      90% of patients in some case series.

      Therapeutic studies of MRONJ have almost exclusively focused on mucosal healing as the
      desired end-point of MRONJ treatment, with little or no attention to patient symptoms,
      quality of life, functioning and well-being during treatment, even though the resolution of
      MRONJ symptoms and limiting treatment related adverse events may be equally important to
      patients.

      This comparative effectiveness research (CER) study is a randomized controlled open-label
      multi-center study in patients with newly diagnosed stage I-II MRONJ and is designed to
      answer the question whether minimally invasive treatment with LPRF membranes or primary
      surgical treatment improves outcomes when added to the standard of care of conservative
      treatment alone. The study also incorporates pragmatic design elements and uses patient
      reported outcomes (PRO) to determine which treatment offers the best humanistic outcomes
      considering both efficacy and measures of quality of life, functioning, well-being and
      symptom control. Indeed, this study will not use an investigational new drug (or drug
      regimen), device, or surgical technique, but rather evaluate their relative efficacy to guide
      future clinical management. Finally, plasma and saliva will be collected to identify
      prognostic and predictive biomarkers of outcome.
