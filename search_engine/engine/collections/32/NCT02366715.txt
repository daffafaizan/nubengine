      The research is devised as follows:

      Prospective section: We will enroll children 0-2 years old, diagnosed with Bronchiolitis in
      our ward (Pediatrics C) during the months of November-March 2014-2016. Children will be
      evaluated according to a Bronchiolitis Severity Score devised by Wang and Co which was
      successfully used in previous research. Children answering criteria for moderate or severe
      Bronchiolitis according to Wang and Co. will be enrolled pending written consent by both
      parents.

      Our prediction is to enroll a total of 200 children during the 2 winter seasons during
      2014-2016.

      Retrospective section: We will examine up to 200 cases of children aged 0-2 years
      hospitalized due to Bronchiolitis in Pediatrics C during 2014-2016 which were not enrolled in
      our research (due to lack of consent/unavailable HHHFNC etc.). We will compare clinical data
      and vital parameters between the groups treated with HHHFNC and those who were not.
