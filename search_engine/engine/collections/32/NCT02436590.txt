      joints associated with a reduction of inflammation and improved homeostasis of the
      extracellular matrix (ECM), both potentially effecting symptomatic relief of OA pain,
      reducing cartilage breakdown, stimulate new cartilage formation therefore preserving joint
      structure. The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine, at 12 months
      post treatment, the safety and efficacy of treating OA of the knee with PEMF. Safety will be
      assessed through adverse event collection. Study subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio
      (active: placebo control) to either an active or placebo control (inactive) Physio-Stim
      device. The study is powered to detect a significant difference between groups when 120
      subjects (80 active: 40 placebo control) have completed the study. Planned enrollment for the
      study is 150 subjects, to allow for an attrition rate of 20%.
