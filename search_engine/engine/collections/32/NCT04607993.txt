      dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) since the 1970s, and it has significant effectiveness in
      improving gas exchange. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication after congenital
      heart disease. The clinical manifestation is refractory hypoxemia. At present, mechanical
      ventilation is one of the main methods for the treatment of acute lung injury-induced
      respiratory distress syndrome. Prone position ventilation refers to placing the patient in
      the prone position during mechanical ventilation to expand the lungs in the atelectasis area
      and improve the ratio of lung ventilation and perfusion.

      Prone position ventilation technology as an important lung protection ventilation strategy
      has been widely used clinically at home and abroad. Compared with adults, children are more
      convenient and easy to implement. Due to the exact mechanism of improving oxygenation
      function, the current domestic and foreign development of pediatric prone ventilation
      technology is mainly focused on children with ARDS. There are few studies on high-quality
      application effects after pediatric cardiac surgery, and almost no research has been carried
      out, especially for pediatric heart The indications for the implementation of the prone
      position after the disease surgery, the specific standardized process including the position
      angle, the prone duration plan, etc. all need to be studied. Therefore, there is an urgent
      need to develop prone position ventilation technology for critically ill children with
      congenital heart disease after surgery to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and
      shorten the time of mechanical ventilation.
