      mobilization and faster recovery, decreased length of stay, and reduce opioid consumption and
      related side effects. The multimodal approach includes peri-operative oral and IV analgesics,
      local periarticular injections (PAI), and/or regional blocks such as femoral nerve blocks
      nerve or subsartorial saphenous nerve (adductor canal) blocks. Extended release bupivacaine
      (Exparel - Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ, USA) in liposomal form was developed for
      longer lasting post-operative analgesia. There are limited studies analyzing its efficacy of
      single injection liposomal bupivacaine in adductor canal block in total knee arthroplasty.
      The investigators hypothesized that a single adductor canal regional block injection would
      provide similar pain relief as peri-articular infiltration of Exparel.
