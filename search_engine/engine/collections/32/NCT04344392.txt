      superoanterior to close trachea via stretching cricopharyngeal muscle. In this context,
      approximation of thyroid cartilage and larynx is important for swallowing. These mechanisms
      are impaired in stroke, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and neuromuscular
      disorders thus resulting oropharyngeal dysphagia. Clinical examination may be used for
      assessing dysphagia in those patients however reliability of this method is controversial and
      videofluoroscopic study is considered as gold standard for assessing dysphagia. Ultrasound is
      used to assess swallowing functions since 1970s however, the studies commonly focused on
      tongue thickness and functions. Due to advances in technology besides tongue thickness,
      ultrasonography may practically demonstrate how larynx and thyroid cartilage approximate and
      hor larynx moves anteriorly. In literature, three methods came to forefront as evaluation
      methods for dysphagia: 1) approximation of thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone (THA), 2) tongue
      thickness in rest (TT), and 3) hyoid bone anterior replacement (HAR). In previous studies,
      the efficiency of THA for assessing dysphagia via videofluoroscopic study has been
      demonstrated. However other methods have not been evaluated in dysphagic patients with
      stroke. Ultrasonography, as a cheap, portable and non-invasive method, is a promising for
      assessing dysphagia in patients with stroke. In this context, this study aims to test the
      reliability and efficacy of these three methods via ultrasound in dysphagic stroke patients
      and test the performance of ultrasound compared to videofluoroscopy.
