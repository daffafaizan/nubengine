      telehealth visit from a healthcare provider (HCP) to assess for any change in their COVID-19
      symptoms. The HCP will recommend the patient remain at home, or to go to an emergency
      department based on standard of care and clinical decision making. Subsequently, the study
      subjects will receive a teleguidance session with a Radiologist who is trained in lung
      ultrasound (LUS) in order to obtain images of their chest. The physician performing LUS
      remotely will report LUS findings in a standard quality assurance (QA) document, including
      image quality, interpretation, and recommendations. This QA report will be study data and not
      shared with the patient. The two providers will be blinded, except when there is a
      disagreement between the Telemed LUS and clinical interview.

      The study staff will determine when this disagreement occurs. They will notify the study
      investigators and radiologist, who will then discuss and come to an agreement within 24
      hours. If deemed concerning, they will then contact the HCP and unblind them as to the
      radiographic findings. There will be no delay in medical care advised by the subject's HCP.

      Specifically, the nurse will inform the HCP by a phone call that the physician performing LUS
      remotely found a significant change in LUS findings. The HCP will then be given access to the
      LUS report (as well as images if desired), and will review the decision to seek medical care
      with the telemed doctor.
