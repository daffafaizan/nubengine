      tested , then total 120 semen samples of patients' husbands with abnormal SDF index were
      randomly divided and then processed by swim up (G1/ n=40), sperm gradient centrifugation (G2/
      n=40) and Zeta (G3/ n=40) methods. SDF test was assessed by Halosperm kit, whereas sperm
      morphology was assessed by spermac stain according to strict criteria. Fertilization,
      division, blastulation, implantation and pregnancy rates will be tabulated and statistically
      tested.
