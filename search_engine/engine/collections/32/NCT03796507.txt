      temozolomide therapy prior to initiation of standard chemoradiation regimen in patients with
      glioblastoma who undergo inpatient rehabilitation. The study will be conducted with adult
      patients who qualify for inpatient rehabilitation following surgical resection of
      pathologically confirmed Grade IV glioma. Patients will begin a 21-day cycle of temozolomide
      starting 14 days after surgery at 75mg per square meter of body surface area daily to serve
      as bridge therapy. Patients will then progress to receive standard therapy following their
      rehabilitation stay. Patients will be assessed for their ability to complete the chemotherapy
      protocol without dose-limiting toxicity as well as complete inpatient rehabilitation
      successfully. Additionally, we will be assessing for tumor progression between the time of
      surgery and the time of treatment initiation.

      If this study shows the expected results, the research team plans to proceed to a larger
      trial assessing the efficacy of early TMZ in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who are
      admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation compared to the current standard of care.
