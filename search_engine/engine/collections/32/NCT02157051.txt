      Arm 1: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with
      recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) as 1 injection
      intradermally (ID) every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2 additional booster
      STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      ARM 2: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/M2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with
      rhuGM-CSF as 2 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2
      additional booster STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      ARM 3: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with
      rhuGM-CSF as 3 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 2
      additional booster STEMVAC vaccines at 3 and 9 months after the third vaccine in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      ARM 4: Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with
      rhuGM-CSF as 2 injections ID every 28 days for 3 months. Patients may also receive 1
      additional STEMVAC vaccine at 3 months after the third vaccine in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice yearly for up to 5 years.
