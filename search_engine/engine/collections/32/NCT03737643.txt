      advanced (Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique [FIGO] Stage III-IV)
      ovarian, primary peritoneal cancer and/or fallopian-tube cancer. All patients should be
      candidates for cytoreductive surgery which could be conducted as immediate upfront primary
      surgery following diagnosis or can be conducted after initiation of platinum based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients should be eligible to start first line platinum based
      chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab.

      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standard of care (SoC) platinum-based
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab followed by maintenance bevacizumab either as monotherapy, or in
      combination with durvalumab, or in combination with durvalumab and olaparib. Therefore, this
      study aims to see which combination allows patients to live longer without the cancer coming
      back or getting worse. The study is also looking to see which combination makes patients live
      longer and how the treatment and the cancer affects their quality of life.
