      sedation with midazolam 5 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg will be randomly assigned to receive
      diphenhydramine (up to 3 incremental doses of 25 mcg each) vs. continued midazolam (up to 3
      incremental doses of 1.5 mg each). the level of sedation will be assessed using the MOAA/S
      scale 2-3 minutes after each administration to determine if they are sufficiently sedated to
      begin colonoscopy. The patient, the healthcare team involved in performing the endoscopy, and
      the investigator assessing sedation will be blinded to the therapy. Our hypothesis is that
      diphenhydramine will provide better sedation than continued administration of midazolam
      during colonoscopy in patients not achieving adequate sedation with standard doses of
      midazolam plus fentanyl.
