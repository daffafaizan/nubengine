      Unfortunately drug eluting stents failed to demonstrate superiority over bare stents in the
      superficial femoral artery. We could show that a non-stent based delivery of Taxan was equal
      or superior to drug eluting stents in an animal model. This was both true for the coronary
      arteries and peripheral vessels.

      In a prospective blinded trail >135 patients are randomized either to receive Taxan locally
      administered with a balloon catheter during balloon angioplasty, or together with contrast
      media. One group serves as control. There were no limitations due to lesion length. Follow-up
      angiography will be after 6 months, 12 months and 2 years.
