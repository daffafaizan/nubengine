      patients' charts were reviewed by independent observer. The type of BPPV and associated
      problems were noted. Patients with migraine were investigated in terms of age, gender,
      symptoms, affected side and the cure rate. Their data were compared with those having no
      migraine. Mean values and standard deviations (Â± SD) were calculated. One way ANOVA test was
      used for the analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.005.
