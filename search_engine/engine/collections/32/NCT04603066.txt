      ondansetron (single 16mg dose) with p-glycoprotein inhibitor tariquidar (single 4mg/kg dose)
      vs placebo in a cross-over prospective randomized study, will:

        1. Be tolerable in patients with neuropathic pain.

        2. Increase the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma ratio of ondansetron after intravenous
           administration, compare to ondansetron alone

        3. Result in a greater reduction in pain intensity than with ondansetron alone.
