      intubated ICU patients requiring anxiolytics and analgesic medications. Patients will be
      randomized into two groups: one group will receive music (MUSIC), whereas the other group
      (CONTROL) will wear headphones, but hear an audio loop of recorded ICU sounds (vent alarms,
      ambient noise, talking, etc). The two groups will then be analyzed for sedation and analgesia
      requirements; Ramsay sedation score, ICP in brain injured patients, ventilator days, ICU
      length of stay, hospital length of stay, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).
