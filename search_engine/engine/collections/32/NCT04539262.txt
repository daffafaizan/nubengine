      supported by evaluation in healthy volunteers in another Phase 1a Gilead study
      (GS-US-553-9018). Participants in Part C will be enrolled after review of preliminary safety
      and available efficacy data from Parts A and B through at least Day 7.

      GS-US-553-9018 is a Phase 1a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, single- and
      multiple-dose study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of remdesivir administered by inhalation.
