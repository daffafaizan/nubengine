    
      Potential patients for this study will be recruited by up to 10 centres specialised in
      prostate cancer. Study sites will be interdisciplinary, consisting of a uro-oncology
      sub-site, and a radiology sub-site with high-quality MRI, surgery and pathology. Study visits
      will be typically conducted at the recruiting sub-site, or as institutionally appropriate.
      Treatment visits for patients will be performed in the collaborating sub-site. Patients will
      be invited for study participation by the investigators in the context of specialised
      clinics. Interested patients will be provided with an information sheet and will undergo a
      detailed informed consent procedure prior to any study procedures. Recruitment will be
      continued until a sufficient number of patients have undergone FerrotranÂ® imaging and
      histopathological evaluation.

      To compensate for an expected drop-out rate of 15% to 20%, recruitment will only be stopped
      as soon as at least 69 evaluable positive (patients positive) and at least 104 evaluable
      negative (patients negative) patients are available for analysis.
