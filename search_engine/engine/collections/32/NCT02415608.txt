    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Evaluate the response rate to ibrutinib in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM)
      (aggressive systemic mastocytosis [ASM] or mast cell leukemia [MCL], or SM-associated
      hematologic non-mast cell disorder [AHNMD]) by the end of 6 cycles (6 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with advanced SM.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ibrutinib in a subset of patients with
           advanced SM.

        -  Evaluate changes in histopathology (blood and bone marrow) of patients with advanced SM
           in response to ibrutinib therapy.

        -  Evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality-of-life (QOL) using
           a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF).

        -  Evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR).

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 to 28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving an unconfirmed or confirmed clinical improvement (CI), partial
      response (PR), or complete response (CR) by the end of course 6 will be permitted to continue
      maintenance courses of ibrutinib on an ongoing basis until loss of response/progressive
      disease, or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
