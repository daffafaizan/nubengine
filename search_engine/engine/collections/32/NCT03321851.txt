      tests two devices mounted on two smartphones.

        -  Temperature: Each user will use the V-sensor mounted on a smartphone to obtain his/her
           temperature interfaced with a temperature specific 'app'. Before and after the the
           temperature is obtained using the V-Sensor, the temperature will be obtained using an
           equivalent thermometer.

        -  Blood Pressure: Each user will test his/her blood pressure using the two sensors mounted
           on the two phones interfaced with a blood pressure specific 'app'. Before and after each
           measurement, a reference measurement using a mercury sphygmomanometer will be taken.

        -  Pulse, Respiration, SpO2: Each user will test his/her pulse, respiration, and SpO2 using
           2 V-sensors mounted on two separate smartphones interfaced with a Pulse, Respiration,
           and SpO2 'app'. Before and after each measurement, a reference measurement using
           equivalent reference devices will be taken.
