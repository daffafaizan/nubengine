    
      This is a multicenter (19 sites), prospective, 2 arm randomized study designed to assess the
      safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER sirolimus-eluting stent as compared to the uncoated Bx
      VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent in patients with manifest diabetes mellitus. Patients with
      de novo native coronary artery lesions <= 42 mm in length and >=2.5mm and <=3.5mm in diameter
      (by visual estimate) will be included in the study. A total of 190 patients will be entered
      and randomly allocated to the CYPHERTM sirolimus-eluting stent or the uncoated Bx VELOCITY
      balloon-expandable stent at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be followed for 12 months
      post-procedure, with all patients having a repeat angiography at 8 months (Â± 1 month).

      It is anticipated the total duration of the study will be 18 months: 6 months to complete
      patient enrollment and 12 months for follow up.
