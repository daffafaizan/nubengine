      progressive worsening of cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. Cardiac remodeling is largely
      the consequence of myocardial injury due to myocardial infarction, although other parameters
      including age, arterial hypertension, etc. may also represent important predictors.
      Aldosterone blood levels measured within the first hours of admission for myocardial
      infarction is associated with increased rates of adverse outcomes. Aldosterone acts on wound
      healing and fibrosis processes in the myocardium as well as on systemic volemia.
