    
      The dose of vincristine will be 1.5 mg/m² or 0.05 mg/kg for patient ≤ 10 kg (maximum 2 mg)
      and will be administered by direct intravenous infusion on day 1 and 8 of each course, before
      irinotecan.

      The dose of irinotecan will be 50 mg/m²/d. Irinotecan will be given intravenously over 1 hour
      on days 1-5 of each course, one hour following the administration of temozolomide.

      In the absence of any contraindication (ie known allergies), treatment with oral cefixime 8
      mg/kg once daily (maximum daily dose 400 mg) is recommended and will be started 2 days before
      chemotherapy until day 7.

      Temozolomide will be given according to the randomization. The starting dose of temozolomide
      will be 125 mg/m²/d. The dose of temozolomide will be escalated to 150 mg/m²/day at cycle 2
      for patients who do not experience > grade 3 toxicity of any kind. Temozolomide will be given
      orally, on an empty stomach, on days 1 through 5 of each course.

      Dose reductions and/or administration delays will be performed using specific predefined
      rules to accommodate individual patient tolerance of treatment and to maintain optimal dose
      intensity.
