      children and young adults and is one of the most severe forms of atopic ocular disease.
      Classically, the incidence of VKC peaks in the summer and spring. However, 60% of cases can
      become chronic with persistent symptoms. VKC is mainly characterized by intense itching, but
      patients also frequently complain of lacrimation, foreign body sensation and photophobia.

      There are three different clinical forms of VKC; the palpebral form, which is characterized
      by giant papillae in the upper tarsal; the limbal form, with gelatinous nodules composed of
      eosinophilic infiltrates and degenerated epithelial cells (Horner- Tantra spots) and a mixed
      form.

      The treatment of VKC involves the use of topical Anti-histaminic and Mast Cell Stabilizers,
      which are usually sufficient to control symptoms in mild cases. However, a high number of
      patients are refractory to allergy therapy and require treatment with topical steroids. Side
      effects related to long-term steroid use, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP),
      cataract development and increased susceptibility to infections.

      Refractory VKC, development of steroid complications or the need for long-term use of Topical
      steroids are indications to use Topical immune-suppressant drugs as Tacrolimus (TCL) or
      Cyclosporine A (CsA). Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant derived from Streptomyces
      tsukubaensis, is an alternative to steroid therapy for allergic diseases of the ocular
      surface. Topical Cyclosporine A is a fungal metabolite that reduces ocular inflammation by
      inhibiting Th2 lymphocyte proliferation and histamine release from mast cells and basophils.
