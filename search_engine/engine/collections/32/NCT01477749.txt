      screening procedures to ensure that they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects
      underwent a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days
      later by an infusion of sipuleucel-T. This process was be repeated at approximately 2-week
      intervals for a total of 3 infusions.

      In Austria, The Netherlands, and France, a study completion visit occurred between 30 and 37
      days post-final infusion, or between 30 and 37 days post-final leukapheresis for subjects not
      receiving at least 1 infusion. In the UK, a follow-up visit occurred 30 days after the
      subject's final infusion and a study completion visit occurred 6 months after the subject's
      final infusion.
