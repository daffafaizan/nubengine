      obstetric events. Multidisciplinary approaches and communication could improve patients
      outcomes. In 2003, leaders from the department of obstetrics, anesthesia and nursing decided
      to institute interdisciplinary rounds as a method of improving team communication.
      Obstetricians, Anesthesiologists, Nurses, Perinatologists, Administrative Assistants,
      Consultants, and Neonatologists participate in the rounds. The investigators wanted to
      determine if the establishment of interdisciplinary rounds has made meaningful changes in the
      perceptions of teamwork and communication.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the establishment of interdisciplinary daily
      rounding has improved teamwork in an academic, tertiary care labor and delivery unit.
