      valid substitution for UFH in a number of settings, such as non-ST elevation acute coronary
      syndromes and prevention of venous thromboembolism, LMWH may provide a useful bridge to
      revascularization after aspirin discontinuation in patients undergoing CABG surgery.
      Obstacles to the spreading of this practice are mainly the absence of solid evidence of
      equivalence (or superiority) as to efficacy in this setting, and the proof of equal safety,
      namely the absence of excess bleeding because some studies have suggested an increased number
      of haemorrhagic complications after LMWH, particularly with the use of higher doses. This
      might here be a problem, as patients are here generally at high risk of thrombotic events and
      for this reason need higher doses than for prevention of venous thromboembolism.
