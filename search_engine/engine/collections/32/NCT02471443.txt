      complete pre-operative and post operative questionnaires at 2, 6 and 12 months, then 5, 10,
      15, 20 and 25 years post operatively.

      Quality of life measured using the EHP-30 and EQ-5D questionnaires. Bowel symptoms were
      measured using GIQLI. Dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, dyschezia and chronic pain were measured
      using a visual analogue scale.
