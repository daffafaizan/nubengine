      I. To confirm that axillary lymphatic mapping with indocyanine green solution (ICG) solution
      leads to a similar number of nodes being labeled as sentinel as lymphatic mapping with
      99mTc-labeled (technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid) radiotracer.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid injection and undergo
      lymphoscintigraphy according to clinical practice. Prior to surgery, participants also
      receive indocyanine green solution subdermally close to the tumor or into subareolar region
      of the breast skin. Participants then undergo axillary sentinel node biopsy and surgery.
