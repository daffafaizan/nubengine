      feasible for the assessment of tumor perfusion in solid tumors of the abdomen. CT perfusion
      has shown promising results in serving as a noninvasive method of predicting response to
      therapy in cancer patients. CT perfusion parameters have also been found to correlate with
      immunohistologic markers of angiogenesis in a number of solid tumors, suggesting a possible
      role for CT perfusion as a noninvasive biomarker of tumor angiogenesis. The goals of the
      investigators study are twofold: first, to determine the relationship between baseline CT
      perfusion characteristics of rectal cancers and their response to treatment, and second, to
      determine if perfusion CT can be used to subsequently monitor tumor response to treatment.
      The investigators hope to enroll those patients with locally advanced rectal cancer
      undergoing standard CT for pre-treatment planning, integrating CT perfusion imaging into the
      current abdomen/pelvis imaging protocol with close clinical and radiologic follow-up after
      treatment to determine response to therapy and time to disease progression.
