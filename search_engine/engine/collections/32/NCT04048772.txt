    
      Patients and their partners will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to two different treatment
      arms: A) standard of care in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the investigational institution as
      well as participating in an additional psychoeducational group or B) standard of care IVF at
      the investigational institution. The intervention group will consist of three additional
      evening visits for 1-1.5 hours per session. The sessions will include an interactive
      educational component addressing usual questions and concerns of IVF patients, such as
      reviewing common IVF myths, and also more information regarding treatment and technologies.
      Each session will also include teaching of coping strategies (such as awaiting the pregnancy
      test, how to cope with insensitive remarks from friends and family) as well as relaxation
      exercises, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing.

      The patients will be consented at their new IVF visit and will take their initial assessments
      (FertiQoL, GAD-7, PHQ-9, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a knowledge assessment)
      within 24 hours of the new visit. The patients will be assigned into groups based on when
      they are going through their IVF stimulations, so they will have similar experiences at
      similar times. Patients will take their final assessments on the third day after egg
      retrieval, regardless of group assignment.
