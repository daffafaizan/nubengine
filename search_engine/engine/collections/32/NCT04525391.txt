    
      This study is a single arm, open-label, multi-centre phase II study of AZD2811NP and
      durvalumab combination therapy in subjects with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a
      second or third line treatment.

      Subjects will receive AZD2811 and durvalumab combination therapy. The arm is composed of up
      to approximately 36 evaluable subjects.

      After the initiation of the study, a safety run-in period will be conducted with 6 patients
      to confirm the safety profile.

      Thus a safety run-in will be undertaken in the first 6 patients with 1500mg of Durvalumab q
      3weeks with 500mg of AZD2811. During the safety follow-up, if 2 or more DLT is observed,
      another safety run-in with new 6 patients will be initiated with 1120mg of Durvalumab q
      3weeks with 500mg of AZD2811.

      In case of a positive risk benefit profile the recruitment will continue.

      Subjects will receive AZD2811 500mg and durvalumab 1500mg via IV administered on Day 1 for
      every 3weeks (fixed dosing for subjects > 30 kg body weight). One cycle consists of 3 weeks.
      The sequence of the infusion is Durvalumab administered over 1 hour, followed by AZD2811
      administered over 2 hours. The optimal proposed time between infusions is 15 min to 30 min.
      The compatibility of drug products in infusion line has not been tested. Therefore, the
      infusion line must be flushed with saline after the administration of one drug product and
      before the start of the second drug product.
