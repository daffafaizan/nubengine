    
      The primary outcome would be to evaluate the peri-implant bone level changes (marginal bone
      level) around the implant platform.

      The secondary outcomes would be:

        -  To evaluate the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) changes according to the measurements
           performed with the instrument Penguin RFA

        -  To evaluate the implant and prosthetic failure rate as well as the implant and
           prosthetic complication rates

        -  The patient satisfaction related to the implant treatment
