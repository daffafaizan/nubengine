      cardiovascular (CV) diagnosis over the past two decades. Many patients with a cardiomyopathy
      are also found to have a bystander coronary artery disease, not responsible for their
      cardiomyopathy. However, the prognostic value of those bystander coronary artery diseases is
      not known.

      Also, new imaging techniques have been developed to assess coronary microvascular disease,
      but the prognostic value of these findings is not known.

      In this study, the investigators evaluate the incidence and the prognosis of bystander
      coronary artery disease and microvascular disease in patients with ischemic, hypertrophic,
      dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathies in 5 French centers.

      Coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), tomographic coronary artery
      angiography, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), rest and stress
      trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) results will be recorded.

      Macrovascular coronary artery disease is defined by :

        -  a stenosis > 50 % in coronary angiography confirmed with myocardial ischemia (SPECT,
           stress echocardiography),

        -  a stenosis > 70 % (50% if it is the left main coronary artery)

        -  or a stenosis 30-70 % with a fractional flow reserve (FFR) < 0.8 Microvascular disease
           is defined by an index of microvascular resistance (IMR) >23 or myocardial perfusion
           heterogeneity imaging (MPHI) > 4 using SPECT or CMR.

      Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be assessed 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after
      enrollment.
