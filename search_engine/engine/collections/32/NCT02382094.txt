      versus total androgen blockage.

      Exploratory parameters: ▪ Time to PSA relapse

        -  Time to symptom giving metastasis

        -  Overall survival

      Patients with localized /locally advanced prostate cancer were subject to treatment with
      curative intention. They could be divided into three groups according to the risk of
      metastasis. Mainly intermediate risk group of patients were included in this study. Patients
      with low risk could be included if they were subject to neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy.
      Different risk groups were defined as below:

      Low risk group: PSA ≤10 ng/ml Gleason score ≤ 6 Tumour stage ≤ T2b Intermediate risk group:
      Presence of 1-2 factors of high risk. High risk group: PSA >10 ng/ml Gleason score ≥7 Tumour
      stage T2c - T3b
