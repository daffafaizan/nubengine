    
      To meet the wishes of the Ministry of Health, the division of Cardiology University Hospital
      of Clermont Ferrand, combining the cardiology and cardiac surgery department, has developed
      since January 2009, a therapeutic education to use oral anticoagulants, in collaboration with
      the functional rehabilitation center Durtol. All patients under VKA, are formed by nurses.
      The purpose of this local study, in cardiac surgery department, is to evaluate the
      therapeutic impact of two methods of comprehensive education, one conventional and performed
      by nurses service, less elaborate, relying solely on the book Information from The National
      Security Agency of Medicines and Health Products, the other based on more detailed documents
      created by a multidisciplinary group. Various studies show that the effect of therapeutic
      education is observed only during the first six months and then disappears.

      This study is the first French study evaluating the impact of a comprehensive education to
      oral anticoagulation according to the latest recommendations of the National Security Agency
      of Medicines and Health Products and the French National Health Authority.
