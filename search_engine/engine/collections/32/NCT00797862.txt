    
      This study was designed to evaluate if patients with hypertension treated early with a
      combination therapy would achieve better blood pressure (BP) control, than patients being
      treated with a classical sequential add-on therapy.

      The study compared the effects of the two treatment strategies: Treatment initiation on a
      single compound, either with aliskiren or amlodipine, and then continuation with the
      combination of both versus treatment initiation with the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine
      and then continuation with the combination. The study also evaluated if the overall mean
      sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP)-lowering effect during the study, as well as the
      change from baseline to study end in msSBP, are superior in the group having received
      combination therapy from the beginning.

      The study further evaluated the BP-lowering efficacy and tolerability of both treatment
      strategies.
