      single-blind trial with 2 follow-ups (one week and one month after intervention) that will be
      performed between January 2017 and March 2017 in one private physiotherapy clinic in Malaga,
      Spain. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline (t1), one week after intervention (t2), and
      one month after intervention (t3). Written informed consent will be acquired for all
      participants prior to their participation. The study will be implemented and reported in line
      with the CONSORT statement.

      Recruitment Eligible participants who will be interested in the study will be asked to
      provide written informed consent to participate. Subsequently the patient-reported outcome
      measures will be completed to establish baseline pain, function, rotator cuff strength,
      scapular muscle activity, scapular muscle endurance and level of self-efficacy. After
      completion of the baseline measures, the participants will be randomly allocated to the
      isoinertial training plus eccentric or eccentric training groups. The measures of pain,
      function, rotator cuff strength, scapular muscle activity, scapular muscle endurance and
      self-efficacy will be repeated one week and one month after intervention. Anonymized age and
      gender will be collected for those participants who decline to take part in the study to
      assess the external validity of the recruited sample of participants. Participant data files
      will be stored in numerical order and in a secure and accessible place and manner.
      Participant files will be maintained in storage for a period of 3 years after completion of
      the study.
