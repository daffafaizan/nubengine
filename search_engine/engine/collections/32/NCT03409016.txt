      of immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The
      study includes a control population of patients receiving standard chemotherapy as a
      comparator. Patients will undergo blood draws at 4 time-points while on standard of care
      treatment. There are no study-related medications or interventions beyond blood sampling.
