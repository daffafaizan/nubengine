      infraclavicular subclavian vein (IP-ISV) and in-plane supraclavicular subclavian vein
      (IP-SSV) catheterization.

      For IP -ISV, the Linear transducer is placed perpendicularly and inferior to clavicle.
      Transverse (short axis) view of subclavian vein (SCV), subclavian artery (SCA) and pleura is
      first obtained. With SCV centrally positioned, the transducer is rotated 90° clockwise until
      longitudinal view of subclavian vein is obtained. Pulse-wave Doppler view of the SCV confirms
      non-pulsatile flow and identifies the vessel. The needle is than inserted in the midpoint of
      the small footprint transducer using the in-plane approach. The needle is advanced slowly,
      under real-time US guidance targeting the SCV, taking note of the lung pleura underneath the
      vessels.

      For IP-SSV cannulation, a short-axis view of the IJV is first obtained . The probe is slid
      caudally following the IJV until the junction of the subclavian vein (SCV) and IJV is reached
      in the supraclavicular fossa. The probe is then turned slightly and tilted anteriorly to get
      the best long-axis view of the SCV and the brachiocephalic vein .

      Using an in-plane approach, the needle attached to a syringe is inserted at the base of the
      transducer at a 30° angle and advanced strictly under the long axis of the US probe from
      lateral to medial. The needle point is then guided.

      In both groups, catheterization was done through Seldinger technique.
