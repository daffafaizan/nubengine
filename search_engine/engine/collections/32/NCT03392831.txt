    
      Patient recruitment: Adult and pediatric patients will be included during hospitalization in
      the clinical/surgical units at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre.

      Variables of registry: Clinical data (diagnosis, reason for indication of catheter, site of
      insertion, vessel size, pharmacological treatment); Socio-demographic (age, sex, education,
      income); Ultrasonography (vessel evaluation); Radiography (to ensure the correct positioning
      of the catheter); economic variables (costs of all inputs used).

      Data collection: All variables will be recorded in an instrument developed by the authors.

      Statistical analysis: Continuous variables will be described using means and standard
      deviations or median and range in case of asymmetric distribution of data. Categorical
      variables will be presented using frequency distribution. Analyses will be conducted using
      chi-square and t tests for independent samples. P values <0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant. A Statistical Package for Social Sciences v.20.0 will be used. The
      Cox Regression Analysis and Log-rank test will compare the groups in relation to
      complication-free survival.

      Cost-effectiveness analysis: The cost-effectiveness analysis will be measured by the
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), showed by the difference in cost between
      intervention and control group, divided by the difference in their effect. It represents the
      average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect. The
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on the cost estimate for insertion and maintenance
      of the catheter, including values of the inputs used, medicines, costs with professionals,
      surgical environment, laboratory and imaging exams.
