      versus annual anthelminthic treatment on the incidence of clinical malaria in healthy school
      children.

      The target population includes children attending primary school in western Kenya. The
      accessible population includes children attending the participating primary schools in
      standards 1-7 in western Kenya. The unit of analysis is the individual child. Children with
      informed consent and assent will be screened for helminth infections and those children found
      to be infected with either Ascaris lumbricoides or hookworm species will be recruited into
      the study. These children will be randomized to one or two groups, receiving either
      albendazole treatment every three months or albendazole at the start of the study and placebo
      every three months thereafter. Cross-sectional health surveys will be conducted before the
      intervention and at 6, 12 and 18 months follow-up. Weekly active case detection during school
      visits will be undertaken.
