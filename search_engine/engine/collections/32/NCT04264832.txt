      disorders in women of reproductive age. It is also one of the leading causes of anovulatory
      infertility and secondary amenorrhea, which represent major stress factors in the female
      life. In the previous studies, the investigators found that PCOS patients showed decreased
      quality-of-life and increased psychological disturbances compared with healthy controls. Body
      mass index (BMI) was associated with emotional disorders and physical aspects of
      quality-of-life and negative emotions were negatively correlated with BMI in PCOS
      patients.These results prompted that PCOS could be separated into at least two subtypes by
      the fat content. So the investigators expand the epidemiological investigation for comparing
      the body composition between the PCOS and the normal women, and finding specific biological
      indicators in different subtypes.
