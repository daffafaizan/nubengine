      mobility. Factors affecting the mobility of the joints may be due to muscle tension,
      ligamentous or anatomical anomalies.

      Research over the last years have reported a scarce of trials investigating chiropractic
      treatment of the ankle joint. Previous studies have focused on investigating ROM and
      proprioception. This study aimed to determine whether a single high-velocity, low-amplitude
      (HVLA) thrust manipulation to the talo-crural joint altered ankle function in subjects with
      dysfunction of the talo-crural joint.
