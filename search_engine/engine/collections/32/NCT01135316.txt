      in up to 15 active sites in the United States. All patients will receive 1 dose of Ablavar as
      part of an MRI examination in their routine clinical management. Prior to undergoing an
      Ablavar MRI, patients will have a baseline serum creatinine test within 24 hours prior to
      Ablavar administration, will sign an Informed Consent (IC) form, will undergo a limited exam
      for skin abnormalities, and will undergo a brief medical history assessment on the day of and
      prior to Ablavar administration. A standardized NSF questionnaire will be administered to the
      patient at 48 (+ or -12) hours, 1 month (+ or - 1 week), 3 months (+ or - 2 weeks), 6 (+ or -
      1) months, and 18 (+ or - 1) months post-dose. At 12 (+ or - 1) months, and at 24 (+ or - 1)
      months. Patients will return to the clinic for a limited examination for skin abnormalities
      and formal review of signs and symptoms suggestive of NSF.
