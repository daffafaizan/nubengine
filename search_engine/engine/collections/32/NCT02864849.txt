      MRI defined high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.

      MRI imaging features as mrT3c/T3d/T4a/T4b, threatening circumferential resection margin, mrN2
      disease or extramural vascular invasion are defined as high-risk factor and proved to
      associated with unfavorable oncological outcome, especially for distant metastasis. Induction
      and consolidation chemotherapy plus radiation may increase both systemic and local control.
      Total neoadjuvant treatment schedule also has advantages as improved patient tolerance, early
      closure of defunctioning ileostomy etc.

      In this study, patients with MRI defined high-risk rectal cancer will receive 3 cycles
      induction CapeOX, intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and 2 cycles
      consolidation CapeOX and Total mesorectal excision.

      The induction chemotherapy related G3-4 toxicity occurred in 42% of patients in GCR-3 trial
      (23% during RT, 19% during induction chemotherapy). It is hypothesized that the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy related G3-4 toxicity rate of the present regimen will be lower than 25% (10%
      during IMRT, 15% during induction/consolidation chemotherapy). A sample size of 67 achieves
      80% power to detect a difference (△P =17%, P1=25%, P0=42%) using a one-sided binomial test.
      (α= 0.05). If the number of G3-4 toxic event is 21 or less, the hypothesis that P1>= 42% is
      rejected. About 10 % loss to follow-up was anticipated, so an additional eight patients will
      be recruited. The study requires 75 subjects in all.
