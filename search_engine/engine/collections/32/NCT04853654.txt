      and rehabilitation. In literature studies, it is stated that eccentric and concentric
      exercises are effective exercise approaches in increasing strength and reducing fatigue.
      However, the best exercise method is not yet clear in terms of providing better performance
      adaptation with less fatigue. Considering the architectural features of the lower extremity
      muscles, it is aimed to increase the angle of pennation with programs that include concentric
      strengthening of the quadriceps, gastro-soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, which are suitable
      muscle groups to produce large forces by design. With programs that include eccentric
      strengthening of the hamstring and tibialis anterior muscles that function in a wide range of
      motion and have high excursion ability, it is aimed to increase fiber length.
