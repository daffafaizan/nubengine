      materials is the third major cause of renal hospital acquired renal dysfunction. Renal
      dysfunction occurs most often in patients with chronic renal failure and or patients with
      diabetes mellitus and contributes to the morbidity and mortality. Previous research work
      proved that the use volume expansion with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is superior to volume
      expiation alone to prevent renal impairment due to radio-contrast5. NAC a potent anti oxidant
      may prevent CIN by stopping direct oxidative tissue damage and by improving renal
      hemodynamics.Pentoxyfylline has also proven to have a significant anti inflammatory effect as
      well as anti oxidant effect.Preangiographic and the highest post-angiographic values of
      Creatinine and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) will be recorded. Levels of the
      biomarker Neutrophil - gelatinase - associated lipocalin (NGAL) will be tested randomly in 49
      patients p as a biomarker for contrast induced nephropathy. Blood serology for NGAL will be
      drown from patients before the procedure and 2 hours after angiography.
