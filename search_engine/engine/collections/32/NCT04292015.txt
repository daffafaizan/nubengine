    
      This is a pilot prospective randomised study. As part of the routine clinical care at RDH,
      all premature infants eligible for ROP screening as stated by the UK ROP screening guidelines
      will undergo the gold standard screening examination by a Consultant Ophthalmologist.

      Each infant eligible for ROP screening will be routinely scheduled for several ROP screening
      examinations prior to discharge from the neonatal unit. For each infant who is eligible and
      whose parent(s) or legal guardian have agreed for them to be enrolled in the study, two
      additional procedures to the gold standard examination with the binocular indirect
      ophthalmoscope (as stated above) will be carried out at each of its routinely scheduled ROP
      screening examination.

      The first additional procedure will be the acquisition of images of both fundi by
      Ophthalmology Specialty Registrar with the Optos ultra-widefield retinal-imaging device.
      Cardiorespiratory indices will be collected at different time points of the Optos retinal
      imaging procedure.

      The second additional procedure will be the collection of cardiorespiratory indices
      (including the heart rate,respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, and blood pressure) by the
      paediatric research nurse at the time of the gold standard examination with the binocular
      indirect ophthalmoscope. The equipment used will be the same as those used to measure the
      cardiorespiratory indices during different time points of the Optos ultra-widefield retinal
      imaging procedure (see above).
