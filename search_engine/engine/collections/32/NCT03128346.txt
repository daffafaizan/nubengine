      thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block for breast cancer resection. In this article, he showed
      that branches of the intercostal nerves (Th2-6) dominate the region of the internal mammary
      area. By administering local anesthetics between the internal intercostal and transversus
      thoracic muscle, analgesia in the anterior chest and sternum can be obtained. A cadaveric
      study shows injectate spread from the second to fifth intercostal spaces with a single 15mL
      injection between the third and fourth ribs next to the sternum. They further published a
      case series of two patients who successfully underwent median sternotomy for aortic valve
      replacement and thymoma resection using only the TTP block for analgesia. Fast- track cardiac
      surgery is now widely practiced, and evidence for its safety and efficacy has spurred its
      adoption. With the increased demand for health care resources including nursing manpower and
      ICU beds, postoperative patients are returning to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit
      (CSICU) on shorter acting anesthetic agents so that they can be awakened, following commands
      and spontaneously ventilating earlier. The TTP block fits in well with the fast- track
      paradigm. By providing adequate analgesia for median sternotomy, the TTP block may reduce
      narcotic requirements and consequent sedation and respiratory depression, hypercapnia and
      respiratory acidosis, prolonged mechanical ventilation and need for emergency advanced airway
      interventions.
