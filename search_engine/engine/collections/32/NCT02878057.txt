      life quality of the patients with breast cancer has been improved greatly, and the survival
      of the patients has been extended as well. However, the treatment of the patients with
      recurrent and metastatic breast cancer remains a major problem. There is still a lack of
      effective targeted therapy for Her-2 negative breast cancer.

      Based on the present researches on the anti-angiogenesis drugs in advanced breast cancer, the
      investigators believe that it is necessary to further explore the efficacy and safety of
      apatinib in advanced breast cancer. The aim of this research is to evaluate the
      progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients with HER-2 negative advanced breast cancer
      with chest wall metastasis in the treatment of apatinib.
