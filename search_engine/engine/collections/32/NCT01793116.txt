    
      The Moderate Preterm Registry is a registry of moderate preterm infants (29-33 weeks
      gestational age) born alive in NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) centers. The purpose is
      to collect baseline and outcome data in a uniform manner on a cohort of infants.

      The registry collects observational baseline data on both mothers and infants, and the
      therapies used and outcomes of the infants. The information collected is not specific to a
      disease or treatment (i.e., it is "generic"). Baseline data is collected soon after admission
      to the NICU; outcome data is collected at the time of death or discharge from the hospital.
      The data collected includes information on:

        -  Demographics of mother and infant

        -  Mother's health (e.g., pregnancy history and complications)

        -  Labor and deliver (e.g., rupture of the membranes, steroids and antibiotics given, mode
           of delivery)

        -  Infant's health (gestational age, Apgar scores, weight, length, delivery room
           resuscitation, respiratory support, etc.)

        -  Infant's medical outcome (heart, lung, nervous system, gastrointestinal system, hearing,
           and vision, known infections, and major malformations/syndromes, and mortality or number
           of days hospitalized).

      These data are used: to examine associations between baseline characteristics, treatments,
      and outcomes; to track trends in incidences of disease and effectiveness of therapies; and to
      identify questions requiring additional in-depth research.
