    
      3 groups of patients:

        -  Controls: patients with normal weight (23 < BMI < 27) operated for myocardial
           revascularization by bypass surgery, without infarction, or for valve pathologies
           without endocarditis

        -  Endocarditis: patients with normal weight (23 < BMI < 27) carriers of endocarditis with
           surgery indication

        -  Obese: obese patients (BMI > 30) operated for myocardial revascularization by bypass
           surgery, without infarction, or for valve pathologies without endocarditis

      Comparisons studied:

        -  Controls vs. endocarditis

        -  Controls vs. obese patients
