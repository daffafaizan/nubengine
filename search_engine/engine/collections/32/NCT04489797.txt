    
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized study in healthy participants to evaluate
      the effect of proton-pump inhibitors (rabeprazole; PPI) on acalabrutinib 100-mg capsule dosed
      orally with COCA-COLA. Participants will receive a single dose of acalabrutinib alone or with
      rabeprazole, and pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and tolerability will be assessed.
