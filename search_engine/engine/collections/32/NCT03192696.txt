    
      This is a prospective, global, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Pantheris OCT-Imaging System to perform atherectomy of in-stent
      restenotic (ISR) lesions in lower extremity arteries.

      The trial will enroll up to 140 subjects diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease of the
      lower extremities that have previously been treated with stenting at up to 20 sites. The
      primary disease must be located in reference vessel diameter of >3.0mm and â‰¤7.0mm. Trial
      success is focused on safety, including rates of major adverse events through 30 days as
      adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee, and effectiveness, which will be evaluated using
      technical success defined as the percent of target lesions that have residual diameter
      stenosis <50% post-treatment with the Pantheris device alone as assessed by Angiographic Core
      Lab.
