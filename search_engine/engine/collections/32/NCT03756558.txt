      percutaneous cardiac or peripheral procedures that use the retrograde common femoral artery
      access route for large bore (8-18F ID) interventional devices. The function of Cross-Seal is
      to percutaneously close the puncture in the artery wall (arteriotomy) through which the
      catheters were inserted for the procedure.

      The study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Cross-Seal in
      achieving hemostasis in femoral arterial access sites in subjects undergoing percutaneous
      transcatheter interventional procedures using a large-bore procedure sheath.
