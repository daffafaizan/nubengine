      Hypercapnic stimuli for CVR will be delivered by prospective end-tidal CO2 targeting device.
      Hemodynamic responses will be determined by BOLD signal changes using fMRI. WMHs will be
      determined by high-resolution 3D FLAIR imaging. Patients and controls will undergo serial
      MRIs with 1 year interval. Associations between areas of reduced CVR and consequent WMH
      development will be tested in both patients and controls.
