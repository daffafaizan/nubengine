           inclusion/exclusion criterion:

           Inclusion Criterion:

           Clinical history of diabetes mellitus or diabetic retinopathy; Fully Gradable Images;
           around 45Â° field which covers optic disc and macula; complete patient identification
           information;

           Exclusion Criterion:

           incomplete patient identification information;

        2. DR grading by expert panel At first, retinal images are graded by three experts
           independently, then they met for a consensus meeting to discuss cases without initial
           agreement. If they can't achieve consensus, a final decision is made by the principal
           investigator. Experts give a grading of both DR and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) for
           each image according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy severity scale
           criteria and hard exudates around optic disc.

        3. Blinding and DR grading by CAD system Before DR grading by CAD system, a randomized
           identification(ID) is assigned to each retinal image, which ensures that investigator
           responsible for CAD system operation is masked to the expert panel grading result. Both
           DR and DME grading is generated by the CAD system and the results are exported.

        4. Unblinding Finally, all data are unblinded and results of the CAD system are compared to
           the results of human grading, which is considered the gold standard, using measures as
           sensitivity and specificity;
