      insulin secretion. The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP-4) cleaves intact GLP-1 within
      minutes and DPP-4 inhibitors are therefore used for treatment of diabetic hyperglycemia. A
      few animal studies have implicated the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (24.11) in the
      degradation of GLP-1 but if this is the case in humans is unknown. We therefore administered
      a NEP inhibitor, 194mg sacubitril, a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin 100mg the night before and
      100mg 2 hours before), both, or place, to nine healthy men during a standardized meal and
      measured plasma concentrations of GLP-1
