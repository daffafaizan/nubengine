      muscle glycogen is systematically depleted, glucose uptake systematically increased, and meal
      sizes are naturally larger than normal: a week of camp at high altitude, with the concomitant
      variable of oxygen consumption that this environment involves; during the winter, that will
      expose and challenge the different components of the system during cold temperatures, and
      with twice daily practice of physical activity designed to deplete glycogen reserves such as
      skiing.

      This proposal aims to demonstrate the superiority of the CLC, also known as Artificial
      Pancreas (AP), compared to the state-of-the art system available on the market:
      Sensor-augmented pump (SAP). This system has shown to diminish hypoglycemic events by setting
      the alarms on the continues glucose monitor (CGM) and taken action, such as performing
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and treating if it is confirm to be low.
