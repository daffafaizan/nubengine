      I. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to aminocamptothecin (9-AC) in
      patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Assess the toxicity of 9-AC in these patients. III. Validate a preliminary
      pharmacodynamic model relating total 9-AC concentration, albumin, and bilirubin to toxicity.

      IV. Determine whether 9-AC concentrations correlate with response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease histology (International Working Formulation
      (IWF) A-C vs IWF D-F) and center.

      Patients receive aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease, partial response (PR), or complete response
      (CR) may receive 2 additional courses past best response (minimum of 6 courses if PR or CR).
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
