      I. Assess the recurrence free survival (RFS) at 2 years after RPLND when RPLND is used as a
      first line treatment for patients with testicular seminoma and low volume (=< 2cm)
      retroperitoneal disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the percent of patients, after treatment with RPLND, who can avoid external beam
      radiotherapy (XRT) or systemic chemotherapy (CTX) for seminoma.

      II. Assess the complications associated with primary RPLND for seminoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo RPLND.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 4 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
