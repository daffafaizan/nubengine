      identify atypically developing infants from their typically developing peers. Twenty-four
      infants will be recruited to participate, including 12 who are developing typically and 12
      who are identified as at-risk for neuromotor delay. Infants with typical development will be
      at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age, score in the low-risk category on the
      Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS), score a greater than 85 on all sub-scales
      of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-II), have no history of significant cardiac,
      orthopedic, or neurological condition, and gestational age at least 37 weeks. Infants at risk
      for neuromotor delay will be at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age (corrected for
      preterm birth if applicable), score in the moderate or high risk categories on the BINS, and
      score an 85 or less on the motor sub-scales of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development
      (BSID-II). In an effort to decrease variability of the data, infants in each group will be
      further stratified into an older group (8-10+ months) and a younger group (3-5 months).
