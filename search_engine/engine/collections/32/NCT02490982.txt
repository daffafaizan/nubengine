      Teriflunomide by their treating physician will be asked to complete questionnaires on quality
      of life (QoL), fatigue, and employment.

      The study will include 300 participants from three Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics. Disease
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), complete blood count (CBC)), drug compliance, side effects,
      toxicity, will be monitored.

      MS patients never treated with a disease modifying drug (DMD) and MS patients previously
      exposed to another DMD will be included. Some would have been on a single medication, while
      others would have been treated with two or more medications.

      The results of the study will provide the patient-perceived global impacts of Teriflunomide
      on the patient's overall quality of life.

      These results will also guide the physician in giving a treatment that will be adapted to the
      patient's major concerns.
