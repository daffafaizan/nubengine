      symptoms, such as dyspnea, dizziness, chest tightness, feelings of choking and sensations of
      smothering are common in both disorders. The overlap in symptoms between asthma and panic may
      lead an individual to mistake a panic attack as an asthma attack. In order to better
      understand this overlap, we hypothesized that participants who received Cognitive Behavioral
      Psychophysiological Therapy (CBPT) would display greater reductions in PD severity and
      improvements in asthma control at post- treatment and 3-month follow-up. We predicted that
      improvements in PD severity in the CBPT group would be mediated by reductions in the
      perceived physical consequences of anxiety. We selected music therapy and paced breathing at
      each participant's average respiration rate for the comparison active treatment. Randomized
      participants will undergo either the CBPT or MRT protocol, be given the same psychological
      assessments, and have their physiological data collected.
