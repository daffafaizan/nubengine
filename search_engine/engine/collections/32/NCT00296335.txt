      worldwide. The most effective treatment for gastric cancer is curative surgical resection of
      primary tumor. However, a substantial number of patients eventually die of recurrences after
      curative resection. A number of randomized trials investigating the role of adjuvant
      chemotherapy have been conducted. However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is still
      controversial and varied between Western and Asian trials. Meta-analysis of Western trials
      didn't demonstrate the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. Conversely,
      some Asian studies have demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative
      resection. In a previous study, mitomycin plus tegafur prolonged the survival in resected
      gastric cancer compared to no treatment.

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of mitomycin, cisplatin and prolonged
      treatment with doxifluridine compared to mitomycin plus doxifluridine.
