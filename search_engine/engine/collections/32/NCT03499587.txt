      healthy. We will measure their body composition, food intake and other characteristics during
      pregnancy. When their babies are born, we will evaluate the brain development of their babies
      using magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography at age two weeks. We will then
      compare the findings and see if their are differences.
