      semi-repetitive cross study with 48 subjects. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive one period of test formulation or two period of reference formulation,
      followed by a 1-day washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. Serial
      blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected at 0 hours (predose) up to 8
      hours postdose. The plasma concentrations of capecitabine were analyzed by LC/MS-MS.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters (non-compartmental model) were assessed with WinNonlin software.
      The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed were area under the plasma concentration-time curve
      from time 0 to the time of last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), AUC from time zero to
      infinity (AUC0-∞), the peak plasma concentration of the drug (C max ), time needed to reach
      maximum concentration (Tmax), the elimination half-life (t1/2), and terminal elimination rate
      (λz). All were analyzed using an ANOVA model after logarithmic transformation of the data.
      For establishing bioequivalence (BE) for capecitabine， reference-scaled average
      bioequivalence (RSABE) acceptance criteria and average bioequivalence (ABE) acceptance
      criteria were used. Safety and tolerability was assessed during the entire study period.
