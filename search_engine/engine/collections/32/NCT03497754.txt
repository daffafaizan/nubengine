      Objective: Cardiac output measurements using transthoracic ultrasound (TTE) with and without
      the use of the probeFixR will be evaluated in terms of accuracy. The TTE measurements will be
      combined with another form of cardiac output measurements (FlotracR) after a passive leg
      rasing (PLR) test.

      Study design prospective, feasibility study Study population: Adult Intensive Care patients (
      > 18 years)

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Consecutive adult patients on the ICU in which the FlotracR monitor is used will be evaluated
      after detection of hypovolemia.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        -  Percentage of patients in which the ProbeFixR can be used

        -  The correlation between the measurements done by FlotracR and TTE with and TTE without
           ProbeFixR

      Although no side effects are to be expected the investigators will monitor the patients after
      the ProbeFix is removed for any skin damage. The investigators will grade this damage into 3
      categories:

        -  No skin marks

        -  Mild skin marks (no treatment necessary)

        -  Severe skin marks (surgical or medical treatment necessary)

        -  If the patients are awake the investigators will ask them whether they felt the
           ProbeFixR to be unpleasant on a scale of 0-10 (0 being: I did not feel anything and 10
           being very unpleasant).
