      role in innate immunity and act against the bacterial cell wall. Smoking is the most
      important environmental risk factor for periodontitis. This study determined the effect of
      smoking on PGRP-1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in smokers and nonsmokers with
      chronic periodontitis (CP) following initial periodontal therapy.
