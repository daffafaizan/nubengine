      study which will compare bite force measurements over a 12 hour period across two cream
      denture adhesives with a currently marketed cream denture adhesive (positive control), and a
      negative/no treatment control. A short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture
      characteristics of each denture adhesive after a single use will also be administered to give
      an indication of participant satisfaction of these attributes.
