      Phase 3 studies in the following surgical indications: spinal surgery, major hepatic
      resection, peripheral arterial bypass (PAB) surgery, arteriovenous (AV) graft formation for
      hemodialysis access, and skin graft surgery following burn injury. Limited data on rThrombin
      reexposure currently exist. This study will assess the immunogenicity and safety of rThrombin
      in participants who are undergoing a surgical procedure during which topical rThrombin
      application is planned and who previously received rThrombin in Phase 3 clinical trials or
      during prior spine, AV graft formation, or PAB surgical procedures.
