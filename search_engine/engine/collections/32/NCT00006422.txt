    
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow the pediatric and strabismus specialists at the
      National Eye Institute to gain additional knowledge of the course of various pediatric eye
      diseases and strabismus and to evaluate the effects of standard treatments for these
      diseases. This understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. This protocol will also
      allow for the maintenance of populations of patients with specific pediatric eye diseases and
      strabismus that may be eligible for future protocols. In addition, by allowing for the care
      of persons with a spectrum of these diseases, the protocol will be valuable for the training
      of pediatric eye disease and ocular motility fellows. The pediatric and eye movement
      specialists at the National Eye Institute are free to choose those diseases that interest
      them.

      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under
      this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for each pediatric or ocular
      motor disease. All alternatives for evaluation and care will be reviewed with each patient,
      and the patient's family.

      Patients in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential
      eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiological protocols as they are
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,
      they will not be required to enter any new protocol and their decision to participate will be
      entirely voluntary.
