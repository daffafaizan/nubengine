    
      This is a multi-centric retrospective study comparing patients of similar characteristics
      with diagnosis of acute appendicitis that have been treated either by open appendectomy using
      a double-ring wound-edge protector or by laparoscopic appendectomy between January 2011 and
      December 2016 at Hospital Recoletas Campo Grande de Valladolid and Hospital Comarcal de
      Medina del Campo.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the incidence of superficial surgical site
      infection in both groups.

      All patients included in the study must meet inclusion criteria and all data will be
      collected anonymously in order to comply with local law on personal data protection (Organic
      Law 15/1999 from 13 December about personal data protection).

      The authors of the study expect results of the study to be comparable with those in current
      literature regarding surgical site infections, hospital stay and procedure safety.
