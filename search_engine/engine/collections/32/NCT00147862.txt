      carries with it the risk of postoperative bacterial infection1 and increased recurrence rates
      in certain types of cancers. Lower transfusion trigger, preoperative autologous blood
      donation with or without erythropoietin, intraoperative red blood cell salvage, regional
      anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and antifibrinolytic agents are all useful means to
      decrease the need for allogenic transfusions.

      Tranexamic acid, a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that binds to the lysine binding site of
      plasminogen and blocks the binding of plasminogen to the fibrin surface. Thus plasminogen
      activation is prevented and fibrinolysis is delayed. It has been used to reduce blood loss
      during coronary revascularization, orthotopic liver transplantation4, scoliosis correction
      surgery and other orthopedic procedures. The use of tranexamic acid intraoperatively has been
      shown to reduce blood loss by 25 - 40% in various studies. The primary concern when
      administering an antifibrinolytic drug is the potential increased incidence of thromboembolic
      events. A common misconception is that synthetic antifibrinolytic drugs increase blood
      clotting. The drugs do not alter blood clotting, but rather slow dissolution of blood clots.
      There is no data on the utility of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss in head & neck cancer
      surgery.

      We wanted to compare Tranexamic Acid infusion to Saline (Placebo)infusion to see whether
      Tranexamic ACid Administration will reduce blood loss. Reduction in transfusion requirements
      will lead to reduced costs and possible reduction in complications of blood transfusion.
