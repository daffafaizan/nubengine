      diagnosis at the first diagnosis can be as high as 25%. For advanced breast cancer, previous
      views have suggested that surgery as one of the palliative treatments does not improve
      patient survival. The proportion of patients undergoing surgery for stage IV breast cancer
      has gradually decreased over the past 30 years. At present, there is still no clear
      recommendation and guidance in common clinical guidelines for the primary surgery for stage
      IV breast cancer. Some retrospective studies suggest that surgery can improve the survival of
      advanced breast cancer, but the results of prospective studies are inconclusive, and surgery
      is still not a routine choice for stage IV breast cancer.
