      SCOUT DS, random capillary glucose (RCG) and the Leicester diabetes risk questionnaire for
      detecting prediabetes and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in subjects at risk, but not having a
      pre-exiting diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A point of care A1c measurement (Siemens DCA
      Vantage or Axis-Shield Afinion) will serve as the reference method for defining a positive
      screen (A1c â‰¥ 6.0%).
