    
      This protocol is designed for screening of subjects prior to a decision as to their
      eligibility for participation on a Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and
      Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) tissue procurement or investigative therapy protocol. The purpose
      of the protocol is to allow investigation into any underlying immunologic and/or inflammatory
      processes and to assess the status of organ systems, important both to determine suitability
      for participation on specific protocols and/or ability to safely tolerate tissue procurement
      or investigative treatments and procedures. It also allows the investigation as to whether
      subjects are eligible for participation as a volunteer based on eligibility criteria that
      include generally good health status by history and physical examination and laboratory
      assessment. After completion of the screening process, the subject will either be offered an
      opportunity to participate in a specific research protocol, or if no appropriate protocol is
      identified, will have recommendations for other treatment options conveyed to the primary or
      referring physician.

      Primary objective is to determine subject eligibility for participation on Center for Human
      Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) tissue procurement or investigative
      therapy protocols.

      Primary endpoint is the results of clinical, imaging and laboratory assessments.
