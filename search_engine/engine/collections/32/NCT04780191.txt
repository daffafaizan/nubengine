      post-stroke. In the lower limbs, adduction and extension of the knee with equinovarus foot is
      the most observed pattern. Spasticity can lead to pain, ankylosis, and tendon retraction
      which may limit the potential success of rehabilitation. Spasticity can also affect
      quality-of-life and can be highly detrimental to daily activities such as walking.

      An initial clinical trial of safety and feasibility suggested that five sessions of treatment
      with the MyoRegulator® device temporarily reduces spasticity and overall stiffness of the
      affected extremity with optimal reductions in spasticity occurring 2-3 weeks post stimulation
      intervention.

      MyoRegulator® is a non-invasive neuromodulation device using multi-site direct current
      stimulation for the treatment of spasticity. The main objectives of this study are to
      evaluate the performance and safety of the MyoRegulator® device in active versus sham treated
      patients during and after 5 consecutive days of treatment sessions. Patients can take part in
      an optional 3-month follow-up.

      The primary performance endpoint is defined as the reduction in ankle joint spasticity. The
      study will be considered to have a successful outcome if the actively treated subjects
      demonstrate a statistically greater reduction in spasticity, as measured by the Tardieu
      Scale, as compared to the sham treated subjects after five treatment sessions.

      The primary safety endpoint is defined as the incidence of device-related serious adverse
      events. The safety of the device will be demonstrated if there are no incidents of serious
      adverse events caused or contributed to by the device treatment that are clinically
      unacceptable in light of the treatment benefits.
