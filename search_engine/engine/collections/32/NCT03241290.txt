      tube) represent a significant improvement; especially in term of image rendering, irradiation
      dose reduction and ergonomy.

      THALES-EVAQUAL is a prospective,monocentric, unrandomized, and uncontrolled study which
      objective is to assess C-ARM ARCO FP-Rk521S in term of quality of image. It also evaluates
      its ability to be used during Orthopedic, neurological and neurological surgeries.

      Patient included in the study will have a surgery during which C-ARM is used. This study
      doesn't modify the medical care of the patient.

      After each surgery, a digital scale of image quality will be filled by the surgeon for each
      aquisition. Other feedback questionnaires regarding the suitability of the device and the
      satisfaction of the surgeon will also be completed.
