      Patients with COPD walk less in daily life than their healthy peers. Gait characteristics of
      extrapulmonary comorbidities that probably affect the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular
      system vary. The gait assessment gives an idea about the biomechanical factors associated
      with a reduction in walking distance in COPD patients. In patients with COPD, after the onset
      of shortness of breath or leg fatigue, a decrease in cadence during walking, shortened stride
      length, an increase in the time spent in the double support period, an increase in the peak
      ankle dorsi flexion moment is observed. During gait, there is an increase in balance
      disorders in the mediolateral direction. In addition, patients with COPD walk on a constant
      speed treadmill with more stride time and less step width variability. Studies have shown
      that patients with COPD have increased temporal walking characteristics, decreased step and
      stride length, and increased walking variability.

      In the literature, most of the studies that examine gait characteristics and balance
      separately or examine the relationship between them are on patients with COPD. No study
      examining gait parameters in other obstructive pulmonary patients such as bronchiectasis and
      asthma has been found. A persuasive link between walking disorders and falls in COPD patients
      is still unknown and further research is needed. This study will contribute to clarifying the
      mechanisms of why the balance studied in patients with COPD is adversely affected.
