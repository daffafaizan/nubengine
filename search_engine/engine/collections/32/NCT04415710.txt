      imbalance in rheumatological disorders. Vaginal dryness and dyspepsia negatively affect
      participation in sexual activity. The aim of the study is to examine the pelvic floor
      problems of women with SS with a self-report, to compare them with healthy individuals, and
      finally to examine the relationship between pelvic floor problems and sexual dysfunction.
