    
      STUDY DESIGN This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II maintenance study
      is evaluating the efficacy of UV1-olaparib-durvalumab combination as maintenance therapy
      after platinum combination therapy for BRCAwt patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.

      Number of total subjects to be included in the trial:

      160 patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Patients are randomized into one of the three treatment arms, (A:B:C), in a 1:1:2
      randomization:

        -  Arm A (olaparib): 46 subjects

        -  Arm B (olaparib plus durvalumab): 46 subjects

        -  Arm C (olaparib plus durvalumab plus UV1): 92 subjects

      Patients are stratified according to:

        -  HRD status

        -  Previous use of PARP inhibitor (yes/no)

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib (arm A) to that
      of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus
           durvalumab (arm B) to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)

        -  To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus
           durvalumab to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 according to stratification
           factors

        -  To evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in treatment arms

        -  To evaluate safety in treatment arms

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To describe genetic, molecular, and immunological mechanisms in blood and tumor of
           maintenance treatment.

        -  To explore the efficacy of maintenance treatment in the molecular subgroups based on
           homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status.
