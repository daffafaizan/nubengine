      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, favorably impacts many processes
      dysregulated during acute illness such as COVID-19, has significant cardio- and
      reno-protective benefits in cardiometabolic disease, and may provide similar organ protection
      in COVID-19.

      The study population will include hospitalized patients with respiratory manifestations of
      COVID-19 of any duration, but without the need for mechanical ventilation. The eligible
      patients should have risk factors for developing serious complications of COVID-19, including
      hypertension, T2DM, ASCVD, HF and/or CKD stage 3 to 4.

      Patients will be treated for 30 days, with either dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo, each
      to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital.

      The study assessments include only those that are absolutely critical for ensuring the safety
      of the patients, to measure efficacy outcomes, and collect biomarker data, so as not to place
      too high a burden on the study personnel and to minimize additional risk of exposure to SARS
      CoV-2.

      The dual primary efficacy endpoints of the study are time to first event of either
      complications or death from any cause, and improved clinical recovery through 30 days of
      follow-up. An extended follow-up period of 60 days (after the 30-day treatment period) is
      included, in order to examine longer-term trajectory of recovery from COVID-19 among trial
      participants.

      The safety data will be monitored by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.
