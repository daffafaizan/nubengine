      hip/knee/ glenohumeral joint will be enrolled according to strict inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All patients are selected and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups based
      on clinical presentation. Subjects will receive a single dose of at least 10 million of
      Wharton Jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJMSC) prepared by the Polish Stem Cell Bank
      every three months for 12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of
      WJMSC in total) via ultrasound guided intra-articular injection. During the study period and
      24 months after last injection they will be followed by clinical assessment, laboratory
      investigations including inflammatory markers and microRNA, as well as magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the injected joint. The investigators will also determine the local and
      systemic safety of the procedure and therapy with WJMSC.
