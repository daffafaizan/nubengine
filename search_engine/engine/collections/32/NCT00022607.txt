        -  Compare the response rate and time to progression in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma treated with bevacizumab with or without thalidomide.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on histological and molecular biomarkers of
           angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and cell death in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma and urine vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast
           growth factor levels and other potential markers of angiogenesis and myeloma cell
           proliferation with outcome in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on the psychological/physical well being of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      treatment with thalidomide (yes vs no).

      Patients who have received no prior treatment with thalidomide are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.
           Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. Patients who have received prior
           treatment with thalidomide receive bevacizumab as in arm I.

      Courses repeat every 56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3-4 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55-103 patients (16-32 who have received prior thalidomide,
      16-32 in arm I, and 23-39 in arm II) will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
