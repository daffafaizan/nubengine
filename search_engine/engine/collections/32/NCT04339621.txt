    
      Patients with AIH who have been undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for 18-24 months will
      be invited for a series of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) scans to assess the utility of LMS for
      monitoring characteristics of the disease.

      This will be a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study recruiting 97 participants
      (20 of which will be treatment na√Øve at recruitment) from those patients scheduled for a
      liver biopsy for therapy cessation review. They will be consented and invited for a
      LiverMultiScan.

      All patients whose treatment is ended based on histology results will be followed up over the
      subsequent 12 months, and those that experience a biochemical relapse or 'flare-up' will be
      invited for a second LiverMultiScan prior to their scheduled liver biopsy.

      All participants will attend their planned outpatient hepatology appointment with their
      doctor, who will document the intended treatment plan for each participant in line with their
      usual care pathway. Their MRI scan will then be scheduled for the same day as their
      outpatient appointment or within a 7-day window after their appointment with the consultant.
