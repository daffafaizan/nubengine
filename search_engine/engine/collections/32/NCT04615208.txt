      dedicated smartphones to record, analyze and classify a person as likely COVID-19 positive or
      negative. The specific objectives are:

        1. Develop an initial simple app to record breathing sounds, check the quality of sounds in
           real time, message and instruct if the sounds fail the quality check.

        2. Recruit and collect breathing sounds of at least up to 200 individuals at one of the
           COVID-19 testing stations in Winnipeg.

        3. Using data of 50 COVID-19 positive cases and 50 negative ones of the above collection as
           the training data, develop a breathing sounds analysis algorithm with high sensitivity
           and specificity for smartphones to classify the recorded breathings sounds as healthy or
           abnormal. Our current database allows for immediate detection of some underlying
           unrelated pathologies, which in the initial stages will be supported by the included
           questionnaire. This can be further enhanced at the end-product stage as each worker's
           history is built up and daily compared.

        4. Develop a smart diagnostic algorithm for smartphones as an app using the above sound
           analysis outcome, the subject's temperature and answers to a few questions and screen
           for possibility of having Covid-19 in less than 30 seconds.

        5. Evaluate the above diagnostic algorithm for the remaining collected data (100 subjects),
           and plan for the next phase of study as a triage in one of the city's hospitals.

        6. Prepare the final market prototype of the technology and disseminate the results.
