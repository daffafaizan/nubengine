        -  To test whether the complete remission (CR) rate (CR and incomplete CR) in adult
           patients with relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is
           sufficiently high after treatment with cytarabine, clofarabine, and epratuzumab to
           warrant further investigation.

        -  To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with the dosing schedule
           of cytarabine, clofarabine, and epratuzumab used in this study.

        -  To investigate, preliminarily, the effect of laboratory correlates (minimal
           post-treatment residual disease) and cytogenetic factors on prognosis in this patient
           population. (Not reported here due to limited MRD data)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days
      2-6, and epratuzumab IV over at least 1 hour on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity*.

      NOTE: * Prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate is required for patients < 22 years of age, and
      is recommended (but not required) for patients â‰¥ 22 years of age.

      Blood samples, bone marrow samples, and/or tumor tissue samples may be collected for further
      laboratory analysis.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years (until 5 years
      after registration).
