      younger and older adult cigarette smokers. Regular cigarette smokers who do not want to quit
      smoking will be asked to complete 3 lab sessions in which they will use an e-cigarette and
      complete questionnaires. This will be followed by a two-week period where participants are
      asked to stop using cigarettes and other tobacco products and to only use the e-cigarettes
      provided. Researchers will examine the influence of flavors (sweet, cool, tobacco) on reward
      (liking/wanting) from e-cigs containing one of two nicotine concentrations (6 mg/ml, 18
      mg/ml) following acute tobacco abstinence.
