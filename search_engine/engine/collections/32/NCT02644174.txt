      that include mechanical, as well as inflammatory factors. We hypothesise that multiple breath
      nitrogen washout will be more sensitive to changes in small airway function than conventional
      lung function testing.

      We will invite adolescents with morbid obesity, scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery at
      SCMCI during 2016-2018, for pulmonary function testing, including spirometry,
      plethysmography, nitrogen multiple breath washout, lung transfer factor and 6 minute walk.
      These tests will be conducted prior to the operation as well as during follow-up appointments
      at 3, 6 and 12 months. We will also evaluate oxidative stress using highly sensitive
      C-reactive protein as surrogate marker.
