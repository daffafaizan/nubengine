      persistent ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this
      drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma
      concentrations and clinical activity or toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the number of prior treatment regimens (1-2 vs
      3 or more). Patients receive irofulven IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 4 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
