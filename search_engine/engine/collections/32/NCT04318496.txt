      fracture, the treatment is relatively limited to oral pain killer and breathing exercise. The
      patients will suffer two weeks of severe pain accompanied with poor sleep and inability to
      preform simple daily live activities. In this double blind randomized control study, the
      investigators offer acupuncture as an additional treatment option.

      of acupuncture on patients with chest trauma. the study will include totally 72 patients and

      groups will receive one treatment, following the first visit to the clinic after chest trauma
      accident. Follow up time will be 3 months.
