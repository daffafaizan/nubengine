           substantial morbidity and mortality.

        -  In recent years, several new therapies have prolonged survival of patients with MM, but
           it is still an incurable malignancy of plasma cells.

        -  B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells and a
           small subset of B cells. This specific expression pattern makes BCMA an ideal target
           antigen for immunotherapies in MM.

        -  BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have exhibited significant
           efficacy in MM, but relapse due to single-target escape or poor in vivo persistence has
           been reported.

        -  Dual-targets or sequential infusion have been proposed to reduce relapse and improve
           outcomes post BCMA-specific CAR T therapies.

        -  CS1 is expressed on pro-B cells and plasma cells especially malignant ones and some
           evidence suggests it plays a role in stromal cell interaction in the BM tumour
           microenvironment.

        -  We have constructed a bispecific CAR containing anti-CS1 single chain variable region
           (scFv) and an anti-BCMA scFv in 4-1BB-containing second-generation formats.

        -  The bispecific CAR T cells have exhibited potent cytotoxicity in various BCMA+ or/and
           CS1+ MM cells and can effectively eradicate MM cells in xenograft mice models.

        -  This study aims to evaluate prelimary safety and efficacy of the CS1&BCMA CAR T cells in
           patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
