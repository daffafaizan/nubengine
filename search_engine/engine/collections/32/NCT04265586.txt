      usually precede and maintain persistent pain. Anxiety and worry frequently precede and
      associate with disturbed sleep and chronic pain. Depression is usually a consequence of
      chronic pain. Pain and depression disturb sleep further. These elements form a vicious circle
      where poor sleep is a critical driver.

      Previous studies have shown that sleep disturbances are a major contributor to the poor
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic pain.
