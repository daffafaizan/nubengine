      significant psychological, social, quality of life, and health related outcomes. Because of
      the broad mental and physical health implications of PO and the difficulty in sustaining
      weight loss as an adult, it is of interest to find successful methods of weight loss and/or
      prevention of weight gain for obese children and adolescents. The family unit is a logical
      and empirically supported point of intervention for PO. Interventions on this level have
      shown good long term efficacy in young children, but there is very little research on
      adolescent family intervention. Within the eating disorder literature, there is growing
      support for the efficacy of family-based interventions (FBI) for adolescents. Given its
      trans-developmental applicability, focus on family as the unit of intervention, and utility
      in creating a healthy eating environment, FBI is a logical candidate for adaptation to
      intervention for PO and intervention for at-risk for overweight youth (FBI-PO). The core of
      the current project is to test the feasibility and efficacy of an adapted FBI manual for
      adolescent overweight and at-risk for overweight in an outpatient eating and weight disorders
      clinic and compare this modality to a minimal nutritional educational control (NEC)
      condition.
