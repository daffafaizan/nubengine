    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of [18F]CTT1057 as a PET imaging agent for detection and localization of PSMA
      positive tumors, using histopathology as SoT. Tissue specimens from both the primary tumor
      and pelvic lymph nodes dissected during surgery from patients with newly-diagnosed high-risk
      PCa will be used for the histopathology assessments.

      All participants will receive [18F]CTT1057 for PET/CT scan imaging, and surgery (radical
      prostatectomy and extended pelvis lymph node dissection) will be performed up to 6 weeks
      after [18F]CTT1057 PET for pathology assessment of the tissue specimens.

      The co-primary endpoints of patient-level sensitivity and region-level specificity will be
      assessed by comparing the central reading results of the [18F]CTT1057 PET scan to the
      histopathology results in the dissected tissue specimens, i.e. both the primary tumor and the
      dissected Pelvic Lymph Node (PLN)).

      Pathology will be assessed by the local pathologists as per Standard of Care (SoC), who will
      be blinded to the PET data.
