      preliminary telephone screening without identifiers. Appropriate candidates will be given
      appointment times and on arrival will undergo the consent process for evaluation. A complete
      medical, social, psychiatric, and drug use history will be obtained. Subjects fulfilling
      general health inclusion requirements will then be offered an appropriate study for which the
      specific consent will be obtained. The evaluation period will be no more than one day with
      all results evaluated within the two following days. Acceptable candidates will then be
      invited to complete the study specific consent.
