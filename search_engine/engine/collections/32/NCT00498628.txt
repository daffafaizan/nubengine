      derivative, as a potential medication for treating alcohol dependence. The immediate release
      form of quetiapine fumarate, SEROQUEL XR®, is approved by the FDA for treatment of
      schizophrenia and acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The extended release
      formulation (SEROQUEL XR®) is also approved by the FDA and is undergoing clinical
      investigation for the treatment of major depressive disorders, schizophrenia, generalized
      anxiety disorder, and alcohol dependence.

      Treatment with other atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine has resulted in
      decreases in alcohol use in alcohol dependent patients with and without comorbid psychiatric
      diagnoses. Quetiapine, like clozapine, appears to have efficacy in reducing drug and alcohol
      use among alcoholics and drug dependent patients with co-morbid psychiatric illness.
