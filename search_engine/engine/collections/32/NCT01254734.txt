      feasibility and safety of TORS (Transoral robotic surgery), including: total operative time,
      blood loss, hospitalization time, need to convert to an open procedure, intra-operative as
      well as post-operative complications. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect data on oncologic
      outcomes, disease free survival, local control rate and overall survival. II. To collect
      normative data regarding objective functional outcomes (FO) which may impact quality of life
      in patients undergoing TORS, including need for adjunctive procedures, such as gastrostomy
      tube placement and tracheostomy placement, and with regards to speech, swallowing function
      and pain, using patient-report outcomes instruments. OUTLINE: Patients undergo transoral
      robotic microsurgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically for 5 years.
