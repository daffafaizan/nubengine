    
      The Multiple Patient Expanded Access Program is designed to provide treatment access to
      olaparib tablets for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial
      response) following platinum-based chemotherapy. The dose of olaparib tablets is 300 mg (two
      150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg
      tablet is available for dose reduction. Treatment may continue until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. The program will collect
      observational data only.
