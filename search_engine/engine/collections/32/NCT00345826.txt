      Primary

        -  Determine the long-term safety and tolerability of dasatinib in patients with
           Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Describe any hematologic or cytogenetic response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients using this
           drug during trial UCLA-0303035.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, roll-over study of protocol UCLA-0303035.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib once or twice daily for 5, 6, or 7 days. Treatment repeats
      every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
