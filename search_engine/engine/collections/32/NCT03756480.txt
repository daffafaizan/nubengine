      (ddPCR) targeted sequencing and responders (n=50) will be compared to non-responders (n=50)
      after controlling confounding factors.

      From a subset of the 100 cases, whole exome sequencing (WES) and Methylation-Specific PCR
      (MSP)-based methylation profiling on microdissected epithelium and stroma will be performed
      in matched eutopic and ectopic tissues from 20 patients with known cancer-associated
      mutations or 20 controls.
