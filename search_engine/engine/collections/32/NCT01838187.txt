      percentage of patients, especially those with high-risk disease features who become resistant
      to conventional therapy. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog
      that concentrates in adrenergic tissue and has been shown to be sensitive and specific for
      detecting localized and metastatic neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma. More
      importantly, experience of many institutions has proven that this agent used as a targeted
      radiotherapeutic has significant anti-tumor activity against refractory neuroblastoma 1-7 as
      well as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, UCSF, and
      the University of Michigan have just completed a large Phase 2 study of 131I-MIBG given in
      doses of 10-18 mCi/kg with stem cell rescue, if necessary, and have shown that this agent is
      safe and effective palliative therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients. In
      addition, there is growing evidence that low-dose (5-10 mCi/kg) submyeloablative MIBG therapy
      is both safe and effective for disease palliation. This protocol therefore provides a
      mechanism to deliver this therapy when clinically indicated.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Provide palliative therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with advanced neuroblastoma,
           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.

        -  Gain more information about acute and late toxicity of 131I-MIBG therapy for patients
           with refractory neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.
