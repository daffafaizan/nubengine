    
      The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network is a National Human Genome
      Research Institute (NHGRI)-funded consortium tasked with developing methods and best
      practices for utilization of the electronic medical record (EMR) as a tool for genomic
      research. Phase III is focused on returning actionable gene variants to patients and
      measuring clinical outcomes. Ultimately, eMERGE hopes its efforts will result in improvements
      in health care, through safer and more effective prescription methodology, augmentation of
      primary and secondary prevention strategies, and enhanced understanding of the biology of
      disease.

      eMERGE is composed of 10 clinical sites [ Childrens Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP);
      Cincinnati Children's Medical Center (CCHMC); Columbia University; Geisinger; Kaiser
      Permanente Washington with Washington University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
      Center; Harvard University; Mayo Clinic; Meharry Medical College; Northwestern University;
      Vanderbilt University Medical center (VUMC)], one non clinical site: Marshfield Clinic, two
      sequencing centers [Baylor college of Medicine; Partners Healthcare with Broad Institute], a
      Coordinating Center (VUMC), and the NHGRI. More information on the eMERGE Network can be
      found at www.gwas.org.

      Each sites' research study is tailored to their specific interests. An eMERGE specific
      sequencing panel was designed and ran on participants covering 109 genes and 1551 Single
      Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), of which 68 genes and 14 SNVs are clinically actionable and are
      being returned to patients.
