      carboplatin/cyclophosphamide with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support in women with
      high-risk stage II/III breast cancer. II. Assess the nonhematologic toxicities associated
      with this combination. III. Assess the progression-free and overall survival of these
      patients following this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients undergo collection of peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization prior to
      high-dose chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients are treated at successively higher dose
      levels of paclitaxel until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. Paclitaxel is given as a
      single 6-hour infusion, followed by fixed doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide for 2 days,
      then carboplatin for 3 days. Four days later, patients receive PBSC and G-CSF for
      hematopoietic reconstitution. Additional patients are entered at the MTD. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, then every 4-6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 24-30 patients will be accrued; a study duration of
      1-1.5 years is anticipated.
