      will not change their usual medical treatment. After 2 clinical visits (screening and
      randomization visit), patients in the intervention group will follow a 15 week rehabilitation
      program consisting of 2 weeks inpatient, 2 weeks outpatient and 11 weeks home based
      rehabilitation. At the end of the outpatient rehabilitation phase (week 4) and the home-based
      program (week 15), clinical outcomes will be reassessed.
