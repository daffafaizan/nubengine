    
      The study will be a randomised controlled non-blinded trial of adult patients with acute
      traumatic brain injury at the Royal London Hospital.

      There will be randomisation to one of two non-blinded trial groups:

        1. Usual standard NHS care (control group)

        2. Usual standard NHS care plus daily oral dose of Souvenaid® ONS

      The trial protocol will commence between 3-7 days after admission. The trial timeline
      provides a summary of intervention and assessments.

      The trial will last 12 months. The first 6 months will be the formal trial with two groups
      and follow up assessments. This will be performed on intention to treat basis. After this
      initial phase the investigators will provide an opportunity for all participants from either
      group (control or treatment) to take Souvenaid® ONS for a further 6 months with a clinical
      follow up appointment.
