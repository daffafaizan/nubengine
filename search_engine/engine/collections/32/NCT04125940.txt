    
      The product known as Resync contains a blend of nitrate-rich foods including beetroot, red
      spinach, turmeric, ginger root, and aronia berry extracts. Resync is sold commercially and
      marketed as an ergogenic aid and/or exercise recovery aid. Manufacturers of Resync recommend
      users take this product 60-90 minutes before an athletic event or 30-90 minutes after
      exercise. Resync bases these claims on prior studies investigating the individual
      ingredients' abilities to increase blood nitrate/nitrite levels; however, there are no
      clinical trials on the finished product itself.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the impact of acute, single ingestion of
      Resync products on blood nitrate/nitrite concentration in a sample of men and women. This
      will be a crossover trial in which participants take all 4 conditions: 1) 7.5g Resync, 2) 15g
      Resync, 3) 20g Resync+collagen, 4) placebo.
