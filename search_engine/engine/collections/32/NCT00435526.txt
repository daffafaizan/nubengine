    
      This is a Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving up to 33 subjects.
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the following three groups.

      Group N Product

        1. 10 BIgG anti-CFA/I

        2. 10 BIgG anti-CfaE

        3. 10 LactoFree® Lipil®

      Volunteers will receive the test article three times daily following meals beginning 2 days
      prior to oral ETEC challenge (strain H10407). Test article will be administered for a total
      of 7 days. Monitoring procedures will assess volunteer safety, the primary endpoint
      (diarrhea), stool microbiology (H10407 excretion), and ETEC-specific immunology. All
      volunteers will receive antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or
      amoxicillin) starting 5 days after ETEC challenge or sooner based on pre-defined clinical
      criteria. Follow-up visits for 2 weeks post-discharge will monitor safety and immunological
      parameters.
