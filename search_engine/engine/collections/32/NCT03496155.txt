      facilitating increased parent-teen communication about teen strengths. However, little
      research focuses on how to address this need in a primary care setting. Content from subject
      matter experts along with data gathered from parents and teens were used to develop a novel
      strengths-based intervention to be tested in primary care.

      The study intervention being examined is called the Strengths Intervention Project and
      includes a written pamphlet, a guided discussion activity, in-person/phone health coaching,
      and in-person or mailed health care provider endorsement and key messaging. Measures will be
      collected at baseline pre-intervention (T1), in clinic or over the phone at the time of the
      intervention (T2), approximately two weeks post-intervention (T3), and approximately 2 months
      post-intervention (T4). Daily diaries will also be utilized twice to gather data pre- and
      post- intervention. We will measure feasibility of clinic implementation of intervention, as
      well as influence of intervention on parent-teen communication and adolescent outcomes.
