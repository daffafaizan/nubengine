      treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with oral estradiol, venlafaxine, or placebo;
      followed by 14 days of drug taper for those on venlafaxine and 14 days of progesterone
      treatment for those on estradiol; followed by 2 weeks with no treatment for all groups; and a
      telephone follow-up post-treatment.
