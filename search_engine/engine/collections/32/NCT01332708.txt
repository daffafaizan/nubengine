      syndrome may be reversible. A reduction in body weight induced by a hypocaloric diet exerts a
      marked reduction in sympathetic activity in obese people with or without metabolic syndrome.
      Incorporation of regular, moderate intensity aerobic exercise training during a dietary
      weight loss program does not confer additional benefits on resting sympathetic neural
      activity, compared with weight loss by diet alone. A new method has been developed to examine
      the sympathetic-parasympathetic status of an individual - the cholinergic status. Cholinergic
      Status represents the total soluble circulation capacity for acetylcholine hydrolysis. Higher
      cholinergic status means the individual is more sympathetic .

      A cross sectional study that took place in Tel Aviv Sorasky medical center and included 632
      participants found that the cholinergic status is related to metabolic syndrome parameters in
      a dose response manner and that it correlates significantly with glucose,HbA1c, lipid profile
      and hs-CRP.
