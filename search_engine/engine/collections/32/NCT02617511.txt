      strategies to ameliorate and reduce the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength is deemed
      important for maintaining functional ability and independence as individual's age. Currently,
      resistance training is considered the standard of care for inducing an anabolic stimulus and
      preserving as well as enhancing muscle mass and strength in aged individuals. One mechanism
      whereby older adults seem to lose muscle mass with age is via chronic low grade inflammation.
      Finding complementary strategies to reduce inflammation, while at the same time building
      skeletal muscle mass and strength, is considered essential for combating the increased
      prevalence of sarcopenia observed as the population ages. Using nutritional supplementation
      strategies, such as omega-3 fatty acids, seems to provide an effect in not only reducing
      inflammation but also acting as an anabolic stimulus for skeletal muscle growth. It is not
      known whether or not providing omega-3 fatty acids (in the form of EPA/DHA supplementation)
      along with resistance training will result in a greater increase in skeletal muscle mass and
      strength than resistance training alone in an older population.

      Hypotheses: The primary hypothesis of this research project is that omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation and resistance training for 12 weeks will decrease markers of inflammation
      more so than resistance training and placebo in a cohort of older adults. A secondary
      hypothesis of the project is that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and resistance training
      for 12 weeks will provide for a greater increase in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and
      functional ability than resistance training and placebo in a cohort of older adults.
