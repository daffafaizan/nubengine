      the development of cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease. To evaluate the prevalence of
      the metabolic syndrome, we will invite all Atahualpa residents aged 40 years or more to
      participate in this study. For the purposes of this study we will obtain the waist
      circumference of all individuals, will measure their blood pressure using a standard
      protocol, and will take a blood sample to determine fasting glucose levels, HDL cholesterol
      levels, triglyceride levels, and plasma insulin levels.
