      self, with the intervention of professionals of the image of the body, such as
      socio-hairdresser, socio-beautician, allows a better socio-professional inclusion, through an
      improvement in body self-esteem. Taking care of yourself will require different approaches
      such as advice on hygiene, becoming aware of your body, experimenting with beauty treatments
      and having the means to reproduce them at home. We will compare our IPS program (Image and
      Presentation of Self), with the usual management in the care center (TAU = "Treatment As
      Usual")
