      Metformin and probiotics have been confirmed to function partly by regulating the gut
      microbiome. The investigators are now wondering if metformin/probiotics treatment will change
      the gut microbiota in healthy subjects and show some benefits.

      In this study, about 60 healthy subjects will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly
      assigned into one of the following three groups: Metformin powder (0.5g tid po), Probiotics
      powder (0.5g tid po), Placebo powder (0.5g tid po), for 12 weeks.

      Blood and stool samples will be collected before and after treatment. Fasting glucose levels,
      fasting insulin levels, serum lipid profiles, inflammation markers and alteration of gut
      microbiota will be evaluated.
