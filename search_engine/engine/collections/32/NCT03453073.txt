    
      BACKGROUND: Three recent meta-analyses found significant prospective inverse associations
      between chocolate intake and cardiovascular disease risk. Evidence from these meta-analyses
      suggests that such inverse associations may only apply to elderly individuals or those with
      preexisting major chronic disease.

      OBJECTIVE: The investigators will assess the association between habitual chocolate intake
      and subsequent incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and the potential effect of
      modification by age.

      DESIGN: The investigators will conduct multivariable Cox regression analyses using data from
      83,310 postmenopausal women free of baseline preexisting major chronic disease in the
      prospective Women's Health Initiative cohort. Chocolate intake was assessed using a food
      frequency questionnaire. Physician adjudicated events or deaths were ascertained up to
      September 30, 2013.
