      contrast agents and to assess the feasibility and accuracy of dual energy techniques in a
      pilot patient study.

      1.1 Formulate algorithms that use dual-energy information to quantitatively measure specific
      material density of colon polyps in physics based simulation.

      1.2 Determine optimal scanning parameters on prototype CT equipment.

      2.1 Measure the material composition density and Hounsfield number of polyps with and without
      simulated contrast enhancement.

      2.2 Measure the accuracy of dual-energy techniques to differentiate between polyps and stool
      and if needed using a combination of simulated intravenous enhanced polyps and contrast
      material tagged stool.

      3.0 Asses the clinical performance of dual-energy CTC for the detection of larger polyps 1 cm
      or larger without cathartic preparation.
