    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR)/residual cancer burden (RCB)-0
      + residual cancer burden (RCB)-I responses in patients with triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), who were non-responders to initial anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy,
      treated with atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) distribution of triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) patients who were non-responders to initial anthracycline and cyclophosphamide
      chemotherapy, treated with atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant
      setting.

      II. To determine the safety of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the
      neoadjuvant setting.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the association between biomarkers in the peripheral blood and tumor tissue
      with efficacy for TNBC patients treated with atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel
      in the neoadjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and
      nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo definitive breast surgery within 6 weeks of the completion of
      treatment.

      ADJUVANT: Within 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.
