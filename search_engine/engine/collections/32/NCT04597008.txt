    
      Specific Aim 1: Compare the proportion of deep surgical site infections (SSI) of the study
      injury within 365 days of definitive fracture fixation surgery in patients allocated to
      receive a combination of local Vancomycin and Tobramycin powders compared to patients
      allocated to local Vancomycin powder.

      Sensitivity Analyses: A series of sensitivity analyses will be conducted to look at
      alternative measures of deep SSI under Specific Aim 1. These sensitivity analyses will
      consider the following alternative end points of deep SSI: infection by gram-negative
      bacteria, infection by gram-positive bacteria, polymicrobial pathogenic infections, culture
      negative infections, and cellulitis/skin infections.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare the safety of treatment with a combination of local Vancomycin and
      Tobramycin versus Vancomycin powder alone as measured by the proportion of antibiotic
      resistance in each arm.
