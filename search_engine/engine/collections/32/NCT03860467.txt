      patients with epileptic seizures in ICUs in an academic tertiary medical care center
      regarding frequency, clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics, treatment,
      course and outcome. This data could help understanding the epidemiology (including risk
      factors, influence of EEG), and to guide management and improve outcomes of affected
      patients.
