      early failure of memory consolidation. It is unknown how propofol affects the
      amygdala-dependent emotional memory system, which modulates consolidation in the hippocampus
      in response to emotional arousal and neurohumoral stress. We present an event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the effects of propofol on the emotional
      memory system in human subjects.

      Methods: Thirty-five healthy subjectswere randomized to receive propofol, at an estimated
      brain concentration of 0.90 Î¼gml-1, or placebo. During drug infusion, emotionally arousing
      and neutral images were presented in a continuous recognition task, while
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation responses were acquired. After a drug-free interval
      of 2 h, subsequent memory for successfully encoded items was assessed. Imaging analysis was
      performed using statistical parametric mapping and behavioural analysis using signal
      detection models.
