    
      As a community engagement approach, Boot Camp Translation (BCT), is a 6-9-month iterative
      process that brings together multiple stakeholders, including patients, parents, and
      community members, to translate evidence-based guidelines and recommendations into locally
      relevant and meaningful messages, materials, and programs.

      Aim 1: Implement BCT in three geographically distinct Colorado communities to translate the
      current evidence for HPV vaccination into locally relevant interventions designed to increase
      vaccine uptake.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the BCT- designed intervention on practice-level HPV
      vaccination initiation rates.

      The long-term goal is to develop a replicable approach and low-cost method of increasing HPV
      vaccine uptake that is easily adaptable to different settings and sociodemographic contexts.
