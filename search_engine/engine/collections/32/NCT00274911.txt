      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) in pediatric
           patients with nonpineal supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall and relapse-free survival of patients treated with HART followed by
           adjuvant combination chemotherapy comprising lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) twice a
           day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks.

        -  Adjuvant combination chemotherapy: Six weeks after the last radiotherapy dose, patients
           receive oral lomustine once and cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on
           days 1, 8, and 15 . Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
