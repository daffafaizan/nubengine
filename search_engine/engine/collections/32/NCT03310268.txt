      parallel group design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the
      two selected test teeth), with a treatment period of 8 weeks. DH will be assessed following
      an acclimatization period of 2-6 weeks at Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks treatment. The
      study will be conducted in healthy participants with pre-existing self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at Screening. A standard fluoride dentifrice with no
      specific anti-sensitivity, anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque activity will be included as the
      negative control. A Chinese marketed positive control dentifrice with sensitivity benefits
      (containing stannous chloride (SnCl2)) will also be included in this study.
