      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, one of such diseases, is characterized by lesions of the
      conducting airways including extension of bronchioles towards the distal lung, or
      bronchiolization of the distal lung. Such lesions are traditionally referred to as "traction
      bronchiectasis" although no evidence supports a cause-and-effect relationship between
      alveolar fibrosis and airway lesions. Another feature of IPF is chronic, invalidating dry
      cough. Our hypothesis is that IPF is characterized by early increases in the volume of
      conducting airways, that such changes correlate with cough, and that airway changes are in
      direct relation with airway fibrosis. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate
      increased anatomical dead space (VD), a surrogate for conducting airway volume, in patients
      with moderate (or early) IPF, in comparison with subjects without any respiratory disease
      ("non-DIP controls"). The secondary aims are : To show that VD is increased in patients with
      IPF in comparison with patients with other DIPs ("DIP controls"), to show that in patients
      with IPF increased VD does not correlate with indices of alveolar fibrosis, and to show
      associations between increased VD and cough and other respiratory symptoms in patients with
      IPF.
