    
      The Nurse Pain Educator arm shall have two phases: a Pre-Teaching Phase and a
      Teaching/Knowledge Maintenance Phase. During the Pre-Teaching Phase, all subjects who are
      enrolled will complete different baseline assessments and will be prescribed an opioid.
      Subjects will then enter the Teaching/Knowledge Maintenance Phase. Subject enrolled into the
      Nurse Pain Educator arm will be educated on different opioid pain management topics with a
      focus on safe and appropriate use and consumption of opioid analgesics. Subjects will meet
      monthly with the Nurse Educator for up to 5 months for reinforcement of their training and to
      assess their use of their medication, their quality of life and their physical and mental
      well-being.

      Subjects who are enrolled into the study arm with no Nurse Pain Educator will be monitored
      every month to assess their use of their medication, their quality of life and their physical
      and mental well-being. No intervention will be conducted with these subjects beyond that of
      standard of care at the facility. Subjects will be evaluated monthly but primary differences
      in outcomes will compare baseline to 6 months.
