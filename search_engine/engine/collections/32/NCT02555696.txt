      the routine use of Abraxane in its labelled indication in metastatic breast cancer.
      Additionally data on real life dosing in daily clinical routine will be analyzed.

      A detailed record of the medical history including co-morbidities and pre-treatment regimens
      will allow analysis of the impact thereof on tolerability, dosage and efficacy.

      This data might also be supportive for further treatment optimization of Abraxane in
      Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC).
