    
      The SureCALL® EMG Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®) is a transabdominal electromyography monitor
      intended to measure intrapartum uterine activity. It is intended for use on term pregnant
      women who are in labor, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal
      abdomen. The device is intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.

      This measurement study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® to the predicate
      Tocodynamometer device (TOCO) using the performance of an Intrauterine Pressure Catheter
      device (IUPC) as the "gold standard".

      This study involved 20 women at term, in labor, at three clinical sites. Each study subject
      was instrumented with three technologies for measuring uterine activity:

        1. a tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen

        2. a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography, and

        3. an intrauterine pressure catheter.

      Using IUPC as the "gold standard", this study methodology allowed a three way comparison for
      evaluating how well the SureCALL® system performed compared to the TOCO technology.
