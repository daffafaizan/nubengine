      metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after prior standard treatments.
      Progression-free survival data suggest that there could be a distinct subgroup of patients
      that may benefit from regorafenib. Therefore, it would be important to identify predictive
      biomarker of efficacy of regorafenib. Considering that regorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, comprehensive approach is required to discover predictive biomarker.

      NGS-based sequencing allows generating large amount of data regarding multiple genes and
      multiple genetic alterations within a single experiment. Also, it requires less amount of DNA
      or tissue and cost compared to currently used individual gene testing techniques such as
      direct sequencing or FISH. Moreover, superior sensitivity over Sanger sequencing can be
      obtained by increasing coverage depth, especially in cases with low tumor purity. Wide range
      of genes targeted by regorafenib and genes in the major oncogenic pathway of colorectal
      cancer influenced by regorafenib can be efficiently assessed using NGS-based sequencing.

      The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafeinib in
      metastatic, refractory colorectal cancer patients using NGS technology.
