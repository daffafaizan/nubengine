      disappointing, with short survival times due to infection complications. However, complete
      response has been documented after radiation in some patients. High-dose MTX will be used to
      improve the possibility of a greater antineoplastic response than that obtained by radiation
      alone. Since the underlying immunodeficiency state is not affected by therapy directed
      against the lymphoma, patients are still prone to life-threatening opportunistic infections
      or relapse of lymphomatous disease within the CNS. Accordingly, AZT will also be used in an
      attempt to alter the overall natural history of the disease.

      Radiation begins on day 1 of therapy. Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or by
      intravenous injection (IV) on days 1-10. MTX IV over 6 hours weekly for a total of 4 doses
      starts 1 week after completion of the cranial radiation. Leucovorin (LCV) IV or PO begins 6
      hours after MTX has been completed over 6 hours for 8 doses. AZT while awake starts on day 1
      of therapy and continues for 52 weeks. Patients are reevaluated with computerized tomography
      (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain at conclusion of radiation therapy
      and systemic treatment, 6 and 10 weeks respectively. If there is a complete or partial
      response (CR or PR), patient will remain on study and continue to receive AZT; if stable
      disease or no response, patient will be taken off study. Reevaluation at 16 weeks from start
      of study will be done. If CR or PR, the patient will continue AZT for 1 year. If there is no
      change or progression of disease, or if the patient develops evidence of systemic
      lymphomatous disease, patient will be taken off study.
