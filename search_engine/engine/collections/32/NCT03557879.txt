      affected members of a family. Filtering of variants will be performed based on frequency. For
      each trio, data will be analysed in parallel to follow segregation of the variant(s) in
      candidate genes. The selected candidate genes will be further characterized in order to
      ascertain their involvement in hearing function.

      Finally, once these new genes are well defined as "deafness genes" , their screening will be
      added to existing diagnostic panels.
