      proven multivessel coronary artery disease. All patients will undergo a combined CT coronary
      angiogram (CTCA) and PET scan using 18F-NaF as a tracer. Patients will then have clinical
      follow-up before undergoing a repeat CTCA at 2 years to assess progression of coronary
      disease. Clinical review of all patients will continue until study completion (given 2 years
      of recruitment this is likely to last 4 years) and following this the investigators will
      continue to monitor for further cardiovascular events via review of patient electronic health
      records for a further 5 years.
