      of AML is associated with a nearly universal risk of febrile neutropenia. Standard supportive
      care strategies include administration of prophylactic anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents,
      but serious breakthrough bacterial and fungal infections still occur. Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim, NeupogenÂ®) has been shown to shorten the
      duration of severe neutropenia, fever, antibiotic use and hospitalization following induction
      chemotherapy for AML. CLT-008, a human allogeneic myeloid progenitor cell product, is
      intended to provide the cellular target for G-CSF to produce neutrophils during the period of
      chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression when the patient's own progenitor cells may be
      limited in responding to G-CSF. It is hypothesized that the production of allogeneic
      neutrophils from CLT-008 will be sufficient to mitigate the infection-related consequences of
      induction chemotherapy for AML.
