      painful stimuli in regulating speed of recovery after surgery and for LC responsivity as a
      mechanistic link explaining the risks for slow recovery from weak Conditioned Pain Modulation
      (CPM), catastrophizing cognitive style, and low enzyme activity
      catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype. Preliminary data show feasibility to
      perform the proposed study.

      Primary Hypothesis: An observational study of pupil responses to noxious stimuli shows strong
      intra-individual reliability over 8 weeks.

      Key secondary hypotheses: Compared to individuals homozygous for val at the val158met site of
      the catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, those homozygous for met will show smaller
      pupil responses to noxious stimuli and weaker CPM.
