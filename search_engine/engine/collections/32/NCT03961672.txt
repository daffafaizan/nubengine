    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of duvelisib (induction followed by maintenance [intermittent
      dosing]) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as
      measured by the progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety of duvelisib induction and maintenance (by intermittent dosing) in
      relapsed/refractory CLL.

      II. To evaluate clinical benefits to duvelisib treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate T-cell populations in patients with CLL treated with duvelisib.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive duvelisib PO BID on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16, and 22-23. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
