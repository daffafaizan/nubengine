      rapidly spread worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a
      pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The clinical disease (COVID-19) results in critical illness in
      about 5% of patients with predominant acute respiratory failure.

      The goal of the study is the evaluation of the respiratory mechanics (peak inspiratory
      pressure (PIP), plateau pressure (Pplat), static compliance (Cstat), driving pressure (DP) at
      different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and different tidal volumes (Vt)
      (6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight), lung recruitability (by change of DP and oxygenation) and gas
      exchange (PaO2/FiO2 ratio and alveolar dead space) in COVID-19 -associated acute respiratory
      failure during the whole course of mechanical ventilation - invasive or non-invasive for
      selection of safe and effective PEEP level, Vt, respiratory rate (RR) and inspiratory oxygen
      fraction (FiO2) during the whole course of mechanical ventilation - invasive or non-invasive.

      This study is multicentral observational trial in 3 University clinics.
