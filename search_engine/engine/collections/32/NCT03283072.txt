      been established. We will use a commercially-available hypoxicator that can be programmed to
      achieve a targeted level of arterial oxygen saturation. We plan to compare 3 previously
      published protocols that have generated motor facilitation (and a sham condition) to
      characterize and effects on sensory function in healthy adults.
