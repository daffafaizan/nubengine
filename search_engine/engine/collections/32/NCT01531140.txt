      bisacodyl (Bisacodyl VP, ICN Polfa, Rzeszow, Poland), polyethylene glycol (Fortrans, Beaufour
      Ipsen Industry, Dreux, France) and/or sennoside (Xenna Extra, US Pharmacia, Wroclaw, Poland)
      and had disorders that make oral intake of the preparation impossible (neurological
      disorders, intestinal obstruction, mental retardation etc.).

      Study design:

      On admission day patients are allocated to one of the groups by study investigators,
      according to the randomization list created by an independent person using block
      randomization by a standard statistical program StatsDirect [version 2,3,8 (2005)] (6
      patients were included in each block).

      During the preparation for colonoscopy each patient are observed for procedure tolerance. On
      the day of endoscopy, each patient evaluated the degree of the acceptance of the method of
      bowel cleaning (according to visual analog scale (VAS) and the occurrence of side effects
      (diary). The endoscopist performing colonoscopy, blinded for the bowel preparation regimen
      evaluate bowel cleansing and score it, according to the Aronchick and Ottawa scale. The rate
      of cecum intubation, and the colonoscopy complications (defined as bowel perforation and/or
      significant bleeding) are analyzed in each bowel preparation group.
