      these, there are 350 patients with surgeon defined intercostobrachial nerve resection during
      the operation. Part of the patients have pain, part of them are pain free. In addition the
      investigators plan to enroll 50 patients with pain, but no nerve resection during operation.

      The patients come for a clinical research visit. Beforehand they fill in questionnaires of
      medical history, pain, mood, temperament, quality of life, and sleeping. After informed
      consent the patients give a blood sample with prior 12 hour fasting. The investigators
      present a detailed sensory testing with body maps and patient pain drawings. The
      investigators perform a cold water test with autonomic nervous system monitoring and conduct
      a set of cognitive tests, part of them computer based. A selected group of patients undergo
      QST.
