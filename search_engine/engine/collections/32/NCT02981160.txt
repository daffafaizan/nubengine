      sensor cartridge and a flow meter to determine the rate of consumed oxygen and produced
      carbon dioxide in the breath. The sensing technology of the new indirect calorimeter, which
      used a cell-phone camera as the optical detector. The current Breezing® device uses a code to
      carry calibration parameters of a single-use sensor cartridge, which can be scanned and
      recognized by the mobile application (app). The device is 6.0 oz. (170 g), and 1.8 in × 2.1
      in × 4.8 in (4.7 cm × 5.4 cm × 12.3 cm), and connects wirelessly to an iOS mobile device,
      using Bluetooth 4.0 technology.

      The mobile device (phone or tablet) receives data from the device, processes information, and
      then provides test results and summaries through a graphic user interface. It determines the
      energy expenditure from the measurement of VO2 and VCO2 according to the Weir equation, along
      with RQ. In addition to the sensor cartridge, the Breezing® device is used with a
      non-rebreathing 2-valvesmouthpiece.

      This new device will provide a more precise information regarding metabolic rate in our
      Bariatric Patients to better tailor their preoperative diet and monitor their weight loss.

      Up to date, this device was never used or validated before in the Bariatric population under
      this setting.
