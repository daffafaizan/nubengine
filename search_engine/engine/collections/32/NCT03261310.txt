      (Tylenol) for post operative pain control in patients undergoing craniotomies (brain surgery)
      and spine surgery. Studies have shown that intravenous acetaminophen is useful for post
      operative pain control in some operations but there have not been studies to evaluate the use
      of acetaminophen in craniotomies or spine surgery.
