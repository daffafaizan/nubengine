    
      The pre-myeloid cancer and bone marrow failure clinic is an individualized medicine clinic
      conceptualized for the early detection of myeloid malignancies such as, myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML). Using next-generation sequencing technologies, clonal hematopoietic
      stem cell changes can be detected early on in myeloid malignancies. These changes are
      currently classified as follows:

        1. Idiopathic cytopenias of unclear significance (ICUS).

        2. Clonal cytopenias of unclear significance (CCUS).

        3. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate prognosis (CHIP).

        4. Bone marrow failure syndromes with risk for clonal myeloid transformation.

        5. Familial/Germline syndromes with increased risk for myeloid malignancies.

      This clinic blends next-generation sequencing technologies with functional studies to help
      identify, prognosticate and define management plans; including early intervention strategies,
      for affected patients.
