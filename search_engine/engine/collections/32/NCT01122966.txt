      glaucomatous patients. It reduces IOP by creating a fistula between the anterior chamber and
      the subconjunctival space with a filtering bleb. Increased wound healing response affects the
      function and morphology of the filtering bleb, and wound healing involves a series of
      biological events beginning with hemostasis.

      Corticosteroids and antifibrosis agents such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil have been
      employed in trabeculectomy to delay wound healing and hence to improve the success rate of
      surgery by inhibiting inflammation and fibroblastic activity, and the use of these
      antiscarring agents is generally believed to improve the success rate of trabeculectomy.But
      this rate decreased with passing time and thus was not perfect.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor is a pivotal stimulator of angiogenesis because its
      binding to VEGF receptors has been demonstrated to promote endothelial cell migration and
      proliferation in wound healing.Therefore, anti-VEGF agents may potentially modulate wound
      healing following glaucoma filtration surgery.

      The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the additive effect of intracameral and
      subconjunctival injections of bevacizumab in trabeculectomy.
