    
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230, also known as
      Pasireotide long-acting release (LAR), in addition to standard therapy of FOLFIRI (5FU,
      leucovorin, and irrinotecan) can shrink or slow the growth of gastrointestinal malignancies.
      The safety of this drug in combination with standard chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) will also be
      studied. The participant's physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory
      findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Pasireotide LAR is safe and effective.
