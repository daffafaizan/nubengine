    
      Aim Our primary aim is to investigate whether muscularity assessed via bedside ultrasound is
      correlated with a reference method for estimating whole body skeletal muscle mass (CT image
      analysis) in the first few days of critical illness.

      Our secondary aims are

        -  To investigate whether muscularity assessed via other bedside methods (bioimpedance
           spectroscopy, subjective physical assessment and mid arm muscle circumference) are
           correlated with a reference method for estimating whole body skeletal muscle mass (CT
           image analysis) in critically ill patients.

        -  To better understand the association between measured resting energy expenditure and
           muscularity in the critically ill.

        -  To observe changes in skeletal muscle mass (in a sub set of patients who have two CT
           scans) and the impact various factors, including energy and protein delivery has on
           these changes.
