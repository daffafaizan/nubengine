      opted to continue treatment in the extension study underwent screening assessments to
      determine study eligibility. Eligible participants initiated treatment in the extension study
      at least 4 weeks after their last dose of sebelipase alfa in Study LAL-CL01. This extension
      study consisted of a treatment period of up to 5 years, and a follow-up period of
      approximately 30 days after the last dose of sebelipase alfa.

      Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is the late onset phenotype for LAL deficiency, a
      lysosomal storage disorder, which also has an early onset phenotype that primarily affects
      infants. CESD can present in childhood but often goes unrecognized until adulthood when the
      underlying pathology is advanced. Many of the signs and symptoms are common to patients with
      other liver conditions.

      CESD is an autosomal recessive genetic condition and is characterized by hepatomegaly,
      persistently abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and type II hyperlipidemia. Splenomegaly
      and evidence of mild hypersplenism may affect some patients. Untreated, CESD may lead to
      fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and death.
