      intake is needed in order to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above deficiency and
      insufficiency cut-offs (30 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L, respectively) in 4-8 year-old Danish
      children during the winter time. The children will be randomized to receive tablets with
      either 10 micrograms/day or 20 microgram/day of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), corresponding
      to one and two times the recommended daily intake in children, or placebo for 20 weeks.
      Measurements and blood sampling will be performed before the beginning and by the end of the
      intervention.
