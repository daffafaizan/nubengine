      translational research. The relevance of "translational oncology" will only increase in the
      future -"From bench to bedside" - the swift implementation of new science research results in
      clinical studies in order to expedite progress in clinical cancer therapy for the benefit of
      the patient.

      Its almost a matter of course in the medical science today to collect biological samples
      together with clinical information thereby creating the foundation for future excellent
      fundamental research.

      The aim of this tumor bank is to consist of biological samples (together with a blood bank -
      see NCT01763125) and isolates of tumor patients and healthy people as controls. The
      biological samples, the clinical date together with prospective experimental date constitute
      the entity of the tumor bank. The content of the tumor bank can provide essential material
      for current and future research (e.g. analyses of prognostic or predictive tumor markers;
      genetically analysis (polymorphism, mutation, hypermethylation; verification and
      characterisation of disseminated tumor cells).
