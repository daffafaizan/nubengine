      an abundance of evidence of harm. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) issued the "CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain" to encourage safe
      and effective alternatives to opioids, discontinuation of opioids when patients do not resume
      normal activities and prudent dosing strategies. However, poor guideline adherence is a
      general concern and may impede uptake. Our prior studies have used insights from behavioral
      economics and social psychology to increase guideline adherence. The objective of the R21
      pilot phase of the Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opioid Prescribing
      Safety (AESOPS) is to develop and test the following novel behavioral nudges to encourage
      adherence to pain and CDC guidelines for opioid prescribing for persons with noncancer pain:
      1) Accountable Justification alert will have clinicians enter a brief statement justifying
      their opioid prescription for new orders or refills. The note will then be added to the
      patient's medical record, 2) The Active Choice (SmartSet) alert will encourage clinicians to
      engage in a taper discussion with the patient and either begin a taper or justify a reason
      for continuing medication, 3) Audit and Feedback will provide clinicians with aggregate data
      on their performance relative to top-performing peers on CDC measures of interest. This
      information will be reported back to the clinician by mail, email or within the electronic
      health record. Peer comparison encourages clinician to follow the lead of top performers, as
      we often follow the lead of others similar to ourselves.
