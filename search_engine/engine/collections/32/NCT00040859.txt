      Primary

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of
           the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia treated with oxaliplatin and
           capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses after CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 weeks (prior to each course of
      chemotherapy).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
