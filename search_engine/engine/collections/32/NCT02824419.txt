      available to diagnose sarcoidosis. FDG-PET imaging is in use, however, FDG is not a specific
      tracer for sarcoidosis and other inflammatory diseases may interfere with the imaging
      findings. The aim of the current protocol is to evaluate the potential of other inflammatory
      PET-tracers in the detection of sarcoidotic lesions.

      The patients with active sarcoidotic lesions in lungs will be recruited. First, the patient
      undergoes PET-FDG scan and then the patient undergoes the PET scan either with C11-methionine
      or 68Ga-DOTANOC. The results with the latter tracers will be compared to the imaging results
      with FDG.
