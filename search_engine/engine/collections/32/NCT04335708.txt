    
      A double blind randomized controlled clinical study of an 30-d intervention with 16 nursing
      mothers was carried out to evaluate the effect of the consumption of the intracellular
      content of Lactobacillus casei CRL-431 on the antioxidant capacity of breast milk. Once
      obtained the informed consent; volunteers were ramdomized into two groups (n=8) to either
      receive 5 mL daily: edible gel with intracellular content of Lb. casei CRL-431 (intervention
      group) or edible gel without intracellular content of Lb. casei CRL-431 as control (placebo).
      Both gels were consumed daily. Participants were asked not to change their diet or lifestyle
      during the intervention. We applied intention to treat for those participants who did not
      have good adherence and those who withdraw the study. The outcomes between groups were
      analyzed using a independent samples student t-test, with P value of 0.05 or less (two sided)
      when there was a statistical differences. Non-parametric data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney
      test; using statistical software.
