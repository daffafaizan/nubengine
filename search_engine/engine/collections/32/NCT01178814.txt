      patients, but given the early experience which showed a better response in del(5q) patients
      and those with lower risk disease, more patients belonging to this category were entered on
      the trial. The subsequent multi-center studies were focused entirely on the low/Int-1
      patients who were transfusion dependent. In the present study, we would like to recapitulate
      the initial study by only treating the transfusion dependent, low and intermediate-1 risk MDS
      patients without deletion (5q). Since the predictive assay is most applicable for the
      non-del(5q) patients, and to avoid confusion resulting from an admixture of patients with
      del(5q) for whom the drug is already FDA approved, we have elected to restrict this clinical
      trial to only the non-del(5q) patients.

      In the present study, only the non-del(5q) transfusion dependent, low and intermediate-1 risk
      MDS patients will be treated with single agent Revlimid®. All patients will have their
      pre-therapy bone marrows studied by gene expression microarray, Luminex bead assay, and
      real-time PCR.
