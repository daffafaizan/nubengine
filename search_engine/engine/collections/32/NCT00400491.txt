      IU per week will result in improved metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      We will include 70 patients with type 2 diabetes. They will be treated with 40.000 IU
      cholecalciferol per week (or placebo) for 6 months. Metabolic control will be evaluated with
      measurements of glycated hemoglobin, home glucose measurements, and fasting blod glucose and
      serum insulin. Only subjects using insulin at bedtime combined with metformin during the day
      will be included.
