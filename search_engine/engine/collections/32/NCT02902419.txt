    
      A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 602 patients to study the effect of
      timing of wound dressing removal on the surgical site infection rate. 300 patients were
      randomized to a group that had the wound dressing removed between 12-30 hours
      postoperatively. 302 patients were randomized to a group that had the wound dressing removal
      between 30-48 hours postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the
      timing of dressing removal had statistical significance on the surgical site infection rate,
      the primary outcome.
