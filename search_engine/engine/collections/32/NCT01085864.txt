    
      The Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Lung Nodules Study is a prospective study of a cohort of 500
      individuals with lung nodules of indeterminate etiology that are identified by CT scans.
      Either biopsy or repeat CT scans must be clinically indicated to determine the etiology of
      the nodule. Patients will be asked to allow investigators access to CT scan images and
      spirometry data, and provide blood, sputum, urine, and exhaled breath samples over the course
      of the study. Patients will also be asked to allow investigators to access pathology records
      if a biopsy or surgical excision of the nodule is clinically indicated.
