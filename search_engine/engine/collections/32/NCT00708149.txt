      patients, there is still lack of consensus about its prophylaxis. There is also few data
      available from Taiwan. H2 blockers are commonly used due to convenience. Some prefer
      sucralfate (a mucosal protective agent) for the sake of less associated nosocomial pneumonia.
      Recently, proton pump inhibitors were shown to have good prophylactic effects for stress
      ulcer. Lansoprazole has good acid suppression effect and the tablets are soluble for the use
      of tube feeding. There was no data about the prophylaxis of stress ulcer development during
      the program of weaning from the mechanical ventilators. Therefore, we conduct a study of the
      comparison of lansoprazole administered nasogastrically and control group for stress ulcer
      prophylaxis in respiratory intensive care unit.
