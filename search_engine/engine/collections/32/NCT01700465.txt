    
      1. Collect physiological waveform data from patients undergoing hemodialysis at the
           University of Colorado Hospital, Children's Hospital Colorado, and Fresenius Medical
           Centers using non-invasive monitoring techniques.

        2. Combine the physiological data from patient monitors with clinical and demographic data,
           including age, gender, race, problem list, reason for dialysis, estimated dry weight,
           volume removed, arterial and venous pressures, etc. for use in developing mathematical
           models of hemodialysis.

        3. Develop robust, real-time, computational models for:

             -  estimating acute intravascular volume loss during hemodialysis

             -  predicting an optimal, individual specific, intravascular volume to be removed
                during a hemodialysis session

             -  predicting intradialytic hypotension

        4. Determine:

             -  which non-invasive signals are relevant to each model type

             -  which features extracted from these signals are relevant

             -  which algorithms are capable of using the extracted features for each decision type
