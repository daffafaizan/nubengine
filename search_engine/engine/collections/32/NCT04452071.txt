      simple, quick and easy method, through taking a gingival crevicular fluid alkaline
      phosphatase sample and measuring its concentration. Comparing the concentration of GCF ALP to
      the standardized middle phalanax of the middle finger MP3 we can predict if it can be an
      accurate and reliable method as skeletal growth indicator.
