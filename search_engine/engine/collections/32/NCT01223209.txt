    
      This clinical study has two main aims which are:

        -  To measure the immunological effects of LTX-315 in combination with GV1001

        -  Find out about the side effects of the combination of the two drugs This is an open
           label, single centre study assessing immunological effects and safety of LTX-315 given
           as an adjunct to GV1001. The LTX-315 dose will escalate while the GV1001 dose will be
           fixed.

      LTX-315 and GV1001 will be given as intradermal injections on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36.

      Investigational treatment: LTX-315 (0.10 mL) with escalating concentrations will be injected
      intradermally, followed, 1-2 hours later, by intradermal injection of 0.56 mg GV1001 (0.20
      mL, 2.8 mg/mL) in the same site, in one arm.

      DTH-test control: 0.10 mg GV1001 (0.10 mL) will be injected intradermally in the
      contralateral arm without LTX-315, as a DTH skin reactivity test control.
