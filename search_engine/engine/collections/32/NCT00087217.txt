      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) when administered with paclitaxel in
      patients with metastatic or unresectable solid malignancy.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine tumor
      response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Patients receive 17-AAG IV over 1 hour on
      days 1*, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *17-AAG is not administered on day 1 of course 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 6-12 patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.
