        1. To determine whether Miglustat can restore the function of the CFTR protein in adult
           patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation

        2. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Miglustat in adult patients
           with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.

        3. To investigate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic of Miglustat in adult patients with
           cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.
