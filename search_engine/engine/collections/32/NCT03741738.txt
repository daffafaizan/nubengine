      with vitiligo always have emotional impairment. In addition, the incidence of recurrence is
      high, and the recurrence rate is reported up to 40% within one year after the discontinuation
      of treatment. Therefore, development of a marker for monitoring the disease activity is very
      important and desperately needed.

      HMGB1 is a protein located in the nucleus, such as histone, and binds to genes and
      transcription factors to stabilize and control the DNA transcription. However, when released
      from the cells, it acts as a danger signal and is thought to cause autoimmune diseases such
      as inflammatory diseases and lupus. The present study demonstrated through ex vivo tissue
      culture that HMGB1 can induce melanocyte apoptosis by inducing apoptosis and also observed
      that serum concentration of HMGB1 was higher in vitiligo patients than in normal controls .
      The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of HMGB1 as a biomarker for predicting
      the severity of disease and to confirm the association between HMGB1 levels and vitiligo
      activity.
