      Translational Research Center. During each visit, testing will include measuring the amount
      of whole body fat and fat in the stomach area, muscle, and liver; levels of cortisol in the
      blood, urine, and fat tissue (taken from a biopsy); how well insulin works (insulin
      sensitivity).
