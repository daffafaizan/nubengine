    
      Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG), and inhibin A, are biochemical markers that are part of the first and
      second trimester screening test, for Down syndrome and neural tube defects in pregnancy.
      These biochemical markers have been shown also to be associated with slightly increased risk
      for adverse pregnancy outcomes in the absence of aneuploidy or neural tube defects, for
      example; preeclampsia, low birth weight, placental abruption, preterm labor, and intrauterine
      fetal death.

      There are no guidelines regarding the management of these cases assuming a reassuring
      maternal and fetal status are normal, at term (38 - 39 weeks). However, adverse events may
      still develop between 38 to 42 weeks when calculated according to ongoing pregnancy.

      Investigators aim in this randomized trial to examine the effect of induction of labor at 38
      - 39 weeks compared to expectant management among women with abnormal first or second
      biochemical screening tests on maternal and perinatal outcomes.

      Enrollment: 320 women in both groups. Interim analyses will be performed after enrolling 50%
      of the participants.
