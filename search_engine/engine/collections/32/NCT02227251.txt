    
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 2b study of the SINE compound, selinexor. A fixed 60
      mg dose of selinexor is given orally to patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who have no
      therapeutic options of demonstrated clinical benefit. One hundred thirty patients with
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL who meet eligibility criteria and have none of the exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled to receive selinexor until either disease progression or
      intolerance has occurred. Patients will be followed until disease progression and/or death.
