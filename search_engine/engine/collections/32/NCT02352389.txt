    
      Participants will have nasal, oral and stool specimens obtained at the time they are
      diagnosed with influenza infections, and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days later. The genome of influenza
      viruses that are isolated from these participants will be sequenced and compared to one
      another and to standard influenza strains.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To determine the proportion of pediatric oncology patients with nasal and oropharyngeal
           shedding of influenza viruses at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days following the diagnosis of
           infection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the proportion of gastrointestinal shedding of human influenza viruses.

        -  To determine the frequency and pattern of mutations in influenza viruses isolated from
           pediatric oncology patients.

        -  To explore the biological consequences of mutations in influenza viruses isolated from
           pediatric oncology patients.
