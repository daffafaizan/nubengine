    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel group, pilot study
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of as-needed with nasal, non-inhaled administration of
      CO2 (nasal CO2) in patients with SAR. Approximately 50 patients who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled into this study at up to 4 sites to ensure that approximately 30
      patients complete the study.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups and be provided with either an
      active or placebo dispenser.

      All patients will administer study drug for 10 seconds to each nostril once on Day 0 in the
      clinic then as-needed up to 6 times a day during waking hours (doses must be at least 2 hours
      apart) for 14 days. Patients will assess their nasal and non-nasal symptoms in a patient
      diary. Each patient's participation in the study may last up to 72 days.

      There will be a total of 5 scheduled clinic visits:

        -  Visit 1 Screening

        -  Visit 2 Enrollment (within 42 days of Visit 1)

        -  Visit 3 Randomization (after the completion of a 3-7 day run-in period)

        -  Visit 4 Mid-Treatment (Day 7 ± 1 day)

        -  Visit 5 End of Treatment (within 1-3 days of last study drug administration)

      Sites will follow-up with randomized patients via telephone 7 ± 1 days after the last study
      drug administration.
