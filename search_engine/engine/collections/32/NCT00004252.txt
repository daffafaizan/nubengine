      treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with or without SU5416. II. Compare the time
      to progression, duration of response, and objective response in these patients on these two
      regimens. III. Compare the percentage 6 month, 9 month, and one year survival of these
      patients on these two regimens. IV. Compare the time to treatment failure in these patients
      on these two regimens. V. Determine the health related quality of life of these patients on
      these two regimens. VI. Compare the palliative and biologic effects of SU5416 in these
      patients. VII. Determine the safety and tolerability of fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium
      plus SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to performance status (ECOG 0 vs 1), site of primary disease (colon vs rectum),
      measurable or evaluable disease, and prior fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy (none vs at
      least 1 dose). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV bolus 1 hour into leucovorin calcium
      administration weekly for 6 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours and fluorouracil IV bolus 1 hour into leucovorin calcium administration weekly for 6
      weeks, plus SU5416 twice weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to study,
      at weeks 4 and 8 of each course, and then post study. Patients are followed post study at one
      month and then every 2 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 710 patients (355 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
