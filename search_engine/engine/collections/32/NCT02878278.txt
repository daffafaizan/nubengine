      clinical trial, which showed that the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide could last for 72
      hours after administration. However, daily administration of Chidamide may create a more
      steady Chidamide concentration, thus improve the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide, so it's
      necessary to compare the two different ways of administration.

      Current study showed that Romidepsin, a HDACI, could activate EBV during the treatment of
      NKTCL, whether Chidamide, as a novel HDACI, could activate EBV is still not clear, so this
      problem is worth to be accessed.
