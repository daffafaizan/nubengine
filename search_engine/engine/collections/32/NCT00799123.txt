      of life. The samples were spun and the platelet-free urine was stored at -80Â°C until
      NT-proBNP analysis. The NT-proBNP assay was performed with an automated immunoassay (Roche
      Diagnostics). Color Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography was determined at the same
      time as the urine collection. New echo parameters such as IVRT, tissue velocity, strain and
      strain rate were measured and compared with the standard parameters for significant ductus
      arteriosus. Furthermore we compared the tissue Doppler measurements with clinical findings.
