      with T3 and T4 larynx or hypopharynx carcinoma that would be treated with total laryngectomy.
      The aim of the study is to compare the standard regimen (Cisplatin + 5FU) versus the TPF
      regimen (Taxotere + Cisplatin + 5FU). Responders to the induction treatment are treated with
      radiation with a purpose of larynx preservation. Non responders patients will be treated with
      total laryngectomy followed by postoperative radiation.
