    
      This trial investigates the feasibility and treatment efficacy when combining durvalumab
      treatment with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated thoracic
      radiotherapy (HYPO-group) in previously untreated NSCLC stage III patients prone to
      radiotherapy only.

      A safety lead-in phase with stop-and-go design will precede full enrollment into the
      HYPO-group.

      Tumor tissue as well as blood and stool samples will be collected for future biomarker
      analysis.

      It is hypothesized that TRT combined with concurrent durvalumab administration in patients
      with unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are not amenable to sequential radio-/chemotherapy

        1. is safe and feasible,

        2. will improve treatment efficacy by a synergistic effect of checkpoint inhibition and the
           photon-induction of immunostimulatory pathways.

        3. will have an effect on the immunological characteristics of the tumor, the
           microenvironment, and the systemic immune response, such as upregulation of PD-L1 or
           secretion of stimulatory cytokines and recruitment and priming of immunocompetent cells,
           which might then mediate the "abscopal effect" beyond the irradiated targets.
