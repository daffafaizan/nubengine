    
      DETAILED OUTLINE: This is an early phase pilot/feasibility trial.

      Study subjects will be sequentially accrued to three cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 will evaluate
      the safety and feasibility of infusing two different doses of CTL.

        -  Participants in all cohorts will undergo two CTL infusions 5 weeks apart.

        -  Procedures performed during the trial will include physical examinations, laboratory
           tests, delayed hypersensitivity testing, and skin biopsies.

        -  Between 5 and 8 days after the first CTL infusion, a biopsy or excision of a melanoma
           lesion may be performed.

        -  Three leukapheresis procedures will be performed: two to collect peripheral blood for
           CTL production and one for research purposes at the end of the clinical trial.

        -  Radiology tests (including CT scans) will be performed prior to infusion and about 4-5
           weeks after the second CTL infusion.
