    
      This is a randomized controlled experimental study designed to examine the effect of white
      noise and swaddling methods in reducing the pain caused by orogastric tube insertion in
      preterm infants.

      The study will be conducted between 01/01/2021-15/06/2021 in Usak Öztan Hospital Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit.

      The sample of the study is planned to have 132 participants with 33 of them in each of the 4
      groups.

      This study is planned to be conducted with 4 groups, consisting of 3 experimental groups and
      1 control group. White noise, swaddling method, and white noise + swaddling methods will be
      the interventions during the study together with the standard care and procedures for the
      experimental groups, while the control group will only have standard care and procedures
      during the study.

      The interventions that will be used in this study are emphasized in the literature as
      nonpharmacological methods in reducing and preventing pain.

      In Usak Öztan Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, where the study is planned to be
      conducted, a pre-application will be performed with 10 preterm infants to evaluate the effect
      of white noise, swaddling, white noise, and swaddling methods on pain perception in preterm
      infants with an orogastric tube inserted.

      As the video recordings will be used for the evaluation of the pain, the best area for the
      video recorder to be placed will be decided during this stage.

      Insertion of the orogastric tube will be done by the same nurse, who will be briefed about
      the study concept and will be blinded to the control and the intervention groups, to manage
      standardization. There will be always a specialist doctor to monitor the infants during this
      stage for any possible complications.
