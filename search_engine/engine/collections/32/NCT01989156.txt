      for 5 days in confinement, and after 86 days in an ambulatory setting, by apparently adult
      healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure (BoExp) to
      selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers continuing
      smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and smoking
      abstinence (SA). Smokers who remained abstinent from SA were used as a benchmark to provide
      context to the exposure reduction.
