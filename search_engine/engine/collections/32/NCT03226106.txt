      change intervention for Veterans recovering from total knee arthroplasty. Testing will occur
      at baseline (before surgery), at intervention midpoint (8 weeks after surgery), end of
      intervention (14 weeks after surgery), and 24 weeks after intervention. The primary outcome
      is accelerometer-assessed daily step count. Secondary outcomes include the percent time
      engaged in standing and walking activity and physical function (Six-Minute Walk, 30-Second
      Chair-Stand Test, Timed Up-and-Go, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey.
