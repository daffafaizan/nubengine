      a significant workload in community nursing. The current management for non-healing wounds
      includes referral to the tissue viability service, using a 2 D photographic image with
      assessment information. This study will pilot the use of a 3 D camera and associated software
      that introduces measurement and monitoring of wounds as a specific intervention. The
      introduction of 3 D measurement and monitoring of wounds will be compared with usual care.
      With a target recruitment of 30 patients via tissue viability, the pilot will report on the
      feasibility of using this outcome measure and the effectiveness of monitoring on wound
      closure or improvement.
