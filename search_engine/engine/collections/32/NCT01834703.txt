      in the current study, uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a form of non-surgical and
      minimally invasive treatment, High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) is a form of
      non-invasive treatment that can be completed as an out-patient within hours. Embolization
      causes ischaemia and shrinkage of the fibroid and therefore symptomatic relieve. HIFU is a
      medical technology that has been used for cancer treatment. Energy is delivered from outside
      the body in a non-invasive manner to produce heat energy that causes necrosis and shrinkage
      of the uterine fibroid thereby relieves the symptoms due to the fibroid. It does not involve
      radiation. The clinical effectiveness of HIFU for uterine fibroid is unknown, however, based
      on the knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of HIFU on liver cancer and pancreatic cancer,
      there is reasonable ground to believe that HIFU is effective for uterine fibroid.
