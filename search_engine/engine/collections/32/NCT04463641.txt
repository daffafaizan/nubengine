    
      This is a interventional, pivotal, prospective, single arm, open label, multicenter,
      international trial.

      The device under investigation is the Axone system, consisting of:

        -  Axone 4LV: an ultrathin, lumenless, quadripolar, IS4-compatible lead designed for left
           ventricular pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

        -  Axone ÂµGuide: a dedicated, permanently implantable micro catheter designed for
           implantation of the Axone 4LV lead.

      The primary endpoint data will be used to support CE marking of the Axone system.

      The primary endpoints will be evaluated at 6 months post-implantation. Subjects will be
      followed-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months post-implantation, then yearly until 4
      years post-implantation.
