           oral MMF therapy as outlined in table 2.

        2. MMF will be initiated within the first 1-2 weeks of the start of steroids. Patients will
           receive CellCept, 750 mg po b.i.d for the first week. Dose will be increased to 1000 mg
           po b.i.d for the second week, and thereafter, according to blood levels and patient
           tolerance. Target blood levels are 1 ? 3.5 &#61549;g/ml. Treatment will be for a total
           of 18 months. This is based on the published dose-dependent adverse effect profiles in
           transplant patients (31-32) and on reports that lower doses are ineffective and shorter
           courses (less then 6 months) result in relapses or failure of therapy (25). Dose will be
           reduced in patient who can not tolerate MMF at the above dose.

      2) Relapse treatment to follow guidelines for relapse regimens. 3) After 18 months, all
      medications will be tapered to a full stop unless disease is active or grumbling.

      4) Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis will be used during the trial (with
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or Dapsone or Mepron if allergic to sulfa).
