      infant. Incomplete virilization of the genital bud results in hypoplasia of the tissues on
      the ventral aspect of the penis, with an ectopic ureteral meatus, a curved penile shaft and
      an incompletely formed foreskin. The condition is generally isolated and the aetiology is
      unknown. The pathogenesis is complex and involves hormonal, genetic and environmental factors
      (which are probably interlinked).

      A doubling in the incidence of hypospadias over the last 15 years has emphasized the probable
      role of environment factors: in fact, certain exogenous compounds (collectively referred to
      as "endocrine disruptors" (EDs)) may modify hormonal functions and thus exert harmful effects
      on the organism or its offspring.

      The male urethra develops between the 8th and 16th weeks of gestation in an
      androgen-dependence manner. In utero exposure of the foetus to EDs may have a
      physiopathological role in the abnormal development of the male genital bud and thus in the
      development of hypospadia. These EDs are present in many different substances, such as
      pesticides.

      Many epidemiological studies have evidenced an increase in the incidence of hypospadias in
      children born to exposed parents. Furthermore, animal studies have identified a certain
      number of compounds associated with hypospadias after in utero exposure. However, human
      foetal samples have very rarely been assayed in an attempt to measure the true level of
      impregnation (i.e. the dose received). At present, it is not possible to draw firm
      conclusions with regard to the true extent of a link between EDs and the increased incidence
      of hypospadia.

      The "HypoMeco" project is a prospective case-control study.
