      acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina pectoris.

      According to the results of the MOJITO study, performed in patients with ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction, the effect of ticagrelor, measured as platelet inhibition, may be
      achieved sooner when crushed tablets are administered. Thus, there may be significant
      differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor if pulverized drug is
      given orally or sublingually when compared with currently used oral administration of
      integral tablets.

      The study is designed as an open-label, single-center, randomized trial of different
      strategies of administration of ticagrelor in patients with unstable angina pectoris. After
      enrollment, the participants will be randomized into three arms, each receiving ticagrelor.
      The drug will be given in: (1) pulverized tablets administered sublingually, (2) pulverized
      tablets administered orally or in (3) integral tablets orally. The time required for
      ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124900XX to reach their maximum serum concentration
      will be measured as the primary outcome of the study. Moreover, further evaluation of other
      parameters including maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration of
      ticagrelor and its active metabolite will be assessed as secondary outcomes. The platelet
      reactivity will be measured with the Multiplate Analyzer.
