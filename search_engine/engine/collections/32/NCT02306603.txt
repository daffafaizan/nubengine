      effective surgery sparing modality in experienced hands. It is often curative of dysplastic
      lesions and is associated with minimal complications and high patient acceptance (1-5).
      Westmead Hospital has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the removal of such
      lesions; however, there is limited research to document the long term outcomes of patients
      undergoing endoscopic resection.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term
      outcomes of ER of superficial lesions of the duodenum and ampulla.
