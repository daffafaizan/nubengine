      primary ICH, a web-based 1:1 randomization process will be employed to assign 220 subjects to
      Glibenclamide group (giving standard management for ICH plus glibenclamide) or Control group
      (giving standard management for ICH). The investigators will make a neurofunctional
      assessment at baseline, and 3 days, 7 days, 90 days after enrollment. The investigators also
      assess the midline shift, and the change in the volume of ICH and perihematomal edema (PHE)
      from the initial to follow-up (3 days and 7days after enrollment). The serious adverse events
      of all-cause mortality, cardiac-related and blood glucose-related adverse events will be
      collected to assess the safety of glibenclamide.
