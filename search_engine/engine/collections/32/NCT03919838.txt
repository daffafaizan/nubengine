      infections, including the treatment of oral diseases. Probiotic bacteria can be found in
      saliva, plaque and adhering directly to the mucous membrane. They compete with cariogenic
      bacteria and pathogens of periodontal disease. Increased interest in probiotics means that
      attempts are being made to find new solutions regarding the methods of their administration.
      The use of probiotic bacteria brings beneficial health effects. Lactobacillus salivarius is a
      strain isolated from human milk. It is inactive (heat treatment) and therefore does not
      produce metabolites that can promote the formation of carious lesions in the mouth by
      lowering the mouth potential of hydrogen.
