      women worldwide. In Mongolia breast cancer is less common, occupies 5-th place by frequency
      in women, the incidence is 118 per 100,000 or 1,770 cases per year.

      Many different types of immunotherapy (especially checkpoint inhibitors) are being tested,
      but so far the successes have been insignificant, and serious side effects are frequent and
      unpredictable. This Phase II will evaluate a new type of breast cancer immunotherapy based on
      a fundamentally new approach that has been successfully tested in a published clinical study
      of liver cancer. Investigators will test new tableted preparation, V3-MOMMO, obtained from
      hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumor tissues of patients with breast cancer. Study will
      last 3 months, 20 patients will be recruited, given one pill per day for three months. The
      primary clinical endpoint is effect on tumor size and lymph nodes burden after 3 months.
      Secondary endpoint will be effect on levels of tumor markers (i.e., cancer antigen 15-3 (CA
      15-3), cancer antigen 27.29 (CA 27.29), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on monthly basis
      compared to baseline.
