      severity and duration of mucositis in a randomized, placebo controlled, Phase 2 clinical
      trial of BMX-001 in combination with standard RT and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed head and
      neck cancer patients (162 subjects, 1:1 randomization study drug: placebo).

      The study will also confirm protection of normal tissues by assessing the acute and chronic
      extent of xerostomia in the same trial.
