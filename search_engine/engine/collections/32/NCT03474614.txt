    
      This is a single center, randomized, trial that will enroll twenty (n=20) patients with a
      diagnosis of symptomatic cavernous malformations who are planned candidates for surgical
      resection by one of the investigators, and who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Patients will be randomized into two groups: A Treatment group of ten (n=10)
      patients that will receive oral propranolol at a dose of 60mg per day (one 60mg ER capsule
      per day) for 7- to 10-days prior to surgery plus their usual medications, and a Control group
      of 10 (n=10) patients will receive only their routine medications. Currently, the only active
      treatment alternative for symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformations is surgery.

      A control group is required to allow for a semi-quantitative comparison with mRNA and miRNA
      levels in the treatment group.
