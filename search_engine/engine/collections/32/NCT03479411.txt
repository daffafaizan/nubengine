    
      Phase 1, multi-center, 3-part, open-label study in healthy adults (Parts 1 and 2) and adults
      with mild to moderate, stable asthma (Part 3).

      Safety, tolerability and PK will be assessed following either single ascending (SAD) or
      multiple ascending (MAD) dosing of itraconazole administered as a dry powder for inhalation
      (PUR1900; Part 1 and Part 2, respectively). Part 1 will comprise 3 separate cohorts planned
      to receive single doses of 5, 10 and 25 mg itraconzaole, respectively. The study will have an
      interleaved design; Part 2 will comprise 2 separate cohorts planned to receive daily doses of
      itraconazole 10 and 20 mg per day for 14 days, respectively. Part 2, Cohort 1 will commence
      after a review of safety data from Part 1 Cohort 2 suggests it is safe to do so.

      Part 3 is a 2-period, randomised, crossover study in adult subjects with mild to moderate
      stable asthma to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of single doses of itraconazole
      administered as a dry powder for inhalation (PUR1900) and administered as an oral solution
      (SporanoxÂ® Oral Solution).
