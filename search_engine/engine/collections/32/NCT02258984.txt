      status of ED patients could lead to its inclusion into existing protocols (similar to EGDT),
      or the development of novel protocols for the treatment of patients with fluid sensitive
      conditions. The majority of other non-invasive measures of preload, such as ultrasound of the
      inferior vena cava or the passive leg raise technique are not continuous measures and require
      some type of effort or skill on the part of the clinician. Continuous methods of assessing
      preload include CVP measurement through a central venous catheter, esophageal Doppler
      monitoring, and pulse contour analysis via arterial catheter monitoring, all of which involve
      invasive procedures.

      The Venus CVP device is non-invasive and has continuous monitoring capabilities. The data
      acquired from this project will allow us to determine whether emergency physicians will, in
      practice, utilize the information provided by a non-invasive CVP monitoring device to assist
      in the management of their patients with severe sepsis or acute HF.
