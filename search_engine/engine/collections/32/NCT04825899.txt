      lymphoma patients were enrolled to detect the translocation of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 by FISH
      and 481 gene mutation by next generation sequencing, then patients received standard
      treatment with R-CHOP, R2CHOP and DA-EPOCH by investigate's choice according to the patients
      pathological characteristics. the basic characteristics and treatment response and
      progression-free survival and overall survival were collected and analyzed with the gene
      abnormalities. a total of 100 diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients will enrolled in one
