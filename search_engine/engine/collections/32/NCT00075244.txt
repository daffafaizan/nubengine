    
      OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of alternative
      weekly and every two week dosing regimens of Replagal (agalsidase alfa) in comparison to the
      current standard Replagal treatment regimen of 0.2 mg/kg given intravenously every two weeks.

      STUDY POPULATION: Hemizygous males with Fabry disease who are 18 years of age or older.

      DESIGN: This is a randomized, open-label study that will assess the pharmacodynamics and
      pharmacokinetics of five different dosing regimens of enzyme replacement therapy with
      Replagal. The effects of dose as well as dosing frequency will be evaluated and compared to
      the standard Replagal regimen.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: The pharmacodynamic parameter to be assessed is plasma
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). The hypothesis to be tested is the role that frequency (weekly)
      and/or dose (0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg) of Replagal will play in pharmacodynamics as measured by
      reductions in plasma Gb3 compared to the current dose and frequency of 0.2 mg/kg given every
      two weeks. Clinical parameters including sweating, heart rate variability, proteinuria,
      severity of neuropathic pain, pain and anti-diarrheal medication usage, frequency and
      severity of abdominal pain, and frequency of diarrhea also will be assessed.
