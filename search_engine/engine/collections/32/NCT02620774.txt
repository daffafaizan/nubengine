      infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants. The study will take place in an
      inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at
      Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers. All participants will receive at least 3 doses
      of ceftolozane/tazobactam 1.5g every 8 hours. A microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc., N.
      Chelmsford MA) will be inserted into the subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the
      wound (patients) or in the thigh (healthy volunteers). The microdialysis probe is perfused
      with lactated Ringer's solution and samples are collected each hour for 8 hours after the
      final dose. A peripheral intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein to collect
      blood samples simultaneously with microdialysis samples. Concentrations in tissue are
      compared with blood to determine percent penetration.
