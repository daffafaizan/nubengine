      bisphosphonate (BP-loaded PMMA bone cement) as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the local
      recurrence rate of giant cell tumor of bone. The investigators will evaluate whether
      bisphonsphonate as a surgical adjuvant improves secondary outcomes, such as pain, function,
      fever, or wound complications. The hypothesis is that the local administration of
      bisphosphonate will decrease the recurrence rate of GCT compared to traditional aggressive
      intralesional curettage.
