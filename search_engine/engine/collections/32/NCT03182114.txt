      (CD). Aortocaval compression is one of the theoretical mechanisms precipitating for
      post-spinal hypotension (PSH) for CD. Positioning of the patients in the left lateral tilted
      position after preforming spinal block was frequently considered a standard protocol for
      minimizing aortocaval compression and improve maternal hemodynamics during CD; however, the
      latest Cochrane database review reported that there is no adequate evidence to support any
      positioning protocol for prevention of PSH. Moreover, a recent study was conducted in full
      term pregnant women reporting no improvement in cardiac output with left lateral tilting. In
      this study, the effect of left lateral tiling performed after spinal block on maternal
      hemodynamics will be compared to ordinary supine position.
