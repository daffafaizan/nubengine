    
      The Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (NVOG) has developed a guideline programme on
      Subfertility, including 9 guidelines concerning diagnosis and treatment of subfertility and a
      national IVF protocol.

      However, guidelines in general do not implement themselves; large gaps consists between best
      evidence (as described in the guidelines) and practice, resulting in a large variation
      between professionals.

      Our study will compare an innovative patient-directed strategy with a (minimal intervention)
      control strategy, and effectiveness, costs and feasibility of both will be assessed. We
      eventually aim at the most cost-effective strategy to implement the existing subfertility
      guideline programme.

      Please Note: In our protocol, we consider only 'couples' undergoing fertility treatment;
      therefore, we aim at gathering information from approximately 5200 records, of both male and
      female participants. When reporting eventually on their treatment, we will consider them only
      as couples, resulting in reported numbers of approximately 2600 participating couples.
