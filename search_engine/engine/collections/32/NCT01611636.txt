      all over the world. The relative impact of gene and environment on diseases can be revealed
      by studies from different populations.

      National Health Insurance database in Taiwan provides a wealth of epidemiology study, which
      can contribute to the understanding of these diseases. However, national health care database
      did not contain test results and clinical details. The database of the hospital records can
      provide complimentary clinical details. Via the comparison of databases of the National
      health Institutes and the investigators hospital, the investigators hope that the
      characteristics and outcomes of these patients can be better understood.

      Briefly, epidemiology of target disease such as age, sex, incidence and prevalence will be
      derived from national database. Medical source utilization such as medication and surgery
      related to target diseases is also available in national database, providing material for
      cost analysis. These data can be compared with hospital database to ensure validity and
      reliability.

      The investigators study is intended to provide epidemiology of target disease and cost
      analysis. Interaction between diseases will also be explored.
