    
      This is a randomized (participants assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences by chance),
      double-blind (identity of study drugs will not be known to participant or members of study
      staff), placebo-controlled (a substance without active drug identical in appearance to
      esketamine), 2-period crossover study (participants assigned to each treatment sequence will
      receive 1 dose of esketamine and 1 dose of placebo administered intranasally [through the
      nose]) conducted in healthy adult participants at a single center. Participants will complete
      3 study phases: A screening phase of up to 3 weeks; a 2-week double-blind treatment phase,
      which includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and 2) separated by a washout interval of at
      least 7 days; and, a 1-week posttreatment (follow up) phase, if applicable. The duration of
      the study for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be
      collected during the study for laboratory assessments. Participants will be monitored for
      safety from the time of signing the informed consent form up until 1 week after the last dose
      of study drug (or end of treatment).
