      surgery are common. In this study the investigators propose the hypothesis that a stapled
      anastomotic technique will decrease postoperative small bowel obstruction and a mesh closure
      of the stoma site in the abdominal wall will decrease hernia formation.

      All patients will be randomized to stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis. The randomization to
      mesh or suture closure of the abdominal wall is optional.

      The stapled anastomotic technique is performed by the use of a linear staple device and the
      hand-sewn technique with a running seromuscular monofilament suture.

      The stoma site has two options and will be closed either by the use of mesh (lightweight),
      positioned under the muscle (retromuscular), or just by long-lasting suture. The anterior
      fascia of the rectus as well as the skin are closed by the use of running monofilament
      longlasting sutures, the latter in a pursestring procedure.
