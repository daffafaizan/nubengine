      participate in the study. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed with a 75-g oral glucose
      tolerance test. Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured using a mechanical column scale
      (SECA).

      The specific dimensions of eating behavior were measured through the 18-item Three-Factor
      Eating Questionnaire-18 (TFEQ-18).

      The Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) was offered every 2-4 weeks. This therapy consists of
      providing a food plan with the following recommendations: limiting carbohydrate intake to
      35-45% of total calories calculated as 30 kcal/kg based on pregestational BMI for an ideal
      weight .

      We evaluated the effect of MNT on GWG using a multiple linear regression model
