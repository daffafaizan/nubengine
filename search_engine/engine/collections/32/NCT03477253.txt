      unremitting and may persist for more than 1 day. Obstruction of the cystic duct by a
      gallstone is the initiating event that leads to distention, inflammation and edema of the
      gallbladder wall. When the gallbladder remains obstructed and secondary bacterial infection
      supervenes, an acute gangrenous cholecystitis develops and an abscess or empyema forms within
      the gallbladder. The perforation usually is contained in the sub-hepatic space by the
      omentum.

      Early cholecystectomy performed within 2 to 3 days of presentation is preferred over interval
      or delayed cholecystectomy that is performed 6 to 10 weeks after initial medical therapy.
      About 20% of patients fail initial medical therapy and require surgery during the initial
      admission or before the end of the planned conservative period. Since last 20 years,
      increasing number of surgeons have favored a policy of early surgery. Several randomized
      studies have shown that performing early cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is better
      than delayed cholecystectomy in terms of shorter hospital stay, better operative outcome.
      Though recovery from disease is earlier in early cholecystectomy group, both groups have
      similar operative morbidity and mortality rates. This study aims to evaluate the surgical
      outcomes of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for ACC within and after 3 days of symptoms onset.
