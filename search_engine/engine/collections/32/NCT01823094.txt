    
      This is an experimental study of CT perfusion (CTP) imaging in subjects with non-small cell
      lung cancer. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the feasibility of CT blood flow
      measurements in lung cancer, to develop a foundation for the use of CT blood flow
      measurements in lung cancer to assess the response to treatment, and to develop an optimized
      CTP imaging protocol for evaluating blood flow in solid body tumors. In this study, tumor
      blood flow will be evaluated at baseline and follow-up routine CT examinations of patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer, and the response of tumor blood flow will be recorded as a
      secondary endpoint. This research study will entail two study visits - one required and one
      optional - which will coincide with regularly scheduled standard of care CT scans.
