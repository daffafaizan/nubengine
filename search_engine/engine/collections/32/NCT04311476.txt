      intravenous dose of cord blood MNCs compared with placebo in reducing incidence of BPD in
      very preterm neonates.We enrolled preterm neonates less than 32 weeks of GA at neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) in Guangdong Women and Children Hospital within the first 24
      postnatal hours. Patients were randomly assigned by 1:1 to receive either (5Ã—107cells/kg
      ACBMNC or normal saline intravenously within 24 hours after birth according to a
      computer-generated schedule. The primary endpoint was efficacy at 36 GA or discharge home and
      all analyses were done by intention to prevent.MNCs viability was also tested before
      transfusion
