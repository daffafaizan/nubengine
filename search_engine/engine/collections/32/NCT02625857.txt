    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study. The Part 1
      of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based
      on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2 will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate
      2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the RP2D for JNJ-64041809 is determined in Part
      1. The study will consist of a Screening Period (from signing of informed consent until
      immediately before the first dose), an open-label Treatment Period (from the first dose of
      study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a Post treatment Follow-up Period (after
      the End-of Treatment Visit until study discontinuation). Participants will be primarily
      evaluated for RP2D. Participants safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
