        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or refractory stage II or III
           multiple myeloma treated with arsenic trioxide and dexamethasone.

        -  Determine the rates of overall and relapse-free survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV daily for 5 days during the first week only and
      then 2 days a week thereafter. Patients also receive IV or oral dexamethasone on days 1-4
      every 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Disease assessments are conducted every 4 weeks. Patients achieving complete
      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy after initial determination of CR.

      Final assessments are conducted 4 weeks after the last study treatment and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
