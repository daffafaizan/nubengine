      with newly diagnosed IIPs in Japan. At least 600 patients will be registered for 16 months at
      approximately 80 sites in Japan.

      Primary research question is to determine the natural history of each category of IIPs at
      registration, patient background and diagnosis methods will be considered. Furthermore, the
      present treatment patterns and disease behavior (CT and forced vital capacity (FVC) changes,
      as well as changes in interstitial pneumonia markers, etc.) will also be investigated.
