      <1800 g) infants leave hospital with overt signs of under-nutrition (eg. growth retardation).
      Recent evidence from randomized control trials suggest that provision of nutrient-enriched
      feeding to formula-fed premature infants after hospital discharge improves their growth,
      accretion of lean body mass and bone mineral content compared to infants fed a standard term
      formula. While available data suggest an advantage of human milk feeding after hospital
      discharge, experimental evidence on which to base guidelines to enrich, or not to enrich,
      human milk (HM) are notably absent.
