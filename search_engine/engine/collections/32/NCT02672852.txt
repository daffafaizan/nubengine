    
      In Part A1, eligible participants were randomized at Baseline at a ratio of 4:1, stratified
      by weight and prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor antagonists to receive double-blind
      (DB) risankizumab 150 mg or placebo at Weeks 0 and 4. In Part A2, participants randomized at
      Baseline to receive DB placebo then received risankizumab 150 mg at Weeks 16 (Part A2) and at
      Week 28 and every 12 weeks up to 88 weeks (Part B); participants randomized to risankizumab
      150 mg continued to receive risankizumab 150 mg at Week 16. Participants who received
      risankizumab in Part A and were nonresponders (sPGA >2) at Week 28 received risankizumab 150
      mg at Week 28 and every 12 weeks up to 88 weeks (Part B). In Part B, participants who
      received risankizumab in Part A and were responders (sPGA ≤2) at Week 28, were rerandomized
      at a ratio of 1:2 to receive DB risankizumab 150 mg or placebo at Week 28 and every 12 weeks
      up to 88 weeks (Part B). Starting at Week 32, rerandomized participants who reached relapse
      (defined as sPGA ≥3) were switched to risankizumab 150 mg every 12 weeks.
