      effective interventional approach of treating hypertensive disease with a progressively
      increasing fall in blood pressure. Decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system is
      one of the major underlying pathogenetic mechanism of the fall in blood pressure but the
      precise mechanisms that causes the fall in blood pressure in the short-term and, in
      particular, long-term remains elusive. The objective of the study is to understand the
      pathogenetic mechanisms of renal denervation beyond the reduced activity of the sympathetic
      nervous system. In 100 hypertensive patients most advanced technology will be applied, before
      and repeatedly after renal denervation, throughout the follow-up period of 1 year. Systemic
      activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, renal perfusion (by MRI spin labelling
      technique), local activity of the renin angiotensin system in the kidney (urinary
      angiotensinogen concentrations), sodium excretion and total sodium content (23 Na-MRI
      technique) and vascular remodelling of small (retinal arterioles 50 - 150 Âµm) and large
      arteries (carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, both measured over 24
      hours) will be assessed. Identification of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the fall
      in blood pressure after renal denervation may help to identify those hypertensive patients
      that profit most from renal nerve ablation in terms of blood pressure reduction.
