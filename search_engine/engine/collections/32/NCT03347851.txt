    
      Prospective, concurrent 4D flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and echocardiography of On-X
      and St Jude Medical (SJM) Masters HP or Carbomedics Carbo-seal or Carbo-seal Valsalva aortic
      valve replacement (AVR) patients will be performed. Echocardiography analysis will include:
      valve function (opening angle), pressure gradients, and degree of valve washout. MRI analysis
      will focus on downstream flow patterns (helicity and vorticity), energy loss, pressure
      recovery, and measurement of wall shear stress in the anastomosis regions.
