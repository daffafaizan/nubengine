      parameters Cmax and AUC0-12h between two recombinant soluble human insulin preparations. The
      study also compares the other pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic profiles as well
      as assesses safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations in type 1
      diabetics.
