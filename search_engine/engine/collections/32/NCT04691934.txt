      the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patient demographics and information about
      anesthesia were analyzed retrospectively from the patient files.

      All patients were operated in negative pressure operating theatres reserved for them. The
      whole team was equipped with Level 3 personal protective equipment (PPE) (liquid-proof apron,
      N-95 mask, goggles, visor, overshoes). Anesthesia was administered by 2 healthcare
      professionals from the anesthesia team, including an experienced anesthesiologist and an
      assistant anesthesia technician. A third person was kept ready outside to help in case of
      need.
