      administration is performed through the epidural needle, a technique of epidural loading that
      provides a rapid and reliable level of labor analgesia without the disadvantages of a
      combined spinal-epidural, and could add a valuable new tool to anesthesiologists.
      Investigators propose to conduct a single blinded, randomized controlled trial to determine
      if a difference exists in the speed of onset and spread of labor analgesia between patients
      receiving an epidural loading dose through the epidural needle or catheter.

      Group 1 (Epidural Catheter Administration) participants will receive the 10 mL epidural
      loading dose in 5 mL increments via the epidural catheter following catheter placement
      (current standard practice).

      Group 2 (Epidural Needle Administration ) participants will receive the 10 mL epidural
      loading dose in 5 mL increments via the epidural needle prior to catheter placement
      (experimental group).

      Various parameters will be measured in the time after drug administration to evaluate blood
      pressure, heart rate, and fetal heart rate. Following delivery, the total anesthetic dose,
      total number of doses demanded, total number and dosage of rescue doses, and overall patient
      satisfaction will be recorded.
