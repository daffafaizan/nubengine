      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Therefore, children routinely receive
      prophylactic and empirical antifungal therapy after SCT. The most commonly used antifungal
      agent in this population is voriconazole. Voriconazole can be given via intravenous or oral
      routes and children who are post SCT are routinely switched from the intravenous to oral
      formulation at the time of hospital discharge. However, the absorption and systemic exposure
      of oral voriconazole has not been well-described in children. Furthermore, many children who
      undergo transplantation develop gastrointestinal graft versus host disease and this likely
      impacts oral absorption. The magnitude of effect resulting from graft versus host disease on
      absorption of voriconazole and subsequent blood concentrations in children is unknown. Thus
      children with graft versus host disease are at a particularly high risk of inadequate
      absorption with subsequent sub-therapeutic levels of voriconazole. They may need higher or
      more frequent dosing to achieve therapeutic levels. The purpose of my research project is to
      define the pharmacokinetics of oral voriconazole and establish dosing guidelines in children
      following SCT.
