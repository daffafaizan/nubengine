      for Special Dietary Use) conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Each subject
      enrolled will be in the study from the time of consent (within 10 days of birth) to hospital
      discharge. A prospective control cohort of 15 infants will initially be enrolled. Fifteen
      (15) infants will then be enrolled into the B. infantis cohort. Infants in the B. infantis
      cohort will receive a daily feeding of B. infantis EVC001 in MCT oil until hospital
      discharge.
