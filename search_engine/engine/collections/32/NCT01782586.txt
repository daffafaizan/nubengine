      switch that controls how they are expressed in a cell, as well as a "volume control" that
      increases or decreases the level of expression of a particular gene as necessary. Researchers
      want to see if the presence and abundance of certain transcripts in a kidney biopsy at one
      year after transplant can predict which kidneys will have reduced function over time.
