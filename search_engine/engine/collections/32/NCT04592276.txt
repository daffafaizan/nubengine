      assigned to two groups, the PS128 and a placebo group, under the double-blind trial.
      Participants took two capsules with or without PS128 after dinner for 30 days. Study measures
      included subjective depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep questionnaires, and miniature
      polysomnography (miniature-PSG) recordings at baseline and on the 15th and 30th days after
      taking capsules.
