      yoga/meditation program. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first
      group will complete the yoga/meditation classes, followed by a waiting period. The second
      group will go through a waiting period, followed by yoga/meditation classes. Two subjects
      assigned to classes during the first session will be selected to participate in an MRI
      sub-study to look for biomarkers of MS-associated fatigue. All subjects will complete
      questionnaires and assessments during 3 clinic visits - at baseline, in between the class
      sessions, and at the end of the study. Questionnaires will also be mailed to subjects 6 weeks
      after the last study visit.
