      radiology departments and imaging in adult-sized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners is
      associated with significant safety and image quality issues. For these reasons, the smallest
      and/or sickest neonates are typically precluded from receiving an MRI exam. The overreaching
      goal of our research effort is to bring high-performance MRI into the NICU so that all
      neonates can benefit from the same quality of diagnostic imaging as adults. To accomplish
      this, we have converted a commercial small-bore 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner designed for
      orthopedic use into a neonatal MRI system optimized for whole body imaging of neonates. To
      expand the imaging capabilities of the NICU MRI system, the measurement control electronics
      and operating system software of the FDA cleared imaging OPTIMA platform have been augmented
      with state of the art HDX electronics and software currently used on a conventional
      commercially available adult sized whole body MRI scanner. The clinical safety of the
      integrated HDX/OPTIMA NICU MRI system and its ability to produce diagnostic image quality has
      been shown in 15 pilot patients (CCHMC Protocol 2011-2045). The present protocol builds and
      expands upon the previous to use the integrated NICU MRI system to perform MRI exams in the
      neonatal population.
