      resulting in visual loss. The mainstay of treatment is reduction of intraocular pressure
      (IOP), which has been shown to preserve vision, and glaucoma surgery aims to achieve this.
      One type of surgery involves insertion of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD). Following surgery
      steroid eye drops are commonly used in order to reduce the inflammation that occurs as a
      result of the surgery. However, a common side effect of steroid eye drops is a rise in eye
      pressure. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) eye drops do not have this side
      effect and are used as an alternative to steroids following other types of eye surgery. Use
      of NSAID drops following GDD surgery may result in improved eye pressure. This study aims to
      evaluate the eye pressure response to NSAID eye drops following GDD surgery.
