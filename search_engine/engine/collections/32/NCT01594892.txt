      metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study.

        1. A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with
           longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety.

        2. Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions
           adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy.
           Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to
           higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to
           single fraction treatment.

        3. Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only,
           while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous
           integrated boost concept.
