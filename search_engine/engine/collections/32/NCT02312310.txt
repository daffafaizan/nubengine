      receive 0, 260, 510, or 770 mg daily* for 12 weeks and will be tested before and after the
      intervention. Cognitive testing will be conducted prior to randomization, and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 20 of the study.

      In an optional substudy, fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium
      contrast will be conducted to measure dentate gyrus function before randomization and then
      after completion of the 12-week intervention portion of the trial.
