    
      The system used in this study is the (MVI)™ Multichannel Vestibular Implant System produced
      by Labyrinth Devices, LLC. It is similar to commercially available cochlear implants in that
      it includes an implanted stimulator powered and controlled by an external unit, which
      communicate with the implant across the skin via an inductive link. Unlike a cochlear
      implant, the implanted stimulator's electrode array is designed for implantation near the
      ends of the vestibular nerve. The implanted stimulator also includes additional magnets to
      help facilitate retention of the external unit on the scalp over the implant. The external
      unit includes a head-worn unit (for sensing head motion and delivering power and signals to
      the implanted stimulator) and a power and control unit containing a battery and
      microprocessor. Participants in this trial who meet candidacy criteria and who choose to
      proceed with implantation surgery, device activation and device deactivation will be asked to
      participate in a series of post-operative monitoring visits over a ≥1 year period.
