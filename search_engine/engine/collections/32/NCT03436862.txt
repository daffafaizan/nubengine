      maintenance therapy early after autologous stem cell transplant in patients with Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (HL).

      Eligible patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg IV) every 2 weeks (Â± 2 days as long as
      interval between doses is 12-16 days) starting 45-120 post-transplant for up to a maximum of
      6 months of treatment. Response to treatment will be assessed 6 months and 1 year
      post-transplant using Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response
      Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification.
