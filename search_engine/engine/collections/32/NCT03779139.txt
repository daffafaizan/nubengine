      incapacitating pain, frequent hospitalization and risk of narcotic dependence. This is a
      debilitating disease with limited treatment options; afflicted patients are often young or
      middle aged adults. The health and economic costs of pancreatitis are great. Nearly $300
      million is spent on emergency department visits alone in the US each year. More than 90% of
      patients with chronic pancreatitis have been hospitalized, half use narcotic analgesics
      regularly, and one-fourth are on disability. The lifetime risk of diabetes mellitus is as
      high as 70%. This proposal addresses needs in two broad topic areas: pancreatitis, and
      diabetes. The investigators propose to investigate a new technique for implanting autologous
      pancreatic islet cells into patients undergoing surgery for acute recurrent or chronic
      pancreatitis in an effort to improve long-term diabetes control.
