    
      All patients with elective, laparoscopic colorectal resection between November 2004 and
      January 2007 were included in the trial. The decision for epidural analgesia was made by the
      anaesthetist and the patient. Contraindications were previous back surgery, coagulopathy,
      severe spondylarthrosis and refusal by the patient as contraindications.

      Primary outcome was subjective feeling postoperatively, assessed with a VAS for pain and
      cramps and amount of analgesics used. Secondary outcomes were duration of postoperative bowel
      dismotility (first flatus, first defecation, first solid food intake) and general and
      specific morbidity.
