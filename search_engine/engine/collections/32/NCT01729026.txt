      re-experiencing of a traumatic event, often together with depression, fearfulness, and social
      isolation. Despite major advances in rehabilitation, many Veterans continue to be disabled by
      PTSD. One possible new approach involves the use of shelter dogs, which might relieve
      symptoms and aid reintegration into society by providing emotional support and a greater
      sense of security. In this randomized controlled trial of 48 Veterans with chronic PTSD, we
      will evaluate whether the half who adopt a dog from the San Antonio Humane Society show
      greater improvement in their PTSD symptoms over the first three months than the half who are
      assigned to a waiting list.
