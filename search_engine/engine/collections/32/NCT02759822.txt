      myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with the lowest rates of
      relapse.

      Fertility rate in Brazil is falling, and only 25% of people born today will have a matched
      sibling donor. On the other hand, currently donor non-related to about 50% of patients
      enrolled in Brazilian Receptor Registry (REREME). Consequently, at least 35% of patients
      won't have a matched donor.

      The haploidentical transplantation is defined as a partially matched hematopoietic cell
      transplantation, using a partially matched family donor (parent, sibling or child).
      Haploidentical transplantation activity is growing worldwide, with results comparable matched
      unrelated donors.

      The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of haploidentical transplantation with
      post transplant cyclophosphamide for acute leukemias in a Brazil.
