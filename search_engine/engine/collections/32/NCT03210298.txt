      demography, therapy) are analyzed using descriptive statistics. Survival data are analyzed
      with Kaplan-Meier statistics. Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazard Models are used to
      identify potential prognostic and predictive factors. In particular, a risk- adjusted
      comparison of the outcome criteria with a propensity score is planned.

      The data are stored in a SQL-based online database. Patient data are pseudoanonymized. The
      registry has received approval of the data protection officer of the State of
      Northrhine-Westphalia.

      The study steering committee is blinded towards the identity of the participating
      institutions. Each participating institution receives an annual report with own data vs.
      benchmark. Scientific analysis can be proposed by the steering committee, by a participating
      institution or by other scientists, subjected to the approval of the independent scientific
      advisory board.

      An export function has been built in to allow data exchange with the HIPEC Registry of the
      German Society for General and GI surgery (http://www.dgav.de/studoq/studoqhipec.html).
