      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in patients with previously-treated ALL.

      II. To gain a preliminary assessment of how MRD response translates into relapse-free and
      overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare disease assessments by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) to a newly-developed and more sensitive next generation sequencing (NGS)-based
      platform.

      II. To correlate response to pembrolizumab to immunologic markers in peripheral blood and
      bone marrow specimens.

      III. To evaluate if treatment with pembrolizumab has a measurable impact on hematopoietic
      engraftment and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients who subsequently undergo allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving complete MRD response may receive up to 1 additional year of treatment at
      the discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
