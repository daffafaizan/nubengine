      outcomes. The Hypotension Prediction Index developed from machine learning, predicts the
      occurrence of arterial hypotension from the analysis of the arterial pressure waveform. The
      use of this index can reduce the duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension in
      adults undergoing noncardiac surgery.

      Methods: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (N=80) in high-risk
      surgical patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. All participants will be
      randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Hemodynamic management in the control
      group will be based on standard hemodynamic parameters. Hemodynamic management of patients in
      the intervention group will be based on functional hemodynamic parameters provided by
      Hemosphere platform (Edwards Lifesciences Ltd), including dynamic arterial elastance,
      dP/dtmax and the Hypotension Prediction Index. Tissue oxygen saturation will be
      non-invasively and continuously recorded by using near-infrared spectroscopy technology.
      Biomarkers of acute kidney stress (cTIMP2 and IGFBP7) will be obtained before and after
      surgery. The primary outcome will be intraoperative time-weighted average with a mean
      arterial pressure < 65mmHg.

      Discussion: The aim of the study is to determine whether a goal-directed algorithm based on
      the prevention of arterial hypotension using the Hypotension Prediction Index reduces the
      duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension when compared with the recommended
      standard therapy and if this intraoperative strategy is associated with better tissue
      oxygenation and organ perfusion.
