    
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, multiple-dose, PLB controlled, 2-period,
      4-sequence, crossover study design.

      After establishing eligibility approximately 16 subjects with cocaine use disorder will be
      randomized to one of four sequences.

      Treatment periods will be separated by a 7-day in-patient washout period. EMB-001/PLB will be
      orally administered for 7 consecutive days, BID for 6 days (starting on Day 1 and Day 15)
      followed on the last day (Day 7 and Day 21) by one EMB-001/PLB oral dose in the morning.
      Infusion of 40 mg IV cocaine and IV saline-to-match cocaine infusion will be administered in
      a randomized order, 2 hours apart, starting 3 hours after the last morning EMB-001/PLB oral
      administration.

      The subjects will be discharged from the research clinic 2 days after the last dose of
      cocaine, and will have a follow-up visit 7 days after last dose.
