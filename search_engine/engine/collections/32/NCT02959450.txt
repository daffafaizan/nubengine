      deglutition. An inefficacy deglutition increases the risk of malnutrition and/or dehydration.
      On the other hand, unsafe deglutition requires more time to complete the oral preparation of
      the bolus, which can leave residues in the mouth that can then lead to penetration of small
      food particles into the respiratory tract. These tracheobronchial aspirations cause
      aspiration pneumonia in 50% of cases, with 50% of mortality rate.

      Despite the enormous impact of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia in functional capacity and quality of
      life, this problem is underestimated and underdiagnosed as a major cause of nutritional and
      pulmonary complications that generate more material and human resources. There are few
      studies evaluating the effect of a nutritional intervention on recovery in swallowing ability
      or improvement of nutritional status.

      The purpose of this trial is to design a nutritional intervention with modified texture foods
      to increase viscosity (measured accurately) according to the patient's requirements, also
      assess if the intervention has a positive effect on the swallowing ability, calorie and
      protein oral intake and nutritional status.
