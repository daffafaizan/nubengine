      and infants. Patients admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and the Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) will be
      enrolled. Participants will be enrolled into one of three cohorts depending on whether they
      are scheduled for ECMO, CPB, or neither, and based on age (neonate or infant).

      Two doses of hpATIII will be used; one according to current labelling for hpATIII and one
      that accounts for the additional circuit volume from ECMO or CPB. Pharmacokinetic
      measurements will be obtained for all groups at baseline prior to administration of hpATIII
      and at multiple defined times up to 120 hrs following each administration of hpATIII.

      Administration of hpATIII is standard of care at CCHMC for participants undergoing ECMO. The
      standard dose administered for clinical care is (120 - baseline AT activity level) x weight
      (kg) / 1.4. For participants not undergoing ECMO for clinical care, or for those undergoing
      ECMO but receiving an adjusted dose for additional circuit volume , the administration of
      hpATIII is considered research.

      The duration of the study at CCHMC is expected to be 2.5 years. This includes 24 months for
      recruitment and data collection, and 6 months for data analysis and report writing.

      Individual participants will be in the study for approximately 120 hours (5 days) following
      administration of hpATIII. If participants receive more than 1 dose, they will be in the
      study for approximately 120 hours following each dose of hpATIII received.
