    
      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1b study of CBP501/cisplatin/nivolumab combination
      administered once every 21 days to patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be
      conducted in two parts.

      The first part of the study involves dose-escalation, in which successive cohorts of three
      patients (expanded up to six patients in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or
      safety concerns) will receive escalating doses of CBP501 and/or cisplatin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or RP2D defined, based on tolerability observed during the
      first 21 days of treatment and safety review of all available information by the Safety
      Monitoring Committee.

      The second part of the study involves treatment of expansion cohorts of 10 evaluable patients
      each in pretreated metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer and in microsatellite stable
      colorectal cancer to confirm the tolerability of treatment at the RP2D and evaluate
      preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in these indications.
