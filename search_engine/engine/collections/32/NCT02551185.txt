    
      Patients will receive ACY 241 with dose escalation according to a 3 + 3 design in combination
      with paclitaxel at the dose and schedule used in clinical practice for the patient population
      treated in this protocol.

      Patients will undergo screening assessments for protocol eligibility within 28 days of study
      start (Cycle 1 Day 1).

      Patients will receive ACY 241 by oral administration once daily (QD) or, if supported by PK
      and safety data, twice daily on 21 consecutive days of a 28 day treatment cycle. Paclitaxel
      will be administered to patients at 80 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the 28
      day treatment cycle. Patients who experience a DLT or other unacceptable toxicity in Cycle 1
      will be removed from study treatment. Patients will receive study treatment until documented
      progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

      Each cohort will consist of at least 3 patients. Patients who withdraw consent in Cycle 1
      will be replaced. An assessment of safety will be made by the Safety Review Committee (SRC)
      before dose escalation. The SRC will be composed of the Study Investigators, the Sponsor's
      Medical Monitor and Clinical Project Lead, and the Contract Research Organization's Safety
      Monitor, Project Manager, and Biometrician. Ad hoc members may be invited by the Sponsor as
      needed.
