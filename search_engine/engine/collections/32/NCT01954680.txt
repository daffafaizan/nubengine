      computer "games" to build up a skill that has been shown to be impaired in a specific
      disorder--can result in improvement in psychiatric illnesses--including schizophrenia.

      This will be the first National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded study to use this
      "retrain your brain" approach in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.

      During this study, we are seeking 40 children and adolescents with bipolar disorder to:

        -  come to our lab at Bradley Hospital in East Providence R.I. twice per week (each lasting
           1 hour) to "play" a special computer game for a total of 8 weeks

        -  to have a special MRI before and after this 8-week trial to see if our "game" improves
           brain activity

        -  it does NOT matter if your child is already on medications--they can continue during
           this study

        -  all children/adolescents with bipolar disorder are welcome--as long as they do NOT have
           implanted metal (no braces, no cochlear implants, etc) because of magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) safety.

      This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain
      changes.

      If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children
      function--i.e., if it helps their illness.
