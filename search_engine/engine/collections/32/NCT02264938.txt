      and were randomized to receive daily oral supplementation with lutein (12mg) + zeaxanthin
      (2mg) + astaxanthin (8mg) + omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] 540mg +
      eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] 360mg) + vitamin C (40mg) + vitamin E (20mg) + zinc (16mg) +
      copper (2mg), or observation during one year. ETDRS vision, biomicroscopy, intraocular
      pressure (IOP), color fundus photography and automatic measurement of drusen with Topcon
      3D-OCT 2000 (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) using the 6 x 6 mm 3D cube scan protocol, were performed
      in all patients, at baseline and 12 months after. Automated delineation of macular drusen was
      modified by the investigators when evident segmentation errors occurred.
