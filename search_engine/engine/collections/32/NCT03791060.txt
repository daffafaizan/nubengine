      presenting with papules and eventually atrophic plaques, most commonly on the distal extensor
      lower extremities, which can be painful and disfiguring. Currently no FDA-approved treatment
      exists, and no well-established treatment algorithm has been described. Reports on successful
      therapeutic interventions have generally been small and inconsistent.

      Recent literature expanding on the previously poorly understood pathogenesis of NLD has
      suggested a potential role for IL-17 in the development of this condition. Thus blockade of
      IL-17 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with NLD. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is
      a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17a and is FDA approved for the treatment of
      psoriasis.

      This open-label, proof of concept study regarding the use of Secukinumab in patients with NLD
      may be a first step in elucidating and defining a treatment for this chronic and potentially
      debilitating condition for which no FDA approved treatment currently exists.
