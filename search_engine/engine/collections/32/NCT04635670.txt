      (CKD). It is hypothesized that defects in the intestinal barrier due to intestinal dysbiosis,
      a microbial imbalance in the intestines, allow bacterial toxins and other proinflammatory
      substances to pass and cause systemic inflammation that damages the endothelium. To
      reestablish the microbial symbiosis and thereby strengthening the gut barrier different
      treatments have been investigated. Fibers serve as substrate for the beneficial bacterial
      strains and probiotics are selected bacteria that exert a beneficial effect on the gut
      environment. It is hypothesized that a supplement of fructo-oligosaccharides and probiotics
      (Pre-/probiotic mix) will strengthen the gut barrier and thereby protect the endothelium and
      kidneys.

      The aim of this study is to test whether af Pre-/probiotic mix, will have a beneficial impact
      on albuminuria in persons with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria.

      46 patients with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria will be recruited from Steno Diabetes Center
      Copenhagen (SDCC) in accordance with the study in- and exclusion criteria.
