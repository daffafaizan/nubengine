        -  Determine the disease-free survival in patients with hepatic metastases from primary
           colorectal carcinoma treated with surgical resection with or without radiofrequency
           ablation followed by irinotecan.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the measurement of molecular markers with clinical outcome in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment with
      radiofrequency ablation in addition to resection (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo surgical resection with or without radiofrequency ablation. Beginning 4-8
      weeks after surgery, patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Chemotherapy
      repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
