      and PD study of avelumab in combination with other immune modulators in adult patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (eg, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), gastric cancer, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) and progressing tenosynovial giant cell tumor/pigmented villonodular synovitis
      (TGCT/PVNS) . In Phase 1b, this includes patients whose disease has progressed on standard of
      care therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. In Phase 2, enrollment criteria
      regarding prior treatment(s) received varies by tumor type. Incorporation of the other immune
      modulators into this study is based on preclinical and clinical data supportive of
      single-agent tolerability and potential clinical benefit, as well as non-clinical data
      suggesting safety, tolerability and clinical benefit of the agent(s) in combination with
      avelumab. Combinations of avelumab plus other immune modulator(s) to be evaluated are as
      follows:

        -  Combination A: avelumab plus utomilumab (4-1BB agonist mAb)

        -  Combination B: avelumab plus PF-04518600 (OX40 agonist mAb)

        -  Combination C: avelumab plus PD 0360324 (M-CSF mAb)

        -  Combination D: avelumab plus utomilumab plus PF-04518600

        -  Combination F: avelumab plus CMP-001 (TLR9 agonist) and avelumab plus CMP-001 plus
           utomilumab and avelumab plus CMP-001 and PF-04518600 Each combination will be studied
           individually in 2 study parts: 1) a Phase 1b Lead-in part to evaluate safety, and
           determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and RP2D
           (if applicable), of the combination, and 2) a Phase 2 part to evaluate efficacy and
           further evaluate safety of the selected dose from the Phase 1b portion in pre-specified
           patient populations.
