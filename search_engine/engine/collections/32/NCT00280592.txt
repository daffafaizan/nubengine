      these patients are prone to have recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), leading to an
      important morbidity. Cranberry has been traditionally used for the treatment and prevention
      of UTI and research suggests that its mechanism of action is preventing bacterial adherence
      to host cell surface membrane.

      However, systematic reviews show the small sample sizes and the poor quality of available
      trials, determining that there is no reliable evidence of effectiveness of cranberry in UTI
      prophylaxis. Therefore, to assess whether cranberry is effective in reducing UTI in patients
      with multiple sclerosis, we have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. Efficacy will be evaluated on the time to onset of a UTI in the first year of
      treatment.
