    
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the extent to which supported exercise training
      through wearable technology and mobile application affects glycemic control in comparison to
      supervised exercise training in patients with Type-2 Diabetes.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Age 18-65

        -  No other chronic condition

        -  No exercise training background Block Randomization according to age and sex.

      Confirmatory Outcome

      - Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)

      Explanatory outcomes

        -  Flexibility

        -  Level of Physical Activity - IPaQ (METS) and accelerometer

        -  Hamstring / Quad strength - isokinetic

        -  Grip strength

        -  Respiratory function test - F1, FVC, F25, F75, F100

        -  6MWT

        -  Balance - static, dynamic, proprioception, sit-to-stand balance

        -  Body Muscle Percentage - bioelectrical impedance analysis
