      variants in susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      The participation of the French UroCCR network consists in completing the bio-collection of
      the UroCCR cohort by preserving constitutional DNA and to provide DNA samples to the US NCI
      team.

      This will increase the number of samples for meta-analysis and contribute to better identify
      clear cell kidney cancer susceptibility loci.
