      will be included between November 2015 and November 2017.

      During each session of speech and language treatment, aphasics will receive a weak 2 milli
      amperes (electric) current delivered by a tDCs device for 20 minutes. The stimulation will be
      either active or placebo. Each stage of the cross over will last three weeks. Patients will
      be administered the usual number of SLT sessions, no particular therapy being imposed. To
      evaluate the long-time effects of the therapy, three follow-up measures will be proposed.
