      In the previous funding period we demonstrated reductions in transmission risk behavior
      associated with participation in our behavioral intervention; however, these improvements
      eroded over time, underscoring the need to develop and test interventions designed to enhance
      longer-term behavior change. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an
      intervention designed to maintain reductions in high-risk sexual practices achieved by
      methamphetamine-using HIV+ MSM. Three major questions addressed are: 1) Can
      methamphetamine-using HIV+ MSM modify their high-risk sexual practices over an extended
      (16-month) period? 2) Do "group maintenance sessions" result in less erosion of behavioral
      improvements? 3) Are the underlying mechanisms the same for acquisition and maintenance of
      behavior change? We will assign 450 sexually active HIV+ MSM who regularly use
      methamphetamine and who have had unprotected sex with an HIV-negative or unknown-status
      partner to one of three conditions: 1) an eight-session intervention, combining
      client-centered motivational interviewing and structured behavioral counseling to address
      five intervention domains (context of unsafe sex/drug use; condom use; safer sex negotiation;
      disclosure; and enhancement of social supports); 2) the same eight counseling sessions (i.e.,
      identical to condition 1 above), plus eight group-format safer sex maintenance sessions,
      which utilize clinical strategies from relapse prevention to identify high-risk situations
      and develop effective coping strategies; or 3) an attention-control condition that is
      time-equivalent to condition 2 above, and addresses diet, exercise, and HIV. Thus we will
      determine whether longer-term maintenance of safer sex behaviors is possible among HIV+
      methamphetamine-using MSM, a population that remains at very high risk of HIV transmission,
      and for which substitution therapies to promote cessation and risk reduction are not yet
      available.
