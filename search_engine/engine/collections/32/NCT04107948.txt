      the working group composed of doctors from different specialities of the department
      considered it important to carry out a randomised study evaluating the effectiveness of a
      healthcare organisation combining:

        -  an adapted and supervised physical activity intervention (1 month hospital initiation
           then 2 months in town)

        -  therapeutic education sessions for the patient with motivational interviews Compared to
           usual clinical practice (adapted physical activity adapted in autonomy at home +
           therapeutic patient education sessions with motivational interviews).
