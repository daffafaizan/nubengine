      bleeding, and SUP is recommended. However, the quantity and quality of evidence supporting
      SUP is low and has been questioned. Furthermore studies have shown that proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of pneumonia, clostridium difficile infection and
      acute myocardial ischemia. The aim of the SUP-ICU trial is to assess the benefits and harms
      of SUP with PPI in adult critically ill patients in the ICU.
