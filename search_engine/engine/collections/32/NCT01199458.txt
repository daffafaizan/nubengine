      regurgitation of gastric content and aspiration.

      The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscle located at the distal end of the esophagus. It
      plays an important role in creating a barrier between the stomach and the esophagus. The term
      "barrierpressure" is defined as the pressure difference between the lower esophageal
      sphincter pressure and the pressure in the stomach (intragastric pressure).

      There are studies showing that opioids given iv/im, in the vein or in the muscle, may
      decrease the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and hereby increase the risk of
      aspiration.

      Nevertheless,other studies shows that opioids are still frequently given to patients during
      anesthesia induction. This is done in order to prevent the cardiovascular response to (the
      painful) intubation which can often be seen as an equally high risk for the patient as the
      risk of aspiration.

      In light of the above description, the investigators are planning a study in volunteers with
      the primary aim of investigating the effects of an opioid (alfentanil) on the pressures in
      the lower esophageal sphincter.

      Another safety measure taken during anesthesia induction is the so called "cricoid pressure".
      This is based on the theory that passive regurgitation of gastric content may be prevented by
      occluding the esophagus by pressing on the cricoid cartilage. However, there are studies
      indicating that the application of cricoid pressure also may decrease the tonus of the lower
      esophageal sphincter.

      The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the effect of cricoid pressure application
      on the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter.

      Measurements are being done using high-resolution solid-state manometry.
