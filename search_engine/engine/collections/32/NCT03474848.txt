      bilateral CP recruited from the Associação Mineira de Reabilitação, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

      Procedures: After being included in the study, children will be randomly assigned to a
      intervention group (n=20) or a control group (n=20). Children in the intervention group will
      receive a 90-hour (6 hours/day; 5 days/week, 3 weeks) of Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Training
      (HABIT) while children in control group will maintain their usual frequency of Occupational
      Therapy (OT) sessions (45 minutes/session, twice a week, for 3 weeks), focusing on functional
      training, stretching and sensory stimulation. All participants will be assessed by an
      examiner blinded to group allocation before and after the intervention period, as well as 6
      months after the intervention (follow-up).

      Statistical Analysis: A 2 (groups) x 3 (assessments) analysis of variance will test the
      effects of group, assessment and group x assessment interaction with a level of significance
      set at 0.05.
