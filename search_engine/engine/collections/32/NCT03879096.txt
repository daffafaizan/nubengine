      cancer-related fatigue or pain. Cancer patients also have affected quality of life, lower
      levels of function and they are at higher risk of weight gain following diagnosis. Given the
      risk of obesity, both exercise and diet play a key role in recovery from cancer.

      Hence, the aim of this study is to show the effect of a Therapeutic Exercise and Education
      programme (TEEP) in clinical and functional, including practical nutritional education in
      other clinical and functional secondary outcomes in cancer patients and survivors.

      Variables included are: body composition, mediterranean-diet adherence, quality of life (QoL)
      and functional outcomes (limb functionality, physical activity, physical function and
      handgrip strength). Furthermore, laboratory variables like muscle thickness (ecography) and
      muscle activity (electromyography) were included.
