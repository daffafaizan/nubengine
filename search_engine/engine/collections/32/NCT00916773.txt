      obstruction during sleep. Recent studies have found evidence of airway inflammation in
      patients with OSAS. Individuals with chronic airway inflammation are at higher risk for
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). We hypothesized patients with OSAS are at higher
      risk for EIB due to baseline airway inflammation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      is a known standard treatment for OSAS, thus the second aim of the study will be
      investigating the effect of 3-month CPAP therapy on EIB for patients with OSAS. Twenty severe
      OSAS patients and 20 control individuals matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI)
      will be recruited. All participants will come to the laboratory on 2 separate days (5~14 days
      interval). On the 1st visit, baseline pulmonary function test (PFT) and airway inflammation
      assess by induced sputum will be performed. On the 2nd visit, an exercise challenge test will
      be performed using standard testing protocol and post-exercise forced expiratory volume in
      one second (FEV1) will be measured at 2.5, 5, 10, 15,20, and 30 minutes. For patients with
      severe OSAS, all measurements will be repeated after 3-month CPAP therapy.
