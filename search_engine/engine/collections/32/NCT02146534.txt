      Prolonged-release fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocking
      agent. It relieves conduction block in demyelinated nerve fibers by blocking voltage-gated
      potassium channels on the paranodal axon membranes in vitro. It enhances synaptic
      transmission by blocking repolarizing potassium currents thus increasing the size of the
      presynaptic action potential and thus increasing transmitter release. It has been shown in
      multiple sclerosis patients to improve walking capabilities as measured by the timed 25 feet
      walk test by more than 20% in approximately 34% of subjects. Prolonged-release fampridine
      also has measurable effects on motor evoked potentials with transcranial magnetic stimulation
      in patients with multiple sclerosis and partial spinal cord injuries.

      The brain is a dynamic plastic organ that continuously adapts to the demands made upon it.
      Prolonged-release fampridine by improving nerve conduction in multiple sclerosis patients has
      the potential to enhance brain plasticity. Activities or processes that call upon such
      plasticity could therefore also benefit from prolonged-release fampridine. Active motor
      training when combined with prolonged-release fampridine in patients with multiple sclerosis
      could therefore show a larger and more sustained measurable clinical benefit than with active
      motor training alone.

      Prolonged-release fampridine by enhancing brain plasticity through improved nerve conduction
      in the central nervous system can potentiate the clinical benefits of active motor training
      as measured via assessments of walking capabilities and quality of life in subjects with
      multiple sclerosis of varying severity.
