      and post measures of symptoms, function, and QOL by administering the PACT intervention. The
      first ten participants in the control group will receive usual care. The next 10 participants
      will receive the PACT intervention. Each participant in the intervention group will be cared
      by a collaborative, multidisciplinary, integrated team including RNs, OTs and PTs.
