    
      Comorbid depression in people with chronic medical illness is a serious public health
      concern. Depressive disorders lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and poorer outcomes in
      ischemic heart disease, a leading cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). Evidence suggests
      that a relationship exists between depression and CHF; studies that examine the way CHF is
      affected by depression treatments are needed.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo
      for 12 weeks. Assessments will be made at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Participants who do
      not respond to their treatment will have their medication dose adjusted following assessment.
      Interviews and rating scales will be used to assess depressive symptoms, cognitive status,
      psychiatric comorbidity, daily and chronic stress, and social support. A follow-up visit will
      take place 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after study completion.
