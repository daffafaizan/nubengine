      displacement of subretinal hemorrhage (SRH) in the macula. A geometrical analysis of the
      forces that act upon a SRH in the presence of an intraocular gas bubble was analyzed and it
      was concluded that the displacement was due to the effect of gravity on the SRH immersed in
      gas. This was followed by a prospective trial of positions of gaze and volumes of gas
      calculated to be optimum for displacement. The eyes of consecutive patients with SRH in the
      macula will had an intravitreal injection of pure perfluorocarbon gas sufficient to provide a
      40% bubble after expansion. The patients are instructed to gaze down 40° or 60° below the
      horizontal depending on the volume of gas for 20 minutes every hour. The SRH is displaced
      rapidly in the first week. Visual acuity usually improves but recovery can be limited by the
      presence of sub pigment epithelial hemorrhage, exudate or proliferation. A vector of the
      gravity force tangential to the sclera is the largest force acting to displace a subretinal
      hemorrhage within a gas bubble. 79% of the vertical gravity component is obtained at gaze 40°
      below the horizontal and requires volumes of intraocular gas not requiring prior removal of
      vitreous. Face down positioning in common practice has been an error and succeeds only if the
      patient has been non compliant.
