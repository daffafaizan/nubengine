      many human diseases. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if microRNA expression
      is changed in untreated and glatiramer acetate-treated patients with multiple sclerosis. The
      expression of microRNA will be analysed in cell subsets separated from peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells.
