      urine. Therefore, another way to remove waste from the body is needed to hopefully allow time
      for the kidneys to heal. One method of removing waste from the body is called Continuous
      Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) or variations of that therapy. This study will evaluate the
      safety of the device while it is connected to the CRRT tubing for up to 7 days. Patients will
      be followed up until day 60 following the treatment.
