    
      An International Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of LAU-7b administered once-daily for 6 months for the treatment of CF.
      All patients will remain on their CF standard-of-care treatments over the trial duration.

      The goal for the treatment with LAU-7b in CF is to preserve lung function by reducing the
      persistent inflammation in the lung and to improve its capacity to defend against resistant
      bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      The treatment regimen will consist of 6 consecutive "dosing cycles" of 21 days each, spaced
      by study drug-free periods of 7 days. A total of 136 eligible adult patients with CF will be
      randomized to receive 300 mg LAU-7b or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The participation in the study
      will last about 7 months.
