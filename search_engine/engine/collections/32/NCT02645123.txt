      other physiotherapy interventions (stretching, TENS application and Swedish type massage) and
      sham treatment in a group of chronic low back pain patients. The outcome measures included
      three dimensional gait analysis (kinetic and kinematic data) as well as clinical indicators
      (numerical pain rating scale, Oswestry disability index, Roland-Moris Disability
      questionnaire).
