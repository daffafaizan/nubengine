      month 6 post-transplant, at the time of protocol renal biopsy. After verifying the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, informed consent will be obtained. Patients with urinary PECs will be
      randomized to 80 mg of valsartan vs. placebo (sample size calculated for a superiority study,
      45 patients per group). Patients without PECs in urine will be followed according to usual
      clinical practice. The follow-up will be up to 2 years post-transplant. At baseline (6 m
      post-transplant) and at 2 years the GFR will be measured by means of iohexol clearance (main
      variable) and, in addition, we will analyze safety variables such as patient and graft
      survival and RAGIs. By means of morphometry techniques on renal biopsy and by measuring the
      renal cortical volume by high resolution CT, the number of glomeruli will be determined,
      which in turn, will allow to calculate the SN-GFR. Finally, in 5 patients per study group and
      in 5 controls, PECs of renal tissue will be isolated by means of laser microdissection
      techniques to perform single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to assess the molecular pathways
      involved in the glomerular damage and repair process and how the RAAS blockade modifies such
      molecular pathways.
