      Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model. Drops of increasing concentration of a
      solubilized allergen will be instilled in both eyes until a positive reaction occurred. The
      test will be repeated to confirm the allergic reaction. Participants with confirmed reactions
      will be administered the test article (Day 0) and undergo a CAC 24 hours post-instillation
      (Day 1). On Day 14, participants will be administered the test article and undergo an
      additional CAC.
