        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 in
           patients with CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of correlating immunologic parameters and
           immunogenicity, of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 IV over 30 minutes 3 times a week for 2 weeks.
      Treatment may continue for 2 additional weeks in the absence of anti-HeFi-1 response.
      Responding patients may continue treatment at monthly intervals for one year.

      Cohorts of 3-4 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 4 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
