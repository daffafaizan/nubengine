      significantly. It now is feasible and economical to sequence the exome (known genes) or the
      entire genome. This technological advance can be applied to identifying genetic causes of
      rare diseases where traditional methods such as mapping frequently failed due to insufficient
      number of cases. These cases often present themselves in the context of other NICHD research
      protocols, such as teaching protocols, where it would not be efficient for the individual
      investigators to write a new protocol. It will also serve to standardize the consent document
      across NICHD for investigators that do not include exomic/genomic sequencing in their own
      protocol.
