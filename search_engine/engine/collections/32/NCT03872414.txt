      affective processing and attention contribute to these motivational and emotional changes
      with age.

      Based on these theoretical considerations as well as the previous study's data, the proposed
      research will apply well-tested emotion processing and attention paradigms to address the
      pivotal question of whether brain activity can be modulated in healthy aging and PD (in the
      substudy) via contingent rt-fMRI neurofeedback and whether this neuroregulatory modulation
      increases emotion processing and cognitive performance.
