      efficacy and safety of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) given on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle
      in subjects with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Subjects will be enrolled
      into cohorts by RAS mutation status (wildtype or mutated). Stage 1 in a given cohort will
      enroll 15 subjects in the Intention to Treat population and if more than 8 subjects have
      Progression Free Survival at the 8 week assessment, then Stage 2 will open in the respective
      cohort. Stage 2 will enroll an additional 28 subjects for a total of 43 subjects in each
      cohort. The study will be positive if more than 26 subjects with Progression Free Survival at
      the 8 week assessment are observed in 43 subjects per cohort. Interim analysis after Stage 1
      did not meet protocol defined criteria to proceed to Stage 2. Patients currently enrolled
      will be followed for Progression Free Survival and until 28 days after last dose, secondary
      endpoints including overall survival will not be followed
