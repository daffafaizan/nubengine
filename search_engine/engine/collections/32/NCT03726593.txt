      development are threatened by multidrug resistant (MDR) malaria parasites, widely prevalent
      in Cambodia. Without effective interventions, MDR malaria can pose a substantial public
      health threat in the years to come. Therefore, accurate, timely and relevant data on
      antimalarial drug resistance is of critical importance. Prompt, effective and well-tolerated
      treatment remains one of the cornerstones in the malaria case management. Recent malaria
      outbreak in Thailand and rise of malaria cases observed in Cambodia in 2017 has brought to
      the forefront the urgency with which new drug candidates and new combination drug treatments
      must be identified; otherwise, patients may be left with ineffective treatments. Lack of
      available alternatives has a potential to result in significant setback to the recent gains
      in malaria control and malaria elimination efforts. Innovative approaches to treatment
      proposed here, using current ACTs in combination with non-ACT drugs, such as
      atovaquone-proguanil, need to be investigated to assess drug tolerability and overall
      efficacy when used under combination treatment. By early investment in the studies of drugs
      such as pyronaridine-artesunate (ASPY), in combination with other antimalarials, and drug
      combinations proposed under this protocol, this study will try to provide the latest evidence
      on the interventions that are most likely to work, even in areas of MDR, such as Cambodia,
      and along the Cambodia-Thai border. It is hoped that our approach for using combination
      treatments will not only provide more effective treatments, but it might prolong the lifespan
      of the remaining antimalarials and delay the spread of MDR malaria to neighboring countries.
