      endocrinological pathology a mathematical model of the human menstrual cycle will be
      generated. The model will serve to predict development of the cycle including ovulation as
      well as to better understand the pathophysiology of endocrinological disorder. In a second
      step current treatment protocols for fertility treatment will be integrated into the model in
      order to optimize treatment outcome.
