      alone vs. antiandrogen withdrawal plus ketoconazole/hydrocortisone in patients with advanced
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Compare the response rate and duration of response to
      ketoconazole/hydrocortisone in patients treated with previous vs. simultaneous antiandrogen
      withdrawal. III. Evaluate the proportion of patients with circulating prostate cancer cells
      identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). IV. Determine whether
      rt-PCR positively correlates with response. V. Compare the likelihood of response to these
      regimens in patients whose prior hormonal therapy consisted of initial combined androgen
      blockage vs. initial monotherapy followed later by an antiandrogen. VI. Correlate adrenal
      androgen synthesis suppression, as measured by levels of various adrenal androgens, with
      response.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients who develop progressive disease on Arm I cross to Arm II.
      Arm I: Antiandrogen Withdrawal. Antiandrogen stopped. Arm II: Antiandrogen Withdrawal plus
      Adrenal Androgen Blockade. Antiandrogen stopped; plus Ketoconazole, KCZ; Hydrocortisone, HC,
      NSC-10483.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 250 patients will be entered over 3 years to attain 238
      eligible patients (including 25-40 minority patients).
