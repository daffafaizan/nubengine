      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 100-day transplant-related (non-relapse) mortality in patients with
           hematologic malignancies undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning comprising
           fludarabine phosphate, melphalan, and anti-thymocyte globulin followed by sequential
           umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) from 2 partially-matched unrelated donors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the 12-month transplant-related (non-relapse) mortality.

        -  To evaluate the days to neutrophil engraftment (ANC > 500/mm³).

        -  To evaluate the days to platelet engraftment (platelet count > 20,000/mm³
           [unsupported]).

        -  To evaluate the risk of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease.

        -  To evaluate percent donor chimerism contribution of each cord unit.

        -  To evaluate relapse rate.

        -  To evaluate disease-free and overall survival.

        -  To evaluate transfusion support needed for UCBT recipients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days
           -7 to -3, melphalan IV over 30-60 minutes on day -2, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over
           4-6 hours on days -4 to -2.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo two sequential umbilical cord blood transplantations
           on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously
           and then orally twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 60, followed by
           a taper until day 180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive mycophenolate
           mofetil IV or orally twice daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 30,
           followed by a taper until day 60 in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
