    
      This study is a phase Ib, single arm, open label clinical trial that will enroll patients
      with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) at moderate or high risk for poor
      outcome, defined as an NCCN-IPI score of 2 or higher. Each patient's disease will be
      biologically characterized at baseline. Enrolled patients will receive chemoimmunotherapy
      with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP),
      administered every 21 days for 6 cycles, which is the standard of care. In addition, all
      patients will receive the study drug, roflumilast, at the standard dose of 500 Î¼g by mouth
      once daily, throughout the 18-week treatment period.
