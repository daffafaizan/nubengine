      via non-invasive methods. In that sense, rTMS has been used to treat a variety of symptoms of
      stroke during last two decades. Especially, improvement of upper extremity function has been
      proved by many studies. However, it remains uncertain about the optimum amount of rTMS.

      The aim of this multicentric double blind study (randomized study) is to demonstrate the
      relationship between the amount of rTMS and the efficacy in the treatment of upper extremity
      motor deficits of stroke patients.

      Fifty-seven patients will be included with written consent. After randomization, the subject
      will receive 3 different amount of treatment rTMS-rTMS, Sham-rTMS, Sham-Sham) in double blind
      methods.
