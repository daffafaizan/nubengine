      received the same therapy.

      Part A: Ofatumumab + HDMP 2-4 cycles Part B: Ofatumumab + Alemtuzumab 1-6 cycles Part C:
      Maintenance with Ofatumumab + Alemtuzumab up to 2 years

      Between days 15-22 of Cycle 2 of Part A, participants are restaged. Participants who achieve
      nodal complete response discontinue Part A therapy and undergo minimal residual disease (MRD)
      assessment to guide the decision whether to go to Part B or Part C. The participants with
      persistent disease after 2 cycles of Part A therapy receive 2 more cycles of Part A therapy
      and then undergo another restaging as well as MRD assessment. At restaging, participants with
      minimal disease are eligible for Part C or allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) off
      protocol. The remaining participants receive Part B therapy. On Part B, restaging occurs at
      weeks 12 and 18. If MRD negative complete response (CR) status is achieved then therapy is
      discontinued and the primary endpoint evaluation occurs 2 months later. Otherwise with
      persistent disease Part B therapy continues up to 24 weeks and the primary endpoint
      evaluation occurs after Part B therapy is completed. Participants who achieve clinical
      complete response may receive Part C therapy or be observed while waiting SCT.
