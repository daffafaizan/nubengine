    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with a washout
      period of at least one week between each study period.

      After an initial screening visit, subjects entered a screening period of one to two weeks to
      ensure clinical stability without medication, which means absence of daily asthma symptoms.
      Eligible subjects were randomized into either the treatment portion of the trial, in which
      subjects received montelukast (4 mg or 5 mg) or matching placebo monotherapy in a randomized
      manner. During each treatment period, which lasted 2 weeks, the study medication was
      administered between 8:00 and 9:00 A.M. Short acting bronchodilator (for severe symptoms) was
      permitted during the study period but was withheld 24 hours prior to bronchodilator challenge
      test.

      Inclusion criteria will be mild persistent asthma children old enough to cooperate on
      performing pulmonary function testing, children with no respiratory symptoms 4 weeks prior to
      the beginning of the study. Exclusion criteria will be the following: respiratory symptoms
      including cough, wheezing, dyspnea, or shortness of breath, presence of acute or chronic
      upper respiratory infections, anatomical nasal disorders (ex, nasal polyps, septum deviation,
      etc.), previous or current specific immunotherapy, use of systemic corticosteroids, or
      admission or visit of the emergency department during the previous 4 weeks.
