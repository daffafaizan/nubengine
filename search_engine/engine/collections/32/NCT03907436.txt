    
      This is a 15 week study, including 10 weeks of active diet intervention. Each participant
      will receive one dietician counseling session at the beginning of the diet intervention
      period, two brief follow up dietician phone calls, and 10 diet education handouts delivered
      via email each week. The main objective of this protocol is to test whether MPN patients can
      adhere to a diet intervention. The investigators will measure adherence in both arms with
      patient reported diet recall every two weeks via internet surveys. As exploratory endpoints
      the investigators will measure changes in inflammatory markers, symptom burden, physical
      activity level, sleep, and gut microbiome in participants over the course of the study. If
      successful, the investigators plan to use this intervention in a larger trial to assess
      whether a diet intervention can effectively change symptom burden and inflammation in MPN
      patients.
