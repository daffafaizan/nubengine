    
      This first-in-human (FIH) study aims to identify a safe and tolerable dose of CC 99677 in
      support of phase 2 and/or phase 3 studies to be conducted in subjects with underlying
      inflammatory diseases.

      The study also aims to evaluate the PK of CC-99677 following administration of single and
      multiple oral doses, including assessment of the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC
      99677, and to assess the effect of CC 99677 on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in healthy
      adult subjects. The pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacogenomics (PG) of CC 99677 will also be
      assessed.

      Parts 1 and 2 are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and
      multiple ascending doses of CC 99677, respectively. The study has been designed to allow for
      safety, tolerability, and PK data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Part 1 will consist
      of escalating single doses in sequential groups. Approximately 48 subjects will be enrolled
      into 6 planned dose level cohorts. Part 2 will consist of escalating multiple doses
      (administered for 14 days) in sequential groups. In Part 2, approximately 40 subjects will be
      enrolled into 5 proposed dose level cohorts. Each dose level cohort will consist of 8
      subjects; 6 subjects will receive CC-99677 and 2 subjects will receive placebo according to
      the randomization schedule. In both Part 1 and Part 2, a higher daily dose level will not be
      initiated until adequate information on the preceding dose level is available and reviewed.
      Parts 1 and 2 will also employ strict dose escalation, individual subject, and intra cohort
      stopping criteria. Parts 1 and 2 will be placebo controlled to appropriately characterize the
      safety and tolerability of CC 99677.

      Part 3 is designed to characterize the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC 99677.
