      Despite years of research and innovations in technology, CLD remains highly prevalent, and
      thus it is a major concern for patients and practitioners. Studies suggest that meibomian
      gland dysfunction (MGD) is a cause of CLD. Several lipid-based artificial tears have recently
      been designed to address dry eye associated with MGD. In this study, the investigators
      examine if the benefits of lipid based artificial tears extend to improving contact lens
      comfort. Studies have demonstrated some usefulness of non-lipid based tear supplements in the
      management of contact lens discomfort. However, the relief was moderate and short-term. To
      date, no study has examined the impact of lipid based artificial tears on contact lens
      discomfort. In this study, the investigators will address this gap in knowledge.
