      Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia (CML) that has relapsed after conventional allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation (SCT), result in a high incidence of durable cytogenetic and molecular
      remissions. However, regular documented effects are the occurrence of secondary aplasia
      and/or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) including the post RIC situation. These effects are
      related to the high content of cytotoxic T cells in the DLI. Attempts to deplete CD8+ T-cells
      from DLI have been conducted with promising results but are not totally satisfactory.

      More recently the infusion of r-IL2 ex-vivo activated autologous or allogeneic NK-selected
      cells have been studied and the safety established in patients presenting various
      malignancies.

      Indeed, NK are thoroughly characterized in terms of genotype, phenotype and function.
      Although a handful of clinical-grade reagents and devices exist that give access to the human
      NK cell compartment, an immuno-selection device exists that allows for the selection of NK
      cells from various types of hematopoietic cell collections in view of clinical applications:
      the process produces CD3-/CD56+ cells in two steps and have been used in the previous
      experiences.
