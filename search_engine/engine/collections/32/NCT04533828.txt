      uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). Subjects also received
      the conventional clinical assessment for liver fibrosis, such as transient elastography (TE)
      and blood biochemical indexes (BBI) testing. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT,
      TE and BBI were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.
