      several neurological disorders and in normal controls. In Part 1 of this protocol, we
      describe our interest in using detailed MRI brain structure analysis to identify predicted
      specific neural structure atrophy in patients with selective amnesia and dementia and to
      attempt to associate the magnitude of atrophy in these neural structures with performance on
      selected memory tests. In Part 2 of this protocol, we outline our interest in utilizing newly
      developed MRI techniques to identify selective changes in local brain blood volume, blood
      flow, and other physiological parameters during functional stimulation. Recent developments
      permit recording of MRI signals that are indicative of regional cerebral blood volume and
      blood flow changes. Local changes in these physiological measures appear to topographically
      overlap with expected areas of functional brain activation. The advantage of this method over
      Positron Emission Tomography is the exquisite spatial resolution of MRI. This MRI technique
      is new and has had only limited use so far. The studies in Part 2 of this protocol should
      help develop the method and begin to answer fundamental biological and functional questions
      about the representation and activation of cognitive, motor, and sensory functions.
