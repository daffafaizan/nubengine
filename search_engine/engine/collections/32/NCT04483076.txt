    
      RESONANCE-II trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study
      which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different cycles of SOX as
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. All patients with
      eligibility will be registered, pre-enrolled and receive three cycles of SOX. Then, tumor
      response evaluation will be carried out according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Those who achieve stable disease (SD) or progressive disease
      (PD)will be excluded. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will
      be enrolled and assigned into either group A (six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      SOX) for another three cycles of SOX followed by D2 surgery and group B (three cycles of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SOX) for D2 surgery. The primary endpoint is the rate of
      pathological complete response (pCR%) and the secondary endpoints are R0 resection rate,
      three-year disease-free survival (3-y DFS), five-year overall survival (5-y OS) and safety.
