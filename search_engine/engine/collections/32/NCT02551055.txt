      people who have locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma. This study will look at the dose-limiting toxicity and response to treatment
      in participants who take MLN1117 in combination with TAK-659, alisertib, paclitaxel, or
      docetaxel.

      The study will enroll 32 participants in the dose escalation phase (Part 1) and 118
      participants in the dose expansion phase (Part 2). Participants will be assigned to 1 of the
      7 treatment groups:

        -  MLN1117 300 mg+Alisertib

        -  MLN1117 600 mg+Alisertib

        -  MLN1117 300 mg+Paclitaxel

        -  MLN1117 600 mg+Paclitaxel

        -  MLN1117 300 mg+TAK-659

        -  MLN1117 200 mg+Docetaxel

        -  MLN1117 300 mg+Docetaxel

      In Part 1, the dose of MLN1117 will be increased step by step. All participants will be asked
      to take tablets of MLN1117 for 3 days on and 4 days off per week in 28-day treatment cycles
      or 21-day treatment cycles when given in combination with the other companion drugs.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain and United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 10 months for Part 1 and 24 months for Part 2. Participants will
      make multiple visits to the clinic, and be contacted by telephone, e-mail or mail every 12
      weeks for up to 6 months or 1 year after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
