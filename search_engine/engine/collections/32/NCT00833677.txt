      immigrant Chinese patients' skills and mastery in diabetes management by identifying and
      diminishing non-constructive coping responses to difficult social situations, while expanding
      the repertoire of positive coping responses and disease management behaviors. The CCST
      comprises a series of six small-group sessions focused on the topics of social problem
      solving, communication skills, cognitive behavior modification and conflict resolution. It
      also includes a review of basic diabetes management information.
