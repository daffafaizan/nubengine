      surgery. Skin-grafting is the main therapy. Bolster dressings are traditionally applied to
      secure the graft to the wound bed, however, there is some evidence to show that irregularly
      contoured recipient sites, exuding wounds, poorly healing areas, and the presence of shear
      stress significantly reduce the success rate of skin-grafting with traditional bolster
      dressings, increasing morbidity, pain, hospital stay, and cost. Negative pressure wound
      therapy (NPWT) has been advocated as a potential solution to some of these issues. the
      application of NPWT to skin-grafting may promote blood flow and microcirculation to the graft
      bed, reduction of edema, exudates, and hematomas, and result in significant qualitative
      improvement in split skin graft take. To further test the healing rate and safety of this new
      method, the investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare this
      method with traditional bolster dressings application in skin-grafting.
