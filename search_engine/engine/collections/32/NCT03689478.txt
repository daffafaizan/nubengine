      over 200 sites in Europe. It is an aluminum heat exchanger that allows hyperthermic
      intravesical chemotherapy (HIVEC) at 43Â±0.2 degrees for patients with bladder cancer.
      Previous studies showed that the Combat BRS could warm the entire bladder wall to the target
      temperature with excellent safety parameters. The flow rates and pressure levels are kept low
      during the HIVEC treatment. A previous study has demonstrated the safety and tolerability of
      HIVEC as a maintenance therapy for patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),
      and two randomized controlled trials are underway to demonstrate its efficacy in terms of
      disease recurrence and progression. On the other hand, the use of HIVEC immediately following
      transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) remains largely unexplored. It is the
      investigators' current practice to give intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) to all patients who
      have endoscopically NMIBC with complete resection, provided that there are no bladder
      perforations being noted. In this study, the investigators shall evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of hyperthermia in addition to the current practice of intravesical MMC alone
      immediately following TURBT.
