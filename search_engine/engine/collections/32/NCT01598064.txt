      control and experimental arms. They will be given GK#10 or placebo for 8 weeks. Clinical
      parameters, such as liver function, renal function, and general conditions will be evaluated
      at specific time points, week 0, 5, 9, and 13 weeks. Primary outcome measurement will be
      survival and major complications analysis, and secondary outcome measurement will be liver
      function evaluation.

      The investigators anticipate providing our sponsor with useful results about GK#10. The
      investigators will make clear the impacts from individual strains, the investigators will
      validate our speculation that probiotics do no harm to cirrhotic patients with portal
      hypertension, even be beneficial to them. If the investigators can validate the anticipation,
      patients can enjoy benefits from our study, and the probiotics may have the potential to sell
      to the patients in the world.
