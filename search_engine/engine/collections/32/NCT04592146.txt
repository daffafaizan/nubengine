      POSITIVE technological ecosystem improves frailty in at least 1 point in Fried's Criteria and
      5 points in FTS-5 during a 6-month follow-up period.

      This objective will be investigated through a multi-centre, non-inferiority, randomized,
      simple blind and prospective pilot study with an intervention lasting for 6 months. The study
      will be carried out in Spain, Sweden and Poland. 150 participants (50 per site) will be
      randomized into two groups. The control group will receive usual medical care. The
      intervention group will receive, in addition, the POSITIVE frailty home monitoring and
      intervention system.

      Both groups will be assessed with the same instruments. This assessment will be conducted at
      baseline (in the beginning of the trial period), at the middle (month 3) and at the end of
      the intervention (month 6).

      A stratified randomization technique will be applied in each of the study groups based on:
      age group (70-85,> 85), history of cognitive impairment, history of stroke to guarantee the
      existence of comparable groups. These factors have been significantly associated with frailty
      and pre-frailty status (stroke OR =3.11 (1.05-9.18), age, per 1-year OR = 1.14 (1.08-1.21);
      cognitive impairment OR = 8.37 (4.43-15.83)).
