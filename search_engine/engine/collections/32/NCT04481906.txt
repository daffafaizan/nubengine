      cystocele being the commonest type of POP. The side effects related to cystocele include
      voiding dysfunction, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, hydroureter, or
      hydronephrosis. The management for cystocele can be classified as non-surgical and surgical
      methods. Non-surgical methods comprise pelvic floor muscle exercise and vaginal pessaries,
      while surgical methods can be divided as conventional operations and operations applying mesh
      augmentation. Conventional surgeries for cystocele such as anterior colporrhapy have high
      surgical failure rates and complications including vaginal shortening or vaginal stenosis.
      Operations applying mesh augmentation are becoming the mainstream in the surgeries for
      cystocle. The Perigee System (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA), which has been
      approved by American FDA and Taiwan DOH in treating female cystocele, have promising
      short-term surgical outcomes. However, long-term reports incorporating both functional and
      morphological outcomes are lacking in the literatures. This study aimed to evaluate primarily
      the functional outcomes and secondly the morphological outcomes for women who had received
      standard managements for cystocele at mediate-term follow-up.
