      double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of IV administered elamipretide on a background of standard-of-care therapy for
      reduction of reperfusion injury in patients with first time acute, anterior wall STEMI.

      Patients were randomized to receive either an infusion of elamipretide at 0.05 mg/kg/hr or an
      identically appearing placebo administered as an IV infusion at 60 mL/hr. The infusion began
      at least 15 minutes but no more than 1 hour prior to the anticipated reperfusion event and
      continued through approximately 1 hour following re-establishment of blood flow through the
      culprit vessel.

      The reduction of reperfusion injury, or infarct size, was estimated using the area under the
      curve (AUC) of the serum creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme, as well as using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) performed on the Day 4±1 and on Day 30±7 (both MRI assessments measured infarct
      size and the ratio of infarct size to myocardial mass). The analyses of cardiac MRI data were
      performed for both the primary endpoint population and also in all patients who had adequate
      Day 4/Day 30 cardiac MRI studies.

      After completion of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting, patients
      received standard medical treatment.
