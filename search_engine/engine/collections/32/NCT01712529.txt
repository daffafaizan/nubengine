      SLE patients than in the general population and cardiovascular disease is an important cause
      of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Disturbances in
      endothelial function are implicated in its pathogenesis. Endothelial function also depends on
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that enhance angiogenesis, promote vascular repair and
      have potential as a marker of cardiovascular disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients
      have endothelial dysfunction and fewer EPCs. There are studies showing improvement of
      endothelial function and EPCs after physical exercise program in individuals with heart
      failure, diabetes and coronary arterial disease, but there isn't studies evaluating
      endothelial function and EPCs after.
