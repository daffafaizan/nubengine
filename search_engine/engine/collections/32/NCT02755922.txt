      patients were divided into: Study Group (SG): fracture reduction plus application of AMSCs,
      Control Group (CG): Same procedure without AMSCs. AMSCs were obtained from adipose tissue ,
      24 hrs before the procedure. Intensity and density were evaluated in normal bone and
      fractured bone, at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery using panoramic radiography and computed
      tomography. (CT)

      A total of 20 patients, 10 in each group were included. SG with a mean age of 31.2 ± 6.3
      years and CG 29.7 ± 7.2 years, all patients were male. Bone quality at week 4 SG 108.82 ± 3.4
      vs CG 93.92 ± 2.6 (p = 0.000) by panoramic radiography, SG 123 ± 4.53 vs CG 99.72 ± 5.72 (p =
      0.000) by CT. At week 12: SG 153.53±1.83 vs CG 101.81±4.83 (p= 0.000) by panoramic
      radiography, SG 165.4 ± 4.2 vs CG 112.05±2.1 (p= 0.000) by CT.

      The application of AMSCs presented at week 4 similar ossification values compared with normal
      bone and a 36.48 % higher ossification rate at week 12.
