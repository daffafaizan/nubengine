    
      This study is an integrated Phase I protocol divided into 2 parts.

      Part one: a single ascending dose study (6 LAS190792 dose levels) in 16 male subjects with
      mild asthma. LAS190792 will be administered (by the GenuairÂ® inhaler) under supervision at
      the study centre, according to the randomisation scheme. One dose level will be administered
      per week with 2 to 3 weeks between each dose level for the safety and pharmacokinetic data
      review.

      Part two: A 5-way , crossover, single dose study (of LAS190792 [two doses], indacaterol,
      tiotropium and placebo) in 40 male and non-childbearing potential women subjects with
      moderate to severe COPD. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 to 14 days. The aim is to ensure at least 30 subjects complete Part 2 of the study.
      The primary comparison for bronchodilation will be between LAS190792 doses and placebo. Other
      treatment comparisons (indacaterol or tiotropium vs placebo and LAS190792 vs indacaterol or
      tiotropium) will be considered additional.
