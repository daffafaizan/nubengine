      activity (microneurography); total forearm blood flow (high-resolution ultrasonography);
      skeletal muscle oxygenation (Near Infrared spectroscopy); plasma F2-isoprostanes; cardiac
      output (non-invasive impedance plethysmography); and blood pressure at baseline and after a)
      rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction alone for 3 minutes, b)
      rhythmic handgrip at the same intensity of exercise plus lower body negative pressure (LBNP)
      to activate sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) for 2 minutes, and c) during intravenous
      infusion of Angiotensin II at the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes at each dose.

      Each subject will then be randomized to receive 12 weeks of Nebivolol (Bystolic, 5-20 mg/day)
      or Metoprolol Succinate (Toprol XL, 100-300 mg/day), using a randomized crossover design.
      There will be a 2-week washout period between the two treatment periods. During drug
      treatment, blood pressure will be monitored every 4 weeks and the doses of Nebivolol and
      Metoprolol will be titrated to keep BP <140/90 mmHg. SNA, total forearm blood flow, skeletal
      muscle blood flow, muscle oxygenation, cardiac output, and blood pressure responses to
      Nebivolol will be compared to responses during Metoprolol in the same subjects.
