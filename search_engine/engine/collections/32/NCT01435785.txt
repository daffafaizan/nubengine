      anesthetized with plasma TCI of propofol based on Schnider model. After partial recovery from
      a bolus dose a remifentanil infusion was started and continued throughout surgery. All BIS
      and TCI data will be continuously record. Arterial blood samples for propofol assays were
      collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min post-induction, and at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min
      after stopping the infusion. A three compartment effect site model linked to a Sigmoidal Emax
      PD model, will be used to fit all the data simultaneously in NONMEM. Median performance
      errors(MDPE), and median absolute performance errors(MDAPE) were calculated to measure bias
      and accuracy of each model. Comparisons between models will be performed.
