      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study.
      Intravenous (IV) cannula had been set and The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information
      (APAIS) score questionnaire was filled by the subject. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and mean
      arterial pressure were recorded. Subjects were then randomized into two groups (music therapy
      and midazolam). In music therapy group, subjects listened to music using headphone attached
      to music player for 30 minutes. Music player has been filled with variety of slow beat songs
      (60 - 80 BPM), including instrumental, pop, jazz, classical, and so forth. In midazolam
      group, subjects was given intravenous midazolam 0,02 mg/kgBW injection without listening to
      music. After injection, subjects are allowed to rest or sleep for 30 minutes. After
      intervention, APAIS score was filled by subjects with blood pressure, pulse rate, and mean
      arterial pressure recorded again. Subjects then were moved to brachytherapy room.
