      Despite intensive research, the cause of preeclampsia has not been established. One of the
      theories is exaggeration of systemic inflammatory that might induce reactive oxygen species
      (ROS). It has been proposed that pregnancy will progress uneventfully if adequate antioxidant
      exists to buffer ROS. The ROS can induce endothelial dysfunction which leads to clinical
      symptoms of hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia. Several large randomized clinical
      trials of antioxidant supplementation have concluded that there were no benefits of
      antioxidants supplementation for prevention of preeclampsia. However, there is limited
      information about benefits of antioxidants in women with low antioxidant status at early
      gestation that deprived of the antioxidant most. Our aim, therefore, in this study was to
      assess whether early supplementation with milk enriched with vitamin and mineral, such as Cu,
      Zn, Mn, Fe, carotene, vitamin B6, B12, C, E, selenium, and calcium lowers the risk of
      preeclampsia in women with low antioxidant status at early gestation.
