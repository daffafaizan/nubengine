      evaluated in regards to possible improvements of cosmetic outcome, such as the use of
      different skin closure materials or whether subcutaneous fat suture closure leads to better
      results than non-closure. Another point to be considered is the skewness of the scar. Many
      surgeons make the skin incision based on their experience without prior measurement and
      drawing of an incision line. However, following a predefined incision line may reduce the
      rate of skew incisions. Therefore, this study aims to compare these two approaches to the
      skin incision.

      Participating women will be recruited at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the
      Medical University of Vienna. They will be included into the study after written informed
      consent and will be randomized into one of the two groups (drawing of an incision line prior
      to skin incision versus no drawing of an incision line) on the day of cesarean section.

      Skewness of the skin incision in each group will be assessed after cesarean section.
      Furthermore, it will be determined whether there are any differences in the incision length
      on both sides of an imaginary line from the umbilicus to the clitoris between these two
      techniques. Additionally, patient's perception of the scar before discharge from hospital
      will be assessed.
