      I. To estimate the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients treated with
      letermovir at 3 months after completion of alemtuzumab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability of letermovir in combination with alemtuzumab.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of letermovir for the prevention of clinically significant CMV
      disease.

      III. To estimate the progression free survival of patients in the study population.

      IV. To estimate the overall survival of patients in the study population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate mechanisms of antiviral resistance in letermovir prophylaxis failures.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning within 7 days of the first administration of standard alemtuzumab, patients receive
      letermovir orally (PO) (or intravenously [IV] over 1 hour if patient is unable to take PO for
      an extended period of time) daily on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 3
      months after the last dose of alemtuzumab in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
