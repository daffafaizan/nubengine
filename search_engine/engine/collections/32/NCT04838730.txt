      Single-center study.

      Duration of Subject participation:

      The primary endpoint will be achieved when the study subject has completed a 1-month
      follow-up after the implantation of the CleaRing device.

      Study Group:

      Each subject will be implanted with a CleaRing device together with SeeLens AF IOL in a
      single eye.

      Visits & Procedures Pre-operative visit: 0-3 months prior to the implantation procedure. The
      visit will include the subject's qualification assessment for inclusion/exclusion criteria as
      described above. Informed consent must be signed.

      Complete anamnesis will be taken including the subject's medical complaints, medical history,
      medication use, and ophthalmic examinations.

      Surgical procedure: Standard cataract extraction procedure will be performed under local
      anesthesia (at physician discretion) and CleaRing device will be implanted together with
      SeeLens AF IOL.

      Follow-up: All subjects will have regular follow-up visits at the following post-operative
      periods: 1 day, 7 days, and 1 month. All postoperative visits will include a complete
