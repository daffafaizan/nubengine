      day the investigators will examine the acute effects of a protein meal. Subjects will receive
      a mixture of alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey and/or casein, carbohydrates and amino acid stable
      isotopes to investigate protein and amino acid kinetics (assigned to alpha-lactalbumin or
      whey or casein group on test day 1, then switch on test day 2 and 3). The subjects will
      receive these stable isotopes by infusion in their blood and by oral intake (e.g.
      simultaneously with protein meal). For study purposes, blood will be drawn approx. 25 times
      during 8 hours on the test day, altogether about 100-120 ml of blood will be drawn on the
      test day.
