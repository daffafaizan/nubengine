      with an injection before insertion. This study aims to look at whether patients find using
      the local anaesthetic spray more acceptable or equally acceptable to using local anaesthetic
      injection. Both are currently licensed products for use as skin anaesthesia but the spray is
      potentially quicker and involves less injections. Some areas of sexual health are already
      offering this option but there isn't much evidence as to which patients find more acceptable.

      Patients in this study will be given a choice of anaesthetic asked to complete a short
      questionnaire, giving a pain score , on the pain rating scale of 0 to 10, ( being no pain to
      10 being extremely painful. ) In addition, they will be asked to give the reasons for their
      choice. The questionnaire will be anonymous.

      Average pain scores will be calculated between in group and compared.
