    
      The study objective is to determine in all-comers patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) under standardised treatment (including the BioMatrix family of
      drug-eluting stents and bivalirudin), whether treatment with 1 month of ticagrelor and
      aspirin followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy is superior with respect to the
      composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal new Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) compared
      to treatment with 12 months of standard dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) followed by aspirin
      monotherapy.

      The study design is an investigator-initiated, prospective randomised, multi-centre,
      multi-national, open-label trial to be conducted in approximately 60-80 interventional
      cardiology centres in Europe, North America, South America and Asia-Pacific. Patients will be
      randomised at a 1:1 ratio to study or reference treatment strategy.

      Randomisation will occur at the time of the index procedure prior to PCI. Subjects will be
      stratified according to centre and according to the clinical presentation (Stable Coronary
      Artery Disease (CAD) vs. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)).

      All patients will be followed for a period of 2 years.
