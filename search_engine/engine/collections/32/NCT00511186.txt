    
      RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY

      A previous clinical study conducted in centers in The Netherlands and Belgium have shown a
      substantial clinical benefit of AP treatment in patients with sepsis and associated acute
      renal failure (see Introduction above). The latter results require confirmation in a
      prospective study, as the current subject of this Protocol.

      Choice of Drugs

      The proposed study medication (AP) is identical to the study medication used in the previous
      clinical study in sepsis patients with single or multiple end-organ failure. Since there is
      no current proven treatment for these patients, the controls (as in previous studies) is
      placebo.

      Choice of patient population

      The aim is to enroll a maximum of 26 patients positive for sepsis with an APACHE score of ≥20
      and ≤28 (determined within 24 hours of entry), and who will be analyzed on an intention to
      treat (ITT) basis.
