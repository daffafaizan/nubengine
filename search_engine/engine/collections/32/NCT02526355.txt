      child's development. There are a number of efficient treatments for postnatal depression
      including antidepressant medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions.
      Tele-health and mobile health is a novel and emerging field in psychiatric and psychological
      care and treatment of mental health difficulties, it involves the use of telecommunications
      to provide health care, support and intervention from a distance.

      The proposed study will test the efficacy of an innovative, affordable mobile based
      intervention program that can help mothers with postnatal depression in low resource
      countries such as Pakistan.

      Participants will be recruited from maternal and child care centres in Karachi, Pakistan and
      those participants (n = 204) meeting inclusion criteria of the study will be randomized into
      one of the 2 treatment arms, i.e., intervention or control, after completion of baseline
      assessment. Intervention will be comprised of LTP Plus and will be delivered through text
      messages. Momentary Sampling assessment and Momentary Psychological intervention will be part
      of this study. Participants will be assessed again after completion of intervention (i.e.,
      after 12 weeks) and then 3 months post intervention.
