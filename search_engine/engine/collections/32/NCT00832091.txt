      safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Thymosin Beta 4 (Tβ4), administered topically, in
      patients with Venous Stasis (VS) ulcers. VS ulcers develop on the ankle or lower leg in
      patients with chronic vascular disease. In these patients, blood flow in the lower
      extremities is impaired, leading to edema (swelling) and mild redness and scaling of the skin
      that gradually progress to ulceration. Tβ4 is a synthetically-produced copy of a naturally
      occurring 43 amino acid peptide that has wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties and
      can up-regulate the expression of laminin-5.
