      assessment based on the Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire, EF assessment based on SPECT
      MUGA, cardiopulmonary exam to evaluate Vo2 max and assessment of left ventricular end
      diastolic and systolic dimensions based on 2D echo and labs drawn to assess circulating
      biomarkers. Patients will than be randomized into the control population where they will
      receive a placebo medication vs. the study population who will receive pentoxiphylline 400mg
      three times daily for 6 months. Patients will also have a one and three month clinic visit to
      assess for any potential change in symptoms and to assess medication compliance. Patients
      will then have a 6 month follow-up with repeat physical exam, Heart Failure status assessment
      based on the Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire, EF assessment based on SPECT MUGA,
      cardiopulmonary exam to assess Vo2 Max and assessment of left ventricular end diastolic and
      systolic dimensions based on 2D echo and labs drawn to assess circulating biomarkers.
