      several limitations. The assessment items are not individually adjusted to each patient and
      his/her subjective symptoms, the collected data is rarely used in clinical practice, and
      decision-support for the physician is not possible.

      Although the body of evidence is accumulating regarding the benefits of computerised symptom
      assessment in cancer patients, there is still insufficient knowledge of the impact of
      computerised assessment tools on the management of cancer pain and other cancer related
      symptoms.

      The COMBAT study aims to investigate if a computer based assessment of cancer related
      symptoms, and a computerized decision support can improve treatment of pain and other
      symptoms in cancer patients.

      This is an open, comparative study with a sequential design with two consecutive study
      periods, the non-intervention period and the intervention period.

      The computer-based clinical decision support system will utilize the following data to
      generate one or several treatment options:

        1. Data from self assessment of cancer related symptoms

        2. Data from relevant variables reported by the physician

        3. Revisited guidelines on treatment of cancer pain
