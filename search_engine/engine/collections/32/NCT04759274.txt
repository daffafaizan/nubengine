    
      Study Population: 30 subjects with signs of hypervolemia and either nephrotic syndrome or
      chronic kidney disease 4 to 5.

      Study Intervention: This is a nonrandomized, uncontrolled trial. The Diuretic Tuner mobile
      device application will be deployed in the care of hypervolemic subjects as defined in the
      study population. The Diuretic Tuner will integrate each subject's estimated dry weight and
      starting diuretic dose (both defined by healthcare provider) with daily weights and blood
      pressures to provide individualized guidance to the subject in day-to-day adjustments to his
      or her diuretic regimen. In addition, the application will generate a diary of daily weights,
      blood pressures, fluid intake, and medication compliance. There will be no control arm as
      this first phase is to test feasibility/safety.

      Study Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of interest will focus on the achievement of the
      provider-defined estimated dry weight (both the time to achieving this target as well as the
      subsequent stability in weights around this target). Secondary outcomes of interest include
      safety metrics (3-month hospitalization rates, rates of hypokalemia, and rates of acute
      kidney injury) and tool usability (assessed through surveys evaluating ease of comprehension
      and satisfaction).
