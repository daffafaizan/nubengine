      and Commitment Therapy in a randomized controlled trial among patients with MDD in routine
      clinical practice. Further, the study will investigate whether each specific treatment
      approach is mediated by its proposed theoretical mechanism. Patients have to meet diagnostic
      criteria for nonpsychotic MDD as determined by the Structured Interview for DSM-IV. Each
      client will receive either Cognitive Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy that will
      last between 16 to 20 sessions. Based on previous results, it is expected that both treatment
      forms will prove beneficial for the patients.
