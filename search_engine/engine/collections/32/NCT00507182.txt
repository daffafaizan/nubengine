      lead to cancer. These lesions may need to be removed. Researchers are looking for a practical
      way to tell early on whether these lesions are cancer or may become cancer. This study will
      test a technique called fluorescence spectroscopy, which is under research in this study.

      Each patient may have 1 to 5 lesions and several normal-looking areas inside the mouth
      exposed to a beam of light. The exposed tissues may emit very small amounts of light called
      fluorescence. This light is not seen by the eye but is detected by a computer. The small
      areas exposed to the light beam may then be removed.

      The patients who need surgery may have the small tested areas removed when the lesions are
      surgically removed. A small sample from a normal-looking area may also be removed during
      surgery. Patients who do not need surgery may simply have small samples taken from the
      lesions and a normal-looking area in the clinic rather than in the operating room. The
      tissues will be looked at under a microscope to see whether they are cancerous. These results
      will be compared with the spectroscopy results.

      If you are scheduled to participate in another MD Anderson study, Protocol 2008-0137
      Entitled, "Phase Ib Study of Erlotinib Prior to Surgery in Patients with Head and Neck
      Cancer" (Study Chair: Dr. William William), some of your collected tissue samples may be
      shared with Dr. William for use on 2008-0137.

      This is an investigational study. About 395 patients will be consented and screened for this
      study, with about 381 to take full part in this study. All will be treated at MD Anderson.
