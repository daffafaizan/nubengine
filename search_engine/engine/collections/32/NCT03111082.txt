      paralysis with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation using the StimPod NMS450 accelerometer set to
      30 mA. Any patients who have residual paralysis will be assessed Q10 minutes until the TOF
      ratio is ≥0.9. The time to achieve a TOF ratio ≥0.9 will be recorded. Any adverse events
      (e.g., hypoxia, reintubation, aspiration) that arise during the patient's PACU stay will be
      documented.
