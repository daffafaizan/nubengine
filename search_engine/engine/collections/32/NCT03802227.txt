    
      This study is a single-center study in which approximately 24 subjects will be randomized to
      one of two treatment groups. Subjects will enter a screening period between Day -28 and Day
      -2. Upon meeting all criteria for enrollment, on Day -1 subjects will enter the clinical
      research study unit (CRSU) for an overnight confinement. On Day 1, subjects will undergo a
      baseline MRI and will then be randomized to NKTR-181 or oxycodone immediate release (IR).
      Once randomized, subjects will receive a single dose of study drug (NKTR-181 or oxycodone IR)
      and matched alternate-treatment placebo. Subjects will undergo a series of three fMRIs
      (functional magnetic resonance imaging) post dose (at hours 1, 2, and 4). At post-dose hours
      0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, pupillometry will be performed and PK blood samples will be
      drawn. Following a 14- to 17-day safety follow-up period, subjects will return to the
      research facility clinic for the End of Study (EOS) visit (Day 16-19).
