    
      The overall goal of this study is to examine and better understand adolescent and young adult
      perceptions, visual attention, use intentions and purchasing behaviors among users and
      non-users of cigarillos.

      Aim 1 of this study is exploratory and will consist of an online survey. Findings from Aim 1
      will inform the questions asked about advertising and product use in Aim 2 and 3. Both Aim 2
      and 3 are randomized sections.

      Participants in Aim 2 are either tobacco users or non-users. Participants will be asked to
      view a series of tobacco related images. The sequence of those images is randomized. In Aim
      3, participants will be randomized in terms of the options they are presented within the
      Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (i.e. which tobacco items they can purchase and at what
      price).
