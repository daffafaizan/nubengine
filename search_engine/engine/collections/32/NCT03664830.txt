      cell disease (SCD) patients but its use is significantly limited by the lack of compatible
      donors. Gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation
      represents an alternative approach but requires the collection of significant numbers of
      cells. Severe adverse events have been observed in SCD patients after mobilization using the
      standard agent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and bone marrow harvesting is
      also associated with side effects. The use of a single administration of plerixafor has been
      suggested as an alternative mobilization strategy in SCD but may not mobilize sufficient
      number of HSC. In this study, our primary objective is to assess if up to two injections of
      plerixafor (starting dose level: 240 Âµg/kg/dose) are safe in SCD patients and can recruit
      enough blood stem cells needed for future gene therapy.
