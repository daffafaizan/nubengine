      beat-to-beat measurement of CI by analysis of the arterial blood pressure tracing. By using
      the autocalibration mode this software calculates the individual aortic compliance and
      systemic vascular resistance by taking patient data like age, height, weight and gender into
      account. After estimation of beat-to-beat stroke volume, a subsequent multiplication by the
      heart rate delivers pulse contour cardiac index. Furthermore, this device offers the
      opportunity for external calibration by a reference technique, e.g. pulmonary or
      transpulmonary thermodilution.

      The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy and trending ability of
      autocalibrated semi-invasive CI by a new arterial waveform analysis compared with
      transpulmonary thermodilution before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
