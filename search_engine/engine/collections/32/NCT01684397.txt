        -  I. To determine the safe phase II dose of this novel regimen. (Phase I)

        -  II. To determine the median progression free survival (PFS) from this novel regimen.
           (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the proposed regimen. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the
      response rate. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib (pazopanib
      hydrochloride). (Phase I) IV. To evaluate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      levels and myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) levels at various time points and correlate
      with response. (Phase I) V. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of this new regimen. (Phase
      II) VI. To evaluate the VEGF levels, interleukin (IL)-8 levels and MDSC levels at various
      time points and correlate with outcome. (Phase II) VII. To evaluate the PFS rate at 12
      months. (Phase II) VIII. To evaluate overall survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-28, and bevacizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 36 and 50. Courses repeat every 70 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and Phase II
      patients are followed up by telephone every 12 months
