      fibrillation (AF) is stroke. Echocardiographic studies suggest that the predominant source of
      stroke in AF is the left atrial appendage (LAA). At present, there are no sufficiently
      powered trials to answer whether removal of the LAA can reduce the risk of systemic embolic
      events.

      LAAOS pilot study will recruit 50 participants undergoing open-heart surgery in 5 Canadian
      academic cardiac surgery centers. The study will inform the feasibility of conducting a large
      RCT and will provide information of the efficacy and safety of appendage occlusion technique.
      From this study we envision a a large international randomized controlled trial (LAAOS II) to
      determine the impact of left atrial appendage occlusion on the composite outcome of stroke
      and non-central nervous system systemic embolic events in at risk patients with atrial
      fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery.
