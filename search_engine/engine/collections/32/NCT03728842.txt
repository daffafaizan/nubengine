    
      Spontaneous regression in patients with metastatic cancer is an incredibly rare event. It has
      been described after infection in cancer patients and also rarely in patients with renal cell
      cancer (usually after resection of the renal primary) and, less commonly, in patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      Primary Objective To collect peripheral blood from patients with metastatic melanoma and
      renal cell cancer and spontaneous regression for studies of immune response and other
      studies.

      Secondary Objective To collect clinical data from subjects registered to this study. Clinical
      data collection will include demographics and cancer characteristics, history and treatment.
