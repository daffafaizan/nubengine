    
      Target population:

      Patients admitted to the OSU Heart Hospital with ADHF routinely undergo a cardiorespiratory
      sleep study to identify OSA. Patients with ADHF who are newly diagnosed with OSA during the
      same hospital stay are eligible for this study.

      Enrollment:

      Given the presence of significant previously unrecognized OSA in 62% of patients hospitalized
      with ADHF, we expect to need to screen 270 patient volunteers to recruit 170 patients with
      OSA.

      Eligibility for randomization: The criteria for ADHF is admission diagnosis of heart failure;
      a chief complaint of dyspnea; and ejection fraction of 45% or less. Additionally, elevated
      left ventricular pressure as indicated by at least one sign and one symptom of volume
      overload (pedal edema, crackles, consistent chest X-ray, increased left ventricular
      end-diastolic diameter, or elevated BNP level) is required [46].
