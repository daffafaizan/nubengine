      period of time in both ears simultaneously, and in just one ear, with periodic lab-based
      re-evaluation. Each field trial will continue until asymptotic performance is identified (up
      to a maximum of 12 weeks). You will return to the lab for assessment every 2 weeks. During
      each visit, speech perception and subjective listening effort will be assessed. Depending
      upon the specific field trial, the investigators also will complete measures of cognitive
      load (via dual-task paradigms), spatial release from masking, and localization ability during
      each lab visit.
