      currently depressed, and randomly assign them to 20 weeks of treatment with IPSRT plus
      placebo (IPSRT-PLA) (N=80) or IPSRT plus quetiapine (IPSRT-QUE) (N=80). We will evaluate
      potential moderators of response to treatment including circadian phase preference,
      intercurrent hypomanic symptoms during the index depressive episode, clinical and demographic
      factors (i.e, number of previous episodes, family history of mood disorders), and prior
      treatment response to antidepressant medications.
