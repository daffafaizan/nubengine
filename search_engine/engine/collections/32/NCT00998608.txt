      schizophrenia. Surveys have shown that antipsychotic drug combinations are frequently
      prescribed, yet few clinical studies have examined this practice. Risperidone, an atypical
      antipsychotics, has low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) but with high cost compared
      to haloperidol. It has been reported that a relatively low daily dose of haloperidol at which
      individual patients develop slightly increase in EPS and has neurocognitive benefits as
      risperidone. The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the
      fixed-dosed risperidone and risperidone combined with haloperidol in the treatment of acute
      psychotic exacerbations of schizophrenia.In this 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study,
      patients with schizophrenic disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis) are randomly assigned to risperidone
      (4 mg/d) or risperidone (2 mg/d) plus haloperidol (2 mg/d). The hypothesis is that the two
      treatment groups have the similar efficacy and safety, but different cost. The primary
      efficacy measure is change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      total scores; secondary outcomes include Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), the
      Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenics (CDSS), subject-reported outcomes via the Short
      Form-36 (SF-36), auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), and cognitive and social functioning.
      Safety assessments include the change from baseline on Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS),
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), and UKU
      Side-effects Rating Scale (UKU), and the change from baseline in prolactin levels, body
      weight, AC glucose level, lipid panel (cholesterol, high density lipid protein [HDL], low
      density lipid protein [LDL], and triglyceride [TG])
