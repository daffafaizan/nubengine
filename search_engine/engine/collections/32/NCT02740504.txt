      due to respiration. The reference device, the SOMNOScreen, uses chest effort bands. The
      Reassure is non-contact and so more comfortable and convenient for quick RR measurement, in a
      similar way that an Infra-Red thermometer is compared to a traditional under-the-tongue
      mercury thermometer.

      The aim is to explore the variations in the human body that could have an effect on the radio
      reflection from the human torso, and thus affect the potential detection and accuracy of
      breathing rate. Factors that could affect non-contact RF performance are:

        -  High Body Mass Index (BMI) could potentially reduce the chest wall movement during
           breathing, or alter the nature of the breathing.

        -  Elderly, thin skin (ie pensioner with low BMI) may have less RF reflection.

        -  Female breast tissue may have an effect on detection or accuracy.

      This was tested at a number of distances from the non-contact sensor and also with the
      subject having a thick comforter (duvet) laid across them.

      The test conditions were

        -  Distances of 0.5 m, 1.0m and 1.5m between the subject and the RF sensor.

        -  Additional test condition of comforter (duvet) on the subject when the distance from
           subject to sensor is 1.0 m.

        -  Each test condition carried out twice.

      The use of the comforter in one test condition is to confirm that the RR measurement by the
      Reassure is unaffected by the thickness of clothing or blankets being worn.
