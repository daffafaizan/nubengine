      not used during the surgical procedure as an image guided system.

      Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, obtained as standard of care, will be used to
      generate the image guided liver system 3D liver surface images used during the study.

      During the laparoscopic procedure, the Pathfinder device will be inserted through the
      standard laparoscopic ports (5mm or 10mm) being used for the staging procedure.

      A total study population will include 20 subjects that complete the laparoscopic procedure
      scheduled.
