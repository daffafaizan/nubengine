      single tertiary urban teaching University Uro-gynecological Department. 65 patients affected
      by stress or mixed urinary incontinence (stress component clinically predominant), defined
      according to International Continence Society guidelines, associated or not with urethral
      hypermobility underwent surgery which consisted of a fusion-welded, non-woven, non-knitted
      polypropylene tape (Obtape® Mentor-Porges). Preoperative MUCP and VLPP, stratified as ≤ or >
      40 cmH20 and ≤ or > 60 cmH2O respectively, were separately or in combination correlated with
      primary (continence status: dry or wet) and secondary outcome variables (QoL questionnaires).
