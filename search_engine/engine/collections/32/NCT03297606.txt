      genetic makeup of tumors that might be responsible for their malignant behavior such as
      uncontrolled growth and spread. Some of these changes can be 'druggable', i.e. there may be
      cancer medicines that can specifically act on the tumour's genetic abnormality. Several
      cancer centers and programs have initiated this type of molecular profiling across Canada,
      with the goal to identify 'druggable' changes in tumors to find matching therapy for
      patients. These include initiatives in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The CAnadian
      Profiling and Targeted agent Utilization tRial (CAPTUR) will test the activity of a list of
      commercially available targeted agents in patients who have undergone tumor profiling and
      have 'druggable' changes identified in their cancers.
