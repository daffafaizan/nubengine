      in infants who are small for gestational age. There have been several theories to the
      mechanism underlying thrombocytopenia in these groups of patients. One mechanism suggests
      that thrombocytopenia in these populations may be secondary to underproduction of platelets.
      Other studies have implied that low platelet levels may be due to endothelial activation
      causing platelet consumption. This study is being performed to help determine the mechanism
      causing thrombocytopenia in infants born to mothers with preeclampsia and comparing it to the
      mechanism of thrombocytopenia in infants who are small for gestational age.
