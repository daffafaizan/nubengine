      postoperative analgesia is best after total hip replacement. The conventional analgesia
      includes both intrathecal morphine at surgery and Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) with
      morphine in the first 48 hours after surgery. This will be compared with two experimental
      groups which will receive either intrathecal morphine and PCA with placebo or intrathecal
      placebo and PCA with morphine. Escape medication with intramuscular morphine is available in
      all groups. A total of 120 patients will be randomized.

      VAS- score at rest and with movement will be recorded every three hours for the first 48
      hours after surgery, as well as PCA-bolussum and Morphine IM.
