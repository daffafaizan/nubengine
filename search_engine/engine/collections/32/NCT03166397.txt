      (IP). Yet, the administration of the TIL cellular product can only be accomplished in the
      context of an autologous, Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) procedure which is composed of the
      following steps:

        1. Reduced Intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen using
           Cyclophosphamide 30mg/kg/day with Fludarabine (25 mg/m2/d) followed by 3 consecutive
           days of Fludarabine 25mg/m2/d.

        2. Bolus high-dose (720,000 IU/kg) IL-2, which will be administered to each patient every 8
           hours, to tolerance. A maximum of 10 doses will be administered per patient.

        3. Early-stage follow-up until 30 days post-discharge

        4. Late-stage follow-up, such as CT scans, will be carried out four and twelve weeks after
           TIL administration, and then every 3 months thereafter for the first year after TIL
           therapy; for the second year and onwards, as clinically indicated.
