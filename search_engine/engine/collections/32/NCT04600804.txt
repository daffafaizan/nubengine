    
      This is a retrospective, multicenter, non-interventional, imaging study devoted to patients
      diagnosed with MCL and enrolled in the MCL0208 international randomized, phase III clinical
      trial (NCT02354313).

      The study is aimed at addressing a number of prognostic issues that still need to be
      clarified in MCL patients, by taking advantage of the PET performed within the MCL0208 trial
      and available for the analysis, and the clinical records and molecular data generated in the
      context of the trial.

      In the clinical trial PET was optional at baseline (b-PET), before ASCT (i-PET) and
      after-ASCT (eot-PET), and none of the exams was used in the decisionmaking strategy. All the
      PETs available will be collected and considered for analysis. The study will not require
      additional treatment or procedures except those required for the MCL0208 trial. The
      participation of the patient to the MCL0208 trial is a pre-requisite to be involved in this
      study.
