      cisplatin-based chemotherapy on gut microbiota and immune response in patients with EGFR/ALK
      wild type non-small cell lung cancer, stage IIIB-IV. Chinese herbal medicine was known to be
      beneficial adjuvant or alternative medicine for cancer treatment. However, the mechanism was
      unknown. This study wants to investigate the effect and mechanism of YQ1, which was proved to
      improve the antitumor immunity, to inhibit cancer progression, and to prolong overall
      survival of lung adenocarcinoma in a series of preclinical studies.
