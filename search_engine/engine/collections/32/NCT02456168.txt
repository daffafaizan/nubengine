      system symptoms whose pathophysiologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Cross-reactive
      anti-dsDNA antibodies have been shown to bind NR2A/NR2B subunits of the N-methyl D-aspartate
      receptor (NMDAR) on neurons and synergize with glutamate in a concentration dependent manner
      to either modulate receptor function or cause an excitotoxic, non-inflammatory neuronal
      death. Mice immunized to express anti-NMDAR Aab demonstrate a causal relationship between
      anti-NMDAR Aab and persistent behavioral and cognitive neuropathology following compromise to
      the blood brain barrier (BBB) which is necessary for Aab access to the brain.

      The investigators' previous cross-sectional FDG-PET studies of resting brain glucose
      metabolism demonstrate robust hypermetabolism in the hippocampus of SLE subjects that
      associates independently with serum Anti-NMDAR Aab titer and impaired memory. Moreover, the
      combination of hippocampus hypermetabolism and elevated serum titers of Anti-NMDAR Aab has a
      higher predictive value for memory impairment than either variable alone. These significant
      correlations must be tested in a longitudinal study to evaluate the utility of FDG-PET as a
      biomarker for Anti-NMDAR Aab-mediated brain damage. The proposed longitudinal studies will
      inform the investigators about correlates of cognitive and behavioral change over time using
      FDG-PET imaging (Aim 1). Additionally, the investigators will explore NMDAR biology with a
      novel PET ligand, [11C]-CNS5161, used to localize and quantify NMDAR activation (Aim 2) and
      explore the role of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in cognitive and behavioral
      impairment (Aim 3).
