      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The exact components of air pollution that underlie
      the cardiovascular effects are not yet known, but combustion-derived particulate matter is
      suspected to be the major cause. In controlled exposure studies, we have recently
      demonstrated that exposure to diesel exhaust causes increased myocardial ischaemia with
      exercise in patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease. The mechanism behind this
      effect is not yet understood, but we have shown that diesel exhaust exposure causes an acute
      impairment of two important and highly relevant aspects of vascular tone: vasomotor tone and
      endogenous fibrinolysis. In this study we propose to investigate the effects of exposure to
      ambient levels of air pollution on patients with stable, symptomatic angina pectoris, during
      their daily lives.
