      SCRIPT smoking cessation program. The research questions that need to be addressed are: i.
      What is the quit rate of pregnant women in the Spokane area who receive the SCRIPT
      intervention delivered by a pharmacist? ii. How does this quit rate compare to the quit rates
      of other SCRIPT programs given by other health care providers (social workers, nurses, etc.)?
      iii. Does the SCRIPT intervention have a significant effect on quit rates for smoking
      pregnant women compared to current Spokane county quit rates?
