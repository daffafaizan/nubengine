        -  Determine the efficacy of epoetin alfa in treating fatigue in patients with advanced
           solid tumors who are not receiving chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug on functional status and overall quality of life in
           these patients.

        -  Correlate self-reported level of energy with other commonly occurring symptoms (e.g.,
           pain, depression, anxiety, dyspnea, appetite disturbance, or sleep disturbance) in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate anemia with other common symptoms in these patients.

        -  Determine the internal consistency of fatigue self-report using three single-item
           measures of this symptom and the responsiveness of each item to change over time in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center, ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2-3), and
      hemoglobin prior to study (10 mg/dL or less vs greater than10 mg/dL). Patients are randomized
      to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients in either arm that
           do not respond to therapy may receive an additional 6 weeks of open-label epoetin alfa
           SC once weekly.

      In both arms, quality of life and fatigue are assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks. If
      patients receive an additional 6 weeks of therapy, quality of life and fatigue are also
      assessed at 9 and 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 128 patients (64 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
