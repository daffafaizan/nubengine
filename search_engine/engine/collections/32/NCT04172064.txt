      cardiovascular events. However, clinical algorithms to identify patients with coronary
      vasculopathies are still not defined and standardized. Non-invasive imaging by myocardial
      perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) or dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) might be used in
      such patients, however, it is unclear if these provide complementary or identical information
      and how this correlates to coronary angiography. A direct comparison of these imaging
      approaches, excellently validated in coronary artery disease, has not yet been described in
      well-defined and large groups of ESRD patients.

      The investigators therefore initiated a large prospective trial with 377 highly-selected and
      well-characterized end-stage renal disease patients without known coronary artery disease
      comparing the performance of standardized MPS and DSE. For the first time we here describe a
      significantly large proportion of ESRD patients with contradictory findings in MPS and DSE
      and its correlation to invasive coronary angiography hinting to complementary rather than
      identical information between both modalities. This is an excellent basis of future studies
      comparing the prognostic value of MPS versus DSE versus a combined MPS/DSE approach.
