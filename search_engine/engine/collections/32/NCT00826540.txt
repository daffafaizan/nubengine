      I. Evaluate proportion of patients who are progression-free at 3 months (in historic
      comparison with results for single-agent bevacizumab in ECOG 3200).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (RR) II. Overall survival (OS) III. Safety IV. Feasibility

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected at baseline and then
      periodically during study treatment for laboratory biomarker and pharmacogenetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
