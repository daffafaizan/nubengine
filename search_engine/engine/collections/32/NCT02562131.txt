      determined by the patient's treating urologist and/or oncologist. Data from histopathology,
      clinical follow-up and follow-up imaging will be collected to establish a reference standard
      that defines the presence or absence of disease for each patient. The imaging findings will
      be compared with the reference standard to assess the sensitivity and specificity. The
      diagnostic accuracy of combined PET/MRI and MRI-only (the current clinical standard) will be
      compared.
