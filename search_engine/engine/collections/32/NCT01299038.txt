    
      -  Since no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be
           "randomized" into the following study groups: Group 1 (regular dose of rosuvastatin) or
           Group 2 (higher dose of rosuvastatin).

        -  Participants will take 1 pill of rosuvastatin every day for 4 weeks. Each 4 week period
           is called a cycle.

        -  Participants will have a physical exam at baseline, on day 1 of starting rosuvastatin,
           and 2 month visits. Laboratory tests will be taken at baseline, on day 1 of starting
           rosuvastatin, 6 weeks and 2 months.
