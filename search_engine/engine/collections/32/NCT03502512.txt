      I. To measure and compare the rate of fat graft retention, defined as the rate between the
      volume of fat remaining in the surgical site at one year and the volume of fat at baseline,
      associated with the use of two aforementioned adipose tissue processing techniques.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure early post-operative complications including infection, hematoma, delayed wound
      healing or seroma.

      II. To measure late complications associated with fat grafting including fat necrosis, cyst
      formation, palpable mass, or breast asymmetry.

      III. To measure patient reported outcomes (PRO, BREAST-Questionnaire [Q], Body Image Survey).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo reconstructive surgery with REVOLVE technique.

      ARM II: Patients undergo reconstructive surgery with PureGraft technique.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then once a year for up
      to 2 years.
