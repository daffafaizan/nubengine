      develops as a consequence of underlying liver disease and is most often associated with
      cirrhosis. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are current best curative options to
      treat HCC. However, recurrence or metastasis is quite common in patients who have had a
      resection and survival rate is 30% to 40% at 5 years postoperatively.

      MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNA, act as endogenous RNA interference by post-transcription
      regulation. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes
      and altered microRNA expression levels may play an important role in the cancer initiation
      and progression. Several studies, including ourselves, have shown that specific microRNAs are
      aberrantly expressed in malignant HCC tissues compared to normal counterpart. Although many
      microRNA profiling studies were done to diagnose hepatocarcinogenesis, data about prognostic
      significances for postsurgical survival are very limited. The main point of this study is to
      develop a predictive signature for postsurgical survival in HCC patients.
