      extensively researched around the world. However, there is a potential "communication
      barrier" in the ACLF study; that is, different countries and regions, or different research
      collaboration groups, follow different ACLF definitions and related standards, making
      researchers in this field confuse in understanding the research value of relevant research
      and interpreting the research results. Important differences exist in the Asia-Pacific region
      and North America and Europe, such as the etiology, the clinical characteristics of the
      patient group, the requirements for cirrhosis, and the predisposing factors of the disease,
      making it necessary for China or the Asia-Pacific region to develop appropriate ACLF
      diagnosis standards and prognosis. In recent years, Chinese experts have also focused on the
      research progress of APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) in the Asia-Pacific region. It is
      found that the AARC standards are more suitable for the diagnosis and treatment of patients
      with ACLF in China than the Western standards. The ACLF prediction model (TPPM model)
      established by Professor Qin.N's team predicts that the prognostic efficacy of patients with
      HBV-ACLF is significantly better than that of Western prognosis. The AARC China Study is to
      establish a widely recognized and harmonized standard of patients with HBV-ACLF in the Asia
      Pacific region.
