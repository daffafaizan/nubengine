      admitted to the Department of Chest Diseases of Cerrahpa≈üa Medical Faculty Hospital of
      Istanbul University will be included in the 30-70 age group 6 months after systemic treatment
      or no treatment. Patients with stages I and IV, malignancy, heart failure, orthopedic
      problems and who have to undergo systemic sarcoidosis treatment during the study will not be
      included in the study. Thirty-four patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be included
      in the study by signing the informed consent form. In the first evaluation, demographic
      information and clinical characteristics of the patients will be noted. Lower and upper
      extremity functional capacities of the patients before and after training will be evaluated
      with 6-minute walk test (6MWT), 6-minute step test (6DST), 6-minute pegboard ring test
      (6DPBRT) and 30-second sit-down test. Percentage values of FVC, FEV1, FEV1 / FVC, PEF, FEF
      (25-75%) parameters according to measured and expected values will be recorded by performing
      pulmonary function test. Respiratory muscle strength will be determined by measuring maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MRP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) with the intraoral pressure
      gauge. Dyspnea sensation Modified Borg and Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) scale,
      fatigue state Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), peripheral muscle strength hand dynamometer,
      quality of life George Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire (SGRQ), anxiety and depression

      Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short form (IPAQ-S), cognitive function Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment Scale (MOCA), daily living activities London Chest Daily Living Activities Scale
      and sleep quality will be evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
