    
      This is a prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to determine if a standard of care sleep
      hygiene handout plus a brief 10 minute intervention for recurring nightmares (Nightmare
      Rescripting and Rehearsal Therapy) reduces scores on the Nightmare Distress Questionnaire and
      Nightmare Frequency Tool, when compared to patients solely receiving a handout outlining
      sleep hygiene techniques. Individuals with a minimum score on the Nightmare Distress
      Questionnaire and Nightmare Frequency Tool of 15 out of a possible 52 who meet all other
      inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.

      A clinically significant reduction will be considered if a decrease in Nightmare Distress and
      Frequency measures is greater than or equal to 25% from baseline. Secondary outcomes will
      include PCL-5 (PTSD), PHQ9 (Depression), GAD7 (Anxiety), ISI (Insomnia Severity Index)
      scores.
