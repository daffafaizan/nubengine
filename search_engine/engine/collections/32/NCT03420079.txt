    
      This is a multicenter, open, single arm phase I clinical trial to explore the dose of FCN-411
      in advanced lung cancer patients with disease progression after standard treatment or
      unsuitable for standard treatment and to expand the dose in advanced NSCLC patients who
      failed EGFR-TKI treatment. During the screening period, patients need to provide tumor
      tissue/ blood samples collected after their disease progression for tumor biomarker
      detection. In this study, the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      FCN-411 were observed by dose escalation study and dose expansion study, and the antitumor
      activity of FCN-411 was preliminarily evaluated to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The phase I dose escalation study includes two stages:
      single dose stage and continuous dose stage; phase I dose expansion study is continuous dose
      administration.

      The research cycle is made up of screening period (day-28-day-1), single administration
      period (7 days), continuous administration period (every 21 days, evaluated every 6 weeks,
      until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, decision of the investigator or
      voluntary withdrawal of the patient), end of treatment, EOT) visit, safety follow-up (30 days
      after the last administration), survival follow-up (survival follow-up every 3 months from
      the safety follow-up until the end of the study). The end of study is one year after the
      first administration of the last enrolled patient or the end of treatment (whichever is
      earlier).
