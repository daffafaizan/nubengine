      mindfulness techniques. Perceived stress is known to be diminished during meditation
      practice. This study evaluates the benefits of scuba diving on perceived stress and mindful
      functioning.

      Method: A recreational diving group, composed of 37 subjects, was compared with a multisport
      control group, composed of 30 subjetcs, on perceived stress, mood, well-being and mindfulness
      by answering auto-questionnaires before and after a one-week long course. For the diving
      group, stability of the effects was evaluated one month later using similar
      auto-questionnaires.
