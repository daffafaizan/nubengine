      pressure within the liver called "portal hypertension." One of its subsequent symptoms is
      ascites, or fluid accumulation in the abdomen. One standard treatment to relieve ascites is
      large volume paracentesis (puncture of the abdomen to drain the fluid). Another standard
      treatment is the TIPS procedure, which involves creating a shunt (small passage allowing
      fluid movement) within the liver to relieve the increased blood pressure in the liver.

      For this study, the investigators will be collecting data based on patients' random selection
      to two different approved standard of care treatments for ascites: Subjects will get
      randomized into either Group A: Large Volume Paracentesis (LVP) with albumin infusion, or
      Group B: an early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

      The study will include about 68 patients (34 patients will be selected for Group A:
      continuing conservative treatment of LVP with albumin infusion, and 34 patients will be
      selected for Group B: undergoing early TIPS with Gore速Viatorr速CX). Each patient will be
      followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall clinical efficacy in symptom
      relief of ascites of patients receiving the Gore速 Viatorr速 CX in early TIPS procedures
      compared to LVP (large volume paracenthesis). In order to so, the investigators will be using
      information found in patient medical records, collected as a part of standard of care, to
      analyze clinical outcomes, complications, and the rate of secondary interventions at
      follow-up.
