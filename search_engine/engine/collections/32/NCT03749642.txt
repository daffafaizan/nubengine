      of trazodone/gabapentin Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC)products for treatment of patients
      affected by painful diabetic neuropathy in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Diabetic
      peripheral neuropathic pain represents an important therapeutic challenge as its
      pathophysiology is not yet fully understood and pain relief is still unsatisfactory. The
      pharmacological treatments, with exception to those targeted to the glycemic control, are
      symptomatic and their use is limited by not universal efficacy, side effects or by the
      development of tolerance. A wide variety of drugs, used both alone and in combination, has
      shown to significantly reduce neuropathic pain when compared with placebo in randomized
      controlled trials, even though pain relief remains inadequate for most of the patients.

      In this contest, Angelini S.p.A is developing a fixed-dose combination medicinal product for
      the treatment of neuropathic pain containing low doses of active ingredients: trazodone, a
      widely used antidepressant drug, and gabapentin which is indicated for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain.
