      urinary tract symptoms arising from bladder outlet obstruction.

      Advanced (defined as locally advanced, metastatic or both in this study) PCA is frequently
      associated with both of these conditions. The currently most frequently performed palliative
      surgical treatment is TURP. Though performed endoscopically, TURP is associated with
      significant side effects in this setting. PAE has been shown to have a superior side-effect
      profile in the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction compared to TURP.

      In addition, there is growing evidence that patients with advanced PCA might benefit from
      cytoreductive therapy (e.g. radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy).
      However, recent methods of cytoreductive treatment of PCA hold the risk of being highly
      invasive and are associated with severe side effects. PAE might represent a minimally
      invasive alternative in this setting.

      Therefore, efficacy and safety of PAE in patients with advanced prostate cancer is assessed
      in this pilot-study.
