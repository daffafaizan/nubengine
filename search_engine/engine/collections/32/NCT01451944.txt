    
      Asthma patients age 3-17 enrolled in our clinic who have been seen in the ER, hospital or
      clinic for an asthma exacerbation will be invited to participate. Once enrolled they will
      have a home health nurse visit their home and provide medical assessment, asthma education
      and determine if the patients has all needed medications available. They enrolled patient
      will receive another home visit at 1, 4, and 12 months after enrollment. The medical record
      will be reviewed and ER visits and hospitalizations recorded.
