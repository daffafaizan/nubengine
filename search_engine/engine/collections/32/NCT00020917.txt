    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety profile of cetuximab, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and
      fluorouracil in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. II. Determine the response rate and
      time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once
      weekly on weeks 1-6. Patients also receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium
      IV over 10-15 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 3-5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-4.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 months.
