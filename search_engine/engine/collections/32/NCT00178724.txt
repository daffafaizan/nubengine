      Preliminary work has been completed on the selection of data elements, data collection
      protocols, case record form design, and the design of a computer system for clinical data
      management and data quality control.

      In the first phase of the network, data will be collected on the natural history of SCI.
      Although there is considerable data in the literature about the natural history of SCI,
      current changes in treatment appear to be modifying the natural history. In particular very
      early surgery, including decompression of the spinal cord and vertebral stabilization with
      instrumentation appears, in some cases of SCI, to be improving outcomes.

      No treatment is given other than standard of care for SCI. Data is collected in hopes to help
      SCI patients in the future.
