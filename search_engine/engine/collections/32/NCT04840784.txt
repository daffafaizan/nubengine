    
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of ETH-155008 and to
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
      Secondary objectives and endpoints will evaluate the PK and PD of ETH-155008 and preliminary
      clinical anti-tumor activity of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).

      This Trial is a FIH, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell NHL,
      CLL/SLL and AML who previously received standard treatment or are ineligible for standard
      treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and
      cohort expansion (Part 2). In the dose escalation, ETH-155008 will be administrated orally,
      once daily (QD) for 28 days at 6 dose levels ranging from 10 mg to 100 mg in 28-day cycles.
      Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle and the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified. Addition subjects will be treated in the
      dose expansion at the commended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      During the study, safety will be monitored by the data review committee (DRC) at each dose
      escalation step and at regular intervals during cohort expansion. Continuous reassessment for
      DLTs will help minimize the potential risks associated with the study drug. Cumulative data
      from subsequent treatment cycles will also be monitored for late-onset toxicities.
