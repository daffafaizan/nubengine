      staff), single-arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 12 weeks
      treatment with Simeprevir (SMV) and Daclatasvir (DCV) in participants with chronic Hepatitis
      C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b or 4 infection and either severe renal impairment or End-stage
      Renal Disease on hemodialysis. The study consists of a Screening Phase of 4 weeks, an
      Open-label Treatment Phase of 12 weeks, and a post-Treatment Follow-up Phase of 24 weeks. The
      total study duration for each participant will be approximately 40 weeks. All participants
      will receive a treatment regimen consisting of SMV 150 mg and DCV 60 mg co-administered once
      daily for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks. Participants who experience inadequate
      virologic response at Week 8 (defined as confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to [>=]
      lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) or viral breakthrough at any on-treatment visit
      (defined as confirmed increase in HCV RNA of >1 log base 10 from nadir, or confirmed HCV RNA
      >100 International unit per milliliter [IU/mL] in participants whose HCV RNA had previously
      been <LLOQ while on treatment) should discontinue all study drugs. Participants will be
      primarily evaluated for sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the actual end of study
      treatment (SVR12). Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study duration.
