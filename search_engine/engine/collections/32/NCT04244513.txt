      patients at different treatment time points will be collected, using different clinical
      assessments. The clinical case report form for HD-DBS is consistent with Enroll HD project
      and the case report form is attached in the appendix. The main purpose is to determine the
      efficiency of DBS treatment for HD with chorea by comparing the patients' status before and
      after surgery.

      Primary endpoints: Changes in chorea score of UHDRS, changes in total motor score (UHDRS).

      Secondary endpoints: changes in cognition will be assessed by stroop interference test,
      stroop word reading test, stroop colour naming test, trail making test, symbol digit modality
      test and mini-mental state examination(MMSE); changes in anxiety assessed by Hamilton Anxiety
      Scale(HAMA); changes in depression assessed by Hamilton depression scale(HAMD) and Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI); changes in the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric
      symptoms assessed by the Problem Behaviours Assessment for HD and changes in quality-of-life
      assessed by UHDRS functional assessment and UHDRS total functional capacity assessment.

      2 Explore the relationship between brain network conditions and DBS efficacy in HD patients
      The electrophysiological signals during the operation of HD patients will be collected and
      analyzed, and compared with the postoperative disease conditions, to determine the
      relationship between the patient's EEG activity and the mechanism of disease development,
      disease progression, and treatment effect.

      3. Explore the effect of different programmed parameters on the treatment of patients with
      DBS After the HD patient is turned on, the patient is programmed to adjust the program
      control parameters of different patients during adjustment, and the effects of different
      program control parameters on the patient, tolerance, and related side effects are clarified.
