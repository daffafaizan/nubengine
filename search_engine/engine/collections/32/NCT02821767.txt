    
      The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard
      treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions.

      Objective: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide short term follow-up of
      patients, usually in conjunction with a referring physician. In addition, this protocol
      allows clinicians at the NEI to maintain their expertise in evaluating and treating various
      eye disorders for which there may not be specific research studies. The knowledge gained may
      lead to ideas for future clinical research studies.

      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but
      will be set to 1,000 patients with ocular diseases.

      Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their
      progression and physiology.

      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however, the clinical assessments of
      enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment.
