      variety of non-surgical treatments have been advocated to correct the impairments associated
      with SAIS. Clinical trials support the use of therapeutic exercise and joint mobilizations to
      improve pain and functional disability associated with SAIS. However, not all patients in
      these trials had a favorable outcome. Moreover, the effect sizes in these trials were small
      to moderate. Thus the purposes of this study are to 1. determine the effect of a multi-modal
      rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening, stretching, manual therapy to the
      shoulder and spine, patient education, posture, and functional re-training; and 2. identify
      those patients who are and who are not likely to respond to rehabilitation at the start of
      care.
