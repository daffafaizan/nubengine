      (tumor registry platform) with the purpose to record information on the antineoplastic
      treatment of renal cell carcinoma in Germany. The registry will follow patients for up to
      three years. It will identify common therapeutic sequences and changes in the treatment of
      the disease. At inclusion, data in patient characteristics, comorbidities, tumor
      characteristics and previous treatments are collected. During the course of observation data
      on all systemic treatments, radiotherapies, surgeries, and outcome are documented.

      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with renal cell carcinoma will be
      evaluated for up to two years.
