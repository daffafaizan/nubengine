      fracture patients in Canada. The use of topical TXA in operatively-treated hip fracture
      patients has the potential to reduce perioperative blood loss and consequently reduce
      exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. This will positively influence post-operative
      morbidity and mortality, while at the same time substantially reduce hospital length of stay
      and overall health care costs. The proposed study is felt to have minimal risk, and is a
      relatively inexpensive study.

      Update: An interim analysis was completed in January 2018. The Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee reviewed the results and recommend the trial continue as planned.

      The final data analysis is in process. The abstract will be uploaded upon completion.
