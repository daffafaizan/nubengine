      Both groups were instructed to brush their teeth with a scrubbing method for the first one
      week. Then, each group received the different additional oral malodor reduction regimen- in
      addition to tooth brushing tongue cleaning in one group and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) mouthwash
      in another group for three consecutive weeks. After that, all the participants were
      instructed to practice all the three oral hygiene procedures (tooth brushing, mouth washing,
      tongue cleaning) the last one week. Total volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) measured by
      breathtron, tongue coating, plaque score and bleeding on probing (BOP) were outcomes of this
      study.
