      Nest care will allow for more flexibility, decrease interruptions to your productivity, while
      continuing to maintain safety for you and your infant. This model of care is anticipated to
      allow you more access to your health care team during your pregnancy.

      This study will compare OB Nest, a new model of prenatal care, to the existing traditional
      model of prenatal care. The plan is to have about 300 low-risk mothers take part in this
      study. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two groups; The Traditional Prenatal
      care Group or the OB Nest Group. Mothers will have an equal chance of being assigned to the
      OB Nest group. Mothers randomized to the OB Nest intervention will be assigned to a nursing
      care team comprised of one to three nurses and see their initial eleven planned appointments
      with their provider reduced to six. Mothers will still be able to request additional
      in-office visits with their provider and/or the provider require additional in-office visits
      to monitor mother and infants safety/care.
