      progesterone, and placebo to evaluate the effects on withdrawal bleeding in women with
      secondary amenorrhea. Patients will be treated for 10 days and study participation will be
      approximately 24 days. Patients will undergo a physical exam including a pelvic and breast
      exam. Patients will be required to complete bleeding and spotting information daily in a
      diary.
