      the dose of Chidamide will be 10 mg each time, for Step 2 30 mg each time. Participants will
      be enrolled into Step 1 first; if the dose given to Step 1 is well tolerated and no safety
      concerns are noted, Step 2 will be enrolled. All participants will keep their antiretroviral
      therapy during this study.

      Each step of this study will last for 56 days, involving 14 study visits(Screening, Day 0, 2,
      3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 21, 24, 26, 27, 56) for every participant. At the screening visit,
      participants will give a medical history and will undergo a physical exam; blood samples will
      be collected. Participants will undergo pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling which will require that
      blood be drawn at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72h after the first dose. For multi-dose PK
      studies, blood samples will be collected at the same time points after the last dose.
      Participants will undergo pharmacodynamic (PD) sampling which will require that blood be
      drawn at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72h after the first dose. For steady-state concentration PK and PD
      studies, blood samples will be collected 5-30 minutes before Chidamide administration on Day
      14, 17, 21. If participants agree, their blood samples may be stored for future research.
