      and programmatic characteristics, Kwale County on the south Kenyan coast and Bungoma County
      in western Kenya. Allocation to study group will be by cluster, using predefined units used
      in public health provision - termed Community Units (CUs), which comprise approximately 1,000
      households or 5,000 people. CUs will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving either
      (i) annual school-based deworming; (ii) annual community-based deworming; (iii) biannual
      community-based deworming. In nine CUs, a longitudinal study will be conducted in order to
      better understand the transmission dynamics of STH.
