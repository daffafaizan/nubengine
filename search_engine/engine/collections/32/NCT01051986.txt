      undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass using Y-composite graft based on the left internal
      thoracic artery. Patients were randomized by use of a randomization table. Composite conduit
      was made using saphenous vein or right internal thoracic artery according to the
      randomization result. The primary end point is to evaluate early and 1-year postoperative
      graft patency. The secondary end points are overall survival, freedom from cardiac death and
      freedom from MACCE(major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events). In saphenous vein group,
      20 remnant saphenous vein specimen was evaluated histologically to compare the difference
      between composite grafted vein and manually dilated saphenous vein.
