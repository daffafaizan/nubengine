      cement. A direct ingrowth of bone to the implant is crucial to the attainment of good results
      in those cases where cement is not employed. A new implant material (tantalum) has shown
      better properties than the implant material which is in use today (titanium). The advantages
      of tantalum implants are greater porosity, reduced stiffness and a higher friction
      coefficient than with titanium implants.

      Hypothetically, the higher porosity of tantalum should enhance bone ingrowth due to better
      osteoconductivity in terms of:

        1. less migration of the acetabulum component, as evaluated by RSA;

        2. increased BMD in the bone surrounding acetabulum components;

        3. fewer postoperative complaints on the Harris Hip Score and visual analog scale scores.

      The migration of acetabulum components will be evaluated by RSA. The follow-up RSA will be
      scheduled for week 1, as well as 3 months, 12 months and 2 years after surgery. Bone mineral
      density around the implanted femoral component will be examined by DEXA scan at week 1, as
      well as 1 year and 2 years after surgery.
