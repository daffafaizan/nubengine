    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of rituximab and sargramostim (GM-CSF), in terms of
           complete response at 12 weeks, in patients with newly diagnosed follicular B-cell
           lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival at 3 years in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of Fc gamma receptor polymorphism on response rate and time to
           progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment with GM-CSF repeats weekly for up to 8 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline for correlative laboratory studies of Fc-gamma
      receptor RIIIa 158 polymorphism.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
