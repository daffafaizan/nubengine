    
      Primary Aim: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Er:YAG laser as an
      adjunct to mechanical scaling and root planing periodontal therapy by comparing probing depth
      and clinical attachment levels.

      Secondary aim: The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Er:YAG laser as
      an adjunct to mechanical scaling and root planing periodontal therapy by comparing gingival
      bleeding index and plaque index.

      Tertiary aim: The tertiary aim of this study is to compare the microbial outcomes of
      mechanical periodontal therapy alone vs. mechanical therapy combined followed with Er:YAG
      laser therapy at the same time.
