    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the presence of the A133S polymorphism in the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene by
           screening germline DNAs of children with Wilms' tumor.

        -  Determine the inheritance pattern of the A133S polymorphism by evaluating the parents of
           children who carry this polymorphism.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the differences in age at diagnosis, stage, histology, site of primary tumor,
           and outcome, between patients with vs without the A133S polymorphism.

        -  Determine whether the S131F RASSF1A variant is a true polymorphism in these patients.

        -  Determine the polymorphic differences in this gene between these patients based on
           ethnicity and sex.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age at diagnosis,
      stage, histology, site of primary tumor, and outcome.

      Genomic DNA samples are purified from peripheral blood of patients and controls and analyzed
      by polymerase chain reaction for the RASSF1A gene. DNA is also analyzed from parents of
      patients with the A133S polymorphism.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 471 participants (229 Wilms' tumor patients and 200 control
      participants plus 42 parents) will be accrued for this study.
