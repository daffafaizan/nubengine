      Guadeloupe. Abnormally frequent, this progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome
      represents a new clinical entity. Unlike in classical PSP 70% of patients have myoclonus, 59%
      hallucinations, 78% REM sleep behavior disorders. Oculomotor pattern differs from classical
      PSP suggesting that cortical dysfunction predominates over brainstem impairments.
      Neuropathological examination in four patients has shown a widespread accumulation of the tau
      protein in the basal ganglia, the midbrain and cortical areas.

      This syndrome has been associated to the regular consumption of food products derived from
      plants of the Annonaceae family, more specifically Annona Muricata (soursop), suggesting a
      toxic origin. We have already confirmed the neurotoxic potential of the lipophilic
      mitochondrial complex I inhibitor annonacin, the major acetogenin in Annona muricata. This
      class of compounds is specific to Annonaceae. Nanomolar concentrations of annonacin induce
      the death of dopaminergic neurons in culture, by impairment of energy production. Chronic
      systemic intoxication of rats with annonacin causes neuronal damage in the same brain regions
      that are damaged in patients with atypical parkinsonism. These results greatly suggest that
      the consumption of annonacea might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The H1
      subhaplotype in tau gene associated with PSP in Caucasians did not confer risk for PSP-like
      atypical parkinsonism in Guadeloupe.
