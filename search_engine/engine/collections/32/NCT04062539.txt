    
      TEVAR involves the insertion of a stent into the thoracic aorta to re-line it and prevent
      life-threatening haemorrhage from rupture, and ultimately death. The stent is inserted
      through a small cut in the femoral artery in the groin that is able to track to the desired
      location in the thoracic aorta over wires. The thoracic aorta and the branches it provides to
      supply the brain are diseased with atherosclerotic plaques and thrombus. The manipulation of
      wires and stents over these diseased locations can lead to small fragments breaking off and
      travelling to the brain to block the blood supply to areas of the brain (cerebral
      embolisation).

      Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) consist of filters that can be placed into the
      branches of the thoracic aorta that supply the brain(supra-aortic branches) before TEVAR and
      can capture and remove solid debris, preventing it from reaching the brain.
