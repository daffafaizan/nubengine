      placebo (sugar pill). Neither you nor your doctor will know which you are receiving. You will
      learn to give yourself the injection, and you will remain on your study drug for 28 days. A
      home health care nurse will visit you twice a week to check the injection site, and at weeks
      1 and 3 the nurse will draw blood for laboratory tests. At months 1 and 6, you will be
      examined to see if you have fewer chronic fatigue symptoms after the antibiotics. This will
      include a fatigue questionnaire, a test of your mental processing speed, and a test of your
      cerebrospinal fluid.
