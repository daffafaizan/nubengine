    
      This is a prospective registry including patients accepted by the heart team for a TAVI
      procedure. Patients will undergo a prolonged continuous ECG monitoring using the CardioSTATÂ®
      device within the 3 months prior to the TAVI procedure. The duration of the ECG monitoring
      will be of 1 week. There will be no restriction regarding the type of valve and approach used
      for the TAVI procedure. All type of arrhythmic events will be recorded, as well as the
      specific therapeutic measures implemented upon the occurrence of the arrhythmic event.
      Following the TAVI procedure, the patients will be monitored (telemetry) until hospital
      discharge. All arrhythmic events during the hospitalization period will be recorded. Clinical
      follow-up will be performed at 30 days, and 1 year post-TAVI, and yearly thereafter up to
      5-year follow-up.
