      study. The product under investigation will be used in routine clinical practice and
      according to the authorized Instructions for Use (IfU). Those data that are obtained in
      routine clinical use will be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).

      The study design is based on a two-arms design. The patients for the both groups will be
      recruited consecutively, starting with group A. The study will prove the equivalence of the
      groups regarding the outcome of the postoperative lower limb alignment (mechanical leg axis)
      and any deviation >3Â° from neutral alignment is defined as an outlier.
