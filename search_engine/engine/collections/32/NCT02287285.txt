      number of patients seeking surgical weight loss. Gastric bypass surgery (GBP) results in
      30-40% body weight loss with resolution of T2DM in 40-80% of cases. The mechanisms by which
      T2DM improves after GBP are unclear. Glycemic control occurs long before significant weight
      loss, suggesting that the nature of the procedure, rather than the weight loss, is
      responsible for the T2DM improvement. Recent data have singled out the role of the gut
      hormones known as incretins in diabetes improvement after GBP. The current proposal will
      study 1) whether the short and long term change in the gut hormone incretins after GBP
      results in improved insulin secretion in response to the administration of oral and IV
      glucose, in patients with diabetes undergoing GBP surgery; 2) the factors responsible for
      diabetes remission - or lack of - after GBP. The investigators wish to apply our finding to
      define better surgical outcome on diabetes.
