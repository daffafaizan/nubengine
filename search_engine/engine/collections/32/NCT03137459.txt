      TTM-tailored intervention on the proportion of middle-age and older persons recruited from
      primary care practices who complete four ACP behaviors (completion of a living will,
      assignment of a health care proxy, and communication with loved ones and with their clinician
      about views on quality versus quantity of life) over six months, compared with usual care.
