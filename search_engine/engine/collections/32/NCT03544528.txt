    
      A randomized controlled trial, employing 34 young individuals aged 6-18 years, with immature
      necrotic teeth will be included. The test group will be treated by the regeneration procedure
      and the control group by the application of an MTA-plug. Clinical and low-dose cone-beam
      computed tomography scans (preoperatively and at 18-months follow-up) will be retrieved.
      Clinical data with information about tooth survival, absents of symptoms, resolution of
      infection and root development will be taken at every session.
