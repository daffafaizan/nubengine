      clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine
      and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising
      medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

      For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial)
      protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical
      research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual
      based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an
      eight-week, 80-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST
      protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing
      primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement
      scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement.

      The three medications being evaluated in this trial include tiagabine, sertraline, and
      donepzil. Tiagabine is hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine mechanisms
      relevant to addiction. Sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal 5-HT
      reuptake, which may modulate the reinforcing and cueing effects of cocaine. Donepezil is
      hypothesized to interfere with cholinergic cocaine mechanisms relevant to addiction.
