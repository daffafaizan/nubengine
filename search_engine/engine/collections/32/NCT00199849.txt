    
      Eligible patients with tumor type known to express NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen will be
      assigned to cohorts. NY-ESO-1 Plasmid DNA (pPJV7611) Cancer Vaccine will be administered by
      PMED at a pressure of 500 psi using the XR-1 Powderject delivery device. The 4 microgram
      dosage of NY-ESO-1 will be administered as 4 X 1 microgram PMEDs in close proximity.
      Similarly, the 8 microgram dosage will be administered as 8 X 1 microgram PMEDs. The third
      cohort of patients will receive the 8 microgram dosage as a cluster dosage of 4 doses (day 1,
      3, 5, 8) as 2 X 1 microgram PMEDs per day.

      Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, 2 weeks after each vaccination, prior to the
      second and third vaccination, and 4 weeks after the third vaccination for the assessment of
      clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology responses. Patients will be
      evaluated for toxicity throughout the study.

      DTH testing will be performed with NY-ESO-1 protein in all patients, with NY-ESO-1b peptide
      in HLA-A2+ patients and with NY-ESO-1 DP4 peptide in HLA-DP4+ patients at baseline and at the
      2-week visit following the first and third vaccinations.

      NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibodies will be assessed in all patients by ELISA using
      recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein. NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be assessed in all
      patients by tetramer and/or ELISPOT assays.

      Disease status will be assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after the third vaccination in
      patients with measurable disease.
