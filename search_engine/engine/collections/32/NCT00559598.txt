        -  To explore the utility of the serum proteome pattern for early detection and diagnosis
           of pancreatic and extraheptic biliary tract cancer by analyzing serum samples from
           participants previously enrolled in the PANKRAS-II study.

        -  To support efforts to contact participants (recruited to the PANKRAS-II study 10 years
           ago) who were diagnosed with benign biliary-pancreatic disease in order to discern if
           they subsequently developed a malignant biliary-pancreatic tumor.

        -  To gather information about clinical factors surrounding the date of blood extraction
           that may influence the proteomic patterns of the blood samples by performing a review of
           clinical records of participants.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples are analyzed for proteome pattern. Participants undergo a telephone
      interview about their medical history (i.e., pancreatic or biliary tract disease diagnosed
      within the past 10 years). Medical records are reviewed to gather information about clinical
      factors surrounding the date of blood extraction that may influence the proteomic patterns of
      the blood samples.
