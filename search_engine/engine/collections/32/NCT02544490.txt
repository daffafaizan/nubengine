      University Hospital Emergency Department (ED) will be enrolled along with non-infective
      controls. Whole blood samples will be separated immediately into plasma and serum for storage
      at the Tissue Repository. Those who are subsequently admitted to the general ward, high
      dependency (HD) or intensive care unit (ICU) will have their 2nd and 3rd samples obtained at
      24-48 hours and 48-72 hours respectively. The 2nd and 3rd samples will be used as prognostic
      markers (Objective #2). Patients who are discharged directly from the ED will be tracked for
      any clinical recurrence of their disease within 28 days to ensure the diagnostic accuracy of
      the first sample of biomarkers that are extracted.

      Samples will be batch-processed via the circulating miRNA profiling workflow comprising of
      the pre-analytics, analytics, and data processing and analysis phases. This qPCR-based miRNA
      profiling has much smaller feature to sample ratio thus allowing a global sequential forward
      selection to optimally combine a host of features with complementary prediction strengths to
      form the biomarker panel which has the least number of components and the maximized
      classification power (ROC AUC). Panel robustness measurement using computational generated
      noises and validation with a larger set of blinded samples will be performed.

      The final objective will be assessed by measuring the concentrations of secreted cytokines,
      chemokines and reactive oxygen species after synthesis and transfection the newly-derived
      miRNA panel into monocytes and monocytic cell lines.
