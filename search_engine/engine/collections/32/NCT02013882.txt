      preservation but it requires appropriate wash-in phase. The current wash-in protocols are
      complicated and time consuming. We propose a new 1-1-12 desflurane wash-in protocol which is
      more simple and predictable.

      The objective of this study is to identify time to achieve alveolar concentration of
      desflurane at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6% with 1-1-12 wash-in protocol.

      All patients will receive iv propofol 2 mg/kg as induction agent and succinyl choline 1.5
      mg/kg for intubation. Then the ventilation will be controlled to achieve end-tidal CO2 30-35
      mmHg with O2:N2O 1:1 L/min with desflurane 12%. Time to achieve alveolar concentration of
      desflurane at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6% will be recorded and analyzed. After that, the
      concentration of desflurane and anesthetic technique will be adjusted to requirement of
      anesthesiologist.
