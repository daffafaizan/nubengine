    
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a lifestyle intervention in obese
      individuals with t2dm and concurrent stage 2-4 ckd. The counseling intervention will be based
      on social cognitive theory and supported by mobile (ipad) self-monitoring. Mobile
      self-monitoring is featured in the intervention to encourage vigilance to the diet in a
      manner that is not burdensome, enhance self-efficacy by integrating complex information
      regarding the ckd dietary regimen with a calorie-restricted diet, and permit real-time
      monitoring of weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and self-reported diet and physical
      activity by the study team.

      Specifically, the investigators will develop the methods for and pilot test the ckd lifestyle
      intervention in stage 2-4 ckd patients and explore the impact of the intervention on: (a)
      weight and fat mass, (b) blood pressure, (c) physical activity, (d) urinary sodium excretion,
      (e) serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product, (f) kidney function as measured by serum
      cystatin-c, and (g) serum lipids. Additionally, we will evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of this intervention in terms of: (h) recruitment and retention, (i) time and
      cost associated with training ckd patients in technology-based self-monitoring and in
      delivering the intervention, (j) patterns of self-monitoring adherence over time, and (k)
      participant satisfaction with the intervention. Finally, we will describe: (l) the extent to
      which the intervention differentially adversely affects the nutritional health of
      participants as evidenced by low serum albumin or serum prealbumin; a body mass index (bmi)
      that falls below 20kg/m2; and subjective assessment of nutritional risk (e.g. Nausea,
      diarrhea, anorexia).
