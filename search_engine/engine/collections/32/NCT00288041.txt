    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the confirmed tumor response rate and adverse event profile of bortezomib,
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate time to tumor progression, overall survival, and duration of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, and 8 and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
