      different countries, and reporting that medical students pharmacy students, nursing students
      are experiencing poor quality of sleep. However, to our knowledge, studies done on sleep
      quality of students and especially the physiotherapy students are not available in Turkey,

      sleep quality, we aimed to evaluate if the sleep quality of the physiotherapy students in
      both gender are associated with their quality of life and physical activity level.
