    
      Study Design:

      During a mandatory post treatment 28-day wash-out period, 135 advanced NSCLC patients with
      progressive disease evaluated between 6 and 18w. of a second or third line ICI monotherapy;
      will undergo a screening visit. After signing an informed written consent, if they are found
      eligible, their participation in the study will ensue.

      Treatment allocation will be performed using the randomization module of the eCRF, :

        -  Arm A: combination of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) + Monalizumab (IPH2201), to target a PD-L1
           co-inhibitory pathway

        -  Arm B: combination of Durvalumab + oleclumab (MEDI9447), to target limitations of
           antitumor T-cell immunity caused by adenosine receptor signaling

        -  Arm C: combination of Durvalumab + AZD6738, to potentially enhance anti- tumour T-cell
           responses

        -  Arm D: a standard third or forth-line chemotherapy maintenance (Docetaxel).

      A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized, with 30 patients per arm (4 arms).
