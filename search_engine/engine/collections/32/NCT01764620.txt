      the important role of lower trapezius for functional scapular stability, it is suggested that
      a kinesio taping technique for facilitating its function could compensate for the negative
      effects of muscle fatigue on scapular kinematics. This is a randomized crossover study and
      all included athletes will be evaluated in three sessions, with a period of seven days
      between them: Control (fatigue protocol, without taping), Kinesio Taping (fatigue protocol
      with elastic taping applied with tension) and Sham (fatigue protocol with taping applied
      without tension). During each session, tridimensional kinematics of scapula and humerus and
      electromyography of serratus anterior and trapezius (upper and lower portions) muscles of
      dominant shoulder will be evaluated, during scaption and throwing movements, immediately
      before and immediately after the fatigue protocol.The changes in scapular movements (before
      versus after the fatigue protocol) will be compared among the sessions.
