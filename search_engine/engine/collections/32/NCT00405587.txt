      55-68% of malignant melanomas. In general, oncogenic mutations of BRAF correlate with a poor
      outcome. PLX4032 is a compound that selectively inhibits oncogenic B-Raf kinase.

      Two extension cohorts of patients with confirmed V600E mutations will be recruited,
      consisting of advanced melanoma and metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
