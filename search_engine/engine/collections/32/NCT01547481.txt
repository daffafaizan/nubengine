      and statistical methodology for segregation of various forms of Parkinsonism from healthy
      adults without Parkinsonism. We focus on early diagnosis of Parkinsonism, other tremor
      disorders, and determine how imaging might be used to improve diagnosis. The purpose of this
      protocol is to gather a multi-modal dataset to explore and validate the investigator's
      previous research findings in prior studies.
