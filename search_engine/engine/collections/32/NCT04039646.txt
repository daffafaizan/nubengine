      mortality up to 30%. Open procedures have in the most part been replaced by laparoscopic
      techniques. The standard postoperative management of PPUD patients is predominantly based on
      traditional practices. Randomization will be made at the end of the surgical procedure.
      Patients will be included in groups 1 or2. Group 1 is the control group and will receive
      standard postoperative care, and group 2 is the ERAS group.The aim of this randomized
      controlled clinical trial was to investigate the feasibility of ERAS in patients who
      underwent laparoscopic repair for Perforated peptic ulcer.
