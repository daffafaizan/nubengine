      insidiously. To date, deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown high prospects in biomedical
      science, particularly in the diagnosis of ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy,
      age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, glaucoma, and papilledema.
      However, there is still a lack of a single algorithm that can classify multi-diseases from
      fundus photography.

      This cross-sectional study will establish a DL algorithm to automatically classify
      multi-diseases from fundus photography and differentiate major vision-threatening conditions
      and other retinal abnormalities. We will use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
      curve to examine the ability of recognition and classification of diseases. Taken the results
      of the expert panel as the gold standard, we will use the evaluation indexes, such as
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      etc, to compare the diagnostic capacity between the AI recognition system and human
      ophthalmologist.
