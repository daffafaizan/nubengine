      existing silicone mask cushion, and is fitted to the patients existing mask frame.

      Subjects will wear the test unit mask, instead of the current CPAP mask, each night whilst
      sleeping. Upon waking, subjects will remove the test unit mask and place it with the skin
      contact side uppermost on a flat surface adjacent to their bed (e.g. a bedside table). Test
      unit masks should not be covered, and are to remain exposed to the bedroom environment for
      the rest of the day. The cycle repeats for up to 35 days (5 weeks).

      If necessary, the test can be terminated before this time.

      A control group of 2 subjects will wash their test unit mask with only hot water every day
      for the 5 weeks. Another 4 subjects will have the foam of their test unit mask replaced
      during the 5 weeks of the trial. Two subjects will have the foam changed after 2 weeks and
      the other 2 subjects after 4 weeks. This will allow estimations of bioburden after 1,2,3,4
      and 5 weeks of use.

      The foam samples are to be sealed in the supplied sterile container. The sealed container
      will be delivered as soon as possible to the project administrator. The project administrator
      will appropriately collect, record, store, and dispatch the sealed samples for
      microbiological analysis.

      Microbial analysis will determine the number of colony forming units, and species present in
      each test unit upon test termination.

      Skin Reactions:

      Participants will be asked to report any skin reaction they experience under the test unit.
      Subjects will keep a bi-weekly record of any skin redness, irritation, etc.
