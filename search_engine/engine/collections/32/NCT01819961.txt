      (vol/vol) mixture of an oil rich in medium-chain fatty acids and soybean oil (termed MCT/LCT)
      or a mixture of MCT/LCT and fish oil Omegaven for 7 days. Full blood count, biochemistry and
      coagulation are routinely assessed. Fresh blood samples are centrifuged into plasma, red
      blood cells and lymphocytes then stored at -80Â°C pending analysis.

      The primary endpoint was numbers of infective complications.Secondary endpoints were other
      clinical outcomes, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality, along with plasma
      immunological markers.
