      space, created by the pericardial sac which cradles the heart. The most common reason to
      perform this procedure is that pericardial fluid is interfering with heart function. The next
      most common reason is to obtain pericardial fluid for testing to make a clinical diagnosis.
      Pericardiocentesis is performed using a long needle that may be guided by various means
      including blindly without imaging guidance, using electrocardiography electrodes to determine
      when the needle accidentally touches the heart, using echocardiography, using X-ray with- or
      without- contrast injections, or using a combination. Each has its advantages and
      limitations.

      We have developed real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide heart catheterization
      with tissue visualization but without X-ray radiation. When used to guide needle access to
      the pericardial space or from there even into heart cavities, MRI provides superb imaging
      guidance. What is especially valuable about MRI is that it provides the entire thoracic
      context of needle access, allowing the operator to avoid critical structures including the
      liver, lung, pleural space, and heart muscle.

      We have developed real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide heart catheterization
      in patients with tissue visualization but without X-ray radiation. We also have used these
      developments to guide needle access to the heart and pericardium in animal models.

      In this protocol we test the safety and feasibility of pericardiocentesis in adult patients,
      using commercially available MRI-compatible (passive) needles.

      If successful, this will enable more advanced minimally invasive procedures in adults and
      children.
