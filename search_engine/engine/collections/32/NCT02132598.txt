    
      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label study of cabozantinib in subjects with molecularly
      unselected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the brain and in patients
      with c-MET amplified Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the brain.

      Patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg orally once daily and continue on treatment until
      disease progression, death or unacceptable adverse events. Treatment cycles are 4 weeks in
      duration.

      The primary endpoint is Overall Response Rate (ORR) in both the unselected NSCLC population
      and the molecularly selected patients on the basis of c-MET amplification.
