      the three-week study. Subjects received 10 algae capsules/d. Laboratory tests of CD4 counts
      and HIV RNA were performed at baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 3, and then once a month.
      Six subjects continued for between 4 and 14 months. In addition to CD4 lymphocyte counts and
      viral loads, subjects were evaluated monthly for Complete Blood Counts (CBC), Liver profile,
      Basic Metabolic Panel, and some subjects were evaluated for thyroid function and cholesterol.
      All subjects completed standard HIV Quality of Life questionnaires at each clinic visit.
