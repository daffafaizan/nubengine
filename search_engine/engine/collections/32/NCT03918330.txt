      is used as a first explorative study of how the human gut microbiota is distributed along the
      lower gastrointestinal tract. No comparable studies in an uncleansed bowel have been
      performed so far. The number of subjects is based on other studies investigating the
      microbial composition of mucosal- and faecal-associated microbiota in which a sample size of
      10 was enough to detect a difference. An equal number of men and women will be recruited.
      Drop-outs will be replaced.
