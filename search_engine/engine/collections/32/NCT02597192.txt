      Nobel prizewinning scientist Eli Metchnikoff in the beginning of the 20th century. However,
      it took several decades for this subject to become a topic of interest in medicine. At this
      moment these micro-organisms are called "probiotics" and defined as "living microorganisms
      which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host"
      (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/fs_management/en/probiotics.pdf). Over the past
      decade probiotics have been extensively investigated from the perspective of oral health. It
      was shown that probiotics have the capacity to reduce mutans streptococci counts in saliva
      and/or plaque during their usage, that they have a positive influence on bad breath and that
      they can improve the results of scaling and root planing in periodontitis patients. A
      positive effect of probiotic usage on plaque accumulation and gingivitis measurements in
      gingivitis patients was also shown.To the investigators knowledge, at this moment no trials
      are available describing the effect of other probiotic genera on gingivitis. Since it is
      clear that probiotic effects are strain, dosage and mode of application dependent, the aim of
      this study was to evaluate the use of a probiotic toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush
      cleaner with Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus pumulus versus a placebo in
      patients with generalized gingivitis.
