    
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center study of oral panobinostat administered in
      combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed, and relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Panobinostat will be administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone over
           2 weeks in each 21 day cycle; the third week will be without administration of any drug.

        -  Treatment phase 1 will consist of 8, 21 day cycles (24 weeks). Patients with clinical
           benefit at the end of cycle 8 as per investigator assessment may continue to receive
           study treatment in phase 2 for a maximum of an additional 24 weeks.

        -  Patients who have not achieved or maintained at least "no change" (EBMT response
           criterion) by 8 cycles must discontinue from study treatment

        -  The protocol will remain open in each participating country until drug is commercially
           available and reimbursable or until July 2017, whichever comes first (except in Norway
           where this protocol will end by March 2016).
