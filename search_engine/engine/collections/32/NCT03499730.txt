      suggesting antinociceptive and hyperalgesic effects. Anxiety might be a confounder in this
      association. In order to investigate the effect of midazolam on postoperative pain, a
      prospective cohort study will be conducted in four Portuguese ambulatory surgery units. A
      convenience sample with consecutive design will include patients admitted for open inguinal
      hernia repair. After anxiety and pain evaluation, a tailored dose of midazolam will be
      administered as premedication according to the anesthetist's best judgement within each
      unit's protocol (routine care; this dose may be null). Subsequent anesthesia and analgesia
      will be standardized. Postoperative pain will be blindly assessed by telephone interviews at
      24h, 7 days, and 3 months. Statistical analysis will be performed separately for each gender,
      centre and type of anesthesia, adjusting for preoperative anxiety and other confounding
      variables with multivariate analysis.

      The investigators intend to clarify the relation between anxiety, preoperative midazolam and
      postoperative pain.
