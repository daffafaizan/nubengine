    
      Subjects with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who are
      considered eligible for reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplant by the
      transplant team at WCI(Wilmot Cancer Institute) will be enrolled in the study. Fludarabine
      30mg/M2 will be given IV over 30-60 minutes on days -6 to -2 and Melphalan 140mg/M2 will be
      given IV over 4-hours once on day -2 of the preparative regimen. Patients will receive HBO
      therapy on day 0 of the transplant. The treatment consists of exposure to hyperbaric oxygen
      at 2.5 atmospheric absolutes (ATA) for a total of 90 minutes after compression to 2.5
      atmosphere absolutes (ATA) in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber (Model 3200/3200R, Sechrist
      Industries, Inc., USA), breathing 100% oxygen. The subjects will be in the chamber for a
      total of 120 minutes as approximately 10-15 minutes were spent during the compression and
      decompression phases and subjects had 10 minute room air breaks every 30 minutes of
      hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Patients will be seen daily until neutrophil count engraftment
      is documented. After neutrophil recovery is documented, the patients will be seen in clinic
      at least weekly through day +100. A final visit will be scheduled day +100. As part of
      routine care, subjects will be followed daily or as directed by the treating physician until
      neutrophil recovery, defined as three consecutive days of achieving a neutrophil count of
      >500/mm3. Laboratory testing will occur per institutional guidelines. Follow-up will continue
      until Day +100. Donor chimerism and disease status will be determined by bone marrow biopsy
      on Day +30 and day +100 post-transplant.
