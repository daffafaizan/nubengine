      contribute, including patient comorbidities, operative technique, and degree of contamination
      of the case. SSI often requires prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission, or
      other procedural intervention. One potential intervention to reduce SSI is the use of
      antibiotic irrigation, which has been shown to reduce SSI in colorectal surgery in a recent
      randomized control trial. We retrospectively evaluated our use of dual antibiotic irrigation
      at the time of mesh placement during open ventral hernia repair (OVHR), demonstrating a
      significant reduction in SSI (16.5 vs 5.4%) using a combination of gentamicin and clindamycin
      irrigation when compared to saline alone.

      We plan to complete a registry-based, randomized clinical trial (RCT) through the Americas
      Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC) to further assess the impact of dual antibiotic
      irrigation on SSI after OVHR with mesh. This will include patients undergoing open
      retromuscular (RM) repair with or without transversus abdominis myofascial advancement flap
      (TAR) with placement of permanent synthetic mesh (mid-weight, large-pore polypropylene).
      Power analysis based on only this subset of patients from our initial study indicates a total
      of 210 patients are needed to demonstrate a significant reduction in SSI using antibiotic
      irrigation vs saline irrigation alone.
