      in Parkinson's disease patients who experience motor-fluctuations. Subjects who completed Ph2
      study B7601003 will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups (15 mg QD, 7 mg QD, 3 mg QD,
      or 1 mg QD group) depending on the treatment received in B7601003 and titrated up to 15 mg QD
      over a 3 week period, as appropriate. All subjects who were blindly down-titrated during the
      B7601003 study will remain at/or be titrated to 7 mg QD only and remain at that dose for the
      rest of the B7601017 study in order to protect the blind for the prior study. Subjects who
      successfully titrate to 15 mg QD will enter the Adjustment Period at that dose.

      Subjects who cannot tolerate 15 mg QD at any time during the study will be allowed to
      down-titrate to 7 mg QD (but not lower) and will stay at that dose for the rest of the study.

      Subjects who cannot remain at a stable dose (7 mg or 15 mg QD) will be discontinued.
