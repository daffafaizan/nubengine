    
      Secondary objectives are :

      phase I : to collect preliminary results on the 6-month progression-free rate of the
      combination vismodegib + temozolomide

      PHASE II

      To estimate in the two study arms:

        -  the objective response rate (Complete response + Partial Response according to WHO
           criteria) after 6 months of treatment

        -  the duration of treatment response

        -  the best overall response obtained during the study

        -  the progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  the time to progression (TTP)

        -  the time to treatment failure (TTF)

        -  In the combination arm (vismodegib + temozolomide): to further evaluate the safety of
           the combination.
