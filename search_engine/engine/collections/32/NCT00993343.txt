    
      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is grade II-IV acute GVHD in the two groups. GVHD is
      diagnosed clinically and graded from 0 to IV. The diagnosis is clinical and biopsies from
      skin, liver and gut is used according to the routines at each participating center.

      Other study parameters

        1. Time to neutrophils >0.5 x 109/L.

        2. Time to platelets >20 x 109/L and 50 x 109/L.

        3. Platelet level 30 days after transplant.

        4. Transfusion requirements of platelets, erythrocytes, granulocyte transfusions during the
           first 30 days.

        5. Non-engraftment (graft failure/rejection).

        6. Grade of acute GVHD.

        7. Incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease graded as limited or extensive and mild,
           moderate and severe.

        8. Transplant-related mortality.

        9. Probability of relapse in patients with haematological malignancies.

       10. Survival.

       11. Relapse-free survival.

       12. Infections by bacteria, virus and fungi. Cytomegalovirus reactivation is also followed
           by PCR.

       13. Side-effects. Side-effects regarding hematopoiesis, liver test, renal function, cardiac
           function, neurology, endocrinology, etc., are taken from the patients' charts. These
           parameters are followed regularly after transplantation.
