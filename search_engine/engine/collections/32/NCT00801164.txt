      oral rinse as an adjunctive agent to non-surgical periodontal intervention for patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately thirty (30) adult (35 years or older) patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus with untreated chronic periodontitis of moderate or worse severity
      will be enrolled in the 6-month study to provide 24 evaluable subjects (12 per group). All
      subjects enrolled in the trial will receive standard periodontal therapy including scaling
      and root planing (SRP). Half will be randomized to receive the investigational oral rinse
      adjunctively twice daily; the other half will receive placebo rinse twice daily. Study
      participants will be treated with either Iocide or placebo rinse for the first 90 days of the
      study only. Follow up examinations will be performed at six months. Evaluation of biological
      markers associated with systemic inflammation and diabetes will be performed at baseline,
      three months, and six months. The primary study outcome is clinical measurement of chronic
      periodontitis (gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment
      level). Secondary outcomes are change in HbA1c and markers of systemic inflammation measured
      by serum C-reactive protein, plasma TNF-a, and IL-6.
