    
      Objective: To investigate the safety of an allogeneic tumor cell lysate (PheraLys) loaded
      onto autologous dendritic cells (MesoCancerVac) in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MM).

      Study design: A phase I study with a classical 3*3 design. Study population: Adult patients
      with malignant mesothelioma who were treated with chemotherapy as standard treatment.

      Intervention: After chemotherapy, a leukapheresis is performed of which the monocytes are
      used for differentiation to DCs using specific cytokines. Pulsed autologous DCs
      (MesoCancerVac) are re-injected 3 times every two weeks. After the third injection with
      MesoCancerVac, revaccinations to boost the immune system are given after 3 and 6 months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The aim of this phase I protocol is to study the toxicity
      and safety of MesoCancerVac (DC-based immunotherapy) in MM patients. Toxicities will be
      scored according to common toxicity criteria version 4.0. The following toxicities occurring
      during 8 weeks after the first vaccination, will be considered as dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Patients have to undergo extra outdoor visits for this study (10-20) and extra
      invasive procedures especially for this trial, like a catheter in a blood vessel. These are
      invasive procedure but risks are limited. This iv entrance is necessary every time, for the
      leukopheresis, for blood samples and for the injection of the dendritic cells. A
      leucopheresis is a standard procedure and will be performed according to guidelines. There is
      a limited risk for transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.

      The administration of autologous cells, that have been loaded with allogeneic human
      materials, is a potential risk and that is the subject of the study. Because not the lysate
      itself is administered to the patients but only when it is processed by the dendritic cells
      of the patient the investigators expect these risks to be limited.
