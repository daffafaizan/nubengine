      transfusion rate, this is not really known in paediatric cardiac surgery. In this
      retrospective study, the investigators will analyse our database for paediatric cardiac
      surgery patients aged 0-16 years and operated between 2002 and 2017. Patients with a single
      cardiac surgery will be compared to patients with a second cardiac operation under
      extracorporeal bypass. The investigators will test the variables for normal distribution
      using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Non normal distributed variables will be compared by a
      non-parametric test (Mann Whitney U), frequency analysis will be done by a Chi-Square test. A
      univariate analysis will determine predicting factors for transfusion. Factors with a P value
      < 0.1 will be analysed by a multivariate analysis to determine independent factors for
      transfusion. Odds with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. A P value < 0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant.
