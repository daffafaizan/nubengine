    
      The study is a two-centre, randomized, 1:1 trial comparing prehospital prasugrel initiation
      therapy between crushed vs. uncrushed prasugrel tablets on efficacy and safety as well as
      pharmacodynamics in STEMI patients.

      Patients with STEMI planned for primary PCI will be screened and, if inclusion criteria are
      met, included at first medical contact (paramedics). After enrolment, patients will be
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 60mg prasugrel loading dose by ingesting integral or
      crushed tablets.

      The follow-up duration is 12 months, i.e. clinical outcomes will be analysed in-hospital, at
      30 days, and 12 months
