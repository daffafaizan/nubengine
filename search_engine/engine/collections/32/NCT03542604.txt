      insomnia. A total of 30 participants will be randomized to either cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia and behavioral weight loss (CBT-I+BWL) or a sleep education program and
      behavioral weight loss (EDU+BWL). Measures will be collected at baseline, 8 weeks (after the
      CBT-I or EDU program) and at 3 and 6 months after starting BWL. The primary outcome will be %
      total weight loss. Additionally, eating behaviors, physical activity, and sleep parameters
      will be carefully assessed.

      The sleep intervention phase of the study includes 6 sessions over 8 weeks (2 in-person,
      followed by 4 phone or videoconferencing sessions), and the BWL intervention includes 15
      sessions over 6 months (1 in-person, 14 by phone or videoconference). Participants will be
      given physical activity trackers and will use a dietary app to record their food intake.
      There are 4 in-person assessment visits (baseline/randomization, 8-week follow up, 3-month
      follow up, 6-month follow up). These assessment visits are coordinated with in-person sleep
      and weight loss intervention visits. Some of the measures that will be recorded throughout
      the study include: height, weight, anthropometric measures (waist/hip measurements), sleep
      diaries, and self-report measures.
