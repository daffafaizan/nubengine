    
      study will consist of three periods:

        1. Screening (up to 28 days)

        2. Treatment (28-day cycles)

        3. Follow-up (up to 3 months)

      Dose Escalation:

      An accelerated titration design will be utilized for the lowest dose cohort (0.5 mg/kg) in
      the dose escalation part. Whereas the traditional 3 + 3 design will be utilized for the
      higher dose cohorts until the RP2D is determined.

      Expansion Cohorts:

      Enrollment in expansion cohort will begin when the RP2D has been identified by the CoRC. Up
      to four tumor-specific cohorts consisting of approximately 16-20 patients per cohort will
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of YBL-006 at the RP2D.
