      disease-modifying therapies entering early phase clinical trials, with additional novel
      therapeutic strategies in development. It is essential to develop biomarkers that can detect
      a "signal of efficacy" over a relatively short time frame for use in Phase II trials. Ideally
      biomarkers are needed that can reliably detect the earliest brain alterations due to AD
      pathology, perhaps at a point when there is synaptic dysfunction but not yet widespread
      neuronal loss. Functional neuroimaging, in particular functional MRI (fMRI), has significant
      potential, having already shown promise in detecting regionally specific pharmacological
      effects on memory related neural activity, and as a sensitive marker of very early cognitive
      impairment.

      This study, a parallel ancillary study of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI), will first examine reproducibility of fMRI activation, using a face-name associative
      memory paradigm, and then the alterations in memory-related activation that occur over the
      course of MCI and mild AD. The study will also examine the relationship of fMRI activation to
      clinical variables, memory task performance, genotype, and other imaging techniques
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally, sampling at multiple time points over a 3-year period.
