      specific complications of end-stage liver disease (ESLD); one of the most important is
      infection (25-30%). Infection is responsible for considerable proportion of ESLD-related
      mortality. Important in pathogenesis of infections in ESLD is CAIDS (cirrhosis - associated
      immune dysfunction syndrome), recently re-named to CAID (Cirrhosis-Associated Immune
      Deficit). TRANSFER FACTOR (TF) is supposed to act at several points in CAID - cascade. This
      gave rise to hypothesis, that TF could be of benefit in AD/ACLF.

      Characteristics of TF It has been shown that transmission fo T-Lymphocyte reactivity is
      transmissible not only by T-cells alone, but also by hommogenate of peripheral white blood
      cells. Later it became clear that for the transmission of cellular immunity is responsible
      dialysable fraction of T-lymphocytes homogenate (with small molecular weight of 10 kDa;
      consists of amino acids, small peptides, nucleotides etc). This homogenate was named Transfer
      - factor (TF). One dose of lyophilized drug contains: Leucocyti dialysatum 200 x 10 6
      (contains various IFNs, ILs, chemokines, endorfins, heat shock protein etc)

        -  stimulates T H 1 response

        -  induces production of IL-1, IL-2

        -  activates chemotaxis of immunocompetent cells

        -  increases fagocytic activity

        -  activates antigen-presentation by APCs

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of transfer factor in decreasing rate and/or
      severity of infections in ACLF.
