      beclometasone/formoterol single inhaler in a twice daily regimen in patients with moderate to
      severe persistent asthma. Patients are randomised to receive either beclometasone/formoterol
      single inhaler (total daily dose: BDP/FF 400/24 mcg) or beclometasone CFC + formoterol DPI
      (total daily dose: BDP 1000 mcg + FF 24 mcg) or beclometasone CFC (total daily dose: BDP 1000
      mcg) during 24 weeks of treatment.
