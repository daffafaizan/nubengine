    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial using a
      non-inferiority comparison to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intra-articular
      injection of Durolane® vs Artz® in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either Durolane or Artz. All subjects will be followed up for 26
      weeks from the initial treatment.The screening period is expected to be up to 2 weeks in
      duration before the baseline visit. Each subject will provide a written informed consent and
      undergo a qualifying screening. Assessment at screening will include postero-anterior view of
      standing weight-bearing semi-flexed radiographs of the study knee. The osteoarthritis changes
      of the study knee will be graded 0,1,2,3 or 4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic
      scoring criteria. Radiographic assessment will be made by an assigned and well trained
      investigator at each study center. The study knee and contralateral knee will use the Likert
      WOMAC 5-point scoring for pain assessment.

      Physical examination of the knees and vital signs will be performed (this examination will be
      repeated at end).
