      plaques in these acute ischemic strokes.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to determine the clinical, sonographic, CT scanner and MRI characteristics of patients
           in constituted acute cerebral ischemia with carotid atherosclerotic plaque taking
           contrast to the doppler ultrasound.

        -  to explore of the plaque contrast enhancement at 6 months (new injection).
