      Uncertainty Management Intervention (PUMI) to improve the outcomes of children newly
      diagnosed with cancer and their parents. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      equivalent doses of either the PUMI or an Education/Support (ESO) group. Theoretically driven
      by Mishel's model of illness uncertainty, the PUMI will teach parents about uncertainty
      prevention and management through the use of medically-specific communication, information
      management, and problem-solving skills via in-clinic sessions and an online portal. Parents
      and children will complete measures online at baseline, 1-week, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month
      follow-ups.
