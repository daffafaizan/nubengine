      reduce pain, and maintain an optimal environment healing promotion. Biocellulose is an
      ultrafine fiber structure that can hold a large amount of water and has a cooling effect that
      decreases pain without causing an allergic reaction or irritation.Silk sericin (SS) can
      activate the growth of fibroblast cells which promote collagen type I production and
      accelerated wound healing without toxicity . Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a broad
      spectrum antimicrobial agent with high efficacy and low toxicity. Therefore, the combination
      of silk sericin and PHMB in biocellulose dressings would benefit STSG donor site wound
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of this dressing
      for STSG donor site wound treatment compared with Bactigras® (chlorhexidine acetate 0.5% in
      white soft paraffin), which is the standard dressing for this type of wound at King
      Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, by monitoring the time required for complete
      re-epithelization, wound quality, the rate of infection, pain, and the adverse events from
      December 2015 to November 2016. Thirty two subjects (more than 18 years) with STSG donor site
      at thigh will be recruited in this study. Block randomization will be used for separation
      half of eligible wound to cover with novel biocellulose wound dressing containing silk
      sericin and PHMB or Bactigras®. Wound healing time is the day that the dressing detaches by
      itself with no exudate and air contacted pain. Wound quality at 1,3,and 6 months will be
      measured in terms of erythema level, melanin level, transepidermal water loss by using
      Cutometer® and scar quality (vancouver scar scale). Sign of infection, pain (VAS score),
      hepatic and renal function will also be collected.
