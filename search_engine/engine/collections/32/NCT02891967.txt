      with resin composite and each increment will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with
      the light curing unit (XL 3000; 3M/eSPe), with an energy higher than 450 mW/cm² (±50 mw/cm²)
      and other group of cavities will be restored by bulk fill composite (3M ESPE) as one
      increment then will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with the light curing unit.

      Articulation will be checked carefully with an articulating paper and occlusal adjustments
      will be performed using flame shaped carbide and diamond finishing burs (DENTSPLY) using
      water spray, restorations will be finished occlusally with finishing burs and finally
      polished with aluminium oxide polishing paste and a rubber cup (DENTSPLY).
