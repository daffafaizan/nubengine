      varying. The purpose of the study is to explore if one rehabilitation option is preferable to
      one other for patients with acute PCL injury, by examining whether there will be differences
      in laxity in the knee joints and patient-reported knee function by three different
      rehabilitation protocols. A randomized controlled trial with 75 patients enrolled will be
      followed up 3 and 12 months after injury. The groups will be compared using kneelaxity
      (stress - X) and subjective knee function (KOOS, IKDC-2000) to indicate whether one
      rehabilitation alternative is preferable in terms of less knee joint laxity and improve knee
      function. Participants considered included in the study if he or she agrees to participate in
      the study by signing the informed consent. Inclusion criteria will be whether the patient has
      an acute isolated PCL injury. Exclusion is additional injuries of ligaments, cartilage and
      meniscus of the knee. Randomization to groups is done continuously.
