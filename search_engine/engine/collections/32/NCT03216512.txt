      administration of noise cancelling headphones or sham headphones on two separate study days.
      Following screening and a baseline assessment session with no headphones, participants will
      be assigned to complete each experimental session. During each session, they will undergo the
      CANTAB and Academic tasks. The order of sessions will be randomized and balanced across
      participants to be either noise-cancelling headphones first followed by sham headphones; or
      sham headphones first followed by noise-cancelling headphones. Eligible participants
      currently taking stimulant medications for ADHD will be asked to stop taking their medication
      on the day of the baseline visit and during the 2 experimental sessions.
