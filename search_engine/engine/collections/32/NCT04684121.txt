    
      Multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, within-subject Vehicle
      controlled, safety and efficacy trial involving subjects with two comparable (similar body
      location, similar burn area and burn severity), noncontiguous deep second-degree thermal
      burns of less than 20% TBSA. A total of 30 subjects will have two target burns randomly
      assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to two treatment groups.

        -  Granexin® gel (200 μM) plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM

        -  Vehicle gel plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM

      The study procedures are divided into the following three periods:

        -  Screening (within 36 hours of the time of injury)

        -  Treatment (daily for 10 days)

        -  Follow-up (Day 10 through Month 12)

      The anticipated total duration of a given subject's participation in this study is 12 months.
      Screening can occur up to 36 hours prior to Day 0; Screening and Day 0 may occur on the same
      day. Treatment period visits occur daily from Day 0 through Day 9, on-site and remotely.
      During the treatment period, each subject will be treated with Granexin® gel (200 μM) plus
      ACTICOAT Flex 3TM on one target burn and Vehicle gel plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM on the second
      target burn. After Day 9, the subject will return to clinic on Day 10 and be followed-up
      (on-site or remotely) every other day thereafter until Day 28, with on-site visits on Days
      14, 20, and 28. The subject will then return to the clinic for follow-up visits at Months 6,
      9, and 12.

      Safety will be assessed during the study by monitoring adverse events and measuring vital
      signs at each on-site visit, electrocardiograms (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests at
      selected time points before and after treatment with Granexin® gel and Vehicle gel.
      Concomitant medications will be reviewed at every visit.
