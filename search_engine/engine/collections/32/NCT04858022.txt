      of visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment via telepractice followed by a 10-week period of no
      treatment, or the same two conditions in the reverse order. Production accuracy will be
      assessed with standard probes (20 syllables, 30 words, and 10 sentences containing /r/ in
      various phonetic contexts) administered prior to the beginning of treatment (baseline), after
      the first 10-week phase, and again at the end of the study.
