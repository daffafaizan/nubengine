    
      This is an open-label, pilot study , to determine if Exendin-(9-39), an antagonist of the
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor with effects on the pancreatic beta cells, increases
      fasting blood glucose levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism. Our overall
      hypothesis is that abnormal GLP-1 secretion resulting from dysfunctional nutrient sensing in
      intestinal L-cells plays a role in the dysregulated insulin secretion characteristic of this
      disorder, and that antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor will increase fasting blood glucose
      levels.

      Aim 1. To evaluate the dose of exendin-(9-39) required to elevate fasting blood glucose
      levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism due to KATP channel mutations.

      Aim 2. To determine therapeutic plasma levels, plasma half-life and pharmacokinetics of
      exendin-(9-39) during an intravenous short-term infusion in subjects with congenital
      hyperinsulinism due to Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (KATP)
      mutations.
