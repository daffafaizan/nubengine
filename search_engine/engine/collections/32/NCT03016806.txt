      designed to validate the process of umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation at our
      institution. Enrolled patients will receive chemotherapy +/-total body radiation as a
      pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then receive cord blood stem cells
      followed by GvHD prophylaxis that will include Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil, or
      Cyclosporin A and Methylprednisolone. Multiple data points will be collected prior to,
      during, and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and to evaluate the
      stated objectives.
