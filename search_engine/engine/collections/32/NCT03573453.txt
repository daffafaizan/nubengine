      admitted to our ICU from the 1st of June 2018 to the 31st of May 2019 will be enrolled after
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria and in the absence of any exclusion criteria. Informed
      consent will be requested. Enteral nutrition will be administered via nasogastric of
      orogastric tube. Patients will be randomised in 2 groups. In the group of patients receiving
      continuous feeding will be enteral nutrition administered via enteral feeding pump for at
      least 16 hours par day. In the group of patients receiving intermittent feeding will be
      enteral nutrition administered as 30-60minutes lasting bolus via enteral feeding pump 6 times
      per day. Following the administration of the bolus the patient will be placed for 30 minutes
      in semi-upright sitting position. Enteral nutrition requirement and composition will be
      standardised with the adoption of international guidelines. In 5 subsequent days from the
      enteral nutrition commencement will be examined if there is a difference in achieving energy
      and protein targets, tolerance and number of complications of enteral nutrition in between
      both groups. As achievement of energy and protein targets will be considered at least 80% of
      calculated values. The tolerance of enteral nutrition will be evaluated by the clinical
      examination of the abdomen, presence of diarrhoea, vomiting and the gastric residual volume
      of at least 0,5 liter. As the complications of enteral nutrition will be regarded the
      aspiration of gastric contents and ventilator associated pneumonia. Nutritional status
      parameters will be analysed. the length of hospital stay, ICU length of stay and 28-day
      mortality will be also monitored.
