      chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and metabolic abnormalities associated with PCOD in
      women. IR could be the underlying pathogenesis of chronic hypospermatogenesis leading to
      oligospermia and azoospermia associated with other metabolic abnormalities in men. Metformin
      has proven as an effective medication for not only IR but several other aspects of the PCOD
      including reproductive abnormalities. Therefore, insulin sensitizers, particularly metformin
      can be introduced as a pharmaceutical option for unexplained oligozoospermia and azoospermia
      associated with insulin resistance.
