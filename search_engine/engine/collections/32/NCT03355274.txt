      subjects will be included.

      After signing the consent, the subject will have a clinical and paraclinical examination.
      Age, sex, height, weight, side of clinical symptomatology will be collected. Medical history
      current treatments will also be noted.

      The examination of transcutaneous oximetry dynamic measurement with palmar face of both
      forearms during two consecutive maneuvers known as the "candlestick" (hands up). The most
      symptomatic arm value in patients and the dominant arm in the control group will be noted. In
      case of DROP between 0 and -25 mmHg, in addition to the maneuvering of the "candlestick", the
      other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos, Tinel and Adson will be realized.

      The results of any additional examinations and / or pre- and post-operative consultations
      will be collected.

      Subjects complete two Quality of Life questionnaires: the SF-12 (Short Form 12) and the DASH
      questionnaire (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand).

      Added by an amendment : Photoplethysmography has already done its proofs to determine the
      thoracic outlet syndrome diagnotic. Combine with a camera Kinect, they should determine the
      angle of appearance of compression in the 3 dimensions of space.
