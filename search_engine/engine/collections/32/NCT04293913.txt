      ventilator support increases patient satisfaction and reduces communication difficulties.
      However, there was no randomized controlled clinical study showing the effect of the use of
      these materials on patient care outcomes such as anxiety and comfort level.Patients were
      randomly assigned to the control groups using illustrated communication material and
      intervention and routine communication methods. The research was carried out in three stages:
      preoperative, intensive care and one day after surgery. The primary outcomes of the study
      were pain, anxiety and comfort levels of the patients. Secondary outcomes were the patients'
      satisfaction with hemodynamic parameters and communication method.
