      Republic of Ireland in 2013. The aims of the project were twofold: to implement DBT in
      Community Mental Health Services across Ireland and to evaluate this coordinated
      implementation of DBT at a national level.

      DBT was initially formulated as a treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) which
      is typically characterised by patterns of emotional and behavioural dysregulation that often
      manifests in self-harm and suicidal ideation. DBT is noted to be an intervention with a
      growing evidence base that demonstrates its effectiveness in treating individuals with BPD.
      More than a dozen controlled trials have been completed at multiple independent sites. The
      results of these trials have reported a reduction in suicidal behaviours, inpatient
      hospitalisations, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation among other constructs which
      individuals with BPD experience.

      While the efficacy of DBT has been demonstrated through multiple controlled trials, few
      studies have examined the effectiveness of DBT in community mental health settings. In
      particular, no study has evaluated a coordinated national implementation of DBT across
      multiple sites in a publicly funded health system. The current study aims to evaluate the the
      coordinated implementation of DBT in Community Mental Health Services in Ireland
