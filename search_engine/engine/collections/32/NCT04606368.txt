      and submentum areas. This will be measured by conducting a treatment using the Thermage FLX
      system on the lower face and submentum area of the participants. Biopsies will be done on
      several locations throughout the 12 week trial to assess skin laxity through laboratory
      measures. Finally, the subject will be asked to complete questionnaires to provide
      satisfaction and tolerability feedback.
