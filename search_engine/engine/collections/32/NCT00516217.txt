      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate (complete and overall response) in patients with relapsed
           or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with galiximab.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients with relapsed or refractory HL.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of galiximab in patients with relapsed or
           refractory HL.

        -  To determine if FDG-PET correlates with outcome in patients with relapsed or refractory
           HL treated with galiximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive galiximab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and
           22 in month 1.

        -  Extended induction therapy: Patients receive galiximab IV over 60 minutes once every
           four weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also undergo FDG-PET/CT imaging at baseline and at time of first restaging (within 7
      days prior to week 8 treatment).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.
