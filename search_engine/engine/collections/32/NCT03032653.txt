      ankle fractures are among the most common of all fractures, with an incidence averaging 4.2
      per 1,000 individuals annually. These fractures range from minimal injuries amenable to
      non-surgical management to complex injuries with potential of long-term sequelae. Known risk
      factors for ankle fractures are age, body mass index and previous ankle fracture, with the
      highest incidence in elderly women.

      Most ankle fractures are low-energy injuries which occur when the body rotates about a
      planted foot, whether it be during sports, normal gait, or otherwise. Stable ankle fractures
      are generally treated non-surgically, while unstable fractures are usually treated with
      surgical reduction and fixation, with indications previously well-described and published.

      However, the post-operative management of such injuries is still controversial, with large
      variability between care providers. Protocols range from complete immobilization of the
      affected ankle and non-weightbearing to early range-of-motion (ROM) and weightbearing (WB).
      Studies have compared immobilization and non-WB to early ROM and WB but results have been
      mixed, with the most recent study demonstrating safety and advantages to protected WB and ROM
      at two weeks post-operatively versus non-WB and immobilization for six weeks.

      The Investigators intend to expand on the studies above and propose a single-centre
      historical control group comparative study to compare outcomes of surgically-treated
      rotational ankle fractures and the current routine practice of early protected weightbearing
      and range of motion with immediate unprotected weightbearing as tolerated and range of motion
      after ankle open reduction and internal fixation.
