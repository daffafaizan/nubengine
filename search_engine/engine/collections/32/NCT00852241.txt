      treatment of the hollows in the under eye area. The combination of these treatments for use
      in the under eye area is considered investigational. An investigational therapy is a therapy
      that is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Restylane速 and Perlane速
      has been approved for treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as
      nasolabial folds by the FDA.
