    
      The GUIDE-HF IDE clinical trial is intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      CardioMEMSâ„¢ HF System in an expanded patient population including HF patients outside of the
      present indication, but at risk for future HF events or mortality.

      The trial includes patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III, or IV HF
      who have an elevated N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) (or an elevated
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)) and/or a prior HF hospitalization (HFH).

      The GUIDE-HF IDE trial will include approximately 3600 subjects at approximately 140 North
      American sites and consists of two arms: a Randomized Arm and a Single Arm.
