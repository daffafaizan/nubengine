      depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP). Individuals were categorized into three groups: individuals with
      clinically healthy periodontium (group 1), patients with chronic periodontitis (group 2), and
      group 3 consisted of the patients with chronic periodontitis (group 2), treated by scaling
      and root planning. GCF samples in grup 1 were taken at baseline. In group 2, GCF samples were
      taken before and after non- surgical periodontal treatment. Sclerostin, OPG and RANKL levels
      were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
