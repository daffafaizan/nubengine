      single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence under fasting condition.

      A washout period of 04 days was enforced between the administrations of study drugs in each
      period.. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours
      prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing. Blood sample
      collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose
      administration at periodic interval up to 24.00 hour in each period. A total number of blood
      draws during the study were fifty-four (54) and the total volume of blood drawn did not
      exceed 274 mL.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of Pantoprazole sodium
      delayed release tablets 40 mg of either test or reference drug product was administered
      during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature
      under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. Both test and
      reference drug products were administered to all the study subjects one in each period
