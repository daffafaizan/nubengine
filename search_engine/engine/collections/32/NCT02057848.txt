      without physical activity and in three experiments with a 4 km, 60 min hike starting at 2
      p.m., either administering 2 x 10 g or 2 x 20 g carbohydrates (muesli bars) before starting
      and at 30 min (during the hike). Plasma glucose was determined with a laboratory method and
      additional carbohydrates needed to treat hypoglycaemia between 2 and 8 p.m. were recorded.
