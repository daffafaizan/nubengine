    
      -  Explore several independent variables as potential independent predictors of vascular
           stiffness and endothelial function. These parameters include patient age, body mass
           index, gender, renal disease, history of cardiovascular disease, serum cholesterol, and
           antihypertensive medication use.

        -  Provide insight into nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function in the setting of
           increased arterial stiffness by determination of substances in the nitric oxide
           signaling pathway (specifically, levels of serum cGMP; serum nitrate and nitrite; and
           serum asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA], an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide
           synthase).

        -  Provide insight into changes in AGE levels and collagen metabolism in response to
           alagebrium therapy [specifically, AGEs: pentosidine, carboxymethyllysine,
           carboxyethyllysine, furosine; Collagen markers: procollagen I carboxyterminal propeptide
           (PICP), procollagen type I N terminal propeptide (PINP), cross-linked carboxyterminal
           telopeptide of Type I collagen (ICTP), n-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen
           (PIIINP)].

        -  Provide insight into changes in markers of inflammation in response to alagebrium
           therapy [specifically, free and total serum matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1), free
           tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
           (ICAM), P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWf), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
           high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs CRP)].
