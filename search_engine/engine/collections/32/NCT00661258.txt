    
      This study is a continuation of "Adherence for Life (AFL): Phase I: Exploratory Research"
      (H-25203), which focused on collecting and analyzing qualitative data on adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) among HIV-positive patients in Dali, Yunnan Province, China.
      Like Phase I, the AFL Pilot Study (Phases II and III) will be a collaborative effort between
      US researchers based in Boston, MA and Chinese researchers based in Beijing and Dali. The
      current study, Phases II and III, will focus on collecting and analyzing qualitative and
      quantitative data related to adherence to ART over a one-year time-frame and generating
      preliminary data on an intervention designed to improve adherence to ART among the study
      population. The questionnaires used in these phases of the study will draw on the results of
      Phase I as well as standardized instruments adapted to the Chinese context. The specific aims
      of the study are as follows: (1) To determine the best surrogate measure of ART adherence
      among the study population; (2) To determine ART adherence rates in this population; (3) To
      analyze the relationship between adherence factors and measured adherence rates; and (4) To
      generate preliminary effectiveness data on an intervention that makes use of electronic drug
      monitors (EDM) to improve ART adherence.
