      epidural space of lower limb amputees and steered laterally towards the dorsal spinal roots
      under fluoroscopic guidance. This approach is essentially identical to the FDA-cleared
      procedure in which these devices are placed in the lumbar epidural space for treatment of
      intractable low back and leg pain. In that procedure, it is common clinical practice to place
      2-3 leads temporarily in the epidural space through a percutaneous approach and perform a
      multiday trial to determine if the patient experiences any pain reduction from spinal cord
      stimulation. Following the trial, the percutaneous leads are surgically removed, and the
      patient is referred to a neurosurgeon for permanent surgical implantation.

      Similarly, in this study, the device will be tunneled percutaneously through the skin and
      anchored in place. Using the stylet included with the spinal cord stimulator leads, the
      devices will be steered laterally under fluoroscopic guidance to target the dorsal spinal
      nerves. During lab experiments, the leads will be connected to an external stimulator. In
      this study, the devices will remain in the epidural space for up to 90 days and will be
      surgically removed. Throughout the study, the investigators will perform a series of
      psychophysical evaluations to characterize the sensory percepts evoked by epidural
      stimulation, along with functional evaluations of the effects of stimulation on the ability
      to control a prosthetic limb. In addition, the investigators will perform surveys to
      characterize changes in phantom limb sensation and pain that occur during stimulation.
