      leads to improved survival. Butyrate proved to increase HbF production in vivo and in vitro
      studies. Nonetheless, its short half-life limited its utilization in clinical practice. Gum
      Arabic (GA) is edible, dried, gummy exudate from Acacia Senegal tree. GA fermentation by
      colonic bacteria increases serum butyrate concentrations. The investigators hypothesized
      regular intake of GA will increase serum butyrate level. The latter will induce fetal
      hemoglobin production and ameliorate patients' symptoms. 47 patients hemoglobin SS aged 5-42
      years, on regular follow up in Military hospital were recruited from April 2014 to January
      2015 Patients received dose of G A 30g/day for 12 weeks. Hb F, complete blood count and
      Erythropoietin level were measured. The main outcome of interest was the level of HbF after
      12 weeks.
