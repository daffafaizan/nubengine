      surgery: a control group (CG) in which standard haemodynamic monitoring was used, and a study
      group (SG) in which extended haemodynamic monitoring was applied with appropriate
      intraoperative interventions. Differences in intraoperative fluid management, hospital stay,
      and postoperative morbidity were observed.
