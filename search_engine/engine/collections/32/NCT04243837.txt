    
      Part 1: This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose
      design to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profile of multiple doses of LYT-100
      administered under fed conditions at steady state in healthy participants. Up to 4 dosing
      cohorts are planned.

      Part 2: A dose level below the MTD in Part 1 will be used in Part 2. Subjects will be
      administered a single dose of their assigned treatment under fasting conditions followed by a
      wash out period then they will receive a single dose of the same assigned treatment under fed
      conditions. This will permit a comparison of the PK profile and bioavailability in both fed
      and fasted states. .

      Part 3: Once the optimal dose and regimen is determined with or without food, Part 3 will
      follow with a randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled design that will assess the
      safety, tolerability, and secondarily clinical efficacy of LYT-100 over a period of up to
      6-months of dosing in breast carcinoma patients with secondary lymphoedema following sentinel
      lymph node biopsy and/or axillary node dissection, with or without radiation.
