      diseases in mice, prolonged fasting is difficult to implement in human-beings for the safety
      and feasibility reasons.

      In this clinical trial, we will recruit metabolic and autoimmune diseases and then follow a
      traditional Chinese 21-day fasting-like diet process with extremely low calorie intake (about
      5% of normal diet) and prolonged fasting-like period. Blood, urine, stool samples will be
      collected on day 0 (baseline), day 4, day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 51 after it started up.
      Therefore we can examine the changes of disease-associated physical indexes and metabolic
      biomarkers pre and post the 21-day fasting-like diet.

      The purpose of the study is to ascertain the impact of the fasting-like diet during the 21
      days. The investigators hypothesize that the 21-day fasting-like diet can reduce the
      biomarkers associated with aging and age-related diseases and benefit for the treatment of
      metabolic and autoimmune diseases.
