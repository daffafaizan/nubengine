        -  Determine the antitumor activity of brostallicin, in terms of objective response, in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have failed one
           prior chemotherapy treatment.

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate clinical outcome with whole blood glutathione level in patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor (tumors
      other than gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) vs GIST).

      Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58-72 patients (40 for stratum I and 18-32 for stratum II) will
      be accrued for this study.
