      surviving 5 years after diagnosis. Most PDAC is advanced and not amenable to curative
      therapies at the time of diagnosis, owing to lack of symptoms in early disease, nonspecific
      symptoms when they do develop resulting in a delay in diagnosis. Identifying biomarkers of
      early PDAC could facilitate screening for individuals at higher than average risk and
      expedite the diagnosis in individuals with symptoms and substantially improve an individual's
      chance of surviving the disease.

      The investigators propose a longitudinal study of subjects at higher than average risk of
      PDAC in order to generate clinical data and bank serial blood specimens. Subjects will
      include individuals with family history of pancreas cancer, individuals with cystic pancreas
      lesions or chronic pancreatitis, and individuals with new-onset diabetes. Identifying
      specific biomarkers - blood markers and/or a clinical "prodrome" - in participants who go on
      to develop PDAC could improve the diagnostic approach outcomes for patients diagnosed with
      PDAC.
