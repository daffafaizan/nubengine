      disease onset at early puberty. It can lead to serious health problems and is associated with
      low bone mass which can persist with growth. Osteopenia is found to be an important
      prognostic factor for curve progression in AIS. Nutritional studies indicated AIS subjects
      had low dietary calcium intake. Evidences suggested that Vit D insufficiency could be present
      in AIS. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can therefore be a viable treatment option for
      low bone mass in AIS subjects. The primary objective of this prospective randomized
      double-blinded placebo-controlled trial is to find out whether calcium and vitamin D
      supplementation can improve bone mineral density (BMD) in osteopenic AIS subjects. The
      secondary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the supplementation is effective in
      controlling curve progression in AIS.
