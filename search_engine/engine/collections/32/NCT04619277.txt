      better long-term outcomes when used for PCI of in-stent restenosis (ISR) compared to plain
      old balloon angioplasty (POBA) or additional stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES). DCB-only
      approach studies for de novo coronary lesion cases are scarce, but a recent registry data
      suggested it was a feasible and well-tolerated treatment method if the pre-dilation result is
      good. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy in terms of
      angiographic and clinical outcomes of a DCB-only approach for de novo coronary lesions.
