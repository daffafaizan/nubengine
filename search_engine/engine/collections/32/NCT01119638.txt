      the most distressing manifestations of dementia. The evidence-based management of these
      symptoms includes the search for treatable physical and environmental precipitants, support
      and psychoeducation for primary caregivers and psychosocial interventions. Nevertheless,
      pharmacotherapy is frequently used and especially in institutional settings. Current
      guidelines recommend the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Nonetheless, there
      are concerns regarding both their safety and effectiveness in patients with dementia. Recent
      research has resulted in a 'black-box" warning concerning the safety of using SGAs for BPSD.
      Sparse and inconclusive evidence support the use of other psychoactive agents such as SSRI
      antidepressants or cognitive enhancers.

      In two published randomized controlled trials, citalopram was more efficacious than placebo
      and as efficacious as, but better tolerated than perphenazine or risperidone in patients with
      dementia hospitalized for the treatment of agitation or psychosis.

      Thus, with proven efficacy and a beneficial safety profile the evaluation of the use of
      escitalopram for BPSD is warranted.

      A 6-week parallel groups, randomized, controlled trial in patients with dementia hospitalized
      because of behavioral symptoms will be conducted at the Abarbanel MHC.

      Participants will be consecutively recruited on an inpatient unit. Randomization will be
      based on a table of random numbers held centrally by an uninvolved physician.

      The study will be of a "double-blind" design. All medications in identical packaging will be
      distributed to the ward from a central pharmacy.
