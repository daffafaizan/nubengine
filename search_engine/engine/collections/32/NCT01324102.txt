      its treatment are associated with long term mental and physical side effects that impair
      physical, vocational, and social role functioning. In order to provide excellent care for
      Veterans, rehabilitative strategies to improve mental and physical health after cancer
      treatment need empirical study. The objective of the proposed pilot project is to create a
      Veterans' Yoga Rehabilitation Program for cancer survivors who receive care in the Veterans
      Health Administration, that is based on an existing evidence based protocol which is
      systemically adapted, marketed, and tested in a Veteran population, with 3 aims:

      Aim 1: Enhancing Acceptability To determine factors that will increase participation in Yoga
      in Veterans after treatment for cancer, who are primarily male and older than age 60.

      Aim 2: Adapting to Veterans To create a Yoga protocol by adapting an empirically supported
      Yoga protocol to the needs of Veterans.

      Aim 3: Evaluating Efficacy To evaluate the efficacy of the Yoga protocol for improving health
      related quality of life in four domains, and, to determine if efficacy varies as a function
      of patient age or pre-existing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The long term goal is to
      develop an evidence based mind-body Yoga intervention to support healing and restore function
      in Veterans Health Administration patients for use after treatment for cancer.
