      Biological agents aiming to reduce lung volume by blocking off the most emphysematous areas
      with a rapidly polymerizing sealant. The mechanism of action involves resorption atelectasis
      from airway occlusion, subsequent airspace inflammation, and then remodeling. This remodeling
      will lead to scarring that induces contraction of lung parenchyma and functional volume
      reduction can be expected within 6-8 weeks. Biological lung volume reduction occurs
      independent of the presence or absence of collateral ventilation.
