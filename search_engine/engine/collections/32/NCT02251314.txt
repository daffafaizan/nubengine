    
      Study population: BRAF mutant melanoma patients

      Pre-mortem bloods will be taken from the patient on three occasions at one to thirty days
      apart from each other, with the first blood draw taking place on the patient's first clinic
      visit. Six 7 ml EDTA and one 6 ml SST vacutainers of blood (a total of approx. 50 ml of
      blood) will be taken from the patient.

      When death is expected within the next 48-72 hours, the Medical Oncologist/ Radiation
      Oncologist/ Hematologist OR delegate will revisit the RAP process with the patient and/or
      family/substitute decision maker to ensure that they are still in agreement. The patient and
      the families will also be provided with an additional consent form for participation
      including blood sampling.
