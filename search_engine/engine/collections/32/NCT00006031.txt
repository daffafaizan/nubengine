      needle localized breast biopsy on operative time and tissue loss in patients with nonpalpable
      breast lesions. II. Compare the cost effectiveness of these diagnostic methods in these
      patients. III. Demonstrate that radioactive seed localization allows for elimination of
      specimen x-ray in these patients. IV. Demonstrate that radioactive seeds may be placed safely
      for 1-7 days prior to surgical removal in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two diagnostic arms.
      Arm I: Patients undergo radiographic placement of a radioactive seed (either iodine I 125 or
      palladium Pd 103) into the suspicious lesion. Patients then undergo surgery to remove the
      lesion along with the seed and a small margin of surrounding breast tissue followed 3 months
      later by a postoperative mammogram. Arm II: Patients undergo a needle localized breast biopsy
      with a specimen x-ray.
