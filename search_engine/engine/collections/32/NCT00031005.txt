      are profoundly immunocompromised and plagued early in life with recurrent and often life
      threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly improves immune
      function in patients LAD however severe toxicities are associated with conventional
      approaches to treatment. The primary objective of this phase II study is to investigate
      efficacy of a novel approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation that is designed to
      promote partial or complete donor stem cell engraftment (hematopoietic chimerism) with
      reduced transplant morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to reduce toxicity from
      pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning, a highly immunosuppressive, low intensity bone
      marrow conditioning regimen will be used. Patients will be transplanted with peripheral blood
      stem cells from an HLA identical family member. T-lymphocytes will be removed from the stem
      cell graft in an attempt to decrease the risk of graft vs host disease. Donor T-cells will be
      infused at various time points following the transplant to augment donor hematopoietic
      chimerism and aid in immune reconstitution. The primary end points of this study are the
      establishment of donor hematopoietic chimerism, acute and chronic graft versus host disease,
      and transplant related mortality.
