    
      AMG 199 is a novel half-life extended (HLE) bispecific T cell engager (BiTEÂ®) molecule
      designed to direct T cells towards MUC17-expressing cells. This is a first-in-human study in
      adult subjects with MUC17-positive gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer,
      to assess AMG 199 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity, with
      additional exploratory objectives to assess pharmacodynamics (PD), correlative biomarker
      analysis, and immunogenicity.

      The primary end point is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 199 in adult
      subjects, and determine the MTD and RP2D. The secondary end point is characterize the PK and
      anti-tumor activity of AMG 199.
