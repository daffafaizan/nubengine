      preliminary behavioral impact of NDURE (Navigation for Disparities and Untimely Radiation
      thErapy), our multi-level, theory-based navigation intervention to improve timely, equitable
      post-operative radiation treatment (PORT) among Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients. We
      hypothesize that NDURE will be feasible, acceptable, improve the timeliness of PORT for white
      and African American (AA) HNC patients and decrease disparities in delay between the two
      groups by improving system-, interpersonal-, and individual-level health behavior constructs.
