      criteria within 8-28 days before start of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
      administration (Visit 1; Screening Visit). At Visit 2 (Day -7) a kinetigraph device (the
      Parkinson's KinetiGraphâ„¢, Global Kinetics Corporation, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) was
      attached to the right or left wrist (the parkinsonian dominant side) and baseline patient
      movement data were recorded during a run-in period of seven consecutive days.

      Following baseline assessments at Visit 3 (Day 1) patients were randomized to receive IRL790
      or placebo (3:1). The treatment allocation was double-blinded, i.e. it was not disclosed to
      the patients, the site staff or the Sponsor. During the treatment period, Visits 4-8 were
      performed on Days 4, 7, 10, 14 and 28 (end of treatment) and a follow-up phone call was
      performed on Day 21. Dose adjustments of IRL790 could be made until Day 14, following
      pre-defined criteria. A follow-up visit (Visit 9) was performed 7-10 days after the last IMP
      dose.
