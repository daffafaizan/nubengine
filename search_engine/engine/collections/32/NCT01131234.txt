    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (equivalent to the recommended phase
      II dose), and safety profile of RO4929097 (gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097) in
      combination with cediranib (cediranib maleate) in patients with advanced malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for RO4929097 when administered alone and for
      RO492907 and cediranib in combination, in order to evaluate for interactive effects in PK (if
      any) between these two agents.

      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of RO492907 when administered alone and in
      combination, with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need
      further exploration and validation in future trials.

      III. To assess for preliminary antitumor efficacy of this drug combination, especially in
      breast cancer, malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, high
      grade glioma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3,
      8-10, and 15-17 (days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17 22-24, 29-31, and 36-38 of course 1) and cediranib
      maleate PO QD on days 1-21 (days 22-42 course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
