      rate of opioids prescribed, distributed, and deaths from opioid overdoses continue to
      increase steadily. Opioids also have the costs of abuse, dependence, diversion of unused
      medication, and can serve as a gateway to other illegal substances. Opioid use often begins
      with treatment of acute postoperative pain, and the surgical episode can be a 'gateway' to
      the opioid crisis. Opioids remain ubiquitous in patients undergoing surgical procedures.
      Among opioid-na√Øve patients, persistent use after surgery occurs in 6-10%.

      Ambulatory surgery cases are rarely mentioned in the context of this public health crisis,
      but are a major contributor to the problem. Opioids are ubiquitous after ambulatory anorectal
      surgery and prescribed in large quantities, often several times more than what is needed or
      taken by patients. As patients take a fraction of the opioids prescribed, this adds to issues
      of opioid diversion. In colorectal surgery, ambulatory anorectal procedures are common and
      frequent procedures, with the potential to impact a large number of patients when
      implementing quality improvement. Thus, study into ERAS and ways to reduce opioids after
      ambulatory anorectal surgery is warranted.

      This application challenges the notion that inpatient surgery should be the only target for
      enhanced recovery and opioid interventions. It seeks to shift the clinical practice paradigm
      that extended opioids are necessary after ambulatory anorectal surgery. This new application
      of ERAS to ambulatory anorectal surgery could address a critical barrier to progress in
      reducing opioids in procedures that are common but underrepresented in current research.
