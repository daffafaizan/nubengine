    
      The study is a prospective phase II, single arm, open label trial evaluating Stereotactic
      Ablative Radiation Therapy (SAbR) for patients with oligo-progressive RCC (Renal Cell
      Cancer).

      Problem Statements:

        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) for oligoprogression delay the change of systemic therapy if
           progression is minimal to the progressive sites?

        -  Safely delaying the change of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life
           benefits for patients with oligo-progressive RCC.

        -  Can SAbR potentially improve progression free survival in oligoprogressive RCC patients?

      Primary Endpoint:

      â€¢ Time to change of systemic therapy.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  To measure the toxicity, safety and tolerance.

        -  To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) on subsequent systemic therapy after
           progression on SAbR.

        -  To measure the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

        -  To evaluate local control of SAbR for RCC

      Sample Size: 20 Patients

      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along
      with the 95% confidence interval.
