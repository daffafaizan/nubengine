      fasting (POF) and exercise program could impact hyperglycemia and other adverse metabolic
      consequences of PI3 kinase inhibitors in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      Women who exercise regularly and who have lower levels of blood sugar and metabolic hormones
      like insulin have a lower risk of developing breast cancer. Some evidence also suggests that
      exercise and metabolism are related to cancer recurrence in women who are diagnosed with
      breast cancers that can be removed with surgery, but less is known about how exercise and
      metabolic factors are related to cancer progression in women whose cancer has advanced beyond
      the breast and underarm lymph nodes. This study is designed to look at the effects of
      exercise combined with prolonged nightly fasting (having a longer time between dinner and
      breakfast the next day), on blood sugar and hormones that control metabolism. This study
      looks to provide important information about whether making these kinds of changes is
      possible for women living with advanced breast cancer and will explore how making these
      changes effects blood sugar and hormone levels in women taking different kinds of treatments
      for advanced breast cancer.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, a baseline visit to collect
      information about diet and exercise habits, a baseline blood draw, participation in a 12-week
      diet and exercise program, and a follow up visit and blood collection at the end of the diet
      and exercise program.

      Participants will be in this research study for up to 14-weeks, including the baseline and
      end of study visits to collect study measures.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study
