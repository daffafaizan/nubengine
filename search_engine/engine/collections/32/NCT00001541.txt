      inflammation frequently occur. The purpose of this investigation is to analyze bronchial and
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis for the presence of
      immunoregulatory mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will also be examining mucosal
      biopsies in these patients to define the histologic changes, the phenotype of infiltrating
      leukocytes, and the pattern of adhesion molecule expression that may be present. Such studies
      could lead to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and of its
      pulmonary manifestations and provide potential directions for future therapy.
