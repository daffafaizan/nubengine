      tools, but their use carries the potential risk of serious postoperative complications.
      NMBD-induced muscle weakness that lingers into the postoperative period, known as
      postoperative residual curarization (PORC), is present in as many as 40% of all patients that
      receive neuromuscular blocking agents. Physiological data suggest that PORC impairs normal
      respiratory function, and compelling evidence suggests PORC impairs clinical recovery in the
      immediate postoperative period and prolongs PACU length of stay. However, despite the
      widespread use of NMBDs and the frequent occurrence of PORC, limitations in the literature
      prevent an understanding of their full impact on clinical outcomes. This study will collect
      data about patients who receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of
      PORC.

      The incidence of PORC and postoperative complications after the introduction of monitoring in
      the PACU will be determined by measuring TOF ratios and tracking the postoperative outcomes
      in the surgical patients over time.
