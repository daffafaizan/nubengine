      abdominal wall pain will be considered for study recruitment.

      Following informed consent, patients will complete a baseline questionnaire in the Pain
      Clinic which gathers basic demographic data, pain scores and functional scores. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either a TAP injection or a TPI. Because the TAP injection involves
      a larger area to be anesthetized, a larger volume of medication will be used.

      Thirty minutes after the injection, a sensory exam will be performed on the patient to
      determine the level of block. At one week, one month, three months and six months after the
      injection, a staff member will telephone the patient to assess how they are doing. The call
      will take approximately 10 minutes and will consist of relaying a pain score as well as daily
      functioning and sleep questions.

      Subjects are responsible for all clinical costs associated with the injection.

      There is no remuneration offered for study participation.
