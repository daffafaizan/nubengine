      wireless sensors for blood pressure, blood glucose, body weight, blood oxygen saturation,
      peak expiratory flow and electrocardiogram. Disease related parameters are monitored at least
      daily and the measured values are transmitted to a central monitoring unit. In case of
      abnormal values, health alarms are generated and transmitted to the local health authorities
      to trigger eventual intervention by the physicians and nurses who normally follow the
      participants. Participants and health professionals can stay in contact via an easy to use,
      home television based videoconferencing system. Participants are also equipped with a a
      personal alarm and GPS-enhanced localisation system.
