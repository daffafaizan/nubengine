    
      A prospective, randomised, parallel, open-label trial, study in malnourished care home
      residents, without obvious dementia, to compare the effects of two common forms of
      nutritional support; dietary advice (DA) and oral nutritional supplements (ONS), on quality
      of life (QoL) and other outcomes including weight, nutritional intake and appetite. The
      residents were randomised to receive either DA provided by a dietitian or ONS for a period of
      12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was QoL and the secondary outcome measure was dietary
      intake.
