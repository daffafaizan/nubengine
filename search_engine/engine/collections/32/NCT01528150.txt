      dimensional images of the body. However, magnetic resonance imaging systems generate three
      electromagnetic fields that are used to produce an image. These include a static magnetic
      field, a time varying gradient magnetic field, and a radiofrequency field. All three of these
      fields interact with implanted devices and could create hazards for the device, the patient,
      or both. Due to these issues, currently marketed pacemaker systems may be contraindicated for
      use in an MRI environment.

      St. Jude Medical has developed a system, the Accent MRI™ system, comprised of the Accent MRI™
      device and the Tendril MRI™ lead, and an investigational MRI Activator™, designed to mitigate
      such interactions.
