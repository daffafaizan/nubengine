    
      Patients with Type 2 diabetes who have severe insulin resistance and very large insulin
      requirements (over 1.4 units of insulin /kg/day) often fail insulin regimens with persistent
      poor blood glucose control when standard U-100 insulin formulations are used. This is due in
      part to poor absorption of the large insulin volumes required using these less concentrated
      standard insulin preparations. The hypothesis that using a concentrated form of insulin
      called U-500 Regular insulin and delivering it by infusion via insulin pump will lower the
      volume of insulin required and therefore improve insulin absorption, which will lead to
      improved blood glucose control, will be tested.
