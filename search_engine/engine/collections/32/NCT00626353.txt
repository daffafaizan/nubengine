      standard care in stroke patients using an interventional, randomised, safety/efficacy
      open-label trial and parallel assignment. The setting was single-center, stroke unit at the
      University Hospital of Copenhagen, Gentofte, although patients were recruited through a
      collaboration of several municipalities.

      Participants were eligible patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke and focal
      neurological deficits hospitalised in a stroke unit for more than three days and in need of
      rehabilitation.

      Interventions patients were randomised to home-based rehabilitation during hospitalization
      and for up to 4 weeks after discharge to replace part of usual treatment and rehabilitation
      services. Control patients received treatment and rehabilitation following usual guidelines
      for the treatment of stroke patients.

      Main outcome measures 90 days post-stroke, modified Rankin Scale, and motor rehabilitation,
      cognitive abilities, quality of life and treatment-associated economy as secondary outcomes.
