      mandibular first molar were selected to participate in the study. The subjects were
      subdivided into one of 3 groups as follows: group 1 consisted of 20 subjects /20 molars where
      piezocision was performed immediately before molar protraction; group 2 consisted of 20
      subjects/ 20 molars where molar protraction was carried on after 3 months of molar
      protraction with no piezocision; group 3 consisted of 20 subjects (40 molars) where
      protraction was carried out with no piezocision.

      After reaching 0.019X0.025" SS arch wire, NiTi coil spring was used for space closure
      (protraction force was 150g) attached from the lower second molar hook to the head of the
      mini-screw. Piezocision was performed by making 2 vertical incisions mesial and distal to the
      extraction space. Piezotome was inserted in the incisions previously made and bone cuts were
      done with a length up to mucogingival line and depth of 3 mm. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      sample was obtained from the mesiogingival side of the lower second permanent molar with use
      of Periopaper. GCF sample was repeated 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks after molar protraction with
      piezocision or with no piezocision. Periodontal parameters were measured and lower molar root
      resorption was assessed using Perapical radiographs.
