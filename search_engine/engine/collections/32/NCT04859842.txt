      the etiology of low back pain. A certain etiological factor or pathophysiological mechanism
      cannot be found in 85-90% of the patients (1).

      Approximately 80% of those living in industrialized countries experience low back pain in
      some part of their lives. 10% of low back pain becomes chronic. It is believed that 1% of
      workforce losses are due to low back pain (2). This type of pain often occurs when the back
      muscles, tendons and ligaments are exposed to stress or strain. Mechanical back pains are
      chronic pain that often affects the lower part of the spine and radiates to the gluteal
      region. Since daily activities such as leaning, turning, lifting, standing and sitting for a
      long time increase the pain, the intensity of the pain increases during the day.

      Interferential current (IF) therapy is obtained from two medium frequency currents and is
      applied by delivering a low frequency current (for example 20 to 100 Hz) to the tissue.

      Pulsed ElectroMagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy, which is among physical therapy methods, is
      frequently used in the treatment of knee, hip and spine osteoarthritis symptoms. It is
      thought that magnetic field therapy improves the oxygen utilization of the cells and the
      erythrocytes release more oxygen under the influence of the magnetic field, thus having a
      positive effect on the circulatory system
