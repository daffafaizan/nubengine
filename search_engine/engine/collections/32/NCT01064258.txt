    
      Material and Methods: We will submit one normal (confirmed with two polysomnographies, PSG)
      subject to a double blind study. Pairs of PSG will be performed on successive days once a
      week, one night with a 4 cm water fixed pressure CPAP device, previously shown not to disturb
      the subject's sleep and breathing, the other night with one of five well known autoCPAP
      devices programmed to work between 4 and 15 cm H2O pressure. The same mask and headgear will
      be used throughout the study. The subject and the physicians reading the tracings will ignore
      which device is being used on which night.
