      causing changes that can range from white lace-like patterns on the mucosa, to red atrophic
      changes to the presence of ulcerations. Symptoms can range from none to severe soreness that
      greatly interferes with eating. The etiology of lichen planus is not known, and because the
      tissue damage is mediated by immune cells, lichen planus is considered to be an autoimmune
      disease. Currently, the most common treatment for oral lichen planus (OLP) is use of systemic
      and/or topical steroids. These medications though efficacious have side-effects that limit
      the effectiveness of these treatments.

      Tumeric, which comes from the plant curcuma longa, has been used for centuries in Ayurveda
      (Indian traditional medicine) for its anti-inflammatory properties. In western scientific
      studies, including invitro studies, animal studies and human studies, components of tumeric
      called curcuminoids (which include, curcumin (diferuloyl methane), demethoxycurcumin, and
      bisdemethoxycurcumin) have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties and to be very
      safe, with few side-effects even at high doses.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether curcuminoids, which are safe, non-toxic
      compounds, can be used to control the signs and symptoms of OLP, a disease which can have
      serious morbidity, and for which current treatment has significant side-effects. If found to
      be efficacious, these tumeric extracts will aid patients with OLP in reducing symptoms and
      therefore the morbidity associated with OLP.
