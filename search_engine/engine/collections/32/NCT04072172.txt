      of women over 50 years old. Sclerotherapy as a traditional treatment for spider veins has a
      low cost, though it may have adverse sequelae. Lasers have shown fewer but still substantial
      complications as well.1 Spider veins are small superficial veins that widen and become
      visible, often on the legs and most cutaneous spider veins are abnormalities of the
      horizontal vascular skin plexus or capillary loops.2 Spider leg veins are composed of a
      feeder vessel and ectatic venous sprouts in the reticular dermis. Their depth is between 180
      Âµm and 1 mm in the skin.3 Spider veins may have a diameter that reaches several millimetres
      and can be blue, purple or red and may appear in the form of thin lines, webs or branches.4
      There is a scarce available data from literature about the role of micro-cauterization in the
      treatment of spider veins. The micro-cauterization is an alternative in management of spider
      veins that delivered via Mole Freckle Pen German Technology.4 Cautery is a safe and effective
      tool for the treatment of superficial and small skin lesions. It is simple, cheap, and
      requires minimal training and the results are usually satisfactory Technology Specifications
      with insulated micro steel needle use current: 5V / 1A of 5-speed free adjustment.5 The
      current study aims to evaluate the role for micro-cauterization in the treatment and
      disappearance of spider leg veins.
