    
      This longitudinal mechanistic randomized controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia (SZ)
      and matched healthy controls (HC) examines the underlying cause of self-agency deficits in SZ
      and their responsiveness to navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) of
      the medial prefrontal cortex. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach that combines
      structural MRI with functional magnetoencephalography imaging (MEGI) and nrTMS that is
      integrated with cognitive and clinical assessments, this research provides an unprecedented
      rigorous assessment of the neural and cognitive basis of self-agency and its modulation by
      nrTMS, using two distinct and validated paradigms involving speech monitoring (pitch
      perturbation) and reality monitoring.

      Subjects will first be assessed for 1 week for diagnostic inclusion criteria and eligibility
      assessment. They will complete baseline assessments (i.e., cognitive, clinical and daily
      functioning assessments, structural MRI, and MEGI scans while they perform reality and speech
      monitoring tasks). After baseline assessments, 80 SZ and 80 age, gender, and
      education-matched HC will be randomly assigned to 5 daily sessions of either active 10Hz
      nrTMS targeting mPFC (40HC and 40SZ) or nrTMS targeting a control posterior superior temporal
      site (pSTS) (40HC and 40SZ). For the pSTS site, the investigators will use the same TMS
      protocol parameters as the active nrTMS condition. Between and within group analyses will
      utilize repeated measures mixed-effects models to examine durability and generalizability of
      behavioral, cognitive, clinical and whole-brain neural oscillatory network changes (with
      focus on mPFC) after neuromodulation by active nrTMS at proximal, and distal post-nrTMS
      time-points, compared to control nrTMS of pSTS and baseline. Whole-brain correlations will be
      computed between neural activity (e.g., with focus on mPFC) related to self-agency during
      reality and speech monitoring tasks and behavior (e.g., self-generated retrieval accuracy and
      corrective response magnitude), and between neural activity with cognition, clinical symptoms
      and daily functioning).
