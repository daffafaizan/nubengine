      to high molecular weight HA (Aragan Plus, 20 mg/2 ml, 3000kDa) or low molecular weight HA
      (ARTZDispo, 25 mg/2.5 ml, 600-1200kDa) groups. With ultrasound guidance, total two-sessions
      of high or low molecular weight HA with one week interval will been injected into
      intra-carpal region. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire is assigned as primary
      outcome. The secondary outcomes encompass visual analog scale, electrophysiological studies,
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve, mobility of median nerve and absorption time of HA.
      The assessment is performed prior injection and at 2 week, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months
      post-injection.
