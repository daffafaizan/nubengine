      angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist, or allopurinol, a XO inhibitor, normalize
      chemoreflex control of sympathetic outflow and ventilation and improve local vascular
      regulation and stiffness; and 2) Determine if these interventions reduce the severity of
      sleep disordered breathing and lower diurnal blood pressure.
