      years. Eligible patients would be registered and randomly assigned to each group with an
      allocation ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint is local relapse-free survival. The secondary
      endpoints are overall survival, relapse-free survival, proportion of local relapse,
      proportion of distant relapse, proportion of patients with pathological R0 resection,
      response rate of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (preoperative chemoradiotherapy arm),
      pathological complete response rate (preoperative chemoradiotherapy arm), proportion of
      patients who completed the protocol treatment, incidence of adverse events (adverse
      reactions), and quality of life after surgery.
