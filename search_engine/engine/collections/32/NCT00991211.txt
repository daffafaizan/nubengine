    
      The 4 agent chemotherapy (CTX) CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine prednisone)
      in combination with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (CHOP-R) represents a
      standard CTX for the treatment of lymphomas of high or low malignancy. The combination of
      bendamustine and rituximab (B-R) is also highly effective with a more advantageous toxicity
      profile. If B-R could be shown to be non inferior to CHOP-R, this could improve the quality
      of life of the patient and possibly also the prognosis.
