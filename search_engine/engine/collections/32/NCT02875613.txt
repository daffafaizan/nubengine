    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of Avelumab for patients with recurrent/metastatic, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      Upon study entry, all patients will receive Avelumab 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Treatment will be given until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision or patient withdrawal. Dose
      interruptions may occur per pre-specified criteria for grade 3 or higher toxicity.
