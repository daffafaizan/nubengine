      brings with it a parallel increase in the associated cardiovascular disease complications.
      Correction of platelet hyperactivity holds promise for this high-risk population of T2D
      patients by contributing to restore normal hemostasis, which has lead to the search for new
      antiagregant drugs. Then, our aim was to study whether incretins may modulate platelet
      function; for this purpose platelets from healthy subjects who were not taken any medication
      were studied. Besides, normal mature megakaryocytes obtained by culture of human cord blood
      derived-CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were also studied.

      For platelet function studies, platelet aggregation was tested in the absence and presence of
      different concentrations (10-9 M to 10-5 M) of glucagon-like peptide-1,GLP1-(7-36)NH2, and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist by a turbidimetricassay. The
      effect of 300 mg/dLglucose added to the media was also evaluated. GLP1R (glucagon-like
      peptide 1 receptor) and GIPR (GIP receptor) mRNA expression was evaluated by Real Time PCR in
      platelet and megakaryocyte total mRNA. The putative presence of their proteins was assayed by
      western blot and flow cytometry in both samples.
