      center for pregnancy termination and its acceptability to women and to their providers. In
      addition, we plan to evaluate rates of follow-up, adherence, efficacy, complications, days of
      missed work and/or school, and lost income. This will be a prospective, comparative,
      non-randomized, open-label study. All women who are seeking medical abortion will be offered
      participation in the study. Women who enroll in the study will be given a choice between
      taking the mifepristone outside the center or in the center setting.
