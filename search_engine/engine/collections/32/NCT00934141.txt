      arms. The agencies were randomized to an intervention for 18 months with a 9 month
      sustainability period. The study aimed to: 1) Determine whether a state-based strategy can
      (with NIATx support) can lead mainstream treatment agencies to implement and sustain process
      changes that improve the study's primary outcomes: time to treatment, annual clinic
      admissions, and continuation in treatment; and 2) Evaluate the effectiveness and cost of the
      services making up NIATx. This study aims to create a practical model for improving
      efficiency and effectiveness of addiction treatment.
