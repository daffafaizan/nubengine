      Primary

      This cross-sectional prevalence study seeks to investigate the incidence and severity of oral
      health changes, specifically of periodontal conditions, among breast cancer survivors and the
      ways in which these outcomes affect their quality of life.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the prevalence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal women with
           early stage breast cancer using adjuvant AI therapy as compared to postmenopausal women
           not using adjuvant AI therapy.

        -  To determine if adjuvant AI therapy use is associated with greater alveolar bone loss or
           increased levels of bone turnover biomarkers in postmenopausal women with cancer
           undergoing adjuvant AI therapy compared to postmenopausal women not receiving AI
           therapy.

        -  To determine the oral health-related quality of life among postmenopausal women with
           early stage breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant AI therapy.
