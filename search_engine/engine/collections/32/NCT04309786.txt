      to understand the symptoms and severity of anxiety, disordered sleep, and somatization and
      how these parameters align with symptoms and quality of life in pediatric EoE. To assess the
      burden of these parameters in children with EoE, investigators will conduct a single center
      pilot study of 60 children with EoE using validated indexes for anxiety (state trait anxiety
      inventory for children), somatization (children's somatization inventory), sleep (pediatric
      sleep questionnaire), coping (Connor-Davidson Resilience Score) symptoms (PEESSv2.0), and
      quality of life (PedsQL-EoE).
