    
      Safety Run-In:

      To evaluate the safety of the addition of pembrolizumab (anti PD-1 immunotherapy) to
      re-irradiation with SBRT for patients with recurrent or new second primary head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      Phase II:

      To compare progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with recurrent or new second primary
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with SBRT re-irradiation with or without pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Safety Run-In: Patients receive SBRT over 2 weeks and then receive pembrolizumab every 3
      weeks for up to 2 years.

      Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive SBRT over 2 weeks and then receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up
      to 2 years.

      ARM II: Patients receive SBRT over 2 weeks. Arm II patients who experience progressive
      disease within 2 years after the start of SBRT will be allowed to cross over to receive
      pembrolizumab for up to 2 years.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
