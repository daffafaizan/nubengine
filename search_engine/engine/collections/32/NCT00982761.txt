      drivers' health is damaged by long-term sitting and driving, lack of exercise, stress from
      traffic, and irregular diet. The objectives of this study were to assess the health status of
      occupational drivers in Taiwan. The measures included blood pressure, central obesity,
      fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, body mass index (BMI), anxiety scale scores, and metabolic
      syndrome, etc.
