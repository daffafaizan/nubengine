      least one year following ablation (single procedure in 391, 87.9%) was followed for 66.0 Â±
      34.0 months. Patients were seen at least annually as outpatients, and underwent regular ECG
      monitoring, especially if there were symptoms suggestive of recurrent arrhythmia. Continued
      absence of arrhythmia was defined as freedom from AF or flutter > 30 secs.
