    
      As part of the PMA # P110039 review process and approval, InSightec was requested to conduct
      a post-approval study. Patients will be treated following the approved commercial treatment
      guidelines.

      For this study, participating sites will use the ExAblate device for the administration of
      the ExAblate treatment. This study will be performed on either 1.5T or 3T MR scanners.

      For this study, a total of 70 patients meeting the approved commercial guidelines will be
      enrolled and treated with the ExAblate system at from 7 to 10 sites. The proportion of
      responders is expected to be at least 30% greater than the proportion of subjects
      experiencing pain progression (i.e., 60% vs. 30%). Additionally, at the 3 month visit, an
      analysis of both the safety and efficacy profiles will be compared to the original PMA
      pivotal study group.
