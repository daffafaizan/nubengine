      receive all treatments). The investigational products will be given as single doses at
      separate treatment visits. Periods without Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), lasting for at
      least 36 hours, will separate treatment visits. Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be
      drawn before and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, as well as at 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, and
      10 hours after start of product administration. Used gums will be collected and analyzed to
      determine the amount of remaining nicotine. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any
      adverse events that may occur.
