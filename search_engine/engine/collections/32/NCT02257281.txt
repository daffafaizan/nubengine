      decades. In some recent systematic review, the evidence of clinical trials were
      insufficiency. We assumed the reaserch biasin clinical trials may be due to the different
      inflammatory level of soft tissue under the similar ultrasound intensity. Our purpose of
      study is to investigate the effect of therapeutic ultrasound for the inflammatory skin repair
      and whether the tissue repair under ultrasound treament is depend on different inflammatory
      level.
