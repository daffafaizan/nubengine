      cardio-cerebral vascular events in a large cohort of Chinese patients undergoing chronic
      hemodialysis. Between January 2008, consecutive patients with hemodialysis with aspirin were
      enrolled.We examine the association of aspirin with all-cause mortality in patients matched
      by propensity scores using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models in "intention-to-treat"
      analyses.The secondary endpoint was rate of cardio-cerebral events.
