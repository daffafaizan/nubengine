      historically been very limited. A significant body of research now supports the use of an
      upper extremity retraining approach for functional recovery after neurological injury. Few
      therapeutic approaches offer any intervention specifically focused on grasp and release
      retraining. In an effort to address this deficit, the SaeboFlex dynamic hand orthosis was
      developed by occupational therapists. The F.T.M. Arm Training Program has been safely used by
      hundreds of occupational and physical therapists on over one thousand patients in outpatient
      neurological rehabilitation over the last 2 years. It is currently an accepted modality of
      treatment for the management of hand paresis in the acquired brain injury outpatient
      population. Two factors, other than the severity of the initial injury, have been clinically
      identified as having a significant affect on the outcomes achieved in F.T.M. Arm Training
      treatment. They are learned non-use and soft tissue shortening of the finger flexors. All
      treatment delivered to the subjects that partake in this study will be clinical care and the
      only research component of this study will be the assessment of outcomes. The purpose of this
      study is to explore the potential patient population that may qualify to use the SaeboFlex
      Dynamic Hand Orthosis as a therapeutic option in the inpatient population.
