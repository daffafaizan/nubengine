      is generally more affected than the lower limb with an impact in "activity" and
      "participation" areas. The non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), appear able to modulate neuronal plasticity
      processes even more late in age attracting great interest for their potential fallout in the
      field of rehabilitation. The effects of tDCS in recovery of motor function has more
      investigated in adults, while in the pediatric population studies on safety and efficacy are
      still few and not conclusive. This study aims to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of
      tDCS session in children and young adults with UCP both in short term and in follow up (up to
      24 hrs after the tDCS session). Secondarily it aims to test the effects of tDCS (real vs
      sham) in improving, in short term, UL functions. For the study 6 children (aged 10-17 years)
      and 6 young adults (aged 18-28 years) with UCP will be recruited. Each subject receives,
      randomly, a real session and a sham session of tDCS with BrainStim Stimulator. Before (T0),
      immediately after (T1) and after 1 hour and half (T2) to each tDCS session (real or sham)
      heart rate, blood pressure and UL functions will be measured. Moreover the subject fills in
      an ad hoc questionnaire on safety at T1 and T2 and, on call, at 24 hours after the sessions
      (T3).
