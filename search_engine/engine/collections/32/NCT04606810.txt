      or changing biological agents demonstrate better self-care safety skills in practical
      situations using the BioSecure questionnaire three months after receiving a multidisciplinary
      educational intervention, as compared to patients who received usual care. The secondary
      objectives were to assess the impact of the educational intervention on behavioral intentions
      and beliefs and adherence to RA medications in patients receiving the intervention compared
      to usual care.

      Trial design This was a pilot, unblinded, randomized study. Participants in group 1 received
      the usual care plus the multidisciplinary educational intervention at baseline. Participants
      in group 2 first received usual care, and after 3 months were offered the intervention. The
      patients' self-care safety skills was measured using the BioSecure questionnaire, and the
      behavioral intentions and beliefs with respect to medications was assessed using structured
      questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 6 months. With the participant authorization, data on RA
      medication adherence, i.e. biological agents and other non-biologic Disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (nbDMARDs) was obtained for the 3 months preceding enrollment and up to
      6 months afterwards using their pharmacy records.
