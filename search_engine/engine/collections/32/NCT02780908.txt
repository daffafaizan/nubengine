      sessions in a randomized order. On one occasion the participants will perform a resting
      hypoxia test and a graded exercise test to voluntary exhaustion in normoxic condition ((NORM;
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)=0.209, placebo). On a second visit the participants will
      perform a hypoxia sensitivity test and a graded exercise test to voluntary exhaustion in
      hypoxic condition (HYPO; FiO2=0.120 corresponding to terrestrial altitude of approx. 4000 m).
      Indirect calorimetry, near infrared spectroscopy and ECG measurements will be performed
      throughout all tests. During both testing sessions the participants will also undergo
      anthropometry measurements and pulmonary function testing. The outline of the research visits
      is presented in the bellow figure:
