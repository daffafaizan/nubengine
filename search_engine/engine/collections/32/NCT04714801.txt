    
      The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases.
      Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow (BMSCs) or adipose tissue (ASCs)
      have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease.
      Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated
      to actively suppress the immune system and hereby evade recognition.

      This knowledge will be transferred into studies in the ischemic reperfusion-injury/primary
      lung graft dysfunction in lung transplantation, and in suppressing the initial host
      immunological response towards the transplanted lung where a high degree of immunological and
      inflammatory activity is involved.

      We will conduct a clinical trial in which patients receiving lung transplantation will be
      randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue. The aim
      is to assess the impact of MSCs on primary graft dysfunction.

      The perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be
      a paradigm shift for the clinical problems seen in the first period after lung
      transplantation and reduce the long-term graft rejection and dysfunction.
