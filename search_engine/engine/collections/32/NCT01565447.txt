    
      Cases will be identified and referred by the primary oncologist or by the Childhood Cancer
      Survivorship team. When a possible subject has been identified they will be contacted via
      telephone or during a routine clinic visit to determine their interest in the study. Two
      hundred subjects will be recruited for participation with the goal of 5-10 subjects at each
      of the 14 times points across the treatment protocol and survivorship. These time points to
      include: at diagnosis, the start of consolidation therapy, the start of interim maintenance
      therapy, the start of delayed intensification therapy, Day 29 of delayed intensification
      therapy, the start of interim maintenance II therapy (if applicable), Day 1 of cycle 1,3,5 of
      maintenance therapy, end of therapy, and 1, 3, 5, and 10 years off therapy ( +/-1 year).

      Clinical data will be collected from the medical record, roadmaps documenting cancer-directed
      therapy, direct patient interview and examination by the physical therapist during the study
      evaluation. Clinical data will include: Date of birth (to calculate age at diagnosis and
      current age); Gender; Race and Ethnicity; Primary cancer diagnosis; Date of Primary Cancer
      Diagnosis; Chemotherapeutic agents received (agent name, cumulative dose and date received);
      Radiation therapy (date received, site radiated, and dose delivered); Any other clinical
      conditions affecting musculoskeletal performance; Dates of previous PT; Pain score at the
      time of study participation. Height, weight, shoe size and leg length will be collected at
      time of study participation.

      Subjects will complete a self report of the PedsQLâ„¢ Generic Core Scale and the parents will
      complete the parental report.

      Observation gait assessment will include hopping on one foot, running and walking 30' and
      ascending/descending stairs.

      Temporal spatial gait parameters will be recorded on the GaitRite mat
