      without HBeAg loss, switching to peg-interferon may increase the response rate. In our study,
      patients without HBeAg loss to 48 weeks entecavir treatment were divided into two groups. In
      Group A, patients continued entecavir for another 72 weeks. In Group B, patients switched to
      peg-interferon-2a monotherapy for 48 weeks, then followed up 24 weeks.
