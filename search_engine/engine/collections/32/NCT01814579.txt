      techniques are standard of care in robotic hysterectomy and the decision of which to use is
      at the discretion of the surgeon. By using unidirectional barbed suture in which no knot
      tying is required, wound closure time may be decreased resulting in decreased operative time.
      This study was created to compare vaginal cuff closure times using these two techniques.
