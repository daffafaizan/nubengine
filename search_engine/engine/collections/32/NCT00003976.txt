      II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicity in terms of predictability, duration,
      intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose relationship of this treatment regimen in this
      patient population. III. Determine a safe dose for phase II evaluation. IV. Assess the
      pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Determine any possible
      antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive E7070 IV over 1 hour once every 3
      weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of E7070 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
