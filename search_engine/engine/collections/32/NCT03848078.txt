      carcinoma (BCC) is the most prevalent form, with a lifetime risk of 16-20% in the
      Netherlands. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing and subtyping BCC is a punch biopsy.
      Since this technique is invasive, new non-invasive diagnostic methods have been developed,
      including optical coherence tomography (OCT). In patients with clinical and dermoscopic
      suspicion of BCC, OCT makes it possible to confirm and subtype BCC with high confidence,
      thereby obviating the need for a punch biopsy in a substantial part of patients. Hence, BCC
      diagnosis and treatment can be accomplished in one day. As a result, patients experience less
      distress and costs can be saved. By discussing diagnosis and treatment with the patient
      directly, care can be provided more efficiently, preventing treatment delay and saving extra
      hospital visits. The investigators hypothesize that the use of OCT is a cost-effective
      strategy when compared to regular care (always punch biopsy). However, it is important to
      evaluate whether an alternative OCT guided diagnostic approach does not lead to an
      unacceptable increase in risk of recurrent BCC.
