      of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving medication, using dentures, a history of dry
      mouth, smoking and systemic disease. In the first week of the experiment, subjects drank
      bubble tea as the intervention group. In the second week, the same subjects drank tea without
      pearls as the control group. Each subject drank the bubble tea for 5 minutes per day over 3
      days. Saliva samples were collected on the first day before bubble tea consumption (pretest)
      and on the third day after tea consumption (posttest). Saliva collection was performed in the
      morning (09:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.) for 1 minute. Salivary CRP levels were measured using an
      ELISA kit, and Ca levels were determined using a test kit.
