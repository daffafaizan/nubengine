      radiation doses. The study compares two patient setups (Standard Prone vs. Genital Drop
      Technique) with identical radiation treatment technique and parameters. After the two setups
      have been planned, the treating faculty reviews the setups and will choose the setup he feels
      that will give the patient improved dosimetry to the local regions and hopefully reduce
      toxicity and improve treatment tolerability.

      Patients will not be randomized or stratified by demographic or disease risk assessment, but
      treatment will be tailored to stage specific current standards of care.

      An extra (non standard of care) CT is required to analyze the data.
