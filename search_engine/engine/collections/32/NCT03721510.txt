    
      This is a Phase 1/2a open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and anti-viral efficacy of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 antibodies for HIV prevention and
      therapy. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 are recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies
      that target a V3 glycan-dependent epitope region of the HIV envelope protein and the CD4
      binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 mAbs were
      chosen for this study because of their potency, their ability to neutralize a wide array of
      cross-clade HIV viruses in a complementary pattern, and their proven antiviral activity in
      animal studies, e.g., their capacity to robustly prevent and treat simian-human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.

      The potency and breadth of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 raise the possibility that
      monoclonal antibodies may be effective for HIV prophylaxis at low doses and against global
      viruses. Neutralization sensitivity profiles are complementary; and the combination of these
      mAbs with unique epitope specificities will provide experience assessing the potential
      additive, synergistic, or antagonistic properties of two bNAbs given sequentially.
