    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of blood
      biomarkers during exacerbations, or other increase in respiratory symptoms requiring hospital
      admission in patients with IPF.

      Patients that are already included in the PFBIO-cohort (NCT02755441) and who are admitted to
      hospital with an increase in respiratory symptoms, are also included in PFBIO-EXA.

      Patients are recruited within 24 hrs. from hospital admission with respiratory worsening,
      where clinical data, and blood samples are collected. The blood samples are investigated for
      the same blood biomarkers as PFBIO.

      Patient related outcomes are also collected, including quality-of-life questionnaires and
      outcomes of the exacerbations.
