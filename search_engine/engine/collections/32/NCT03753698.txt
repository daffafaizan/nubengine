    
      This is a prospective, interventional, single arm, self-controlled pilot study in patients
      with multiple sclerosis and OAB symptoms with a 6-month treatment period of posterior tibial
      nerve stimulation with the medical device eCoin.

      It is a pilot study to explore the effectiveness and safety of using this device to treat MS
      patients with OAB in daily clinical practice in. Based on feasibility considerations, we plan
      to include approximately 20 patients.

      It consists of:

        1. wash-out period from PTNS treatment of at least 2 months;

        2. baseline assessments;

        3. implantation of eCoin;

        4. system activation; and

        5. treatment and follow-up visits for a 6-month period post implant activation. Seven
           Visits are foreseen during the trial.
