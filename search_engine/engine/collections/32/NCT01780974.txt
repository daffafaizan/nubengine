      plus omega-3 fatty acids and placebo on the primary outcome measure Trails B (executive
      function). This is designed as a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      with a 12 month intervention period. Thirty participants diagnosed with hypertension that is
      treated (systolic blood pressure 90-160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mm Hg) that
      have low omega-3 fatty acid levels, and normal cognitive function will be randomized to
      receive study drug or placebo.
