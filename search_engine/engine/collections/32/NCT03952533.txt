      progressive uterine contractions, associated with a shortening and dilation of the cervix.

      These modifications occur as a consequence of inflammatory processes that involve important
      changes in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. For this reason, in the event of a
      threat of preterm birth, the appropriate tocolytic therapies should be associated with
      interventions able to counteract morphological changes in the uterine cervix. Women
      presenting high or low BMI, presence of uterine myomas, metrorrhagia during the first
      trimester and hypertensive disorders are at risk for PTB. Current management practices remain
      profoundly various, without a therapeutic tocolytic strategy, especially because most of the
      first-line tocolytic drugs used present important side effects [8]. It is to be assessed
      whether a supplementation during pregnancy with minerals, vitamins, anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant agents can avoid PTB in women with risk factors.

      ALA may interact synergistically with magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin D, limiting some of
      the main factors related to the risk of preterm delivery - probably via the inhibition of
      nuclear factor k beta (NF-kB)-signaling pathway - and reducing therefore the rate of uterine
      contractions.

      Moreover, the administration of ALA, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin D have been
      demonstrated to be safe in pregnancy.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether pregnant women presenting risk factors
      for PTB, treated with a combination of ALA, magnesium, vitamin 6 and vitamin D from 11-14
      weeks of gestational age, until delivery, could present a reduced rate of cervical shortening
      measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) at 11-14 weeks and 19-21 weeks of gestational age.
