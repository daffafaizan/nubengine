    
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the Central Nervous
      System (CNS). There are many forms of MS; although the majority are Relapsing Remitting
      (RRMS) representing approximately 80% of the cases. The disease appears to be more
      inflammatory in RRMS as manifested by an increase in Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on MRI and
      an increase in inflammatory bio-assay markers.

      Alemtuzumab; a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 molecule present on T and
      B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes and macrophages; effects rapid and
      sustained lymphocyte depletion and is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia in many countries under the names CAMPATH or MabCAMPATH.

      There are two parts to this Investigator Sponsored Trial (IST):

        1. To perform advanced serial MRI studies on patients initiating alemtuzumab therapy.

        2. To provide serum samples for the University of Southern California (USC) ICAM125
           lymphocyte recovery study.
