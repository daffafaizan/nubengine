      and serving as a significant barrier to working among those whose health is otherwise stable
      or restored by antiretroviral (ARV) medication. Fatigue in HIV is associated with disability
      and diminished quality of life. It may be caused by ARVs or by the virus itself. A related
      study tested whether modafinil, of which armodafinil is an r-isomer, could reduce fatigue in
      HIV/AIDS patients. Armodafinil, believed to have a longer duration and greater effect than
      modafinil, will be tested on the same criteria.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either armodafinil or a placebo daily for 4
      weeks. Participants randomized to active medication and who show improvements in symptoms
      will be offered armodafinil for an additional 12 weeks. For them, the study duration is 16
      weeks. Participants who did not receive armodafinil will be offered armodafinil for 16 weeks.
      For these participants, the study duration is 20 weeks. Participants who did not benefit from
      armodafinil will receive alternate treatment options. All participants will have weekly study
      visits for the first 4 weeks of the study and biweekly visits for the remainder of the study.
      At each visit, participants will complete various tasks to determine cognitive function, and
      self-report scales will be used to determine symptoms of depression and fatigue. After
      completion of 16 weeks, participants responding to armodafinil will be transitioned to the
      publicly available modafinil over the course of 2 weeks.
