      study.

      It is unknown whether the blood pressure levels used for the diagnosis of preeclampsia have
      the same impact in adolescents as in older women, however for the diagnosis of preeclampsia
      and severe hypertension the same criteria of hypertension are used regardless of age
      maternal.

      It is necessary to do research to determine the values of blood pressure with which
      adolescents convulse and also to validate if slight increases in baseline blood pressure in
      adolescents are associated with prediction of preeclampsia and eclampsia.

      Unfortunately, 85% of teenage pregnancies occur in non-industrialized countries such as those
      in Latin America, and it is estimated that 25% of maternal deaths occur in adolescents

      Cases: patients with pregnancy that starts before the age of 19 that develops preeclampsia
      (mild), severe preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and eclampsia, that is 24 and more
      weeks pregnant with prenatal control started before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Controls are
      patients with the same criteria but WITHOUT hypertension during this pregnancy.

      The statistical analyzes are based on comparing blood pressure levels between the two groups,
      in addition blood pressure levels like 30/15 on the systolic and diastolic basal levels will
      be created and compared between the two groups, especially when it is not possible to have
      140 / 90 mm Hg.
