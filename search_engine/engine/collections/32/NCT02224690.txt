    
      This study was a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of 20 milligram [mg] per
      kilogram [kg] per day [mg/kg/day] of GWP42003-P versus placebo. The treatment period
      consisted of a 2-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The study
      determined the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P compared with placebo. The
      dose was recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment of
      safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A of study GWEP1332. The first participants
      enrolled into this study after the DSMC reviewed the safety data from Part A of study
      GWEP1332. Following study completion, all participants were invited to continue to receive
      GWP42003-P in an open label extension (OLE) study (under a separate protocol).
