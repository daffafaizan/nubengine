      with JIA. The foot orthoses (FOs) prescribed to JIA children so far appeared to be very
      expensive and required long time to manufacture before the fitting. This randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine whether pre-formed FOs that can be prescribed at
      chair side, impacted on pain, quality of life (primary outcomes) and/or gait-parameters
      (secondary outcomes) in children affected by JIA.

      Methods - The study took place at the Gait Analysis laboratory at Queen Margaret University -
      Edinburgh and at the TORT Centre, Ninewells Hospital-Dundee. Children with JIA were diagnosed
      according to the ILAR criteria. Intervention was blinded to the patients. The trial group
      received Slimflex-plus FOs, with the addition of chair side corrections and the control FOs
      supplied were made with leather board (1mm thick) only. Both FOs had the same black EVA top
      cover. Primary outcomes were investigated using validated questionnaires (VAS, CHAQ and
      PedsQL). Tekscan™ equipment (F-Scan™ and HR Walkway®) measured secondary outcomes in-shoe
      pressure and force data with and without FOs intervention. Multiple foot strikes and
      repetitive gait patterns were compared pre and post-treatment. Primary and secondary outcome
      measures were recorded at baseline, 3rd and 6th month's period.
