      mouth in slowly increasing doses. Treatment will begin with 5-10 mg three times a day. A
      common final dosage is 15-20 mg four or five times a day, as clinically needed, and if
      tolerated. The upper limit is a total of 100 mg/day. Subjects will be monitored for strength
      and side effects via routine clinic visits at intervals of one month for the first three
      months, then every three months for the first year, and at least every six months thereafter.
      Treatment will be continued indefinitely if a good clinical response is achieved and side
      effects are tolerable.
