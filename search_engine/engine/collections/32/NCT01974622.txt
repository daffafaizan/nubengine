      and include 2 follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months post-procedure to determine if the
      treatment has been effective in treating their disorder. It is anticipated that approximately
      half of the patients will require an additional treatment. Patients will be enrolled from our
      patient population and be 50 years of age and older, male or female. Pregnant women or women
      of normal child bearing age will be excluded since there are no adequate and well-controlled
      studies on the use of photodynamic therapy in pregnant women. Any retinal vascular
      abnormality that has a standard of care method of treatment will also be excluded from the
      study population.
