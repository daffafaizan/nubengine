    
      Allergic asthmatic subjects showing seasonal rhinitis symptoms will be recruited. The
      discriminative (internal consistency, cross sectional construct validity and reliability) and
      evaluative (responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity) properties of the RCSS will
      be evaluated as well as the relationship between rhinitis control and asthma control. RCSS
      will be completed at various time points during the seasonal allergic period.
