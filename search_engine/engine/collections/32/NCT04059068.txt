      gaining a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in causing liver damage is
      particularly important to identify drug targets that could reverse this process.

      White adipose tissue (WAT) or fat fails to respond normally in obesity which leads to fat
      deposition in other organs, particularly the liver, and the fat tissue becomes inflamed. The
      inflammation in the fat is lead by specific immune cells called macrophages. This
      inflammatory state in the fat tissue is thought to be a precursor to liver inflammation and
      liver damage. This has been demonstrated in mouse models where the fat inflammatory cells
      contributed to liver inflammation and worsened liver damage, emphasising the importance of
      the relationship between fat tissue and the liver in NAFLD.

      Liver damage or liver fibrosis is also the result of activation of these inflammatory cells,
      the macrophages, in the liver which drive scarring through cells called fibroblasts that lay
      down collagen. Therefore, understanding the interaction between the cells involved in
      inflammation (macrophages) and scarring (fibroblasts) in both the fat and the liver is key to
      identifying potential drug targets for reversal of this process.

      Our lab demonstrated, using an obese animal model, that the release of pro-fibrotic compounds
      called prostagladins from the fat macrophages is linked to NAFLD and liver inflammation.
      Based on these results the investigators aim to deepen the understanding of the link between
      fat and liver inflammation and damage specifically looking at cell interactions (the
      macrophage and fibroblast) by using genetic tests on liver and fat samples in obese patients.
