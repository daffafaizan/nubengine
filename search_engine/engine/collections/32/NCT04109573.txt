      employed to treat HSIL of the anus to prevent progression to anal cancer. The functional
      outcome of this procedure has not previously been formally assessed.

      HIV and negative positive MSM in whom HSIL has been detected will form the study population,
      as HSIL is prevalent in these patients and intervention is felt to be indicated. Functional
      assessments will be carried out prior to initial treatment and then repeated six months after
      laser ablation therapy. The structure, function and sensitivity of the anal canal will be
      evaluated using endoanal ultrasound, high-resolution anal manometry and anal mucosal
      electrosensitivity measurements respectively. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed
      using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months
      post-treatment.
