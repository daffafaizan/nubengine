      (RVOT) is one of the major components of the cardiac physiology in many congenital heart
      defects. Surgical correction of complex heart defects often includes some form of surgical
      repair or replacement of the native RVOT by biological valves such as homograft,
      bioprosthesis or Xenografts (i.e., Contegra conduits). Typical examples are tetralogy of
      Fallot (TOF) or double outlet right ventricle (DORV), pulmonary stenosis (PS), pulmonary
      atresia (PA), truncus arteriosus (TA), transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with PS
      (Rastelli's operation), absent pulmonary valve syndrome (Miller-Lev-Paul), Ross surgery for
      aortic valve disease and others. The repaired or replaced pulmonary valve however often
      becomes dysfunctional later on and many patients require surgical revisions of the RVOT with
      pulmonary valve replacement within 10 years of primary intervention.

      TPVI provides a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients with right
      ventricular-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit dysfunction. Early results of percutaneous
      pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) showed that it is a promising procedure compared to a
      conventional surgical intervention. Meanwhile, pre-stenting of the RVOT before PPVI is
      routinely performed, enabling PPVI in various anatomies.
