      is only little knowledge about the extent and the duration of drug-induced changes of
      detection and pain thresholds based on a currently recommended standardized quantitative
      sensory testing (QST). The assessment of QST changes would be an important step forward to
      understand the way of action as well as the time course of the presumed recovering of the
      C-fiber function after topical application of a high concentration capsaicin patch.

      10 patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve injury and 10
      patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia will be investigated by QST following the
      protocol of DFNS (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain), using both thermal and
      mechanical nociceptive as well as non-nociceptive stimuli.

      QST will be performed at the following times:

        -  at baseline

        -  2, 4, 6, 8 weeks later, and every two weeks at least until re-occurrence of pain and/or
           recovering of the capsaicin-induced worsening of the C-fiber function.
