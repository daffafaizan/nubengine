      diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
      People with type 2 diabetes and no history of heart disease have a risk of myocardial
      infarction similar to the risk in non-diabetic patients with known heart disease.

      However, the causal relationship between obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease is
      unclear. Insulin resistance leads to many metabolic abnormalities, including high circulating
      levels of free fatty acids (FFA). FFA induces insulin resistance and may lead to beta cell
      failure. In addition FFA may directly worsen the metabolic and electrochemical performance of
      the working heart. Moreover it is still unclear how acute hyperglycemia affects cardiac
      output.

      In this study our purpose is to characterize the changes in amino acid, lipid and glucose
      metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes exposed to acute hyperglycemia (blood glucose
      between 18 and 20 mmol/L) compared to the amino acid, lipid and glucose metabolism at a
      normal glucose level (blood glucose between 5 and 7 mmol/L). The results from the patients
      with type 2 diabetes will be compared with results from healthy controls examined in a
      fasting basal state. The patients must not suffer from any kind of serious heart disease and
      should be treated with insulin.

      Moreover we wish to compare cardiac output at high and normal blood glucose levels,
      respectively. Cardiac output will primarily be assessed by doppler echocardiography.
