      to tramadol HCI alone and a longer duration of action than acetaminophen alone. Therefore,
      the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen may be effective for the treatment of cancer
      pain as well as to allow lower cumulative daily dosages of each medication to be used.This is
      an open-label study. Patients will receive one-dose treatment of 37.5mg Tramadol/325mg
      Acetaminophen tablets.This study has been designed to investigate the following
      hypothesis:Tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen is effective in the treatment of breakthrough
      pain in cancer patients.The patients will complete basic questions on side effect at visits
      on entry, 10, 30 mins, and 1h.

      The patients will receive only one dose treatment of Tramadol hydrochloride/Acetaminophen
      oral tablets throughout the study. The number of oral tablets be given will be depend on the
      total daily dose of around-clock medications. If around-clock medication is Tramadol <=400mg
      or codeine <=300mg or morphine <60mg, the breakthrough pain medication will be 1 tablet. If
      around-clock medication is morphine 60-120mg or Fentanyl >=25 ug/hr, the breakthrough pain
      medication will be 2 tablets.
