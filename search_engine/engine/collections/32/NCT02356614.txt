    
      FDA post-approval study designed to collect prospective data in a real-world setting to
      evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of the LAP BAND® System in patients with a BMI of
      ≥ 30 kg/m2 and < 40 kg/m2 and one or more comorbid conditions. The Apollo-001 Study is a
      prospective, 10 year, multicenter study of patients who have decide to undergo implantation
      of the LAP-BAND AP® system. Outcomes include device explants, changes in weight, comorbid
      condition status, device- and procedure-related AEs, and reoperations.

      The LBMI study was part of the condition of approval (CoA) for the Lap-Band device. It was
      terminated because it was no longer required to fulfill the condition of approval for the
      device. Apollo was able to fulfill the condition of approval (CoA) for the Lap-Band device by
      using data from published literature and another recently completed study (OSB Lead-Hero-002
      study) which had long-term safety and effectiveness data addressing the conditions of
      approval.
