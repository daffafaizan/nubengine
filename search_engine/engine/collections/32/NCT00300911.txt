      to 7%) with glitazone therapy, with an increased incidence of peripheral edema occuring in 2%
      to 5% patients. Some evidence suggests that this effect may be related to increased
      endothelial cell permeability induced by glitazones therapy. Others report that glitazones
      may interfere with renal hemodynamics. In controlled clinical trials, the frequency of new
      onset congestive heart failure was very low in glitazones treated patients. The incidence of
      congestive heart failure is higher in patients receiving combination therapy with insulin and
      glitazones. Only few studies compared rosiglitazone and metformin on cardiac safety. Recently
      a study reported a reversible increase in endothelial cell permeability to albumin in
      cultured pulmonary arterial cells treated with rosiglitazone. To our knowledge, there is not
      any clinical study published for showing the reversibility of the cardiac adverse effects if
      the rosiglitazone treatment is continued.
