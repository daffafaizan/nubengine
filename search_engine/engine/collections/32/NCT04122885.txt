      proteins that influence immune function as well as those that influence angiogenesis. In
      addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are also a large number of other proteins
      that have not been investigated thus far in the perioperative window; these proteins also
      merit assessment. The plasma obtained via this study and protocol will also be used to search
      for other tumor growth factors influenced by surgery or to investigate the impact of surgery
      on immune function.

      Aim 1: To determine perioperative serum levels, over time, of a variety of serum proteins
      including but not limited to IGFBP-3, VEGF, Ang 2, PlGF, sVCAM, CHI3L1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MCP-1
      and proteins that influence immune function as well as other proteins in the following 2
      groups of patients:

        1. PM patients treated with CRS and HIPEC

        2. PM patients treated with PIPAC.

      Aim 2: To compare the perioperative blood protein results between the 2 different groups of
      patients.

      Aim 3: To determine, within each group, a possible correlation between the magnitude of these
      effects on oncological outcome (patient overall survival).

      Aim 4: To search for other surgery-influenced plasma or cellular factors that may influence
      early postoperative tumor growth or that hold promise as tumor or prognostic markers.
