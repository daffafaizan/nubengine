      appropriateness for study inclusion. The treating physician will then immediately contact the
      MFM fellow on call and Research Division personnel to facilitate the initiation of study
      procedures, including the consent process and baseline blood tests. Once enrolled with
      informed consent, the participant will receive 17 OHPC, 250mg IM to be given at admission and
      every 7 days thereafter. Blood sampling of approximately 1-2 teaspoons each will be collected
      at baseline immediately prior to administration of 17 OHPC, then 24 hours (+-2hrs). After the
      first 24 hours, blood samples will be collected every 72 hrs until delivery and again 24hrs
      (+- 2hrs) after delivery. Placentas will be collected at delivery and the investigators will
      also collect information of the mother and newborn while in the hospital and until discharge
      including de-identified routine ultrasound.
