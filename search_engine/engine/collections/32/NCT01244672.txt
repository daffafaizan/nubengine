      feeding blood into the hemorrhoids. Once located, stitches are placed around those arteries
      to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids, which destroys them.

      In the standard surgical excision technique, the hemorrhoids are removed by cutting them out
      with a scalpel.

      Both techniques are widely used in many hospitals today. However, there have been no formal
      studies comparing the two techniques regarding outcomes, particularly regarding pain after
      the procedure. We plan to enroll 60 patients in this study here at Stony Brook; 30 patients
      will have THD and 30 will have the standard surgical excision of hemorrhoids.
