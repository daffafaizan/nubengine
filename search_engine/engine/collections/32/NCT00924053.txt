      sugar transporters. The use of EGT0001474 may enhance the elimination of glucose from the
      blood by increasing the amount of urine produced. This would help prevent an abnormal
      decrease in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) both during fasting and after meals without increasing
      insulin secretion (which may result in weight gain or an abnormal increase in blood sugar
      known as Type 2 diabetes).
