      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of neoadjuvant sunitinib malate in patients with newly
           diagnosed, resectable stage II-IIIA breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the nature, severity, and frequency of adverse events in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate markers of angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor
           receptor, circulating plasma VEGF, sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3, sKIT, and tumor vascularity) both
           pre- and post-treatment.

        -  Examine the role of both host- and tumor-specific genes pertaining to response and
           toxicity.

        -  Compare tumor vascular parameters pre- and post-treatment using DCE-MRI.

        -  Compare cell death and tumor microcirculation pre- and post-treatment using
           contrast-enhanced spectroscopic and microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

        -  Compare tumor metabolic activity pre- and post-treatment using fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 14-21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue samples are obtained by needle biopsy at baseline and once between days 14-21. Blood
      samples are collected at baseline, once between days 14-21, and at 4 weeks post-treatment for
      pharmacodynamic and other studies. Markers of angiogenesis (VEGF receptors, platelet-derived
      growth factor receptor, VEGF, sKIT, and tumor vascularity) are detected by
      immunohistochemistry. DCE-MRI and fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET are conducted for research studies
      at baseline and once between days 14-21.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
