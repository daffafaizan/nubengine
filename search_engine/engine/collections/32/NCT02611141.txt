      essential. A study comparing retromolar and conventional laryngoscopy showed in patients with
      an existing retromolar gap, that the retromolar technique is superior for endotracheal
      intubation especially in patients with a failed 'conventional' intubation attempt. The aim of
      the following study is to test if a retromolar gap at the right mandible is necessary for the
      successful performance of the retromolar laryngoscopy technique.

      Therefore, 20 patients with and 20 patients without a retromolar gap will be investigated.

      The anesthesiologist will visually determine the view of the vocal cords and score it
      according to Cormack & Lehane. For an improved view a backward, upward, right-ward pressure
      (BURP) will be performed, if needed, and scored again.

      Finally, endotracheal intubation will be performed by the 'conventional' intubation method.
      If, however, intubation is not possible, then the retromolar technique will be used. In the
      case that both methods fail, then any (other) intubation method will (can) be used.
