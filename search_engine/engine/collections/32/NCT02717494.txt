    
      This was a multi-center, Phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women on Highly Active Antiretroviral
      Therapy (HAART) who were in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and of their infants.
      The study was designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity,
      transplacental antibody transfer and interference with infant responses to childhood
      vaccination of maternal vaccination with PCV-10 or PPV-23 by comparison with placebo.

      Mothers were randomized to one of three arms and received PCV-10, PPV-23, or placebo in a
      blinded fashion. They were followed for safety, immunogenicity and vaccine-specific
      anti-capsular pneumococcus (PNC) antibody persistence until 24 weeks post-delivery. Women who
      received placebo were randomized to a second study step and received PCV-10 or PPV-23 at 24
      weeks post-delivery. Antibody responses to the vaccine administered 6 months postpartum were
      measured. Women who received placebo but cannot be randomized to a second study step due to
      ongoing new pregnancy were enrolled in a third study step and receive open label PCV-10 at
      the last study visit; no data were collected on these women and they were not followed after
      vaccine administration. All infants received PCV-10 vaccinations per local standard of care.
