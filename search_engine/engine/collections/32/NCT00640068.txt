      Shield of Michigan and Blue Cross Network (BCBSM/BCN) for initiation of insurance coverage of
      coronary artery CT scanning (CCTA), a relatively new procedure that can provide non-invasive
      coronary angiograms. While this procedure has promise in that it can rapidly diagnose
      patients with unknown chest pain and reduce the cost of medical care, there is substantial
      potential for abuse and excess cost and inappropriate care if not appropriately used.

      The Consortium's objectives are to educate participating sites of the clinical uses of CCTA
      as well as other best-practice recommendations; to create a database (Registry) to develop
      evidence of the best-practice utilization of CCTA; to provide a feedback mechanism to the
      sites about the positive or negative evidence of best-practice utilization of CCTA; to
      develop strategies to improve the utilization of CCTA; to monitor the CQI process of the
      individual participating sites; to reduce cost and improve safety and efficiency in in the
      care of patients with acute chest pain, indeterminate stress tests results, and to assess
      coronary bypass graft patency.
