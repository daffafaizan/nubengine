      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether
      the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), multicenter, parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. Approximately 200 participants
      will be randomly assigned to JNJ 49095397 or placebo in the ratio 1:1. The study consists of
      3 phases: screening (3 weeks), double-blind treatment (12 weeks), and follow up (4 weeks).
      Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be
      approximately 19 weeks.
