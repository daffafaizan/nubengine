    
      -  Entry into the study : After informed consent, patients will be randomised into three
           groups : tDCS, rTMS, tsDCS. The physician responsible for conducting neurostimulation
           sessions will make the randomization via an interactive web response system (IWRS).

        -  Baseline : Participants, will record on a book, a daily Visual Numeric Scale(VNS) of
           Pain Intensity for 1 month.

        -  The beginning of the treatment : after the baseline, sessions of neurostimulation will
           begin. Sessions of neurostimulation will have a decreasing rhythm. Five sessions per
           week during the two first weeks, two sessions per week during the third week, one
           session during the fourth week and then two sessions per month for four months.

        -  After the end of neurostimulation sessions, patients will be followed for 1month.

      Throughout their participation in the study, patients will complete their VNS report book
      (1month of baseline before the treatment, 3 months during neurostimulation, 1 month after
      neurostimulation).

      Patients will have 5 evaluation examinations:

        -  The first, one just before the beginning of the neurostimulation,

        -  The second, 1 month after the beginning of neurostimulation

        -  The third, 3 months after the beginning of neurostimulation

        -  And the last one, 1 month after the end of neurostimulation.
