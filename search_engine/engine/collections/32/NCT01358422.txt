      and clopidogrel) in patients presenting for elective non-cardiac surgery who have undergone
      PCI with either bare metal stent or drug eluting stent placement in the four years prior to
      surgery. The absolute risk reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with dual
      antiplatelet therapy and the absolute risk increase for clinically significant bleeding
      events with dual therapy will be determined. This will allow the number needed to treat (NNT)
      for the prevention of MACE and the number needed to harm (NNH) for bleeding to be determined
      and the optimal antiplatelet therapy in this setting to be identified.
