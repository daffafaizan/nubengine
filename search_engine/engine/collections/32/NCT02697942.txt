      in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate
      feasibility for the interventions (cognitive training and exercise training) in Aim 1. The
      investigators will formally test whether whether cognitive training (tablet-based brain
      games) and exercise training (stationary foot pedal) administered during HD slow cognitive
      decline as well as improve secondary outcomes (physical function, frailty, and health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) as part of Aim 2. The investigators will compare these two
      interventions against the standard of care. Pre- and post-intervention assessments will be
      conducted at the dialysis unit by a study coordinator and by research assistants.
      Participants will be followed for 6 months to assess cognitive decline.
