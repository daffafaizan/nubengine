      therapy (ART) during pregnancy and breastfeeding ("Option B") or ideally throughout their
      lives regardless of clinical stage ("Option B+"). In February 2013, Zimbabwe's Ministry of
      Health and Child Welfare (MoHCW) declared that Zimbabwe would begin implementing Option B+ in
      October of 2013. This impact evaluation utilizes serial population-based, community-level
      surveys to comprehensively assess the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission strategy
      (PMTCT) 'Option B+' among mother-infant pairs in Zimbabwe. The investigators will assess the
      population-level impact of Option B+ in Zimbabwe using serial community-based cross-sectional
      serosurveys with data from three time points: 2012 (pre-Option A standard of care), 2014
      (post-Option A / pre-Option B+), and 2017 (post Option B+ implementation) in order to monitor
      population-level trends in MTCT and HIV-free infant survival.

      The investigators will compare outcomes among infants from 2017 to outcomes among
      mother-infant pairs who participated in similar surveys conducted in 2012 and 2014. These
      community-level data, along with in-depth facility survey data, will also allow the
      investigators to examine impact heterogeneity by the extent of integration of PMTCT and ART
      services at the facility. Together with effectiveness data from the serosurveys,
      facility-level resource utilization and cost data will allow assessment of Option B+
      cost-effectiveness. In addition, this study will also include a population-based,
      community-level survey conducted in 2017 to assess retention of mothers in ART services after
      weaning (19-36 months postpartum). These data will allow the investigators to assess
      HIV-infected mothers' retention in care at the time of the survey, when most mothers will
      have stopped breastfeeding
