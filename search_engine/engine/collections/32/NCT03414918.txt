      of endocrine hypertension, is in up to 66% of all cases investigated with adrenal vein
      sampling (AVS). Mutations in the KCNJ5 potassium channel involve up to 70% of APA and cause
      the most florid PA phenotypes. The recent finding that macrolide antibiotics specifically
      inhibit in vitro the altered function of mutated KCNJ5 channels has opened new horizons for
      the diagnosis and treatment of APA with KCNJ5 mutations in that it can allow identification
      and target treatment of PA patients harbouring a mutated APA. Thus, the aim of the present
      study was to investigate if clarithromycin and roxithromycin, two macrolides that potently
      blunt mutated Kir3.4 channel function in vitro, affect plasma aldosterone concentration in
      adrenal vein blood during AVS and in peripheral blood, respectively, in PA patients with a
      mutated APA.

      The investigators designed two proof of concept studies. In study A: consecutive patients
      with an unambiguous biochemical evidence of PA will be exposed to a single dose of 250 mg
      clarithromycin during AVS, to assess its effect on the relative aldosterone secretion index
      (RASI) in adrenal vein blood from the gland with and without APA. In study B: consecutive
      hypertensive patients submitted to the work-up for hypertension will receive a single oral
      dose of 150 mg roxithromycin. The experimental endpoints will be the change induced by
      roxithromycin of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and other steroids, direct active
      renin concentration (DRC), serum K+, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

      The investigators expect to prove that: i) clarithromycin allows identification of mutated
      APA before adrenalectomy and sequencing of tumour DNA; ii) the acute changes of PAC, DRC, and
      blood pressure in peripheral venous blood after roxithromycin can be a proxy for the presence
      of an APA with somatic mutations.
