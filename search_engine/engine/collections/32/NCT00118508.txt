      cancers diagnosed annually. Much advancement has been made in the treatment of these cancers
      which has significantly decreased the mortality rates. Treatment, including adjuvant
      chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, prolongs disease free survival and overall survival of
      patients with breast cancer. The cytotoxic drugs, however, can cause premature ovarian
      failure and subsequent menopause. This risk has been reported to range from 53% to 89%.
      Temporary or permanent chemotherapy induced ovarian failure is important because of potential
      bone loss associated with the estrogen loss. Initiating a potent antiresorptive agent,
      risedronate, should prevent or improve bone mass in these women.

      Comparison: The investigators will compare bone mass/markers of study subjects receiving
      risedronate with study subjects receiving placebo. All subjects will be provided calcium and
      vitamin D supplementation as needed.
