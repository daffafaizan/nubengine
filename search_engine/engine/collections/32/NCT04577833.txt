    
      Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, with potent activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA)-repair polymerases. AA is a pro-drug of abiraterone which selectively inhibits the
      enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), that is found in the testes and adrenals
      (leading to systemic inhibition of testosterone production), as well as in prostate tissues
      and tumors. The rationale of the study is to investigate the various strengths and
      formulations of niraparib and AA plus prednisone or prednisolone (P) in metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants with and without homologous recombination
      repair (HRR) gene alterations. In participants with metastatic prostate cancer, DNA-repair
      anomalies are found in approximately 15 percent (%) to 20% of tumors. This study consists 4
      periods: screening phase (up to 21 days); treatment phase (up to 22 days); extension phase
      (from day 23 until discontinuation); and post-treatment follow up phase (end of treatment
      [EoT] visit within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment). Total duration of study
      is up to 1.4 years. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers will be assessed
      at specified time points during this study. Participants safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
