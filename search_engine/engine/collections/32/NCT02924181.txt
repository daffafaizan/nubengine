      contact force-guided ablation or contact force-blinded ablation strategy. Each PV will be
      ablated with same contact force-sensing catheter (Thermocool Smart Touch Catheter, Biosense
      Webster Inc. CA). The PV (right or left) which will be randomized to contact force-sensing PV
      or blind PV. Contact force-sensing PV will be ablated guided by contact force, whereas the
      blind PVs will be ablated without contact force-sensing information. The change of impedance,
      total ablation and time to ablate PV will be collected and analysed according to contact
      force-sensing strategy. After exit and entrance block by conventional method, dormant
      conduction will be evaluated by using adenosine. The proportion of dormant conduction will be
      compared between contact force-sensing guided or blinded strategy.

      During 1-year follow up, patients who recurred AF or AT will be undergo second ablation
      procedure. In these patients, PV reconnection rate will be evaluated by a duodecapolar lasso
      circular mapping catheter. We would like to know whether PVs which have ablated with contact
      force-sensing information at index procedure have less reconnection than those which was
      ablated without contact force-sensing information.
