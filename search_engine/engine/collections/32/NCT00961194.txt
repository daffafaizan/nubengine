      route, its analgesic action was rapid. In one study, when oral ketamine was administrated to
      patients suffering from neuropathic pain, in six out of nine patients, pain was relieved
      after 24 hours post-administration.

      In this study, ketamine will be administrated during seven days, which will allow us to
      evaluate ketamine efficiency and safety.

      The effect of ketamine on pain intensity will be mainly studied using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) but also taking into account the score assigned by the patient to his pain. This score
      will be noted down by patients before, during and after ketamine treatment.

      Evaluation of benefit/risk for ketamine administration during this trial, shows that even if
      adverse events are not excluded, the benefit for the patients may be neuropathic pain relief.

      Because clinical current knowledge regarding oral administration of ketamine is limited, this
      trial intends to enlarge information about ketamine efficiency and safety, more particularly
      in neuropathic pain disorders.
