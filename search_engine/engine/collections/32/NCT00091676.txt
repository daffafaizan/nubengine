    
      Patients with Stage III-IV follicular lymphoma and tumor > 2cm (Stage II allowed if tumor >
      5cm), previously untreated by other than local radiation, provide tumor material by tissue
      biopsy for production of a patient-specific Ig idiotype vaccine conjugated to the immunogenic
      protein KLH. After completing PACE or CHOP-R chemotherapy and achieving a complete remission,
      followed by a waiting period to reconstitute the immune system, patients who remain in
      remission randomized to the active treatment arm receive a series of 5 idiotype vaccinations
      accompanied by the immune stimulant GM-CSF. Patients randomized to the control arm receive a
      time-matched series of KLH injections also accompanied by GM-CSF. Patients are subsequently
      studied to observe their immune responses both to the non-specific immune stimulating agents
      and for the specific immune response to the vaccine. Patients are followed for a minimum of 4
      years post-randomization or until relapse.
