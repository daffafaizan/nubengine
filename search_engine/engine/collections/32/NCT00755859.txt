      steroid course with supportive therapy in 86 patients with IgAN. After 5 years of follow-up,
      the risk of a 50% increase in plasma creatinine from baseline was significantly lower in the
      treated patients; proteinuria also decreased. However, the effect of steroids seemed to
      diminish over time. The difference in renal survival was particularly striking up till the
      third year, but then remained constant. We hypothesised that a six-month course of steroid
      therapy is not enough to ensure a stable remission, and a more aggressive treatment may be
      required to obtain long-term better results. At this regard, some studies of combined
      treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine found that treatment was effective in
      preserving renal function and in reducing proteinuria. However, these studies did not clarify
      whether azathioprine added further benefit to steroids in the long term. We conducted a
      randomised controlled trial to assess the utility of low-dose azathioprine added to steroids
      in adult IgAN patients.
