      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) as the first systemic
      intervention for patients with advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of MK-3475 as the first systemic intervention for
      patients with advanced MCC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immune correlates of the clinical activity of MK-3475.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      * NOTE: Patients with confirmed disease progression may continue to receive treatment if they
      are otherwise clinically stable until there is an increase in tumor burden of 25% or more
      following initial confirmation of progression. Under exceptional circumstances, and with
      protocol principal investigator (P.I.) and Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) P.I.
      approval, patients may receive treatment beyond 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, annually until the patient has completed 3
      years of follow up for disease assessment, and then every 12 weeks.
