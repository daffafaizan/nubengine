      of techniques have been cited to confirm placement of the endotracheal tube. However, even
      end-tidal CO2 monitoring, considered to be the gold standard, has been associated with false
      positive and false negative results. In addition, use of this monitor requires ventilation
      through the tube, resulting in gastric distention if the esophagus has been intubated.

      When the lateral neck is auscultated during insertion of an endotracheal tube, there is a
      distinct difference between the sounds generated by a tube placed in the esophagus compared
      to a tube inserted into the trachea. Stethoscopes are readily available in any OR setting,
      and ventilation and release of cricoid pressure need not occur prior to confirmation of tube
      placement. However, this technique has yet to be validated.

      A series of sounds heard at the lateral neck during both tracheal and esophageal intubation
      will be recorded using an electronic stethoscope. These sound files will be played to a group
      including both experienced and inexperienced intubators, who will be asked to identify which
      sounds represent tracheal and esophageal intubation. Overall accuracy will be determined for
      the group of listeners.
