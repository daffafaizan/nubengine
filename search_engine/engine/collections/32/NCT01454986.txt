      subject is determined to be eligible, the subject will be vaccinated with the quadrivalent
      meningococcal conjugate vaccine at least two weeks prior to dosing, if applicable. A total of
      7 dose cohorts will be enrolled sequentially and randomized to receive ALXN1007 or placebo.
      Subjects will receive ALXN1007 or placebo at the clinic and be kept at the clinic for a total
      of 4 days for observation and completion of the required study tests.

      The subjects will return for 8 additional clinic visits to complete the required study tests
      over the next 86 days. The total duration of the study is 90 days from the day of dosing with
      ALXN1007 or placebo.
