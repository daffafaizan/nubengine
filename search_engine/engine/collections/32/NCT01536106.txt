      improve cardiac function in acute myocardial infarction patients. There is a great potential
      for stem cell therapy, using a variety of cell precursors to contribute to new blood vessel
      formation and muscle preservation in the myocardial infarct zone. The administration of cells
      via an infusion through the infarct related artery appears to be feasible and result in a
      clinical effect in some studies. Across the globe AMI is the leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality. This cannot be prevented by optimal standard therapies i.e. balloon or stent
      dilation of the infarct vessels.

      The study is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized, multicenter trial. Male or
      female patients between 18-75 years with first incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction(AMI)
      and LVEF less than or equal to 40% are included in the study. Patients who have undergone
      successful percutaneous intervention (PCI) within â‰¤ 24 hours after onset of symptoms
      (PTCA/stent) or / and Thrombolysed patients having TIMI-3 flow are eligible to take part in
      the study.

      A total of 30 subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive concentrated BMMNC
      or placebo. All patients will undergo bone marrow aspiration within 3-10 days from the index
      event(infarction). Bone Marrow(BM) will be processed utilizing point of care technology.
      Following cell processing, the concentrated BMMNC or placebo control is infused directly into
      the infarct related artery using the stop flow method. Clinical follow up for all the
      subjects at 1,30, 60, 90, 180 and 360 days will be performed from the day of the procedure,
      with primary and secondary end points evaluated for both study arms.
