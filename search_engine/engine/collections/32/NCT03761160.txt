      patients who are about to initiate androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer with an
      exercise program and better eating habits. The first phase of the research study seeks to
      evaluate the experience of the first version of the mobile health app within a group of
      participants and what they think of it.

      The investigators are interested in how individuals react to the use of a developed mobile
      health app and what they think of it.
