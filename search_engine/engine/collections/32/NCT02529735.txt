      measured in the arm and each of the three sites in the lower limb.

      Secondary endpoints: The difference in systolic blood pressure, diastolic and mean

      Methodology:

      Experimental design:

      This is an observational study, prospective, multicenter, comparative on healthy volunteers,
      each individual is his own witness. Reports of non-invasive blood pressure values of 3
      different sites of the lower limbs, compared to a reference value. For each individual, the
      side which will be carried out blood pressure measurements will be drawn. After 5 minutes
      rest in the supine position, it will be realized the measurement of blood pressure
      non-invasively systolic, mean and diastolic 2 automated oscillometric measuring devices
      identical and calibrated simultaneously the arm and thigh ipsilateral / arm and calf
      ipsilateral / arm and the ipsilateral ankle.

      Each measurement is repeated once after 1 minute.

      Statistical analysis:

      Systolic, mean and diastolic pressures are analyzed separately, and expressed by their
      average with standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. The concordance of BP
      measurements between the arm and each of three sites in the lower limb was analyzed by the
      method Bland and Altman, calculating the average difference, its approval limits, as well as
      the confidence interval 95 % upper and lower limits of approval subject to a Gaussian
      distribution of the difference between the measurements.

      The search for the best AP measurement site to the lower member is made by comparing the
      differences between each of the three sites and the reference site, for a global test
      (variance analysis or test Friedmann according to the distribution of differences), then by
      comparisons with 2-2 adjusting the p-value.

      The chosen site is one for which this difference is significantly weaker. All tests are
      conducted bilaterally with a risk of first species set at 5%. In an earlier study, the
      largest variance found regarding the difference in systolic BP between calf and arm.

      Based on the most pessimistic scenario (s = 12.76) to highlight a difference of 5 mm Hg with
      an alpha risk of 5% and a power of 90% and taking into account the multiple comparisons
      considered, 176 patients necessary.

      Total duration of study: 27 months Period of inclusion: 24 months Duration of participation
      for voluntary: 30 minutes Number of participating centers: 8 centers
