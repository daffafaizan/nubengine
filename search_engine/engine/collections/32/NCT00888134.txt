      I. To evaluate the objective response rate to AZD6244 (selumetinib) in patients with cancers
      other than melanoma in which BRAF mutations have been identified prospectively.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival in subjects treated with AZD6244. II. To obtain a
      preliminary estimate of the objective response rate in non-small cell lung cancers and colon
      cancers with BRAF mutations.

      III. To explore biologic correlates of responsiveness to AZD6244, and specifically to
      correlate AKT pathway activity with sensitivity to MEK inhibition in the BRAF mutant class of
      tumors.

      IV. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in
      circulating tumor cells (CTC) using a microfluidic platform (the 'CTC-chip').

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
