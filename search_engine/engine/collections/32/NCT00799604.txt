      the purpose of this study, hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm
      Hg immediately prior to initiation of study drug.

      On the day of surgery, an IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 1 - pre-anesthesia) was
      administered to each eligible study participant during Treatment Period 1 to decrease BP
      before induction of general anesthesia. The dose (either 125 μg, 250 μg or 500 μg) given was
      based on the assigned cohort for each participant, listed in the 'Arms' section below.

      At the discretion of the investigator, a second IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 2 - with
      anesthesia) could have been administered during Treatment Period 2 at either 125 μg, 250 μg
      or 500 μg, based upon the earlier observed response to Bolus 1. This dose was administered
      after the induction of anesthesia, to decrease BP prior to cannulation of the ascending aorta
      for initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Assessment of safety was performed throughout Treatment Periods 1 and 2 with Adverse Events
      (AEs) followed 6 hours post final bolus dose and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) followed 24
      hours post final bolus dose.
