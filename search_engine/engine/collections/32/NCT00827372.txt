      vascular endothelial growth factor (commonly called VEGF). Pazopanib is not currently
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and therefore considered an
      experimental medication.

      High levels of VEGF cause blood vessels to leak fluid, increasing the pressure in tumors
      similar to the increased pressure in lymphedema. Previous studies have found that treatment
      with pazopanib decreases the fluid pressure in tumors. That is why we think pazopanib might
      be an effective treatment for lymphedema.
