      non-external sound is present - can be disabling and difficult to treat. Physiopathology of
      tinnitus can be considered as similar to neuropathic pain. Neuropathic and central pain are
      treated since ten years by chronic electrical motor cortex stimulation. The hypothesis of
      this study is that it will be possible to treat severe tinnitus by this stimulation as
      neuropathic pains are treated by motor cortical stimulation.

        -  Principal Objective : to evaluate the efficacy of chronic electrical stimulation of the
           auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus

        -  Secondary Objective : to evaluate the tolerability and the safety of chronic electrical
           stimulation of the auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus

        -  Study design : randomized, cross over, double blind, study to evaluate the efficacy of
           the chronic electrical stimulation versus sham in severe and chronic tinnitus
