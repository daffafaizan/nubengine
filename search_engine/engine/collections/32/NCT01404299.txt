      component of frailty. However, the effect of protein-energy nutritional supplementation on
      the functional status of frail older people is controversial. Some investigators suggested
      that, if nutritional or functional status has deteriorated too far, it could be very
      difficult for single nutritional supplementation to reverse malnutrition progression or
      functional decline.

      The investigators believe one of the reasons for these ineffective results, especially for
      the community-dwelling frail elderly, may be due to a lack of regard to the socioeconomic
      status of the study population. For this reason, the investigators recruited a study sample
      with low socioeconomic status and evaluated the effect of protein-energy nutritional
      supplementation on their disability scores and physical performance.
