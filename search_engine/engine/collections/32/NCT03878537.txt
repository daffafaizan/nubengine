      profiling to predict disease relapse or progression while on therapy for advanced stage NSCLC
      in comparison to current standard objective measures of disease relapse or progression.

      This study is a prospective observational study. The investigators will assess whole genome
      sequencing from patient blood samples collected alongside routine blood draws with each
      treatment cycle to determine the tumor load score at each timepoint while on therapy. CT
      images will be obtained at routinely ordered timepoints throughout therapy and will be used
      in the assessment for standard clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression.
      These methods of measuring disease progression will be compared in a lead time analysis.
