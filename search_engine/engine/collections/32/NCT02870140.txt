    
      This is a prospective, randomized, 1:1 balanced, controlled, single-blind, multi-center study
      comparing clinical outcomes at 12 months between SUPRAFLEX and XIENCE in a "Real world, all
      comers" patient population (patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease including
      patients with chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, and acute coronary syndromes, who
      qualify for percutaneous coronary interventions). The objective is to compare the SUPRAFLEX
      SES with the XIENCE EES with respect to target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months in a
      non-inferiority trial in a "real world" patient population.

      All patients will be (at minimum) contacted at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post
      procedure to assess clinical status and adverse events. The 30 day and 12 month will be a
      clinic visit. All patients will have annual contact through 3 years follow-up to assess
      clinical status and adverse events.
