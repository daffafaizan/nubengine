      (participants are randomly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing
      treatment that does not contain the test drug), randomized (study medication assigned to
      participants by chance), crossover study in up to 120 men and women self-identifying as
      current, recreational, nondependent polydrug users. The study has a Screening Phase
      (consisting of a Screening Visit and a Qualification Session) and a Treatment Phase. In the
      Qualification Session participants will be randomized to receive Sequence 1: intravenous
      placebo and intranasal placebo concurrently (Treatment A) on Day 1 and an intravenous dose
      (0.5 mg/kg) of racemic ketamine and intranasal placebo concurrently (Treatment B) on Day 2,
      or the participants will receive Sequence 2: Treatment B on Day 1 and Treatment A on Day 2.
      In the Treatment Phase eligible participants will be administered 4 treatments: A, B, C
      (intravenous placebo and intranasal 84 mg esketamine as 3 devices, each with 28 mg esketamine
      followed by 1 device with placebo) and D (intravenous placebo and intranasal 112 mg of
      esketamine as 4 devices, each with 28 mg esketamine) in a cross-over manner (1 treatment per
      period) in Sequence 3, 4, 5, or 6. Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be separated by 7 to 14 days.
      Primarily the drug abuse potential will be evaluated. Safety of the participants will be
      monitored throughout the study.
