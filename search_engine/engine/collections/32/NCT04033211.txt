      of surgical site infection (SSI) in each suture group until 30 days postoperatively. The
      frequency of infections (SSI: A1 and A2) is considered as a suitable parameter for the
      assessment of efficacy. It is expected that the use of the Novosyn® CHD suture will reduce
      the occurrence of infections (SSI: A1 and A2) 30 days postoperatively compared to Novosyn
      suture (primary objective). SSI will be classified according to the Centre of Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC), therefore the time point for assessment of SSI as set to 30 days
      postoperatively.

      Furthermore, short-term and long-term complications, the handling of the suture material,
      length of postoperative hospital stay, costs, pain, quality of life, time to return to work,
      hernia rate including umbilical hernias and the cosmetic outcome will also be assessed as
      secondary objectives.
