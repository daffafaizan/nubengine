      screening experiment. Patients whose tumor specimen pass the drug screening process will be
      finally enrolled.

      Actual clinical response to TMZ treatment will be compared to drug screening results derived
      from AVATAMED, a medical software device to predict the drug response based on in vitro assay
      using patient-derived tumor cells.
