      children with solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Nonetheless, longitudinal
      studies have implicated the absence of a safe anthracycline dose that is free of
      cardiotoxicity. Substantial risk for cardiovascular disease has been shown recently in large
      cohorts of adult survivors of childhood and adolescent survivors. Serial monitoring of
      cardiac function is hence of paramount importance in childhood cancer survivors for early
      detection of myocardial damage and timely institution of interventions. The optimal
      monitoring of cardiac function in the long term in these at-risk patients remains to be
      established. Novel noninvasive imaging modalities including echocardiography and cardiac
      magnetic resonance allow interrogation of myocardial deformation and fibrosis, while
      circulating biomarkers are increasingly used to monitor the cardiac status in heart failure
      patients. Additionally, genetics of heart failure are increasingly unveiled.
