      the basis for designing novel targeted therapies to prevent or reverse this prevalent human
      disease. The overall objectives are to determine whether autoimmune diseases are associated
      with AF development and to identify specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that will
      improve the ability to accurately predict risk of AF development. The study will
      prospectively enroll patients with and without AF and determine their serum cytokine levels
      and assess the functional responses of T cells on the basis of cytokine production after in
      vitro T-cell specific stimulation, using Luminex bead-based multiplex technology.
