      development, due to their exposures to poverty and related issues. In low-and middle-income
      countries, children experience a dis-proportionally high burden of exposure to poverty and
      related risk factors for delayed development including of poor health and nutrition,
      inadequate responsive care giving, and a lack of opportunities for early learning. Water,
      sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions have the potential to positively affect the
      developmental trajectories of children by reducing enteric pathogen infection, improving
      child health, and altering parental care practices. A recent cluster-randomized controlled
      trial (cRCT) in Bangladesh (WASH-Benefits, or WASH-B, Clinical Trials.gov Identifier:
      NCT01590095), found that improvements in WASH or nutrition supported by intensive
      interpersonal communication, when delivered either individually or in combination,
      contributed to improvements in child development outcomes at 1 and 2 years of age, and
      mothers in all intervention groups reported lower depressive symptoms than mothers in the
      control households.

      This follow-up study, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, includes assessments of
      the children and caregivers originally enrolled in the WASH Benefits intervention 5 years
      following intervention completion, when the children are 5-8 year of age. The original WASH
      Benefits intervention enrolled pregnant women between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013. The
      goal of this follow-up study is to examine whether the improvements in child development and
      maternal mental health are sustained when the children are in middle childhood. Our guiding
      hypothesis is that interventions that showed early impact will continue to improve child and
      maternal outcomes at this follow-up time period. Investigators will attempt to collect
      follow-up data from every household originally randomized to one of the 7 arms in the WASH
      Benefits trial.
