      those failed other strategies will be recruited. The primary tumor and nearby metastatic
      nodes will be irradiated with Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) mostly with conventional
      fractions. During the course, oral capecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin will be given
      concurrently. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the two drugs will be determined during
      escalation according to the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).
