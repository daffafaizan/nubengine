    
      A multidisciplinary team, involving pediatric hospitalists, pediatric emergency physicians,
      residents, medical students, nurses and nurse managers, and respiratory therapists will be
      assembled. The investigators will participate in a value stream mapping process, to map out
      the current pediatric bronchiolitis care process and identify areas for improvement in
      efficiency and effectiveness. The investigators will then begin the iterative process of
      implementing improvements to the bronchiolitis care process. Interventions will be
      evidence-based and designed to improve compliance with bronchiolitis care guidelines, as set
      forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Examples of possible interventions may include
      creation of a bronchiolitis admission order set, implementation of an evidence-based
      bronchiolitis clinical pathway, and/or institution of standardized bronchiolitis discharge
      criteria. Interventions will be implemented in a stepwise fashion, utilizing successive
      plan-do-study-act cycles, with a minimum 2 month period between interventions to monitor
      outcomes. The investigators will track utilization of diagnostic testing and treatments
      within our intervention group, as compared to historical controls who also meet inclusion
      criteria.
