    
      The on-drug reference range study will be performed by measuring venous blood samples in
      duplicate collected from patients receiving prasugrel (Effient®), or ticagrelor (Brilinta®).
      Subjects must be on aspirin at the doses prescribed by their treating physician.

      When possible, venous blood samples may be collected in conjunction with routine laboratory
      testing, to minimize the number of needle sticks for the subject. Alternatively, samples may
      be collected separately to complete the study.

      A CBC measurement must be performed for each enrolled subject from a sample collected at the
      time of blood draw or within ± one week and tested at a certified laboratory. Samples for
      PRUTest collected in conjunction with a CBC must be drawn after the PRUTest sample.

      Up to 130 subjects will be enrolled in the study to facilitate collection of the minimum
      number of blood samples needed to determine the on-drug reference range of prasugrel
      (Effient®), or ticagrelor (Brilinta®).
