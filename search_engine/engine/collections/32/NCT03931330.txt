      (FGID), it has been documented that subjects have decreased vagal tone. Vagal tone in turn
      modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics and plays a role in anti inflammatory effects. Further
      defining these brain-body connections that underlie FGID's could help guide future treatment.

      The investigators postulate that a 4 week neuro-stimulation with an Electro Auricular Device
      that has already shown to increase vagal tone will produce an increase in mitochondrial
      bioenergetics and decrease in inflammatory markers in this patient group.
