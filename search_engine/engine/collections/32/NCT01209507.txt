      evaluate the prevalence of adrenal suppression in gynecologic cancer patients undergoing
      chemotherapy regimens requiring concurrent dexamethasone. Women with gynecologic cancers
      (including cervical, endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers) who
      are scheduled to begin chemotherapy with any of the standard chemotherapy regimens that also
      receive dexamethasone. After informed consent is obtained, they will have peripheral blood
      samples drawn at the time of routine blood draw for (ideally a fasting morning) cortisol
      level at three different times in their routine care. Patients will also answer a quality of
      life questionnaire at the times of these blood draws to assess for symptoms associated with
      treatment (nausea, vomiting, fatigue). A total of 80 subjects will be recruited to
      participate. 40 subjects will be given chemotherapy regimens receiving dexamethasone with
      three chemotherapy treatments in a three week cycle. 40 subjects will be given chemotherapy
      regimens receiving dexamethasone with one chemotherapy treatment in a three week cycle.
