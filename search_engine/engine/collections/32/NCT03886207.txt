      footbaths with added ginger powder (experimental) compared to warm water only footbaths
      (control) in adolescent anorexia nervosa patients. Participants will receive footbaths 4
      times per week before bed-time over a period of six weeks.The main focus is on subjective
      increase in overall body warmth. Moreover, core body temperature, skin temperature at the
      extremities and several psychological as well as physiological scores and parameters are
      assessed before and after the six-week intervention. A follow-up is planned at six months
      post intervention, where core body temperature, physiological and psychological parameters
      are once more tested.
