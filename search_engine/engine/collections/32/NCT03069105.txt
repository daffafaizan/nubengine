      of patients with cancer. It has been documented that non-professional caregivers and
      long-term care providers to patients with cancer receive little preparation, information, or
      support to perform their vital role. Through this study, the investigators will identify the
      relationship between cognitive dysfunction, resilience, social support, cognitive appraisal,
      coping behavior, and caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression among family caregivers of
      patients with cancer. The findings of this study will direct future intervention studies to
      reduce caregiver burden and improve outcomes for the many individuals caring for family
      members with cancer.
