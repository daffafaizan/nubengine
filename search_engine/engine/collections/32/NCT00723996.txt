      colorectal cancer screening and screening mammography and to develop an innovative approach
      for reducing barriers colorectal cancer screening in women, using screening mammography, an
      existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a
      "teachable moment." Although screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) has been shown to decrease
      the incidence of CRC and CRC associated mortality, adherence to screening guidelines from the
      American Cancer Society and the American Gastroenterological Association remains poor.1-5
      Barriers to adherence are not fully defined, but may include poor understanding of the
      relative benefits and risks of CRC screening, absence of physician recommendation, lack of
      insurance coverage for screening procedures, and poor patient acceptance of screening
      procedures. A potential challenge in increasing patient knowledge may be the milieu in which
      the educational intervention is administered. This study will be the first prospective study
      to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC
      screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC.
