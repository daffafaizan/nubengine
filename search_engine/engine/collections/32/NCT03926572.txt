      composite endpoint including death, circulatory assistance or emergency transplantation
      within 90 days following admission to intensive care unit. Patients will be treated according
      to the usual practice. A biobank will be created from blood samples taken at admission, days
      3 and days 7. Prognostic value of pre-selected biomarkers will be analyzed and a proteomic
      analysis will be performed in order to identify new biomarkers. The prognostic value of these
      new biological parameters will be compared to the usual monitoring parameters that will be
      collected during follow-up (clinical, echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters). In a
      second step, it will establish, using a dynamic model, the best combinations of parameters
      allowing to best assessment of prognosis of patients suffering from PH and hospitalized for
      acute right ventricular failure.
