      are generally refractory to be removed by EST and stone extraction balloons and or baskets.
      Traditional rescue therapy was the technique of stone fragmentation using ML. The previous
      reports have shown that EST with ML was successful in the fragmentation of large stones
      yielding stone clearance rate from 68 t0 79 %. EST-LBD has been shown favorable outcome in
      the treatment of large bile duct stone. A meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and
      complications between EST-LBD and EST in the management of CBDS showed that EST-LBD was as
      effective as EST for the removal of large or difficult of CBDS in terms of stone clearance in
      the first ERCP session of 87.87 % vs. 84.15 % and overall clearance of 97.35 % vs. 96.35 %
      but EST-LBD was associated with fewer complications as well as reduced need for ML compared
      to EST. The efficacy of EST-ML versus EST-LBD as a therapy for relatively large CBDS, a mean
      stone size > 20 mm in currently not well defined. The investigators, herein, compared the
      efficacy and complications between EST followed by LBD or ML for the removal of CBDS > 15 mm
      with a mean stone size > 20 mm.
