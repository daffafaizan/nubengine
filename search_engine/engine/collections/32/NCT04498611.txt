           Coefficient (ADC) that can distinguish between pure Ductal Carcinoma in situ (pure DCIS)
           and invasive cancer (DCIS-IC), from June 2019 to 2020 1 Of the 144 patients who obtained
           Diffusion Weighted images (b=0,800,1200) with 3.0-T MRI equipment and diagnosed with
           ductal carcinoma in situ on the biopsy, among 144 patients who did not undergo
           preoperative chemotherapy using a CAD program, the 3-dimensional Apparent Diffusion
           Coefficient value of the tumor is measured and compared with whether or not there is
           invasive cancer after surgery, and the optimal Apparent Diffusion Coefficient reference
           value that can predict the invasive cancer will be retrospectively derived.

        2. Scheduled MRI tests will be performed on patients enrolled from July 2020, and will be
           performed using the standard protocols (3T, contrast enhancement and diffuse enhancement
           images DWI b0,800,1200). Among the MRI images taken, the range of lesions is evaluated
           in contrast-enhanced T1-highlighted images, and the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient
           values of the lesions are three-dimensionally mapped using a CAD program and histogram
           analysis on diffused images. The ADC reference value derived from the retrospective
           analysis is used to predict prospectively for invasive cancer in all lesions.

        3. Mastectomy is performed according to the existing surgical method. Axillary lymph node
           surgery is determined according to the existing decision method (tumor location, size,
           range, histological grade, etc.).
