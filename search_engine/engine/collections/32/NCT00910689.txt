      initial inclusion criteria received "optimal" acute therapy (OAT). At the end of the OAT
      Run-in, participants who continued to meet the migraine severity criteria were stratified by
      sex and randomized via a computerized randomization procedure to the four added treatments:
      Beta Blocker Placebo (PL), Beta Blocker (Propranolol LA or Nadolol), Behavioral Migraine
      Management (BMM) + PL, or BMM + Beta Blocker. Each of the 4 treatment protocols required 4
      monthly clinic visits and 3 telephone contacts during the 3 month Treatment/Dose Adjustment
      Phase (Month 2 to Month 4) where Beta Blocker or PL dose was adjusted and BMM was
      administered. During the 12 month (Month 5 to Month 16) Evaluation Phase clinic visits were
      scheduled at Month 5, Month 7, Month 10 (the Primary End Point), Month 13 and Month 16.
      Treatment conditions were blinded only for the preventive medication (Beta Blocker, Placebo)
      component, and not for the administration of BMM. Electronic headache diary recordings are
      obtained for the full 16 months of the trial, including the 12 month evaluation phase, and
      migraine-related impairments in quality of life are assessed at multiple points over the 16
      months of the trial.
