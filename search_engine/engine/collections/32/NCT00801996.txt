      prostate cancer. Individuals in the study population will be of Arab descent from Qatar. In
      this protocol, researchers will survey epidemiologic factors and medical records of patients
      with prostate cancer in order to study the clinical characteristics of these individuals. The
      researchers will collect blood and tissue samples to evaluate the genetic characteristics of
      individuals with prostate cancer. The researchers will also collect blood samples of
      individuals without prostate cancer to serve as a control. The goal will be to identify genes
      that are associated with prostate cancer and gene profiles that are associated with differing
      prognoses in individuals who have prostate cancer.
