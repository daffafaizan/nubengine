      combination of insulin and metformin in treating patients with gestational diabetes (GDM).
      Currently, outside of pregnancy, the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with both
      metformin and insulin is superior to using insulin alone. In pregnancy, insulin alone has
      traditionally been used, though some advocate the use of metformin alone as primary therapy.
      There have been no trials published to date specifically comparing combination therapy to
      insulin alone. Our hypothesis is that the combination of metformin and insulin will improve
      overall control of blood glucose, the improvement of which has been demonstrated to improve
      maternal and neonatal outcomes. Control of blood glucose will be determined by hemoglobin A1c
      at the time of delivery.
