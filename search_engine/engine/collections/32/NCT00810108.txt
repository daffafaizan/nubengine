      At least 660,000 children worldwide have advanced HIV/AIDS and are in dire need of
      antiretroviral treatment. While many barriers exist to scaling up HIV/AIDS care and treatment
      globally, access to life-saving treatments for children is increasing. The protease
      inhibitor, lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraÂ®), is recommended as a first-line agent by the World
      Health Organization and by the US Department of Health and Human Services for the treatment
      of pediatric patients in resource-limited settings and in the United States.

      The prescribing information states that these tablets may not be crushed, broken or chewed,
      and the manufacturer does not plan to examine the pharmacokinetics of crushed tablets at this
      time. The company found that the crushed tablets were poorly absorbed in a small
      pharmacokinetic study in several dogs. While this information has spread through
      investigators by word-of-mouth, this information has not been published in any forum by the
      company, and no guidance as to the extent of the decrease in absorption has been provided.
      However, patients and caregivers are dosing pediatric patients with crushed tablets to
      overcome some of the limitations of the oral solution. If crushed tablet administration
      yields significantly lower systemic exposure to lopinavir than whole tablets, then patients
      using this administration technique will be at higher risk for development of viral
      resistance and treatment failure. This administration technique must be studied so that
      providers have evidence to support recommendations about this dose administration strategy.
