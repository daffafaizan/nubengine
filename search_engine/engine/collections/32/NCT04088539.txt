      cigarette smokers in Hong Kong in 2017 and half will be killed by smoking [5] which accounts
      for over 7,000 deaths per year. Smoking is a highly addictive behavior and it is difficult
      for smokers with strong nicotine dependence to quit without assistance. Despite the low
      smoking rate in the general population, smoking prevalence remain high in the correctional
      institutions. Incarcerated prisoners suffer disproportionately from mental illness, substance
      use disorders and disease infections. They are in need of health care such as treatment or
      prevention for smoking. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of smoking cessation
      intervention in the correctional setting. More work is required to provide smoking cessation
      assistance to these high risk and underserved population.

      The aim of this project is to promote and evaluate a smoking cessation intervention through
      the "Quit to Win" Contest organised in correctional institutions in Hong Kong. The specific
      objectives of the study are:

        1. To test the effectiveness of face-to-face brief cessation advice (AWARD) and video
           education for smoking cessation among current smokers at the correctional institutions
           in Hong Kong;

        2. To evaluate the process and outcome of the recruitment of smokers through qualitative
           interviews; and

        3. To conduct qualitative interviews with quitters and non-quitters to examine their
           experience on the intervention.
