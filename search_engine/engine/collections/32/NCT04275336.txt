      Therefore, venipuncture has become a major source of pain. Without pain management can lead
      to moderate to severe pain and can cause fear, tension and anxiety in children. The current
      pain relief form include pharmacologic(i.e. topical anesthetic) and psychological(i.e.
      distraction) interventions. Psychological interventions are not as good as pharmacologic
      methods in terms of pain relief, but it is more conducive to relieve children's distress
      reactions such as fear and anxiety. There are less high qualified evidences supporting that
      pharmacologic combined with psychological interventions can enhance children's abilities to
      cope with painful procedures successfully. The hypothesis of the current study is that
      topical anesthetic combined with psychological interventions can decrease children's pain and
      distress.

      The current study adopts a randomized, blind, controlled intervention trial. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to three groups: a lidocaine group, a psychological interventions
      group, or a combined group(lidocaine plus psychological interventions). The outcomes include
      self-reported pain, observer-reported pain, salivary cortisol and physiological measurement.
