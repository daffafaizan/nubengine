      responsible for making red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The stem cells are
      collected by a process called leukapheresis and will be frozen for later use. After receiving
      the chemotherapy drugs, the stem cells will be thawed and given like a blood transfusion.
      This is called autologous stem cell transplant or rescue. The study doctors will be measuring
      how well the disease responds to the drugs as well as any side effects to the drugs. During
      the course of this study, blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained to measure levels of
      the chemotherapy drugs as well as levels of certain enzymes (proteins).

      The staff of the Blood and Marrow Transplant program will continue to collect information
      about the participant's disease and its treatment for the rest of their life.
