      episodes of aspirations defined as penetration of material - liquids, food, saliva, into the
      respiratory system due to a malfunctioning of the swallowing mechanism) are subject to
      pathologies and pulmonary insufficiencies. The risks of aspiration pneumonia or suffocation
      are significantly greater if the patient is not able to expectorate and thus engages the
      vital prognosis. There are several methods to treat chronic aspirations: the least invasive
      methods involve adopting postures and/or positions of the body during swallowing and adapting
      food textures; when these treatments are insufficient there is the need to recur to more
      advanced ones to protect the airways and keep the patient on a sufficient nutrition.

      For these severe cases, heavier surgical methods can be also considered. These methods lead
      to important anatomical changes, with a variable degree of reversibility, up to
      irreversibility (eg total laryngectomy). Among surgical methods, there is also an implant of
      a tracheotomy cuffed cannula that allows patient to breathe through a hole in the trachea.
      The efficacy of this solution is highly controversial as reported by numerous studies and
      several adverse effects are reported on the tracheal duct.

      Due to the interest of a prosthetic treatment and the disadvantages of the current methods
      and devices, PROTiP Medical has developed a closed intra-laryngeal implant: NewBreez LD. This
      device is innovative because its geometry has been optimized to conform totally to the
      anatomy of the larynx with the aim to ensure a sealing against saliva, liquids and food
      aspirations.
