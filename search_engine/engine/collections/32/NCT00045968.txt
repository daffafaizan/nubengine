    
      This Phase III trial is designed to evaluate the impact on disease progression and survival
      time, as well as safety, in patients following treatment with DCVax(R)-L, an immunotherapy
      treatment for GBM. The experimental therapy uses a patient's own tumor lysate and white blood
      cells from which precursors of the dendritic cells are isolated. The dendritic cell is the
      starter engine of the immune system. The white cells are then made into dendritic cells and
      they are educated to "teach" the immune system how to recognize brain cancer cells. Eligible
      patients will receive a series of injections of DCVax-L, to activate and then boost the
      immune response to the tumor cells.

      The primary study endpoint is PFS (progression free survival), and the first secondary
      endpoint is overall survival (OS). Other endpoints include performance status, immune
      response, and also safety. Interim analyses to assess efficacy are incorporated in the trial
      design.

      Side effects reported from early trials are mostly mild, and may include skin reactions of
      redness, pain & swelling at the injection site.
