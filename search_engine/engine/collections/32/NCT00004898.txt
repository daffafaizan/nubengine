      etoposide with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) in patients with high grade
      lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      etoposide when combined with cyclophosphamide and TBI in these patients. III. Determine the
      response rate in patients treated with this induction regimen. IV. Determine the potential
      for long term survival in patients with relapsed lymphoblastic lymphoma and chemotherapy
      responsiveness treated with this induction regimen. V. Determine the efficacy of this
      induction regimen followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT)
      in patients with ALL in any complete remission. VI. Determine the efficacy of this induction
      regimen followed by APBSCT in patients will ALL after relapse and remission reinduction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients undergo total body
      irradiation twice daily on days -8 to -5. Patients receive etoposide IV over 30 hours
      beginning on day -5 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -3 (beginning 6 hours after
      completion of etoposide infusion) and day -2. Peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on
      day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until blood counts have recovered for 2 days. Cohorts of 5 patients receive
      escalating doses of etoposide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 5 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed every month for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 5 patients will be accrued for this study.
