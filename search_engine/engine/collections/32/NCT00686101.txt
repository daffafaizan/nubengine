    
      This proposed 2-year questionnaire study examines views and attitudes regarding health risks
      of cigarette smoking, smoking patterns and motivators for cessation in smokers who suffer
      from schizophrenia compared to a sample of smokers without a major psychotic disorder. The
      specific goals of this study are to 1) examine differences in the perceived consequences of
      smoking, smoking habits, and motivation to quit between adults with and without schizophrenia
      and 2) identify clinical and demographic variables (e.g., age, race, sex, age of smoking
      onset, knowledge of smoking consequences, insurance status, family support, co-occurring
      substance abuse, education level, current health status) associated with motivation to quit
      smoking among individuals with and without schizophrenia. This secondary goal is exploratory
      in nature. We will identify potential predictors in each group separately and also assess if
      these potential predictors differ between groups.

      The study will consist of one 2-hour visit, where each subject, after signing consent, will
      participate in a semi-structured interview as well as answer clinical and demographic
      information. Patient volunteers will be recruited from the MPRC Outpatient and Inpatient
      Programs and through NIDA. Control subjects will be recruited by MPRC and NIDA via newspaper
      advertisements from the Baltimore metropolitan area. We anticipate recruiting up to 110
      schizophrenia patients for a total of 100 completers and up to 110 normal controls for a
      total of 100 completers. All participants will be 18-65 years old, will smoke cigarettes
      daily, and must not be interested in reducing or quitting tobacco use.
