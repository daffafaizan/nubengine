    
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase I/IIa two-part study with a sequential dose
      escalation part, followed by three parallel Extension cohorts (BRAF-mutated melanoma,
      BRAF-mutated non-melanoma solid tumors, and BRAF-mutated classical hairy cell leukemia). Up
      to approximately 42 patients may be enrolled in the dose escalation phase of the study,
      depending on the number of cohorts required, number of patients per cohort needed, and the
      need for replacement patients. Approximately 130 patients are planned to be enrolled in the
      BRAF-mutated tumor Extension cohorts, with the goal of enrolling approximately 50 patients
      with BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor-na√Øve melanoma, approximately 10-15 patients with BRAF/MEK/ERK
      inhibitor-pretreated melanoma, approximately 50 patients with non-melanoma solid tumors, and
      approximately 10-15 patients with hairy cell leukemia. The trial was intended to be a Phase
      1/2 trial, but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2.
