      retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas. This procedure also includes the removal of the healthy
      adrenal gland ipsilateral to the tumor site.

      The investigators think that a such extended surgical approach together with the removal of
      the adrenal gland may lead to a state of acute adrenal insufficiency and related hemodynamic
      instability.

      In order to recognize this condition the investigators use a low dose ACTH test (Synacthen
      test) during the 1° and 10° post-operative days.
