      patients with atrial fibrillation is crucial. LAA thrombus can be a frequent cause of
      cerebral stroke or peripheral embolism post cardioversion, and anticoagulation therapy is
      required in these instances to prevent cerebral events and avoid embolization. To date, TEE
      has been considered the clinical reference in detection of LAA thrombi with high diagnostic
      accuracy. However, diagnosis and size estimation of LAA thrombi remains challenging due to
      the complex anatomy of the LAA, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered a
      semi-invasive procedure. To date, there have been few comparative studies involving TEE and
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and the results have been conflicting. With newer
      CMR Imaging techniques now available, we hypothesize that comparable results will be achieved
      in detecting LAA thrombus in subjects using a less invasive procedure.
