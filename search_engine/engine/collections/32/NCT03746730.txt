      inflammatory, systemic, obstructive and neoplastic conditions . Clinical examination alone
      will not provide the correct diagnosis of salivary gland pathologies. Thus, radiological
      evaluation is essential in correct diagnosis .

      USG plays a significant and crucial role in the diagnosis and management of salivary gland
      lesions. Results of the USG examination alone may suggest the final diagnosis or provide
      important differential diagnostic data . USG can differentiate intraglandular from
      extraglandular lesions in 98% of cases. It can differentiate salivary gland lesions as focal
      or diffuse. Characterisation of focal lesions into benign and malignant can be done by
      evaluation of edges. With high resolution transducers USG is better than CT or MRI in
      detection of unsharp borders .

      Color Doppler findings are helpful in characterising the pathologies. It is helpful in
      diagnosing pleomorphic adenoma. Doppler findings of intralesional vascularity, type and grade
      of vascularity, PSV, RI and PI are useful in differentiating benign from malignant tumours .
      Pathological diagnosis can be established by Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). FNAC is
      preferably done under USG guidance. This helps in further enhancing ability of USG to
      differentiate between benign and malignant lesions .

      Other radiological investigations for evaluation of salivary gland pathologies are plain
      radiography, sialography, CT, MRI and PET-CT .

      Sometimes it is not possible to visualize lesions completely on USG because of their
      location, extension into the deep lobe of the parotid gland or behind the acoustic shadow of
      the mandible In these situations, further imaging with CT or MRI is necessary.
