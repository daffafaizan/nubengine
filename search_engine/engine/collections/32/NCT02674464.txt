      team, including a community health worker (CHW) to deliver community-based contextualized
      care, reduces disparities in blood pressure control rates, lowers cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk, and improves outcomes among patients with hypertension and other common comorbid
      conditions when compared to standard of care health system approaches to CVD risk management,
      including audit and feedback and staff and provider training.

      Collaborative care includes care coordination and care management; regular and proactive
      monitoring and treatment to target specific patient needs using validated clinical tools and
      rating scales; and regular systematic caseload reviews by the care team and consultation with
      experts for patients who do not show clinical improvement. A typical collaborative care team
      includes the primary care provider, nurse care manager or coordinator, and other members of
      the clinic staff involved in patient care.

      Intervention protocols are designed to address common comorbidities (diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, depression and coronary heart disease), lifestyle factors (dietary intake,
      physical activity, and smoking) and medication adherence. The intensive intervention treats
      the "whole" patient, driven by individual patient goals and priorities, as opposed to the
      standard of care, which typically focuses on individual conditions. This proposed study
      responds directly to patient desires to feel more equipped to be involved in their care and
      manage multiple conditions that contribute to CVD. The investigators have worked successfully
      in the past with a broad range of stakeholders, including community members, patients,
      providers, and payors, and will continue to engage them through the research and
      dissemination process.
