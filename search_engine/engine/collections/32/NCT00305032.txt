      significant weight loss could improve the severity of sleep apnea. Significant weight loss is
      difficult to achieve especially in morbidly obese patients. Endoscopic gastric balloon
      insertion is minimally invasive procedure is employed by surgeon for weight reduction for
      morbidly obese patients. This study would assess the parameters of sleep which could be
      affected by weight reduction. If results are positive, this procedure might be considered as
      treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in morbidly obese patients.

      Patient population would be selected from patients who would undergo gastric balloon
      insertion in the surgical department. There would be no sex or age limit. Patient recruited
      would have BMI > 35. Consent would be signed for sleep studies. Baseline sleep study, lung
      function, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and quality of life would be assessed in patients
      who have symptoms suggestive of OSA. If a patient is confirmed to have OSA, a continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration would be offered if the patient is willing to try
      CPAP. Otherwise patients would be discharged home and wait for balloon insertion. The same
      assessment would be repeated 3 months and 6 months after the surgical procedure. All sleep
      studies would be done as in-patient.

      Leptin and ghrelin are hormones control satiety, which are also related to the degree of
      obesity. Blood for plasma leptin and ghrelin would be taken before and 6 months after gastric
      balloon insertion to assess the relationship of weight reduction by reducing appetite and
      plasma level of the hormones
