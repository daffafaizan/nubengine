      studied.randomization is startified by three birth weigth classes (<1000g, 1000-1500g,1500 -
      2000g) human milk fortifier is introduced in two steps after oral feeding is achieved. two
      acid-base status and electrolyte concentrations are measured. when metabolic acidosis,
      defined as BE < -6 mmol/l, occurs fortifier feeding is stopped, and after a wash-out period
      of three days the alternative product is used.again, occurence of metabolic acidosis, need
      for oral bicarbonate and effect on longitudinal growth an weight gain are registered.
