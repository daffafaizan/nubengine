      of 5 %. While stage I and II tumors leads to an improvement in survival, almost all PCs are
      currently diagnosed at more advanced non-resectable stages since minimally invasive technique
      which is capable of screening early-stage PC does not exist. Serum CA19-9 is not recommended
      as a screening technique because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Imaging modalities
      such as MRI, CT, EUS and ERCP are more accurate but are not appropriate screening tools due
      to their high cost, discomfort and complications. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a
      screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity which is highly acceptable for the
      patient.

      The investigators would like to standardize the detection method of pancreatic cancer that
      uses the duodenal juice as an optional endoscopic diagnosis. It's a very useful chance to
      collect pancreatic juice from duodenum, it is called "duodenal juice" ,if we collect them
      without additional invasion. The investigators would like to collect duodenal juice during
      undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and analyze the pancreatic tumor markers in
      duodenal juice. A definite diagnosis of the patient is made with histology, cytology or
      imaging diagnosis and the result of each definite diagnosis is correlated to the each marker
      analyzing result of duodenal juice. Therefore this study can be positioned as a feasibility
      study to confirm clinical performance.
