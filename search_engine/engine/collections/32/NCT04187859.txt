      innovative prompting cup and education as person-centred and holistic tools to empower
      nursing leadership to reduce frailty in a catheterised community-dwelling population. This
      project will investigate interventions to improve hydration as potentially economically
      viable solutions to reducing frailty in a vulnerable population. Interventions have been
      developed using behaviour change theory and techniques. 80 participants will be recruited and
      will receive one of three interventions or usual care for a period of 12 weeks, data will be
      collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and
      routine hospital records will be collected or accessed as part of the study.
