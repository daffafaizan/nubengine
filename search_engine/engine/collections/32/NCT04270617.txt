      practice is superior to usual conservative therapies in the treatment of chronic back pain at
      6 months. There is enough data that the most recent ACP guidelines have included yoga as a
      treatment for chronic back pain, but more data needs to be generated regarding the efficacy
      of this modality in treating the chronic back pain population.
