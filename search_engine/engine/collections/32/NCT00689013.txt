      immunizations from pharmacists, as well as the effects of pharmacist involvement in
      advocating and administering vaccinations. The most well documented studies have been
      conducted in hospital settings. Undoubtedly, there is enormous opportunity for the community
      pharmacist to identify potential vaccine recipients, advocate immunization and administer
      said immunizations to their established patient populations. However, there is a lack of
      concentrated study in the implementation of immunization services in the community setting
      and their effects. The investigators intend to evaluate the intervention of pharmacists in an
      immunization program and the resulting changes in immunization rates.
