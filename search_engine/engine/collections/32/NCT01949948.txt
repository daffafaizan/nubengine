      stroke <4½ hours after stroke onset. 2) Tenecteplase 0,4 mg/kg (single bolus)has superior
      efficacy and safety compared with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus + 90% infusion/60 minutes)
      when given within 4 ½ hours after stroke onset.

      DESIGN: NOR-TEST is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded
      endpoint) trial with randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase 1:1.

      POWER CALCULATION: NOR-TEST aims at detecting a 9 % higher percentage excellent outcome with
      tenecteplase vs. alteplase (r1=0.40; r2=0.49; OR 1.44; power 0.8), and will include 954
      patients during 3 years.

      PATIENT RECRUITMENT: All patients found eligible for thrombolytic therapy are eligible for
      NOR-TEST, i.e. NOR-TEST changes neither inclusion nor exclusion criteria. The number of
      patients treated at a participating centre will therefore essentially remain unchanged.
      Estimated 400 patients are thrombolysed per year in participating centres. Allowing for 20%
      of patients not being included in NOR-TEST, the total number of patients (n=954) will still
      be met.
