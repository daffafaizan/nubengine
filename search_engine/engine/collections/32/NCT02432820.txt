        1. To evaluate congruence between pelvic anatomical structures segmented on MRI and/or CT
           scans co-registered with transperineal US scans acquired with an optically and/or
           electromagnetically tracked matrix array ultrasound transducer.

        2. To estimate the achievable accuracy of anatomy tracking based on 3D US matrix-array
           transducer imaging and grey-level based image registration algorithms.
