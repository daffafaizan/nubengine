      medical information via a secure internet platform on the anxiety level of patients before
      their surgery. For this, patients agreeing to participate in the study will be randomized
      (drawn at random) during the inclusion visit and divided into one of the following two
      groups:

        -  The control group: patients included in this group will receive the usual medical
           information as part of the surgery performed;

        -  The experimental group: the patients included in this group will have, in addition to
           the usual medical information, personalized and secure access to a platform so that they
           can have additional information on the surgery performed.
