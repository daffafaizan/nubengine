           the supine position and heads rotated contralaterally to the examination side. A 5-12
           MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer was used to observe both longitudinal and
           transverse views of bilateral SCM muscles for each subject. The ultrasound system
           settings, including gain (86%), monitor dynamic range (70 dB), and depth (2 cm), were
           kept constant throughout the study.

        2. The echo intensity was determined by computer-assisted gray scale analysis and was
           calculated in MATLAB 2006b. The mean echo intensity of every pixel in the region of
           interest and the K value developed to compare sonograms between different individuals or
           between different times in the same subject were estimated as the previous study (PMID:
