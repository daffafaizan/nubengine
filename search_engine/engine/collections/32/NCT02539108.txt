    
      Study participants will be assigned to the appropriate age group (6 months to < 36 months of
      age or 3 years to < 9 years of age) based on the subject's age at the time of enrollment.
      Participants aged 6 months to < 36 months will receive a 0.25 mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent
      vaccine and those aged 3 years to < 9 years will receive a 0.5 mL dose of Fluzone
      Quadrivalent vaccine. Participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per
      ACIP guidance, will receive a second dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit 2 (28
      days after Visit 1).

      Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each vaccination,
      unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or to Visit 3 for those
      subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event (SAE) information will be collected from
      Visit 1 to Visit 2 or Visit 3, as appropriate.

      Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and
      at Day 28 after the final vaccination using the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) technique.
      For each influenza vaccine strain, pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers (GMTs)
      will be calculated.
