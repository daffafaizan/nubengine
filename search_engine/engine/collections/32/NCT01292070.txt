      to cat allergens. Cat allergy in humans is an allergic reaction to one or more of the five
      known allergens produced by cats. The most common of these is the protein Fel d 1.

      This study will test Intradermal Human Fcγ1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD), a new protein that,
      based on animal data, has been developed to block the allergic effects of cat. If this drug
      works the way they think it does, it may become a treatment for cat allergy that is faster
      than the currently available treatments and with fewer side effects. This protein contains
      the molecule from the cat, that causes the allergic reaction, attached to a section of a
      particular antibody (protein involved in immunity) called Fcγ1 that acts like a break. The
      fusion of the two proteins is predicted to interrupt the flow of cellular reactions which
      lead to the allergic response.

      This will be the first time GFD is administered to humans. The study will be conducted in two
      parts. The subjects in part A will be administered intradermal standardized cat hair
      allergenic extract (CAT) and GFD sequentially in 10-fold increasing doses every 20 minutes.
      If Part A demonstrates the safety of GFD,subject in part B will begin by following the same
      treatment as part A followed by a rechallenge of the sites with CAT at 4 hours after the
      first dose of GFD. Each subject will be evaluated 3 times (screening, dosing, and telephone
      follow-up 2 days post dosing) and will return on Day 28 for blood draw.
