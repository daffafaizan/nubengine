    
      The present study is designed as a prospective single center study. All selected patients
      with implanted ICD to prevent VT/VF recurrence who are referred to the Arrhythmology
      Department of San Donato Milanese Hospital, for the management of a primary cardiomyopathy
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Primary cardiomyopathies include: -
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), - arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), -
      left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), - early repolarization syndrome (ER), and -
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Patients with a family history of BrS, will also be
      included. Endo-epicardial electroanatomical 3Dmapping and RFA ablation will be systematically
      performed according to a standardized procedure. Patients will be monitored for at least 3
      days after RF ablation. Before hospital discharge, echocardiography and 12-lead ECG will be
      performed. Patients will be followed-up clinically after the procedure as per normal clinical
      practice. Follow-up visits will be systematically scheduled at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
      12-lead ECG and ICD interrogation will be performed at each follow-up visit. Patients will be
      instructed to immediately contact the center in case of symptoms suggestive of ventricular
      arrhythmias. Documentation for intercurrent events will be requested and collected. The
      maximal duration of study participation for the individual patients is two years.
