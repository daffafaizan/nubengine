      medicine. Thus the possibility of quickly attributing an infectious origin to a febrile
      and/or inflammatory syndrome makes it possible to treat and refer the patient quickly. In
      addition, the ability to distinguish bacterial etiology from viral etiology provides a
      valuable additional indication for the clinician. This of the upmost importance for fragile
      populations such as elderly patients and in epidemic conditions such as influenza. A new
      rapid diagnostic guidance solution is proposed by the Beckman Coulter Laboratory with the
      simultaneous assay of two biomarkers, one allowing the detection of a viral infectious
      process (CD169), the other of a bacterial infectious process (CD64). The combination of these
      two biomarkers, measured in 12 minutes by a new generation assay and flow cytometer,
      represents an opportunity for emergency services.

      To date, there is no study on the validation of this diagnostic orientation method. We
      propose to carry out a prospective, observational, non-interventional feasibility study to
      compare the results of these measurements with the usual diagnostic criteria combining the
      clinical signs, infectious testing, and biological data.
