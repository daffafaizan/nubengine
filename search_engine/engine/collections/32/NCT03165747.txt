      significant cause of disability and morbidity. Many drugs are approved for the prevention and
      treatment of osteoporosis, but are associated with high costs and side effects. Some data
      from animal studies suggests that supplementation with probiotics can safely treat and
      prevent osteoporosis. The probiotic VSL#3 is commercially available, is safe for human
      consumption, and has been widely used in human clinical trials, and has known
      health-promoting effects in both children and adults.

      The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of VSL#3 will be conducted in a
      population of ambulatory, otherwise healthy, postmenopausal women for 12 months. Control and
      VSL#3-treated postmenopausal women will be matched by age (Â± 3 years). Study visits will
      include all or some of the following procedures: a medical exam, urine collection, height and
      weight measurement, a blood draw to assess bone biomarkers, a dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure bone density, and health questionnaires.

      The primary endpoint is the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the L1-4 lumbar spine
      over one year of study. Changes in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip area will be
      secondary endpoints. All BMD data will also be used as a tool for future studies power
      calculation and design. Additional endpoints will include changes in bone turnover markers
      and inflammatory/osteoclastogenic cytokines. Measurements of indices of bone turnover and
      cytokine levels will provide much needed mechanistic information.The data will allow to
      establish whether VSL#3 prevents bone loss and/or increases bone mass by regulating bone
      resorption, formation, or both.
