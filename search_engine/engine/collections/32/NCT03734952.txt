      which is characterized by rapid development and fatal prognosis in most patients. Neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has been explored for many years in western countries and Japan, and
      proved to get survival benefit, especially for locally advanced esophageal cancer. However,
      the recurrence is the major cause of treatment failure in patients with ESCC. Our hypothesis
      is that inadequate radiation dose leads to recurrence of ESCC with nCRT and PORT lower
      recurrence rate and improved OS. As is known, there are no any studies concentrating on PORT
      in ESCC with nCRT. Patients are randomly assigned to PORT (Group A) or without PORT (Group B)
      with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is OS assessed with a minimum follow-up of
      60 months. Secondary outcomes are progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence-free survival
      (RFS).
