    
      Patients older than 18 years of age diagnosed with an acute supratentorial ischemic stroke
      within 48 hrs of symptom onset will be prospectively enrolled. Research imaging will be
      obtained before 7 days after symptom onset. The patient will receive the standardized
      treatment protocol at the hospital. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient or a
      substitute decision maker for each individual imaging study (CTP, Rb PET, and FDG PET). The
      patient will be given the option of undergoing the CTP imaging with the Rb PET only or both
      the Rb PET and FDG PET components.
