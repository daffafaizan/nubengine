      glenoid capsule, the development of fibrosis and a progressive decrease in the range of joint
      movement with pain. Shoulder pain and stiffness are accompanied by disability. It is thought
      that the incidence is 3% to 5% in the general population and 20% in people with diabetes.
      Although usually reported to be self-limiting in 2 to 3 years, studies have reported that 40%
      of patients have persistent pain and stiffness for more than 3 years.

      Therefore, various therapies are used to reduce pain and increase the range of motion more
      rapidly without waiting for spontaneous recovery. Adhesive capsulitis treatment includes
      conservative and surgical treatment options. The options for non-surgical treatments are
      pharmacological treatments including intra-articular injection and physical therapy
      modalities. As for physical therapy modalities, various interventions are used. These include
      heat or ice, therapeutic ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and laser
      therapies.

      The aim of exercise programs consisting of joint range of motion (ROM), strengthening and
      stretching exercises, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and mobilization techniques
      is to alleviate pain caused by the capsular contracture and to improve glenohumeral ROM.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the effects of high-intensity laser
      therapy on pain, disease - related disability and quality of life in patients with shoulder
      restriction and pain due to adhesive capsulitis.
