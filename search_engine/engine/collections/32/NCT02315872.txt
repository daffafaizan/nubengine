    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the
      safety, tolerability, and effect of ACTH on fatigue in patients with relapsing multiple
      sclerosis (RMS). The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of ACTH versus
      placebo in reducing fatigability in patients with RMS. Secondary objectives include
      assessment of the tolerability and safety of twice-weekly ACTH treatment vs. placebo and
      evaluation of ACTH on depression, sleepiness, and quality of life measures and correlations
      between these measures.
