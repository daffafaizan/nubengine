      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 . The first outbreak reported
      was in December2019, in Wuhan, China, as pneumonia of unknown etiology linked to a seafood
      market exposure COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people
      will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

      The evolution of the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and its expeditious dissemination
      have led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on 11 March 2020 . As
      of 16 May 2020, there have been 4,425,485 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 302,059 related deaths
      worldwide and Egypt has been among the most affected countries in the Eastern Mediterranean
      region with 11,228 confirmed cases and 592 deaths .

      As a consequence, many countries, including Egypt, have set a state of lockdown to hinder the
      spread of infection among people resulting in a global atmosphere of depression and anxiety
      associated with social isolation, fears of getting infected, breaks in the supply chains,
      financial distress, disrupted travel plans, and future uncertainty . Several epidemiological
      studies from China detected a high prevalence of psychological disturbances among the public
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a large online survey of 56,679 individuals from
      34 provinces in China reported numerous psychological conditions during the COVID-19
      pandemic: depression (27.9%), anxiety (31.6%), stress (24.4%), and insomnia (29.2%) . Also, a
      study conducted on 4872 Chinese people from 31 provinces showed a high prevalence of
      depression (48.3%) and anxiety (22.6%) related to the COVID-19 pandemic . A similar study
      revealed depression (20.1%), anxiety (35.1%), and poor sleeping (18.2%) among 7236 Chinese
      people . Another study conducted on 7143 college students in China detected anxiety among 25%
      of them .

      In low- and middle-income countries, such as Egypt, where infection control precautions,
      surveillance programs, laboratory capacity, and public health resources are limited , the
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging and, as a result, the psychological impacts
      of the pandemic on the public can be even worse. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate
      several forms of psychological disturbances .
