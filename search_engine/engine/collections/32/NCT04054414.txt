      number of these injuries comprising of traumatic spinal cord injury. People with spinal cord
      injuries (SCI) are two to five times more susceptible to die than people without an injury.
      More than 80% cases of SCIs occur among young people between the ages of 20 and 45 years and
      majority of sufferers are male. In developed countries, the incidence of spinal injuries
      varies from 20 to 50 per million. Every year about 250,000 to 500,000 number of SCI cases are
      reported.

      There are hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the spinal
      cord. Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal
      progenitor cells in the spinal cord to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons
      and blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activity.

      Sovateltide is an endothelin B (ETB) receptor agonist (previously used names IRL-1620,
      SPI-1620 and PMZ-1620; International Non-proprietary Name (INN) approved by WHO is
      sovateltide). Activation of ETB receptors with PMZ-1620 produces neurovascular repair and
      remodeling or neuroregeneration.
