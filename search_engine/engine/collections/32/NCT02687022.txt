      In LASIK, information derived from aberrometry (scans performed using aberrometers) is used
      to program the pattern of laser pulses delivered by an excimer laser in therapeutic reshaping
      of the cornea to correct defocus. To do this accurately, aberrometry findings need to be
      repeatable and correspond closely to manifest refraction. Here the investigators compare
      repeatability of measurements for a new aberrometer (Peramis) versus the aberrometer most
      widely used in contemporary wavefront guided laser vision correction (iDesign).

      The test aberrometer will be:

      Peramis (Schwind Eye-tech Solutions, Kleinostheim, Germany).

      Control aberrometer will be:

      iDesign (AMO, Santa Clara, CA)
