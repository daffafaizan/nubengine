      activity prior to and after a surgical procedure reduces the surgical-related postoperative
      recovery time, hospital stay, sick leave and complication rate.

      A secondary aim is to investigate the effect of a training program with pre- and post-
      operative PA on the rate of resumption of QoL and normal physical function.
