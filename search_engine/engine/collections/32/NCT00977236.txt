      progression in low myopes. To date, clinical experience has shown the technique to be less
      effective in achieving full myopic reduction in high myopes. Would myopic control be possible
      for high myopes undergoing partial correction ortho-k treatment?

      A randomized, longitudinal study is designed to investigate the efficacy of partial
      correction ortho-k in retardation of myopic progression in high myopic children. Eye growth
      in terms of axial length elongation in children wearing ortho-k and over-spectacles (to
      correct residual refractive errors) (study group) and those wearing single-vision spectacles
      (control group) will be evaluated and compared.
