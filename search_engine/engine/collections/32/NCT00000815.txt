      morbidity and mortality with the benefit of achieving the highest seroconversion rates.
      Immunizing a more intact immune system at an earlier stage of HIV infection may in turn
      achieve better and long-lasting measles protection. This study will help define a more
      effective measles vaccine regimen for children diagnosed with HIV infection and will provide
      greater insight into the functional status of the HIV-infected children's humoral immune
      system.

      Patients, HIV infected and uninfected, are randomized to one of two attenuated measles
      vaccine schedules: at 6 and 12 months of age, or at 12 months of age only. Attenuvax is
      administered as the month 6 vaccine and M-M-R II as the month 12 vaccine. Patients are
      followed for 24 months after the last vaccination.
