      function quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) following a
      combined intervention of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary program
      plus a home-based exercise program, and following a home-based exercise program alone; and
      (2) compare the changes in microvascular function and inflammation in patients following the
      combined DASH diet and home-based exercise program, and the home-based exercise program
      alone.

      The investigators hypothesize that the combined DASH diet and exercise program will result in
      greater increases in 6MWD and in the physical function quality of life than the exercise
      program alone. Further, it is hypothesized that the combined DASH diet and exercise program
      will result in greater improvements in calf muscle oxygen saturation [StO2] following
      exercise, and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP]) than the exercise program
      alone.

      The home-based exercise program consists of intermittent walking to moderate claudication
      pain in a home-based setting. The DASH dietary program consists of the dietary approaches to
      stop hypertension diet emphasizing foods rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
      low-fat dairy.
