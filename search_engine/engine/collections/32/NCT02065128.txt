      demonstrate an increased efferent receptor sensitivity level in ILS subjects as compared to a
      control group. The second is to determine if there is an objective change in capsaicin cough
      challenge results after behavioral therapy, and whether it correlates to the subjective
      improvement. Self-reporting measures include two validated cough quality of life (QoL)
      questionnaires collected at the same intervals as the capsaicin testing.
