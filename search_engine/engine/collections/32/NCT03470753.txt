      participate in a trial investigating the value of different exercise and education
      prescription strategies as well as strategies to determine the influence of various exercise
      reminder strategies. On day 1 of enrollment, patients will be randomized and instructed in
      two different types and amounts of exercises, as well as two types of delivery strategies.
      The ability to recall and perform these exercises will be assessed 20 minutes after
      completion of the instructional period (retention). In phase 2, patients will be randomized
      to receive different reminder strategies (none, email, text, and/or video) and their
      compliance assessed over a 1 month period (compliance). Self-reported compliance over the
      first month, and health care utilization outcomes will be analyzed for the 1 year following
      completion of the 1 month period, in all groups.
