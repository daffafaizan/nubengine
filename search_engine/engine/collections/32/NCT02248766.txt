      subjects' habitual Avaira toric lenses following a refit with Clariti toric lenses. Subject's
      habitual Avaira toric lenses will be evaluated at the first visit and then re-fitted with a
      pair of Clariti toric lenses for 1 month of daily wear. After the dispensing visit, subjects
      will return for evaluations at 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.
