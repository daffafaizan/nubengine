      inclusion criteria. The clinical staff will schedule a tissue biopsy and a blood draw for the
      participant. Blood will be sent to Ashion for DNA extraction. Tumor specimens will be shipped
      to Ashion for DNA and RNA extraction. Ashion will process the samples for DNA and RNA
      Sequencing in their CLIA certified laboratory. A portion of the nucleic acid will be stored
      in Ashion and used to confirm actionable targets. Results will be submitted to the physician
      for possible inclusion in the treatment regimen. After sequencing analysis has been
      performed, a report will be provided to the treating oncologist. The PI and the treating
      oncologist may review the results to identify potential treatment. The treating oncologist
      may use this information at their discretion, and is not required to treat the patient based
      on the targets identified by the GWS analysis.
