    
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea is highly prevalent in patients with resistant hypertension and
      several studies have assessed the effect of CPAP treatment on BP.

      But only few studies have raised data about the effect of CPAP treatment on BP in patients
      with resistant hypertension.

      Hypertension is moreover associated with increased arterial stiffness, but no data are
      available in patients with resistant hypertension.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that OSA has a major impact in resistant
      hypertension, whose effects on BP and arterial stiffness can partially be reversible with
      CPAP treatment.
