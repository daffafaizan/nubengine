    
      SJCAR19 is a Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the use of SJCAR19 (CD19- specific CAR
      engineered autologous T-cells) in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with
      relapsed/ refractory CD19+ ALL. Treatment will include a single treatment course, with most
      patients receiving a lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen of fludarabine/
      cyclophosphamide, followed by a single infusion of SJCAR19.

      This protocol contains a 3-part consent process: 1) to proceed with autologous apheresis, 2)
      to proceed with manufacturing of the SJCAR19 product, and 3) to receive treatment with the
      SJCAR19 product (initially as Phase I, then proceeding to Phase II). The Phase I portion will
      evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SJCAR19.

      The Phase II portion will evaluate the efficacy, and provide further safety evaluation, of
      SJCAR19 in an expansion cohort at the MTD determined in the Phase I portion of the study.
      Additionally, for both the Phase I/II portions of the study there are correlative studies
      evaluating the biology of this treatment as well assessments into patient/caregiver
      experiences with undergoing this treatment.
