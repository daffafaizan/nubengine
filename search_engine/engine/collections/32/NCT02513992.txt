      frequent seizures of short duration, which can not be localized with early ictal SPECT with
      intravenous injection in a cubital vein. An arterial catheter will be inserted. The right
      groin will be disinfected using an alcoholic disinfectant and locally anaesthetized. The
      artery in the groin, the femoral artery, will be punctured. A catheter is inserted in the
      artery and slided towards the heart. To determine the correct position of the catheter
      proximal to the cerebral arteries, a contrast agent will be injected, and at the same time
      radiographs will be taken. The catheter will be attached and taped in the groin. The patient
      will be monitored with video-EEG recording. During an epileptic seizure, the perfusion tracer
      99m-Technetium Ethyl Cysteinate Dimer (99mTc- ECD) dissolved in 30 cc normal saline will be
      injected with a pressure injector over 2 seconds. After injection, the catheter will be
      removed and the ictal SPECT scan will be performed. Subtracted ictal SPECT images
      co-registered with MRI (SISCOM) will be obtained. The investigators plan to do this study in
      one patient in order to assess whether this procedure is logistically possible and to
      determine whether subtraction images of ictal SPECT with intra-arterial injection minus
      interictal SPECT with intravenous injection allows localization of the ictal onset zone.
