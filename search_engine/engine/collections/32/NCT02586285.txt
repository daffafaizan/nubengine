      treatment of HCC have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with HCC, the overall
      survival rate is still unsatisfactory; the 5-year survival rate is only 50-70% even after
      curative treatment such as hepatic resection and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. One of
      the reasons for the poor prognosis of HCC is its high rate of recurrence.However,anti-relapse
      treatment remains a pressing work to do.

      In recent years, some study reported that S-Adenosyl Methionine had an impact on promoting
      apoptosis and inhibiting the growth on breast cancer, colon cancer,gastric cancer and liver
      cancer in vitro and vivo.

      In this study, we aim to examine whether S-Adenosyl Methionine have an effect on improving
      patients' recurrence after curative resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
