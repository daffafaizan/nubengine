    
      Hypothesis The primary question the investigators propose to answer is whether all patients
      undergoing PCI with stent deployment who receive chewed ticagrelor will demonstrate more
      rapid drug absorption and decreased platelet reactivity as compared to integral pill form 1
      hour after drug administration.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) rate at 30 days and 1 year.

             1. Death

             2. Repeat myocardial infarction

             3. Need for urgent revascularization

             4. Cerebrovascular accident

        2. Rate of stent thrombosis and in-stent stenosis at 30 days and 1 year.

        3. Bleeding: Defined as major, minor, or minimal bleeding based on TIMI criteria.
