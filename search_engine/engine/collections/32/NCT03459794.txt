      (CTRU) twice on consecutive days and blood will be drawn from them. On the first occasion
      they will be weighed and will complete the consent process. They will have been randomly
      assigned to the test (Stromectol) or control (placebo) group, with 8 participants in the test
      group and 4 participants in the control group. Stromectol will be obtained from a medical
      supply distributor and a placebo will be obtained through the UGA School of Pharmacy. Drugs
      will be prescribed by Jonathan Murrow MD. They will be stored in their original packaging at
      room temperature in a drug locker in the lab at CTRU. Participants will be identified by
      number and allocated to groups using a block randomization protocol. Randomization and drug
      dispensation will be done by CTRU. Eighteen ml of blood will drawn in a fasting state and
      they will be administered 150 mcg/kg Stromectol or the equivalent number of placebo tablets
      immediately after blood is drawn. Participants will remain at CTRU for four hours after they
      take the drug, then another 15ml of blood will be drawn. On the second day they will attend
      CTRU at the same time and the third blood sample will be drawn 24 hrs after administration of
      the drug. On each occasion the drawn blood will be coded by CTRU staff prior to being
      collected by a member of the Department of Infectious Diseases and taken to the laboratory
      (Wildlife Health G0007) for the isolation of leukocyte populations (peripheral monocytes,
      lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs)) and for the preparation of serum. Complete
      blood counts will also be carried out. Sera will be analyzed on the Luminex for
      cytokine/chemokine content. RNA will be isolated from the cell populations for RNASeq
      analysis.
