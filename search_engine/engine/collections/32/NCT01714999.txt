      prepatellar bursa (PB), due to their exposed and superficial location. Although a common
      injury, the authors are not aware of any study dealing with this entity. In order to get a
      first idea on the treatment concepts currently used, the authors conducted a international
      online survey among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, Austria and Switzerland [1].
      The primary treatment approach of more than 70% of Austrian and German surgeons was
      bursectomy and immobilization, which was performed by less than 50% of Swiss physicians.

      At the Departments of Trauma Surgery of the Medical University of Vienna and of the Medical
      University of Munich, two opposing treatment concepts are being practised. Whereas in Vienna
      a bursectomy is performed in case of traumatic laceration of the OB and PB, a primary bursal
      reconstruction is performed at the Medical University of Munich.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively follow patients who suffered from an acute
      traumatic laceration of the OB or PB treated, according to the local standards, either by
      bursectomy (Vie, AT) or bursal reconstruction and direct wound closure (Muc, GER).

      The Hypothesis of this study is, that there is no difference with respect to complications
      between bursectomy and bursal reconstruction in case of acute traumatic laceration of the OB
      and PB.
