      rise to human malformation/mental retardation syndromes. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is the
      prototypical example of a post-squalene inborn error of metabolism; however, this group of
      disorders now includes lathosterolosis, desmosterolosis, X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia
      (CDPX2), CHILD syndrome, HEM dysplasia, and some cases of Antley-Bixler syndrome (1-3). Due
      to the extremely rare occurrence of some of these disorders, the full phenotypic spectrum has
      yet to be defined. Cholesterol transport in cells can also cause a disorder known as
      Niemann-Pick Disease type C (NPC). NPC belongs to a group of disorders known as lysosomal
      storage disorders. The purpose of this protocol is to 1) allow for the collection of
      biomaterial and medical information that can be studied to gain insight into the pathological
      processes; 2) allow for the collection of DNA and medical information from individuals who
      have a phenotypic resemblance to known disorders of cholesterol synthesis, lysosomal storage
      disorders or individuals who may be carriers of these disorders.
