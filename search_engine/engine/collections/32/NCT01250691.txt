      antimicrobial resistance, and risk factors for lower respiratory tract infections in patients
      followed in the ICU for the last 4 years. The effect of reconfiguration from a ward-type ICU
      consisting one large room to an ICU with isolated rooms with two beds on the incidence of HAP
      was also determined.
