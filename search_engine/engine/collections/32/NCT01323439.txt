      Axium MicroFX coil system in 99 patients at 13 study centers. The primary endpoint of the
      trial was the anatomic occlusion of the aneurysm in the immediate post-procedure angiogram
      basedon the Raymond classification. Secondary endpoints included safety during the procedure,
      safety after the procedure, detachment system performance, stability of the embolization, and
      packing efficacy.
