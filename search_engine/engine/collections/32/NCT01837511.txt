      available at the various investigation sites. There will be no study treatment and no
      study-specific procedure carried out on the patients.

      Clinical data collected will include patient demographics (age, gender), Tumor, Node,
      Metastasis (staging system) [TNM stage], histopathologic description and the patient smoker
      status. Strict anonymity of patient data will be maintained.

      This retrospective study is based upon the analysis of archived formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tissue samples and patient-related data already available at the
      investigational site.
