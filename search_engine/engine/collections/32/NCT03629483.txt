      complication in these patients after surgery and is associated with worse outcomes, including
      prolonged hospital stay, poor functional recovery, decreased cognitive function, increased
      health care costs, and elevated mortality rate. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to prolong the
      duration of nerve block without neurotoxicity and improve postoperative sleep quality. The
      investigators hypothesize that dexmedetomidine, when combined with ropivacaine for continuous
      femoral nerve block, can reduce the incidence of delirium and improve the long-term outcome
      in elderly patients after total knee arthroplasty.
