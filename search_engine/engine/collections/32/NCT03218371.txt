      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were identified. All the participants had undergone a
      chandelier-assisted peripheral vitrectomy under air. Scleral self-indentation had been used
      in 68 eyes (study group) (Indentation group), while non-indentation had been used in 62 eyes
      (comparison group) (Non-indentation group). Outcome variables included: Trimming-induced
      retinal breaks (TIRB), retinal redetachment rate, final LogMAR BCVA, and intraoperative
      complications.
