      current literature reports existence of subjects who are moderately milk intolerant and whose
      intolerance can neither be attributed to a defect in lactose intolerance, nor to milk protein
      allergy. Yet, they experience at least one or two of the following symptoms following milk
      consumption: gases, bloating, abdominal cramp. It is known that the A1gene variant coding for
      beta-casein leads to the production of a bioactive peptide with opioid activity named
      betacasomorphin 7 (BCM7). This peptide has been associated with several metabolic health
      disorders including diabetes, elevated cardiovascular risk and stimulation of
      pro-inflammatory signals. Recently, it was reported that non-lactose milk intolerant subjects
      did not experience such symptoms when consuming milk containing the non-mutated A2 gene
      variant coding for beta-casein. In this study, we hypothesise that consumption of A2 milk
      will improve gastrointestinal symptoms in non-lactose milk intolerant individuals. The
      primary outcome of this study will be the reduction of gastrointestinal inflammation
      following a course of A2 milk consumption.
