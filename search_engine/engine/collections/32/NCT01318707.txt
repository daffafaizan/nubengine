    
      20 adults with severe Hemophilia A seen in one HTC site for routine blood drawing will be
      consented for discard blood sampling.

      Half of the whole blood discard will be placed in a tiger top test tube, and half of the
      whole blood discard sample will be placed in a red top test tube containing exogenously added
      recombinant human FVIII concentrate [Advate, Baxter immuno] to assure an end concentration of
      once IU per CC of whole blood.

      Both whole blood specimens will be allowed to coagulate at room temperature and then will be
      centrifuged to prepare serum. The separated serum from each type of collection test tubes
      will be aliquoted into eppendorf tubes (a minimum of two aliquots per sample) at a volume of
      150 microliters. Aliquoted serum samples will be stored at -70 degrees centigrade and shipped
      on dry ice to Synarc Labs.

      A panel of standard CTX bone resorption assays will be preformed in duplicate on the two
      differently processed serum specimens obtained from each subject.

      Results will be analyzed for inter-subject variability using stored age-matched samples
      provided by Synarc and intra-subject variability will also be analyzed.
