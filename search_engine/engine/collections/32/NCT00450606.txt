      to determine whether twice a week treatments can be as beneficiary as two straight weeks of
      treatments as was shown to be effective in previous studies.

      Our study will follow the patients for a longer period of time (6 months) than was done in
      previous studies.

      An additional advantage will be separating the therapeutical effect of our specific treatment
      from the therapeutical effect of being in a comfortable hotel away from the daily nuisances
      for 2 weeks which by itself has been shown to be pain relieving in patients suffering from
      rheumatic diseases.

      Our study will take 50 patients suffering from Osteoarthritis of the knees and divide them in
      to 2 equal groups. One group will be treated twice a week with thermo-mineral baths at the
      temperature of 35-36 degrees Celsius for approximately 20 minutes. The other group will be
      treated twice a week with hot sweet water tub (without the water jets!) of the same
      temperature and for the same length of time.

      Both groups will change nothing in their current medical treatment.

      The patients will be examined at 5 points during this study: a few days before their first
      treatment, right after their last treatment (after 6 weeks), after one month, after 3 months
      and after 6 months.

      All examination will be performed in the Soroka University Medical Center.

      The clinical indexes and questionnaires which would be filled during this trial will be:

        1. WOMAC index

        2. Lequesne's index

        3. Visual analogue scale by the patient

        4. Visual analogue scale by the doctor

        5. SF 36 and Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ)
