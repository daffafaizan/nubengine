      systemic blood circulation is limited, because of deficient transport of glucose across the
      blood-brain barrier by the transporter protein (GLUT1). Classically patients present with
      developmental problems, movement disorders and severe epilepsy. There is no curative
      treatment for GLUT1DS, and anti-epileptic drugs usually have little to no effect. The
      ketogenic diet, providing ketones as an alternative energy substrate for the brain is an
      effective treatment option for the epilepsy and movement disorders in many GLUT1DS patients.
      Unfortunately, not in all GLUT1DS patients the ketogenic diet has a positive effect and other
      treatment options for these patients are very limited.

      Traditionally, lactate is seen as a waste product of glycolysis during anaerobic conditions
      and a marker of ischemia. Interestingly, research has shown the beneficial side of lactate as
      an energy source for different organs. It seems that the brain can indeed use lactate as an
      alternative energy metabolite, besides glucose and ketones. The aim of this study is to
      investigate whether lactate can be an alternative energy metabolite in the GLUT1DS brain, and
      reduce epileptic discharges on EEG when intravenously administered in patients with GLUT1DS.
