      I. Determine the toxicity and the proportion of complete remissions associated with two
      different treatment schedules of vorinostat (SAHA) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects of SAHA in this study population. II. Examine for preliminary
      evidence of re-expression of silenced genes in leukemic blasts in response to SAHA.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status (relapsed vs untreated). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once a day on days 1-21. In both arms,
      treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral SAHA three times a day on days 1-14. In both arms, treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
