      malignant gastric conditions, is one of the most genetically variable pathogens. Variations
      in a few genes have been associated with risk of inflammation and carcinogenesis, but to date
      no systematic study has evaluated the entire bacterial genome. We propose a multicountry
      study to establish and analyze an informative international collection of H. pylori clinical
      isolates from residents of defined geographic areas. Molecular characterization will be
      conducted at the NCI/DCEG. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic variations in H.
      pylori strains among chronically infected individuals may affect risk of progression to
      gastric cancer. Findings from this study may help to characterize the differential virulence
      among H. pylori isolates and suggest predictive biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer. The
      bacterial isolates and databases from this study will also provide a foundation for further
      elucidation of H. pylori pathogenesis.
