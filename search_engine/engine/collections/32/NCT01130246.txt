    
      A double-blind randomized parallel group placebo controlled study in subjects presenting with
      an ACS. Up to 6500 subjects will be randomized to receive either A-002 500 mg once daily (QD)
      or placebo tablets in addition to atorvastatin QD and standard of care. Treatment will be 16
      weeks in duration. The dose of atorvastatin shall be adjusted after 8 weeks if subject's
      LDL-C is ≥100 mg/dL, but otherwise must remain stable throughout the16-week duration of
      study. The survival status for all enrolled subjects will be ascertained 6 months after they
      complete the study.

      Randomization must occur within ≤96 hours of hospitalization for the index ACS event, or if
      already hospitalized, within ≤96 hours of index event diagnosis. Follow-up visits will occur
      on Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. A 6 month follow-up visit will also occur.
