      intervention in a high risk population by providing ambulatory aids upon admission to the
      hospital to patients who previously used one at home after a standardized evaluation by a
      Registered Nurse. This will be a randomized controlled trial within three hospitals in a
      large academic medical center.

      Primary Objectives:

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness in preventing falls by providing an ambulatory aid
      to patients who use an ambulatory aid at home, and who are deemed fit to use the device in
      the hospital by their nurse.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the nurses' ability to assess the appropriateness of providing an
      ambulatory aid, such as a cane or walker, to a patient who uses an assistive device at home.
