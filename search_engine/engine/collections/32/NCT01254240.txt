      B narrow-band (UVB narrowband, 311nm) with or without Ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm), the
      subjective pruritus levels and clinical severity will be measured before, during and after
      completion of the 16-week therapy (40 patients per group). Patients will be recruited in the
      department of dermatology of the University Hospital ZÃ¼rich in the outpatient clinic.
      Following oral and written consent, pruritus levels will be measured by a visual analogue
      scale and a new, detailed pruritus score 2 before start of therapy, every 4 weeks after start
      as well as after completion of the phototherapy. Phototherapy is to be administered 3 times
      per week. The study includes 5 study visits and up to 43 treatment visits that include
      administration of phototherapy only.

      A physical examination including clinical scores (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI,
      Eczema Area and Severity Index EASI, Physician's static global assessment PSGA and
      Dermatology Dynamics Vector DDV) will be performed at every visit. During the first physical
      examination the Fitzpatrick-skin type of patient will be recorded, the demographics, the Body
      Mass Index (BMI), diagnosis, past medical history, co-morbidities, concomitant medication and
      the number of past UVA/B treatments.
