      individual profiles of weakness, spasticity, sensory and bimanual function vary widely.
      Improved prediction of recovery after stroke has broad implications for clinical decisions on
      the type, duration and goals of rehabilitation.

      100 consecutive patients with 1st ever stroke and upper limb hemi-paresis will be subject to
      imaging, at 4 weeks and 6 months, and behavioral assessments at 4 weeks, 3 months and 6
      months after stroke. The imaging protocol includes anatomical sequences for lesion mapping,
      diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI for structural and functional
      connectivity analyses, respectively. Clinical hand function measures will be combined with
      novel validated methods to quantify spasticity,grip force control, sensory and bimanual
      function.

      ProHand will provide insights into neural mechanisms related to recovery of hand function
      after stroke and enable enhanced prediction and development of targeted treatment trials.
