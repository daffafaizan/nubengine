      receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the
      recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where
      patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical
      activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the
      discretion of the investigator.
