      deaths in women across the globe. The majority of women, nearly 70%, will present with
      advanced stage disease that heralds a poor prognosis.

      Despite aggressive treatment that still favors initial debulking surgery followed by a
      platinum and taxane based chemotherapy regimen, most patients relapse after achieving a
      complete clinical response.

      Our group has shown that the ketorolac can inhibit gene activity which inhibits cell
      proliferation and migration.Ketorolac will be used in this study with the goal of producing
      specific inhibition of cell adhesion and migration in ovarian cancer cells retrieved within
      the peritoneal cavity after cytoreductive surgery.
