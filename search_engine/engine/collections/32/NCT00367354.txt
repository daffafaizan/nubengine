    
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used heavily in the research setting but its use
      is limited in clinical practice, the main reason being artifact (noise) from respiratory and
      cardiac motion. To counteract these sources of motion, many different applications have been
      applied. For cardiac motion, ECG (electrocardiogram) gating is widely used, while respiratory
      motion reduction uses methods of breath holding or respiratory gating techniques.

      Patients will be recruited based on whether they are a normal healthy volunteer or a patient
      already receiving a routine cardiac MRI.

      Normal Healthy Volunteers Patients will be recruited via a flyer posted in various locations
      at Emory University. The contents of this flyer will adhere strictly to Emory IRB
      Advertisement guidelines. Subjects will register by contacting Marijn Brunner, PhD, by email
      or telephone.

      Patients already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI The MRI technical specialist will review
      the laboratory schedule daily. Those who are already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI will
      be approached by a study staff member in the Children's MRI Department. The patient will be
      asked if he/she would wish to enroll in this study. The patient will be requested to sign a
      consent prior to any study procedures being performed.

      MRI image data will be collected by the prescribed protocol for respiratory monitoring. All
      MRI data will be acquired by standard FDA approved imaging methods. The image data will be
      transferred by network to the Pediatrics Imaging Research Laboratory where they will be
      stored on a password-protected computer and analyzed.
