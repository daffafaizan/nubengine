      group (coronally advanced flap and subepithelial connective tissue graft using microsurgical
      approach) Same procedure will be executed but with the addition of vitamin C injection.
      Intraepidermal injection (oral mesotherapy technique) of 1-1.5 ml (200-300 mg concentration)
      of L-ascorbic acid will be done. It will be locally introduced in relation to the keratinized
      gingival tissues with extension to the whole target region successively using special
      syringes (30 gauge). The needle will be introduced parallel to the gingival tissues with the
      bevel facing upwards. Vitamin C will then be delivered through the attached gingival tissues
      at the epithelium-connective tissue junction (equivalent to epidermal- dermal junction) till
      the tissues blanch. Vitamin C will be injected first time immediately postsurgical and then
      repeated once per week for 3 consecutive weeks for a total of 4 injections.
