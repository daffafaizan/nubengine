      study at the outpatient clinic. Patients will undergo a NSE at the sleep lab at night,
      followed by a DISE at the operating theatre the morning after. Both the NSE and DISE set-up
      will include gold-standard flow measurements, acoustic analysis and esophageal pressure
      measurements.
