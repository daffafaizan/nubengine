      is defined as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods.
      While paradoxically linked, numerous studies have shown a significant association between
      food insecurity and obesity. Moreover, recent narrative works have developed new, untested
      hypotheses linking food insecurity and obesity positing the causal role of psychological
      mechanisms. Given this, this mixed method pilot study will collect new psychological data in
      a sample of food secure and food insecure adults with and without obesity to examine the
      connections between food insecurity, body weight, and psychological constructs. The
      overarching objective of the study is to gather pilot data to identify potentially new
      intervention targets that will be used in future studies to more rigorously investigate the
      relationship between food insecurity and obesity.
