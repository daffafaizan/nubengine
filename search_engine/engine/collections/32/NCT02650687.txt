      School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. After informed consent, patients will complete cognitive
      and tests at least one but not more than 30 days prior to surgery. In the recovery room the
      Post Anesthesia Recovery Scale (PQRS), and CAM-ICU delirium screening will be administered.
      Immediate recovery will be recorded using the Postoperative Recovery Scale (PQRS) on
      postoperative day 1 and 3, and 1 week.

      Longterm functional recovery will be measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center
      (ADRC) Instrumental Activities for Daily Living (IADL-24). Postsurgical complications will be
      recorded including unplanned ICU admissions, postoperative myocardial infarction and stroke
      (risk less than 1 % in most cases), wound infection and reoperation. The full cognitive and
      functional battery will be repeated at 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
