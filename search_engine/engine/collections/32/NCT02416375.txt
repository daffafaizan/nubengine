      saturations, wellness and cough scores, spirometry measurements, physical activity,
      temperature, weight and sleep quantity and quality. The patients will also collect daily
      sputum samples.

      Data will be collected via Bluetooth-enabled devices and transmitted via a Smart-phone to a
      secure National Health Service approved web-based site to be analyzed.

      The information obtained will allow the investigators to develop a software program that will
      identify signals that can predict the onset of a chest infection before symptoms develop.

      The investigators will also measure specific substances in sputum to identify changes before,
      during and after chest infections. The investigators hope this additional information will
      enable them to more accurately predict the onset of chest infections in cystic fibrosis.

      The results of this study will determine if it is possible to develop a simple sputum test
      for patients to use at home in combination with other home-based assessments of well-being to
      provide an early warning system of a chest infection before patients feel unwell.
