      treatment of haemophilia A; however, as haemophilia A is a rare disease, the numbers of
      patients treated in studies so far are limited. For previously untreated patients (PUPs), who
      are typically young children, and for minimally treated patients (MTPs), who have been
      exposed to only minimal FVIII dosages, there is a general interest to increase the body of
      data on treatment effectiveness and safety, particularly related to inhibitor development.
      Also, specifically for PUPs, treatment algorithms are not standardized, e.g. with respect to
      utilisation, dosage, frequency or optimal start age of FVIII prophylaxis. Real world evidence
      derived from a non-interventional study (NIS) can describe product utilisation and
      demonstrate value over a product's life cycle and facilitate benefit-risk assessments. The
      purpose of this study is thus to evaluate product utilisation, effectiveness and safety,
      including inhibitor development information, in severe haemophilia A PUPs and MTPs, who have
      been prescribed Octapharma's FVIII concentrates.
