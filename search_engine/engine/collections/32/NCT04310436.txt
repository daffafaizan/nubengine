    
      Participants will be assessed for stammering severity either on line via video link or in the
      Institute of Technology Sligo Health Science & Exercise Physiology Lab (B2004) at three time
      points: before intervention, after a five-week trial period and three months post completion.
      Participants will complete two assessments at each time to cater for "off" days. Participants
      will be required to practice quick eye movements at the start of words / syllables where
      dysfluencies are predicted for 10 minutes twice a day for the treatment period. Training in
      eye movement (saccade) modification will occur following the initial assessment in IT Sligo,
      or video link.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment arms. An experimental arm, and a
      control (placebo) arm. All participants will be assessed regarding their premonitory
      awareness of anticipated dysfluencies both before training and at the three month Based on
      advice from Community Speech and language Manager (Ms Sinead Carthy), participants will
      voice/video message the principle investigator once per week for this five-week period to
      confirm compliance.
