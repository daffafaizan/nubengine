      (DLPFC) is used therapeutically in major depressive disorder resistant to standard
      treatments, and recently also shown to be effective in reducing suicidality with a bilateral
      approach. Recently, a new form of rTMS has been developed called theta burst stimulation
      (TBS) which requires a much shorter daily treatment duration and has been found to be
      non-inferior to standard rTMS. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled
      clinical trial of a daily, 20 session course of bilateral TBS versus sham stimulation in the
      treatment of suicidality in patients with OUD and MDD. The investigators will explore whether
      TBS can have other clinical effects on decreasing symptoms of MDD, craving for opioids, and
      rates of relapse to opioid use. The investigators will also examine whether rTMS can engage
      GABA mediated inhibition using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and
      electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) will be assessed before and after intervention. Clinical
      outcomes measured before, during, at end of treatment, and 4-weeks post treatment.
