      pandemic. People with HIV (PWH)/AIDS, or people with HIV who have not achieved viral
      suppression through antiretroviral treatment may have at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2
      infections and disease progression. At present there is no evidence to suggest that there is
      an increased risk of infection and increased severity of illness for PWH. We know that during
      the SARS and MERS outbreaks, there were only few case reports of mild disease among PWH.
      Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and
      other co-morbidities. However, some healthy people have also developed severe disease from
      the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      This is a multi-center prospective observational study. Our aim is to characterize the
      clinical presentation and clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with HIV.

      Patients with HIV and confirmed SARS-Cov-2 will be identified during routine clinical care in
      the inpatient or outpatient setting.

      Contributors will share de-identified demographic data, health history data, and clinical
      data pertaining the patient's presentation with COVID-19 and outcomes obtained during routine
      care for their patients, using the secure online data collection tool REDCap.
