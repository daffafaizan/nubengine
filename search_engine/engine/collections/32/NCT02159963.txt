      and safe in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Previous studies have
      tested exercise at moderate intensity. No studies have so far investigated whether
      high-intensity-training (HIIT) exercise can increase fitness, or the training will cause
      muscle damage. However, we know that patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy do
      not get increased muscle damage after a single exercise at high intensity.

      Investigators aim to investigate whether patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular disease
      may increase their fitness and improve their functioning in everyday life without muscle
      injury in a time-saving high intensity training.

      To investigate whether HIIT is safe and effective, three groups of participants are included.
      Two training groups, one group of patients and another with healthy matched subjects. The
      training is done on an ergometer-bike three times a week for 8 weeks. One weekly training
      will be supervised. The training consists of an interval training program (10-20-30). The
      third group is a none-training control group of patients. This group will undergo the same
      tests as the two training groups.

      To investigate wether participants would continue HIIT training after 8 weeks of supervised
      training, the two training groups, one group of patients and one group of healthy matched
      subjects, are tested after additional 8 weeks of home based optional training.

      To investigate wether patients with muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral will perform
      unsupervised HIIT training and whether it will be as effective as the supervised training,
      the control group of patients who did not train the first 8 weeks, is instructed to do home
      based HIIT for 8 weeks.
