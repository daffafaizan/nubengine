      reduced insulin sensitivity and insulin production leading to impaired glucose tolerance.
      Overweight and low physical activity are the main risk factors for the development of type 2
      diabetes. Increased physical activity has shown to improve insulin sensitivity, hence,
      exercise plays a significant role in the prevention and therapy of type 2 diabetes. This
      study aims at investigating the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity low-volume
      training, that consists of brief bursts of very vigorous exercise separated by recovery
      periods, on metabolic function in patients with type 2 diabetes, people at high risk for the
      disease and healthy, lean individuals. Study participants take part in 30 min training
      session three times a week for a period of 12 weeks. Participants are studied on four
      occasions, prior to the intervention, after an acute bout of exercise as well as after 6 and
      12 weeks of training in order to assess physical fitness, body composition, insulin
      sensitivity, energy metabolism in muscle, adipose tissue inflammation and neurological
      function. It is hypothesized that this type of exercise leads to significant improvements in
      insulin action and oxidative phosphorylation in muscle
