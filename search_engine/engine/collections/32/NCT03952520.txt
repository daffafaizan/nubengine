    
      This is a cluster randomized, controlled implementation trial to compare two implementation
      approaches (standard and tailored) for scaling-up the SNaP intervention in 42 HIV test sites
      in Vietnam. The SNaP intervention combines systems navigation and psychosocial counseling for
      people who inject drugs (PWID), and it is designed to facilitate PWID's engagement in HIV and
      substance use care.

      The two implementation approaches being compared are:

        -  Standard Approach (SA); vs.

        -  Tailored Approach (TA)

      SNaP is an evidence-based intervention (EBI) that combines systems navigation and
      psychosocial counseling to facilitate the engagement of HIV-infected people who inject drugs
      (PWID) into HIV and substance use care.

      The 42 HIV test sites will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the standard approach (SA)
      procedure or a tailored approach (TA).

      At the HIV test sites, the study will enroll:

        -  Approximately 6200 HIV-infected PWID who are newly diagnosed and not currently on
           antiretroviral therapy (ART), who consent for medical record assessments. Of those PWID
           enrolled, a subsample cohort of 1500 PWID will also be enrolled for detailed
           assessments, including viral load determination, at baseline, 12 and 24 months.

        -  HIV test site director boards and staff.

      Study activities will span across 5 years, with approximately 27 months at each site and
      recruitment of PWID participants over 21 months. For PWID not in the subsample cohort,
      participation is a one-time visit. For the subsample cohort PWID or PWID selected for
      qualitative interviews, maximum study participation time is 24-27 months. For HIV test site
      director boards and staff, maximum time in the study is 24-27 months.
