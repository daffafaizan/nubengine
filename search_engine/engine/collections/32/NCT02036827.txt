      However, 30-50% of patients suffer from shoulder tip pain, which might arise from diaphragm
      stretch due to pneumoperitoneum.

      In the previous pilot study, working intra-abdominal space was increased in the condition of
      deep neuromuscular blockade. And thus investigators hypothesized that the depth of
      neuromuscular blockade can affect insufflation pressure and intra-abdominal volume, which
      result in the severity of diaphragm stretch and postoperative shoulder pain. In addition, the
      depth of neuromuscular blockade can alter pulmonary compliance.
