      atraumatic extraction, test group patients received an immediate implant with provisional
      restoration, while patients in the control group received an implant after 6 weeks of
      healing. After 4 months (test group) and 6 months (control group) definitive restorations
      were delivered. All patients were followed for 1 year post restoration and pink esthetic
      score (PES), mid-buccal mucosal level (MBML), crestal bone changes (CBC) and peri-implant
      soft tissue parameters were recorded at several time points. In addition, patient chair time
      was recorded.
