    
      Study subjects will be new or existing patients of the clinical sites who are in need of
      dental restorations, meet all eligibility criteria, and provide informed consent/assent to
      participate. Subjects will be asked to provide two pre-treatment urine samples and three
      post-treatment samples. Urine collections occur next-day and 14 days after treatment, with
      one final urine collected approximately 6 months later (marking the end of the subject's
      active study participation). Data will be collected from the clinician's standard oral
      examination (including new and existing dental treatments), the data collector's measurements
      of height and weight and interviews administered to the parents/guardians to assess
      sociodemographic and other relevant factors (e.g., recent food/beverage consumption).
      Confidentiality will be maintained by assigning each subject a unique number and using only
      this number or aggregate data in all study reports. All study records will be securely
      maintained with access limited to essential study personnel only.
