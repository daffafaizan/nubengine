      nearly half of all heart failure cases. This study aims to collect data about systolic
      (contracting portion of a heart beat) and diastolic (relaxing portion of a heart beat)
      dysfunction at rest and during exercise. Participants with normal cardiac function will serve
      as a control group and compared to participants who are at risk of heart failure.
