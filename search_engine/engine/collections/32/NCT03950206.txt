    
      Patients with clinical and trans-vaginal / abdominal ultrasound diagnosis of deep
      endometriosis, undergoing surgery for the removal of endometriotic lesions are included in
      the study.

      Ureter perfusion will be intraoperatively assessed using indocyanine green angiography.

      After surgery, patients will be included in the post-operative follow-up, as usual in our
      clinical practice.
