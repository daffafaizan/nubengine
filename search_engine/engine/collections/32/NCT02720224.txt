      non-child bearing potential.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before
      dosing. The study will be executed in a single group, 6 subjects will be enrolled and dosed
      with a single oral dose of carbon 14 labelled estetrol. Subjects will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on the morning prior to study drug administration (Day -1). Dosing will take
      place on the morning of Day 1 after an overnight fast (approximately 10 h).

      Subjects will be resident in the clinic up to 240 h after dosing during which plasma, blood,
      urine and faeces samples will be collected. It is planned that subjects will be released as a
      group when all subjects have achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of >90% or if a mean
      of <1% of the dose administered has been collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate,
      consecutive 24 h periods. In this case, collection of all samples (blood, urine and faeces)
      will be stopped and the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If this criterion has
      not been met by all subjects on Day 11, home collections of urine and faeces may be requested
      at the discretion of the investigator for individual subjects.
