      study. Women treated with preoperative RT were assigned to the exposed group and women
      treated with surgery alone were assigned to the unexposed group.

      142 participants were enrolled at five outpatient rectal cancer centres in Sweden between
      2008 and 2013. Patient data, fasting venous blood samples and questionnaires regarding sexual
      function and well-being were collected at a baseline visit before start of oncologic
      treatment, 1 year after surgery and 2 years after surgery (only questionnaires). Women
      treated with preoperative RT for rectal cancer had an additional venous blood sample taken
      the day before surgery.

      Changes in serum levels of testosterone and sexual function during follow-up was assessed and
      compared between exposed and unexposed participants.
