      breast or thyroid cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis,
      preventing over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type
      of contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular
      structure and density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful
      prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.
