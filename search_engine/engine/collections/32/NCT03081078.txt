      connection with or without volunteer support in addition to treatment as usual (TAU;
      psychiatric and psychosocial treatments) is effective in reducing suicidal ideation,
      enhancing treatment compliance, reducing thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness
      and hopelessness among post-discharge self-harm young adults, and if personalized contact by
      volunteers has additional effects reducing suicidal ideation among post-discharge self-harm
      individuals.

      108 participants aged 18-45 with an index self-harm episode will be recruited from the
      Accident & Emergency Department (AED) of 4 local public hospitals, and randomized into the
      TAU, mobile app group with, and without volunteer support. Each participant will complete a
      questionnaire at the 4 measurement time points at baseline (T0), one-month (T1) and the end
      of the 2-month intervention period (T2), and post-intervention at the three-month point (T3)
      from the baseline. The primary outcomes include Suicidal ideation, hopelessness, thwarted
      belongingness & perceived burdensomeness, treatment (TAU) compliance, and suicidality.
