    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess accrual, retention, and participation rates for patients receiving sildenafil
      (sildenafil citrate) compared to placebo in patients undergoing robotic partial nephrectomy
      (RPN) for a suspected renal malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate individual alterations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 24 hours, 48
      hours and one month following RPN and compare these to the placebo group.

      II. To evaluate individual alterations in proteinuria at 24 hours, 48 hours, one month and
      three months following RPN and compare these to the placebo group.

      III. To measure between-group differences in estimated blood loss and hemoglobin
      concentration at 24 hours following RPN.

      IV. To describe individual changes in blood pressure measurements as noted in the
      preoperative holding area, throughout the procedure and in the post-anesthesia care unit.

      V. To describe between-group variations in vasopressor support or intravenous fluid
      requirements during the operative procedure.

      VI. To compare overall complication rates (within 90 days postoperatively) between groups.

      VII. To obtain a preliminary effect size of sildenafil on change in GFR at three months
      following RPN.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sildenafil citrate orally (PO) before the initiation of standard
      robotic partial nephrectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO before the initiation of standard robotic partial
      nephrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.
