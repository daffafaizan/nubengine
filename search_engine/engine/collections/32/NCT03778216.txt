      diagnosed with ARFID and their families will be recruited will be recruited through Stanford
      University, pediatricians, mental health experts, clinics treating EDs, and local parents'
      groups. Those eligible for the program will be invited to read and sign informed consent
      forms and complete the baseline assessment. They will then be randomized to the FBT-ARFID
      program either immediately after their screening or 3 months after assessment (i.e., to a
      usual care group). FBT-ARFID consists of 22 sessions over a 6-month period.

      There will be 3 major assessment time points for those in the FBT-ARFID Arm: Baseline, 3
      months into treatment, and EOT. There will be 4 major assessment time points for those in
      Usual Care: Baseline, transition to treatment (3 months after the usual care period is
      complete), 3 months into treatment, and EOT. Both the child and the parent will complete
      measures at these time points. In addition, patients and parents will participate in ongoing
      qualitative assessments before treatment (BL), throughout treatment (every other session),
      and at EOT.
