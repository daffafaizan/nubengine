      colorectal cancer screening program with the addition of yearly FIT testing at two critical
      points in the current recommended follow up: 1. In patients found to have adenomatous polyps
      for the first time after colonoscopy, the addition of FIT in yearly intervals following index
      colonoscopy and 2. For subjects with "clean" colonoscopies (no polyps found), the addition of
      FIT at yearly intervals starting in year 6 and continuing to year 10 or subsequent
      colonoscopy. Current screening guidelines do not recommend the combination of colonoscopy and
      FOBT.

      Two factors plague an effective colon cancer screening program: 1) a less than 100%
      sensitivity (95% ) for optical colonoscopy to detect colon cancer, and 2) Limitations of
      guaiac based stool testing: low sensitivity ( 5% in single use) for detection of colon cancer
      and the traditional gFOBT is cumbersome for patients to perform, impeding patient acceptance
      and adherence.

      FIT offers a FOBT with improved sensitivity (65% for invasive colon cancer) and improved
      specificity and better patient compliance. The addition of FIT after initial colonoscopy
      could be applied to a screening program and thereby salvage "missed" lesions by increased
      detection rates
