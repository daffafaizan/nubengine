      been shown to be effective in controlling hypertension. Although in the same drug class,
      preliminary data have shown that these medications may have different vascular effects. This
      study will assess which medication is better at improving artery health independent of their
      blood pressure lowering effects. Artery health will be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound.
      Certain markers of atherosclerosis found in the blood will also be measured.
