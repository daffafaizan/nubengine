      different sections affected by mandible position by using dynamic and static magnet resonance
      imaging technique. The study also discusses the formation mechanism of obstructive sleep
      apnea syndromes and function mechanism of the oral appliance, as well as the evaluation of
      the clinical results of the oral appliance on non-obese male patients with severe obstructive
      sleep apnea in Taiwan.

      10 non-obese (BMI<25) severe OSA (AHI>30) male patients between the age of 20 to 60 and 10
      gender, BMI and age matched control (AHI<5) were recruited for this study. Nine bite index
      were made for the different mandible positions of the subjects.

      Upper airway was imaged by using static and dynamic MRI of each subject wearing the bite
      index while lying on the MRI scanning table. This study also measures the circumference and
      takes the lateral cephalometric imaging of each subject. Oral appliances were made and fitted
      for the experimental group subjects, who wore them for three months, after which they
      transferred to the Sleep Center and underwent PSG examination to evaluate therapeutic effects
      of the appliances.
