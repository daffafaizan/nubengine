      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent painful condition that may cause disability among older
      adults (Cruz-Almeida et al., 2013). Psychological traits and emotional states of patients
      were found to be correlated with symptoms of OA and daily functioning of patients
      (Cruz-Almeida et al., 2013; Dezutter et al., 2015).

      The experience of pain is generated or modified by nociception, neuropathic symptoms,
      psychological and personality factors, genetic influences, past painful experiences, comorbid
      conditions, and expectations related to future pain. Previous studies have shown
      psychological well-being has been significantly associated with disability in patients with
      OA, and anxiety has been found to be associated with knee pain in women.

      Previous studies also found that there are large interindividual differences among persons
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) with respect to psychological function.

      Aim of project:

      This research is trying to find out what psychological strengths or factors could attenuate
      the chronic pain of knee OA patients. The purpose of the study is to find psychological
      evidences that may be used in the future to help chronic pain patients for improving their
      daily functioning and well-being.
