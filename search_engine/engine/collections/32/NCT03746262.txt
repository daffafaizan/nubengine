      DNA (ctDNA). It is hypothesized that ctDNA may identify patients who can be considered for
      additional therapy. 40 People with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer will be asked to
      take part in this study. Participants will have approximately 3 teaspoons of blood withdrawn
      from a vein at three different times. These times will be before primary treatment (either
      surgery or radiation therapy), 1 month after primary treatment, and 4 months after primary
      treatment. The total amount of blood withdrawn during the study will be approximately 9
      teaspoons. Participants will be followed every 3 months for 12 months to determine if a
      confirmed recurrence or progression has occurred. Participants will also be asked to complete
      questionnaires on their quality of life and their smoking behaviors. As part of this study, a
      blood sample will be obtained and DNA from participants blood sample will be purified. DNA,
      or deoxyribonucleic acid, stores and transmits inherited traits, such as eye color or blood
      type. As part of this research project, participant's DNA will be studied in an effort to
      find out if there are genes that contribute to medical conditions like their cancer that are
      part of the study. If participants have surgery to have tumor removed or if participants have
      a biopsy of their tumor, the study would like to take some of the leftover tissue to purify
      and study the DNA from the tissue sample.
