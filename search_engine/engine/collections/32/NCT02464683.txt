    
      We are going to include of 60 patients diagnosed with confirmed TBP with and without diabetes
      mellitus, by positive smear and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to
      first-line drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol), which will be grouped
      as follows: 1) patients who receive vitamin D (VD) (n = 30) and 2) patients who not receive
      vitamin D (NVD) (n = 30) in addition to drug treatment of tuberculosis drug frontline. Blood
      samples must be taken each month until the end of treatment.The VD group of participants will
      receive treatment with a daily dose of Vitamin D 200 International Units (IU) during the
      first two months of treatment. All Patients who participate must give their written consent.

      First, we are going to separate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ficoll reagent.
      Then, for the determination of intracellular cytokines in basal conditions and after the
      antigenic stimulation with M.tuberculosis, the flow cytometric technique is going to be used
      and the results will be analyzing in a flow cytometer. We are going to infected cells with M.
      tuberculosis strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10, in order to determinate
      phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of peripheral whole blood of patients, using Colony
      Forming Units (CFU) and staining. Extraction of RNA will be performed according to the kit
      supplier. The amplification reaction is going to perform with Applied Biosystems and Sybr
      Green Master Mix. We are going to use the unpaired Student t test, for the normal
      distribution parameters.
