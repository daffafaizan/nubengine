      & exclusion criteria) These patients should be offered for surgery to release the adhesions
      between fingers and MCP. When the consent form was accepted and the lab test was confirmed, a
      small skin biopsy was removed from retro auricle and fibroblast cells were separated and
      cultured. These cells were seeded on AM and the microbial test was done as evidence to prove
      the safety.

      Under general anesthesia, when the hands adhesion was removed, the autologous fibroblast
      cultured on AM was transplanted to the both hands (specially the area without skin coverage)
      and the hands were dressed afterward.

      The dressing was changed and the wound was checked regularly to detect any complications.
