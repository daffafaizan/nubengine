      strategy to maximize the benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for improved prognosis of patients
      with borderline resectable (BRPC) and locally advanced (LAPC) pancreatic cancer is a
      challenging and debatable issue. No studies have yet evaluated the efficacy of split-course
      SBRT as the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen. The investigators aimed to study whether
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus split-course SBRT results in better outcomes in BRPC and LAPC
      patients.
