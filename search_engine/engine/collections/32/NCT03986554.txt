      introduced into the pharynx to detect intrabolus pressure and contact of pharyngeal
      structures during swallowing. The presence of the catheter through the upper esophageal
      sphincter (UES) leads to a violation of its natural closed state. It is not clear how this
      intrusion influences the swallowing biomechanics . Hence, this project's goal is to identify
      how hyoid movement is altered during swallowing with the presence of a pHRM catheter in
      place.
