      and also proven as an effective risk-reducing method for ovarian cancer.

      The investigators have experienced denials among women who were seeking tubal ligation as a
      sterilization procedure during cesarean section after a comprehensive counseling for
      prophylactic salpingectomy. Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess the driving factors
      of decision making for prophylactic salpingectomy or tubal ligation. It is planned to
      preoperatively have a non-validated questionnaire for the women after a detailed briefing.
