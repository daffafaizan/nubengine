      evaluate the effects of two doses of amantadine or placebo in the management of
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and psychiatric status in patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are clinically stable on paliperidone ER or
      risperidone Consta. Placebo or amantadine 100 mg or 200 mg BID will be administered to
      participants for 4 consecutive weeks as an adjunctive therapy in 72 schizophrenia subjects
      treated with paliperidone or risperidone Consta to examine amantadine effects on fasting AM
      serum prolactin levels. Participants will be followed after suspension of amantadine or
      placebo for an additional 4 weeks for safety purposes. The goals of this study are to
      prospectively demonstrate that amantadine lowers prolactin levels, and evaluate the impact of
      amantadine on psychiatric symptoms, and on prolactin-related side effects in patients treated
      with paliperidone ER or risperidone Consta.
