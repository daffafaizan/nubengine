      difficult for couples. Azoospermia (both obstructive and non-obstructive) occurs in
      approximately 10-20% of all infertile males with non-obstructive azoospermia encompassing the
      majority of cases.

      In this study, quantitative MRI will be investigated by employing advanced functional metrics
      for addressing these challenges. Specifically, diffusion-weighted imaging will be assessed,
      multi-echo T2 mapping, arterial-spin labeling, and spectroscopy. No intravenous contrast will
      be administered for purposes of this study. It is hypothesized that these techniques will be
      sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of azoospermic cases and
      will improve upon current characterization of patients with this condition. Moreover, it is
      believed that these techniques will provide complementary information, such that they may be
      combined in a synergistic fashion for targeted extraction methodologies.

      The goal of this exploratory study is to investigate whether associations exist between
      quantitative MRI metrics and the previously noted features of testis architecture.
