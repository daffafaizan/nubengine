      forms for an ACB: repeated intermittent boluses through a Certa catheter (CC) versus repeated
      boluses through a standard catheter (through the needle) (SC) versus a single bolus (SB). Our
      dual hypothesis is that repeated boluses through a catheter (either Certa or standard
      catheter) reduces opioid consumption (primary outcome), as well as reduces pain scores,
      enhances ambulation and muscle strength compared with a single bolus, and that the Certa
      catheter is superior to a standard catheter.
