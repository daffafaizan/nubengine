      alternans. Human studies have shown that active ischemia can be associated with visible as
      well as microvolt-level T-wave alternans. While MTWA testing is traditionally used to
      evaluate arrhythmic risk, this known association with ischemia may allow MTWA testing to be
      used as a diagnostic tool to detect underlying CAD. The MTWA-CAD study will assess the
      feasibility of this concept by measuring MTWA during routine nuclear stress testing or stress
      echocardiography with treadmill exercise. This is a feasibility study designed to verify
      preliminary observations under controlled environments and to generate hypotheses, endpoints,
      and sample sizes for future investigations.
