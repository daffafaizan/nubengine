        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan administered in combination with a
           fixed dose of carmustine.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of topotecan and carmustine in patients with recurrent
           primary malignant glioma.

      OUTLINE: Topotecan is administered by an ambulatory infusion pump for 72 hours each week.
      Topotecan dose escalation is carried out in cohorts of three patients. Dose escalation is
      continued until toxic effects or disease progression is observed in these patients.
      Carmustine is administered over 1 hour every 6 weeks, on the same day as the first topotecan
      dose for that week.

      Three patients will be treated at an initial dose level of topotecan, and if one of these
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), an additional

      3 patients must be treated at this dose level without further DLT in order for dose
      escalation to proceed. The MTD is the highest dose at which DLT occurs in no more than 1 of 6
      patients.

      Patients are evaluated after every 6 week cycle.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 18-36 patients will be entered.
