      is not yet based on a high level of evidence, and studies on consolidation therapy for
      elderly patients who cannot transplant this disease are very limited. Based on the Korea
      National Cancer Incidence Database, about 100 to 150 cases of primary central nervous system
      lymphoma are diagnosed per year in Korea, and 15 to 30% of them are judged to experience
      recurrence.

      Rituximab and lenalidomide (RR) are drugs that are expected to play a role in patients with
      primary central nervous system lymphoma who have already refractory or relapsed as described
      above, but there is a big hurdle that the number of patients is limited. Since then, it has
      not been studied as consolidation therapy in elderly or non-transplantable patients.
      Therefore, the present investigators attempted to confirm the efficacy and safety of
      lenalidomide/rituximab maintenance therapy in patients with primary central nervous system
      lymphoma who received high-dose methotrexate-containing anticancer drug, but could not
      receive consolidation therapy with autograft.
