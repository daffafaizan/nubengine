      EASL and mRECIST criteria differ from each other in terms of the number of target lesions
      (all versus < = 2) and calculation method (bidimensional versus unidimensional). Therefore,
      the investigators aimed to retrospectively analyze and compare the clinical outcomes among
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were treated with different modalities of
      therapy according to the BCLC classification, and detect the possible predictors of
      post-treatment outcomes.

      Methods:

      This work was conducted at the departments of tropical medicine and gastroenterology,
      internal medicine, and general surgery. This study included patients that matched our
      eligibility criteria for a period of five years started from June 2015 to May 2020. The study
      purpose was to retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes among patients with HCC who were
      treated with different modalities of therapy according to the BCLC classification, and detect
      the possible predictors of post-treatment favorable outcomes. The data of the patients were
      extracted and retrospectively reviewed from the patients' records and the databases of both
      hospitals (SUH and SOI).

      During the period of recruitment, 407 patients diagnosed with HCC admitted to our departments
      and followed-up attending outpatient clinics, Sohag University Hospitals, over a 5 years
      period.
