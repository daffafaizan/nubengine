    
      REALITY is a open-label randomised trial of 1800 adults, adolescents and children aged 5
      years or more with low CD4 counts about to initiate ART.

      The trial will have a factorial design with 3 randomisations, each to address one of the
      potential approaches to reduce early mortality in adults and children initiating ART with low
      CD4, namely:

        1. Raltegravir for 12 weeks from ART initiation in addition to 3 standard ART (3-drug
           2-class) versus standard of care first-line 3-drug 2-class ART (choice according to
           national guidelines for ART initiation);

        2. Immediate enhanced opportunistic infections (OI) prophylaxis with isoniazid/pyridoxine
           and cotrimoxazole, plus 12 weeks fluconazole, 5 days azithromycin and a single dose of
           albendazole versus cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone for the first 12 weeks followed by
           isoniazid and any prophylaxis and/or treatment prescribed at screening

        3. supplementation with Ready to Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) for 12 weeks versus standard
           of care nutritional support to those with poor nutritional status according to local
           guidelines.

      All participants will receive cotrimoxazole throughout the trial.

      The primary objective of the trial is to identify effective, safe and acceptable
      interventions to reduce early mortality (all-cause) in HIV-infected adults, adolescents, and
      older children (5 years or more) initiating ART.
