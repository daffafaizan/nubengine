      Laboratories, Texas, USA) uses rotational oscillations at ultrasonic frequencies to emulsify
      cataractous lens material in a seamless cutting motion from a tip that oscillates laterally.
      The side-to-side movement of the phaco tip produces minimal repulsion of lens material from
      the phaco tip resulting in improved followability. Clinically this translates into more
      effective lens removal with torsional phaco in comparison to the conventional ultrasound
      mode.to test this in a clinical scenario we undertook this study.
