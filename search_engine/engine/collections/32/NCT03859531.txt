      Orkambi therapy to ascertain if the inflammatory changes in the intestine have improved. A
      marker of intestinal inflammation measured in the stool, Calprotectin, will be examined
      before and 6 months after Orkambi treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the result
      will be reduced on therapy.

      A marker of pancreatic exocrine function, pancreatic elastase, will be examined before and 6
      months after therapy to examine if the result has increased indicating improvement of
      exocrine pancreatic function

      for Orkambi therapy, i.e. above 12 years of age, in total 145 patients in Sweden of which 60
      are taken care of at Stockholm CF Center; the investigators aim to examine 20 patients.
