      3-week titration phase to a maximum dose of 108 mg per day, with a weekly follow-up during 3
      months. Socio-demographic and behavioral data will be collected through phone interviews
      every month. During medical visits, self-administered and clinical questionnaires will
      collect clinical and behavioral data. Urine drug toxicologies and blood sampling will be
      performed to gather biological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.

      This study should identify an effective response-dose of methylphenidate for people with a
      cocaine use disorder. The methylphenidate should be effective to reduce cocaine use in
      cocaine-dependent individuals with a good tolerability. The results of pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic analyses will give us the effective dose of methylphenidate and some
      information on toxicity to adapt the surveillance in a future clinical trial.
