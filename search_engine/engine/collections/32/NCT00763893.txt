      marfan syndrome receiving standard therapy

      Inclusion criteria :

      10 years or older Marfan syndrome according to international criteria Signed informed consent

      Non inclusion :

      Previous surgery of the ascending aorta, or surgery planned Non echogenicity
      Contre-indication lactose Pregnancy on going or planned within 3 years Breast feeding
      Participation in another clinical study Non member of the social security or CMU

      Number of subjects : the number of subjects (150 per group) is derived from the study from
      Shores et al (1994) demonstrating the benefit of beta-blockade in Marfan patient and uses a
      decrease by half of the aortic dilatation with losartan

      Follow-up is 3 years, after inclusion period of 2 years. A total of 5 years is expected

      Methods : randomised double blind vs placebo study. All French centres de competence for
      marfan syndrome and the centre de reference are participating in the study.

      End points : main endpoint is evolution of normalised aortic diameter. Secondary endpoints
      include clinical events (cardiac surgery or aortic dissection, hospitalisation in cardiology
      department, death), tolerance of the drug, and quality of life.
