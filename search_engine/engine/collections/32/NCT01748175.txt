      During the characterization subjects will undergo a baseline evaluation that will include
      will include answering questionnaires, lung function testing, and chest tomography.
      Subsequently, to determine steroid responsiveness, all subjects will receive one
      intramuscular dose of 40 mg in 1ml (1 mg/kg for children <18 years old, up to 40 mg maximum.
      Participants at the University of Pittsburgh will undergo a bronchoscopy to provide airway
      samples. The longitudinal phase will include a 36 month follow-up time with annual visits and
      phone calls every 6 months. During it, participants will answer questionnaires and provide
      sputum samples on two occasions, and will perform lung function testing.

      The SARP III longitudinal follow up study (all centers) will determine the long term
      stability and implications of clinical and molecular asthma phenotypes and identify potential
      systemic biomarkers for these phenotypes

      The University of Pittsburgh center will test the hypothesis that a) a mast cell signature is
      present and longitudinally maintained in severe asthma; and b) That the persistent signature
      determines short and long term outcomes through interactions with lung and inflammatory
      cells.
