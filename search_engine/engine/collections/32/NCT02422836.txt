      coordinator will review the subjects' medical history and obtain demographics. The Principal
      Investigator (PI) or designee (expert grader) will examine the subjects to determine their
      appropriateness for study inclusion.

      At the Screening visit (Visit 1, Day -10 to -7), the subjects will be assessed by the PI or
      designee to confirm inclusion into the study. Expert grading and Canfield VISIA CR
      photographic documentation (all flash modes including RBX) will be performed at baseline
      (Visit 2, Day 0), Week 4 (Visit 3, Day 28 ± 7 days), and Week 8 (Visit 4, Day 56 ± 7 days).

      Subjects who, in the PI's or designee's opinion, appear to be experiencing product related
      adverse reactions may be discontinued at any time during the study. The subjects' home care
      treatment products (the items included in the kit) will be performed at home, at the times
      and in the manner described in the instructions provided.
