      tool to train manual dexterity in patients with CP as comprehensive and holistic therapy.

      The NDT program for both groups will be routinely applied according to each child's
      individual needs and included tonus regulation, support of sensation, perception and motor
      development for gross motor function.

      The two different patient-centered rehabilitation programs will be conducted with an average
      of one hour sessions three times a week for 8 weeks in both groups. The two different
      patient-centered programs will be as VGBT with Nintendo® Wii and LMC games (Group I) and
      NDT-based upper limb rehabilitation (Group II).
