      are fragile due to age and severe comorbidity. Infections are frequent during the course of
      initial myeloma treatment and contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in elderly
      patients. Furthermore infections often lead to delay in myeloma treatment and to dose
      reduction. The use of primary antibiotic prophylaxis might influence the frequency of these
      complications. In the study myeloma patients who are ineligible for high-dose melphalan with
      stem cell support are randomised to either p.o. clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 180
      days, p.o. sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 400/80 mg twice daily for 180 days or observation
      without prophylactic antibiotics. All patients receive concurrent myeloma treatment at the
      discretion of the treating physician. The choice of anti-myeloma treatment has to be settled
      before randomization. The study evaluates the frequency of infections in patients treated
      with clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or observation
