    
      The purpose of this study is to (i) evaluate the acute effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4
      (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin (100mg once daily for two days), on gastric emptying,
      postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon and 'incretin' hormones (ie. glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)), blood pressure and
      heart rate after a high carbohydrate meal, and (ii) to determine whether the magnitude of the
      effects of sitagliptin on postprandial glycaemia and blood pressure is related to the rate of
      gastric emptying, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The rate of entry of carbohydrate into the small intestine is especially important in
      patients with diabetes mellitus. Sitagliptin is an orally administered inhibitor of
      dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GLP-1. It is
      hypothesized that sitagliptin will increase the GLP-1 response to, and thereby slow gastric
      emptying and diminish the glycaemic and blood pressure response to, a carbohydrate-containing
      meal.

      Twenty healthy subjects (male and female) will be studied. Each subject will be studied on
      two occasions following treatment for 2 days with sitagliptin (100mg once daily) or matching
      placebo in a randomized, double blind, crossover design. Measurements of gastric emptying,
      intragastric meal distribution, blood glucose concentrations, gut hormones, blood pressure,
      splanchnic flow and appetite will be measured for 4 hours following ingestion of a mashed
      potato meal.
