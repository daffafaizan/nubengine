      children undergoing repeated drug exposure.

      We will evaluate the development of tolerance in two ways:

      Clinical: as the time needed to perform the inhalation induction, with a standardized
      protocol.

      Electroencephalographic: we will record every 3 sessions the electroencephalographic activity
      of the patients. We will perform classical spectral analysis, and coherence analysis as well.

      This observational study will be mainly exploratory since there are no other previous report
      in this topic
