      during first trimester surgical abortion under local anesthesia. Semi-structured interviews
      will be conducted to understand the patient's experience of using VR. Surveys evaluating
      anxiety will be administered to women before and after surgical abortion. Investigators plan
      to enroll 30 patients in order to obtain an effect size for future studies. A group of
      control patients will be enrolled; these patients will receive standard care and will be
      compared to the anxiety scores of the group receiving VR. The mean and standard deviation of
      anxiety scores for each group will be used to calculate power for future studies.
