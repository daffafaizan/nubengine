      allograft vasculopathy contributing to morbidity and mortality. Belatacept is Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved for use in kidney transplant recipients on the basis of two
      randomized controlled trials, which demonstrated important renal sparing benefits, a
      reduction in de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and improved long-term outcomes. In
      this study, ten (10) primary heart transplant recipients will receive belatacept in addition
      to mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and a tacrolimus tapering regimen.
