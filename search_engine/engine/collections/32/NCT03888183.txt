    
      This trial is a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to
      compare intervention treatment (Per-Young Eye Drops: preservative-free 0.15% HA) against
      control treatment (AIM Artificial Tears: salt solution without 0.15% HA). All participants
      will be received Per-Young Eye Drops (4 to 8 times per day) or AIM Artificial Tears (4 to 8
      times per day) with 12 weeks. Two drugs are identical in appearance and order of
      administration will be double-blind randomized.

      Primary endpoint:

      To compare the central tear meniscus height (TMHc) of treatment with preservative-free 0.15%
      HA to the treatment with salt solution without 0.15% HA at 4 weeks.
