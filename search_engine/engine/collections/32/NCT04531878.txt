      gene expression and metabolism. They are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, secreted
      into bile and re -turned from chyme to liver in portal- vein blood 6-10 times per day
      (enterohepatic circulation. Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids involves more than 20
      transporters among which bile salt export pump (BSEP), encoded by ABCB11 plays a key role.
      BSEP medi-ates the secretion of bile acids across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes
      into bile to provide the osmotic pressure for bile flow. Mutations in ABCB11 can cause
      absence or dysfunction of BSEP leading to cholestasis. Bile acid accumulation in hepatocytes
      caused by BSEP dysfunction is associated with a range of liver dis-eases, ranging from
      transient neonatal cholestasis to fatal progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC),
      with jaundice, growth retardation, cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Our current indicates
      that more than 70% patents with ABCB11 mutations need liver-transplantation or dead during
      follow-up. In recent years, some targeted drugs including 4-phenylbutyrate(for patients with
      BSEP trafficking abnormal), ivacaftor(for patients with abnormal BSEP transport function),
      and gentamicin (for patients with none sense mutations) have emerged make it possible for
      individual targeted therapy possible.
