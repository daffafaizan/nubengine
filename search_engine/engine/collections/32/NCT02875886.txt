      in CKD is linked to hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes. Dietary salt restriction is an
      accepted intervention for salt-sensitivity in CKD. Another strategy, however, could be to
      block sodium uptake by the kidney pharmacologically by diuretics. Especially diuretics acting
      on the distal tubule may be effective, because this appears to be the site of increased
      sodium reabsorption in CKD. It is currently unknown how these two strategies, diet or
      diuretics, relate. The investigators hypothesize that diuretics are non-inferior to diet.
