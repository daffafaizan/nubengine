      For this study, patients with diagnosis of IBS performed by Rome IV criteria and followed as
      outpatients at the Clinical Nutrition Clinic of "Petrucciani" Nursing Home of Lecce (LE),
      Italy, will be enrolled.

      At baseline, the enrolled subjects will follow a balanced normal-caloric low-FODMAP and
      gluten-free diet for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks patients who did not
      experience an improvement in symptoms will be considered "non-responders" and discontinue the
      clinical trial. Only those subjects who had showed a significant improvement in symptoms,
      will be enrolled for the phase 2 of the study that includes a challenge with gluten or with
      placebo, as described by the Salerno criteria.
