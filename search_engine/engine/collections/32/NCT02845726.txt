      ureteral stents on the entire spectrum of stent-associated morbidity.

      Moreover, it could provide more detailed knowledge about the correlation of the occurrence of
      biofilms on ureteral stents and findings in urinary analysis, which could serve as a decision
      support whether patients with ureteral stents undergoing further interventions (for example
      ESWL or simple secondary URS) should receive antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Correlation of results of urinary bacteriologies (assessed pre- and intraoperatively) and
      biofilm analysis on stents could provide information if "targeted antibiotic treatment" based
      on urinary bacteriology only is possible at all.

      Correlation of urinary analysis and conventional urinary bacteriology could provide a
      valuable contribution regarding the prediction of bacteriuria and the necessity of postponing
      operations.

      Additionally, the study is intended to provide an overview over the recent bacterial species
      that are involved into biofilms on ureteral stents and their resistance to antibiotics. This
      could provide valuable information about the choice of antibiotics in cases were treatment
      has to be performed empirically.
