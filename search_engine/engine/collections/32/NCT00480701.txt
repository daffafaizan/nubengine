    
      Approximately 25 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 25 patients
      Parkinson's disease and 20 healthy controls will be recruited to participate in this study.

      AD patients will be eligible to participate if they have a diagnosis of AD based on
      NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.

      PD patients will be eligible to participate if they have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's
      disease.

      Healthy controls will be evaluated to ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative
      changes including cognitive decline.

      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, a physical and neurological evaluation and cognitive
      assessment.

      Subjects will be asked to undergo an injection of 123-I IBVM followed by up to three
      approximately thirty minute SPECT scans during the next 24 hours.

      Subjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit two-weeks to six months following the
      initial imaging visit to assess the reproducibility of the imaging outcome and/or the
      progressive change from baseline in 123-I IBVM binding.

      The imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain
      masked to clinical diagnosis. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional
      distribution volumes expressed as a target region to cerebellar ratio.
