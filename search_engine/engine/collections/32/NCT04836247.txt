      participants will be recruited from the waiting room at a local treatment center. The
      research assistant will screen interested individuals for eligibility in person and schedule
      study appointments, which may be coordinated with treatment appointments. All study screening
      and appointments will be conducted in private spaces at the treatment center. At the first
      study appointment, the research assistant will introduce the study, check for questions, and
      obtain consent for the study procedures, medical record review, and follow up procedures.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the disclosure intervention or a
      control intervention (i.e., an evidence-based mindfulness intervention). Following the
      intervention, participants will complete measures of acceptability, feasibility, and decision
      quality. At the second study appointment, participants will again be asked to respond to
      survey and interview questions designed to further evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the
      intervention. In particular, we will investigate whether participants who completed our
      disclosure intervention report better relationship outcomes than participants who completed
      the control condition.
