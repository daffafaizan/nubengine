      Birth recommended that information on the chance of survival and risk of disability should be
      provided separately. The order in which information is presented can affect memory,
      persuasiveness, and treatment choice, but the effect of order of information presentation in
      the context of neonatal resuscitation has received little attention. Additionally, the effect
      of including a description of the long and intense time in the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) on parental treatment decision making is also unexplored. Current evidence suggests
      that pictographs best convey numerical information to parents.

      Three pictographs were developed based on NICHD data for 22 weeks gestational age (GA) babies
      who received intensive care. One pictograph displayed information on the rates of disability
      in the babies who survive. Two pictographs displayed information about how many babies born
      at 22 weeks survive, with one of these pictographs including a description of the average
      course of NICU stay.

      An internet survey was sent to a U.S. representative sample of women of child-bearing age. A
      vignette including background on prematurity and the treatment options of intensive care or
      comfort care for a baby born at 22 weeks GA was presented. Participants viewed the
      pictographs, evenly randomized to one of four experimental conditions (order of information
      presentation x level of description of NICU course). Participants were then asked to choose
      intensive care or comfort care. Participant religiosity, values (quality vs. sanctity of
      life), autonomy preferences in medical decision making, previous NICU exposure, numeracy, and
      health literacy were also assessed.
