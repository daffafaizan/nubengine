      Acupuncture. The medical practice of acupuncture has existed for thousands of years and
      purportedly has been successful at managing a wide array of health conditions. Producing
      objective/quantitative data that rule out any possibility of placebo effect has proved
      burdensome.

      Objectives: This exploratory study seeks to determine if physiological measurements of fine
      motor control can be changed after receiving an acupuncture treatment. Can this change
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment? Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions:
      This study looked at acupuncture patients undergoing treatments for pain relief, and general
      minor injury to determine whether or not observable changes could be detected in the fine
      motor control of the hands after acupuncture treatments.

      Two groups of 50 subjects were used in the study. The test group was given a fine motor
      control test prior to and after their acupuncture therapy to determine if any changes could
      be measured.

      The control group was given two fine motor control tests without acupuncture treatment with a
      40 minute delay between the tests to replicate the test group timing. This study was
      conducted at a non-profit community clinic between the dates of 9/28/16 & 2/19/17.
