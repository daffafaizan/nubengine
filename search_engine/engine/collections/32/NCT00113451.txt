      based on the first 119 patients operated with this graft at our institution, aiming to answer
      the following questions:

        1. What is the short-term patency (2-3 years) of radial artery bypass grafts in CABG
           (comparisons are made with saphenous veins and internal thoracic artery grafts)?

        2. What complications occur and what in what frequency?

        3. What are the clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction after using radial arteries in
           CABG? (n=119 pt.)

        4. Can multidetector CT be used to reliably evaluate coronary artery bypass graft patency?
           (n=45 pt.)

      Methods: Questionnaires, record review, coronary angiography.
