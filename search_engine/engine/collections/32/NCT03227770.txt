      medical centers in Shanghai Metropolitan area have explicitly expressed interest to
      participate. Participants will be randomized to receive hemodialysis plus hemoperfusion or
      hemodialysis alone at a 1:1 ratio after 1-month run-in period. In both arms, patients will
      receive low-flux hemodialysis at a frequency of 2 times a week and hemodiafiltration at a
      frequency of once a week. In the experiment group, in addition to the treatments in the
      control arm, hemoperfusion will be conducted once every two weeks using a HA130 resin
      hemoperfusion apparatus containing 130ml resin. Follow-up is scheduled at 3, 6, 12, 18, and
      24 months after randomization, and will consist the following: routine physical examinations,
      standard lab panels (blood routine, liver/kidney functions, tests of the coagulation system,
      etc.), chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, heart function rating (based on New
      York Heart Association grading). Dialysis adequacy defined by standard Kt/V will be
      calculated. Adverse events will be assessed according to the international conference on
      harmonization guidelines. The primary outcomes will include 24-month all-cause mortality.
      Secondary outcomes will include cardiovascular-related mortality, the occurrence of major
      cardiovascular events and the quality of life (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form).
