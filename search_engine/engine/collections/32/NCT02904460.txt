      light and cooperative sedation as soon as possible in order to decrease the period of
      mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is a central alpha-2 agonist, is the
      referential hypnotic in this case with a reduction of the morphine-type use.

      DEX was mainly studied in the bandage procedures for the burned adult. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the reducing effect of DEX on the morphine use in case of severe burnings for
      adults, to describe the receivers of DEX and to report the procedure of this new molecule.

      This study would manage to develop a protocol using dexmedetomidine to reduce the use of
      morphine for the sedation-analgesia. It expects a sensitization of physicians about the need
      to form the nurse crew for the autonomous use of a protocol before performing a new
      evaluation of sedation-analgesia.
