      drainage in the setting of extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary to inoperable pelvic and
      abdominal malignancies or secondary to changes caused by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation
      for pelvic and/or abdominal malignancies. The management of malignant extrinsic ureteral
      obstruction secondary to inoperable neoplastic disease of the abdomen or pelvis is a common
      urologic problem, and has important implications for a patient's quality as well as quantity
      of life, which has been estimated to generally range between 6.5 to 23 months in this
      population. Currently, extrinsic ureteral obstructions are usually managed with double-J
      ureteral stents, placed either cystoscopically, or antegrade via a percutaneous nephrostomy
      tube. Double-J stents are prone to encrustation and obstruction over time, necessitating
      stent exchange under general anesthesia every 3 to 4 months. These repeat surgical procedures
      under general anesthesia carry subsequent risks of infection, drug reactions, and iatrogenic
      injury, leading to degradation in the quality of life of these patients who often have a year
      or less to live. To circumvent these disadvantages, the nickel-titanium Memokath 051 ureteral
      stent was developed to provide a means of minimally invasive long-term temporary ureteral
      drainage.

      This is a prospective non-randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of the Memokath
      051 ureteral stent in managing extrinsic malignant ureteral obstruction secondary to an
      inoperable abdominal or pelvic malignancy or secondary to changes caused by surgery,
      chemotherapy, or radiation for pelvic and/or abdominal malignancies. Enrollment of study
      subjects will take place over a period of two to three years for to a total of 15 patients.

      A control group 10 patients with extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary to an inoperable
      pelvic or abdominal malignancy or secondary to changes caused by surgery, chemotherapy, or
      radiation for pelvic and/or abdominal malignancies and treated by other urologic staff
      surgeons in a standard fashion with retrogradely placed double-J stents will also be followed
      every 3 to 4 months.
