      universitaires Saint-Luc between July 1993 and June 2012, were collected retrospectively
      using electronic data files. Results were analysed according to ABO matching and portal vein
      complications. Uni- and multi-variate analysis was used to study the impact of
      immunosuppression, gender match and maternal donation on acute rejection rate.
