      reference center will be included in this prospective descriptive study.Once hysterectomy is
      completed, a 10 % solution of sodium fluorescein at a 0,25 ml dose will be injected before
      performing diagnostic cystoscopy. Time from injection to fluorescent visualization will be
      recorded as well as coloration density. Adverse events are collected in the operating room,
      in the recovery room, before patient's discharge and through a home survey.
