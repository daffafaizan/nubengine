        -  Determine the tolerability of gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

        -  Determine whether the addition of weekly PEG-interferon alfa-2a to ongoing gefitinib
           improves response rate in these patients .

        -  Determine whether PEG-interferon alfa-2a exacerbates rash in patients who have been
           treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, pilot, dose de-escalation study of PEG-interferon alfa-2a
      followed by an open-label, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral gefitinib alone once daily for 4 weeks. Beginning in week
           5, patients also receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously once weekly. Treatment
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive de-escalating doses of PEG-interferon alfa-2a until a tolerable
      dose is determined.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a at the tolerable dose
           determined in phase I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.
