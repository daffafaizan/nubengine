      I. To help develop and/or optimize new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy
      applications and analysis software in order to provide the best MR services for the
      investigator's patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo an additional investigational MRI or MRSI sequence along with the standard
      MRI or MRSI. Healthy volunteers undergo an investigational MRI or MRSI sequence. Healthy
      volunteers may also undergo an additional standard sequence if there is one that can be
      compared to the investigational sequence. All MRI or MRSI procedures, including the standard
      MRI or MRSI, are no longer than 60 minutes.
