    
      One hundred consenting patients meeting all inclusion criteria will undergo an exercise
      stress test, 2D and M-Mode echocardiograms and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure holter
      monitoring prior to being randomised to receive either renal denervation (RDN) with a
      Symplicity renal denervation catheter plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. Coronary
      angiography with/without coronary revascularisation will be performed as per the treating
      cardiologist's clinical judgement and a RevealÂ® holter will be implanted in all patients at
      the end of the procedure.

      Time zero will be defined as starting at three months after the procedure. Follow up visits
      will be scheduled to scan the holter for the primary end point, i.e. high atrial rates
      (AF-surrogate defined as: "episodes of atrial rate >190 beats per minute for more than 6
      minutes") or new-onset AF. Patients will be followed six monthly for three years.
