      weekly for 2 consecutive weeks (induction) and then every other week (maintenance) with oral
      probenecid and IV hydration. Group B receives no treatment until the time of retinitis
      progression (deferred treatment), at which time they receive the same regimen as Group A,
      provided retinitis progression is not immediately sight-threatening.
