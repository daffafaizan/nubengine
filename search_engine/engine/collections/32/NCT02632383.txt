    
      Young people with diabetes type 1, their parents and health care providers have participated
      in developing the mHealth app "Young with Diabetes".

      The aim of the app is to support young people to self-manage their diabetes type 1.

      A test group of 70 young people with diabetes type 1 test the app for 12 months as a
      supplement to standard care and the control group receives standard care only.

      At baseline and after 2, 7 and 12 months HbA1c, problem areas in diabetes, perceived
      competences in diabetes and health care climate are measured.
