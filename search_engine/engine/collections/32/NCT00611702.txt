      affected long-term transplant survival. Rejection is caused by both immunological and
      non-immunological factors from both the donor and the recipient. Although the exact cause of
      chronic rejection is not known, it is associated with the presence of C4d, a degradation
      product of the antibody response cascade, and the presence of circulating donor-specific
      antibodies (DSAs). The purpose of this study is to determine the role of cell- and
      antibody-mediated responses in chronic rejection of transplants, to determine the gene
      expression profile associated with the development of chronic rejection, and to determine
      whether variants of specific genes cause susceptibility to rejection.

      This is an observational study of people who will be receiving kidney transplants and
      participants will be followed for 2 years. Study visits for kidney transplant recipients will
      occur at study entry and at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after transplant. At these visits,
      adverse event assessment, rejection assessment, medication history questionnaire, and blood
      collection will occur. At some visits, a physical exam and a kidney biopsy will occur. Blood
      will also be collected from living kidney donors at the time of donation if both donor and
      recipient agree to be in the study. This study will be take place at 4 clinical sites: Mount
      Sinai School of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Westmead Hospital, and
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General
      Hospital will also participate in the study as central laboratories.
