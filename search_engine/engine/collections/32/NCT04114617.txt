      Aim 1: To determine the relationship between bolus flow and healthy swallowing physiology.
      The investigators will collect concurrent videofluoroscopic and physiological measures of
      swallowing (tongue pressure, electromyography [sEMG]) in healthy adults using barium stimuli
      across the continuum of liquid consistency (thin, slightly thick, mildly thick, moderately
      thick and extremely thick liquids, as defined by the International Dysphagia Diet
      Standardisation Initiative, www.iddsi.org). Significance: This will show the impact of
      consistency on bolus flow through the oropharynx, controlling for the forces used to initiate
      flow and propel the bolus.

      Aim 2: To compare healthy swallowing physiology for barium versus non-barium stimuli. The
      investigators will collect physiological measures of swallowing using barium and non-barium
      stimuli matched for consistency. Significance: This will determine how swallowing behaviors
      (tongue pressures, sEMG) differ between barium and non-barium stimuli with matched
      consistency, enabling us to develop models of flow accounting for these differences.

      Aim 3: To compare healthy swallowing physiology across different commercial barium products.
      Significance: This will determine whether differences in barium concentration or brand
      influence swallowing behaviors, enabling us to make recommendations regarding ideal contrast
      agents for use in radiographic swallowing assessment.

      Aim 4: To explore swallowing behaviors across solid foods of different consistencies (minced
      and moist, soft & bite-sized, regular) in comparison to liquids. Significance: This will
      provide preliminary data regarding swallowing physiology across these consistencies.
