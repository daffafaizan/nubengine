      Parkinsons disease with camptocormia after receiving 8-weekly sessions of the osteopathic
      manual treatments for truncal flexion dystonia as measured by the distance of the external
      acoustic meatus from a plumb-line to lateral malleolus, spinal X ray, and heart rate
      variability.
