      chronic condition characterized by permanent and irreversible dilatation of the bronchial
      airways and impairment of mucociliary transport mechanism due to repeated infection and
      inflammation leading to colonization of organism and pooling of the mucus in the bronchial
      tree.

      The prevalence of bronchiectasis is age-related and occurs in every age group and in the
      pre-antibiotic era . it most often began in childhood. Recent evidence shows that
      bronchiectasis disproportionately affects women and older individuals and will be
      contributing to increase in healthcare burden.[3] International data show an increase in the
      prevalence of bronchiectasis over recent years.
