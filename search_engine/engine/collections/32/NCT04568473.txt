      effectiveness between bio-smart Shield with bioactive S-PRG filler and Fluoride varnish
      containing Xylitol-coated Calcium and Phosphate (CXP™) Compared to Sodium Fluoride Varnish in
      management of hypersensitivity in adult patients after 1, 4 and 8 weeks.

      P (Population): Patient with Teeth Hypersensitivity.

      Intervention-1: Bio-smart Light Cured Protective Shield with bioactive S-PRG (Surface
      Pre-Reacted Glass ionomer) filler technology (PRG Barrier Coat) by (By SHOFU Inc., Japan).

      Intervention-2: 5% Sodium Fluoride with Xylitol-coated Calcium and Phosphate (CXP™) Varnish
      (Embrace™ Varnish) by (Pulpdent Corporation)
