    
      Study I is a long-term, prospective, single-blind study comparing biofeedback for fecal
      incontinence to a standard therapy (Kegel exercises) that is associated with a similar
      expectation of improvement (i.e., comparable placebo effect). Prior to randomization,
      patients will receive medical therapy (antidiarrheal medications as appropriate) and
      education for 4 weeks, and only patients who remain incontinent will be randomized. Anal
      canal squeeze pressures and rectal sensory thresholds will be tested before and after
      treatment. Patients will keep a diary throughout baseline and treatment, and they will be
      re-assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Treatment will consist of 6 clinic visits at 2-week
      intervals. The primary outcome is the patient's response to the question, "Have you had
      satisfactory relief of fecal incontinence (yes/no)?" This question is asked at 3 months
      following the end of treatment and at each follow-up visit. The investigators will develop a
      detailed treatment manual for fecal incontinence which would permit other investigators to
      replicate our study.
