      drug therapy based on a patient's genetic make-up. Hypertension (HTN) is the most common
      chronic disease for which drugs are prescribed, and the most prevalent risk factor for heart
      attack, stroke, renal failure and heart failure. Responses to antihypertensive drug therapy
      exhibit considerable interpatient variability, contributing to poor rates of HTN control
      (currently about 40-50% in the US), and frequent nonadherence and dropout from therapy. We
      propose to identify genetic predictors of the antihypertensive and adverse metabolic
      responses to two preferred and pharmacodynamically contrasting drugs, a beta-blocker
      (metoprolol) and a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a sequential monotherapy design in
      400 hypertensive individuals. Data collected will include home and clinic blood pressure,
      blood samples for testing for adverse metabolic effects and other biomarkers, RNA, and DNA
      and urine sample. We will conduct genome-wide association single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) genotyping and data from the study will be used for replication of findings from the
      previous PEAR trial, along with new discoveries. The primary aims are to define the genetic
      determinants of the antihypertensive response and adverse metabolic responses (e.g. changes
      in glucose, triglycerides and uric acid). The proposed research is significant because
      genetically-targeted antihypertensive therapy could lead to dramatically higher response
      rates and fewer adverse effects than the usual trial-and-error approach. This would likely
      lead to higher rates of HTN control, less need for polypharmacy, reduced health care costs,
      and improved outcomes.
