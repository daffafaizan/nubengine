      rate, the percentage of the elderly population ( above 80 years old) is expected to double in
      Taiwan by the year 2044, according to data from the National Development Council.
      Consequently with the increase in the proportion of senior citizens, there will be an surge
      number of patient suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, most
      importantly acute ischemic stroke. In recent years, mechanical thrombectomy has become the
      gold standard in the treatment for acute stroke patients, however, many studies have excluded
      the patients above the age of 80 years old as the benefits of the procedure have been very
      controversial and there is no clear evidence proving favorable a outcome. There are a few
      studies which state that though elderly patients had higher risk of complications when
      receiving mechanical thrombectomy as compared to younger patients, the prognosis was still
      superior to those didn't receive any intervention. Previous studies put more emphasis on the
      overall prognosis, morbidity and mortality rate, they didn't focused on the cause of
      mortality.

      The study focuses on analyzing of the cause of mortality and whether there is a significant
      difference between 30-day-mortality group versus non-30-day-mortality group.
