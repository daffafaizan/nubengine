      receive behavioral economic stewardship interventions will have decreased antibiotic
      prescribing rates for non-antibiotic appropriate ARIs, compared to contemporaneous antibiotic
      prescribing rates for non-antibiotic appropriate ARIs among control practices. This
      hypothesis will be evaluated in a linear mixed effects model will be used to estimate and
      test the group effect using group and time as fixed effects and practice site and provider as
      random effects. The interaction between time and group will be included to estimate and test
      the different group effect over time.

      Design: The investigators will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of acute care
      ambulatory visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers in a predominantly
      non-academic public hospital system. Clustering (by site) helps prevent treatment
      contamination between individual clinicians within the same site. The stepped wedge design
      will allow studying the effects of a complex intervention rolled out through a system over
      time, as often happens in the real-world, where State and Federal public health as well as
      site-based organization quality improvement interventions may be occurring at different
      times.

      Treatment Assignment Procedures: For the 12-month intervention period, in a stepped-wedge
      fashion, sites will be exposed to a site-adapted multifaceted stewardship intervention
      consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) core elements for outpatient
      antimicrobial stewardship: commitment, action, monitoring, reporting and education, and also
      included a behavioral component that used individualized audit and feedback, peer comparison,
      and public commitment, in addition to standard patient and clinician education on antibiotic
      prescribing for antibiotic nonresponsive ARIs.
