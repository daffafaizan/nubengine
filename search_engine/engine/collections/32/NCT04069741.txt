      patients with de Quervain's tendinopathy. In the first part of this study, a Decision Aid
      (DA) has been developed to help participants make choices about their treatment.

      Decision aids are designed to provide patients with balanced, complete, and understandable
      information about their options for management of their condition, as well as risks and
      benefits, in order to help them determine their preferences according to their values.
      Research has shown that patients felt more knowledgeable and better informed with a more
      active role in decision making after using DAs.

      Additionally, research has shown that depression affects pain and disability experienced by
      patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis. In the second part of our study, the investigators
      want to see whether a web based skills intervention (Toolkit) is more effective than usual
      medical care in improving pain and disability in patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis
      and symptoms of depression.

      The Toolkit is delivered online and can be accessed at home. Similar skills interventions in
      patients with musculoskeletal injury have been shown to improve pain and function.
