      nivolumab in subjects who did not have disease progression to initial therapy with the
      combination of FOLFOX and Nivolumab. Subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma are eligible. All subjects will receive FOLFOX + nivolumab
      therapy. Subjects who demonstrate at least stable disease, as per RECIST 1.1, on their first
      imaging assessment at two months will receive one additional month of FOLFOX + nivolumab (3
      months total), and then will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab
      alone or nivolumab plus radiation therapy. Radiation therapy fields and technique will be
      approved by central review. Radiation will be planned at 4Gy x 5 doses (20 Gy total), given
      concurrently with nivolumab. After 4 months of therapy, patients who remain on study will
      receive nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects will be on study (intervention + follow-up)
      for approximately 24 months. The projected end date of the study, including data analysis, is
      December 2023
