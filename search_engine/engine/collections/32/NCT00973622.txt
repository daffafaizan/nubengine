      exhibit substantial relapse following treatment. Understanding the brain mechanisms involved
      in tobacco dependence is an important step toward reducing the high rate of relapse
      associated with current behavioral and pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation. This
      study seeks to examine the effects of high frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) on decision-making and smoking behavior. A concept central to this study
      is that "quitting" tobacco necessitates making conscious choices not to smoke (to delay
      gratification) and these choices are influenced by the balance of activity between the
      frontal-parietal systems that process the value of rewards and limbic systems that are
      involved with immediate gratification. We aim to: 1) determine how two different levels of
      cortical excitation (10 Hz and 20Hz), induced by different rTMS frequencies, influence reward
      and risk-taking choices and cigarette consumption. Additionally, we aim to 2) determine how
      limbic activation due to acute nicotine withdrawal and/or satiation modifies the effects in
      aim 1. Twenty non-smoking and 20 smoking participants will receive two levels of high
      frequency rTMS and comparable sham stimulation (using electrical scalp stimulation) delivered
      over the left prefrontal cortex. Smokers will also crossover between nicotine satiation and
      acute withdrawal conditions to determine how rTMS interacts with limbic activation associated
      with nicotine use and withdrawal. In addition, changes in preattentional (brainstem-thalamus
      processing as measured using the P50 midlatency auditory evoked potential) and attentional
      (thalamocortical processing as measured using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task; PVT) will be
      assessed before and after treatment to quantitatively determine changes in
      preattentional/arousal and attentional function.
