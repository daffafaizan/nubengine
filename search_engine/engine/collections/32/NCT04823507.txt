    
      -  This will be a retrospective, single arm, unmasked, clinical study.

        -  Data scores will be collected for patients who initially underwent the Workplace
           Post-Injury 1 test of the ImPACT® test system prior to PBM treatment.

        -  Patients were treated with photobiomodulation using the BIOFLEX® DUO+ system that
           utilized a 180 bulb Light Emitting Diode (LED) array followed by laser probes. Both
           delivery methods were applied to the cervical spine and the cranium, and both entailed
           the use of red light at 660 nm wavelength and near-infrared light at 830-840 nm
           wavelength. Treatment is provided three times per week on alternating days with weekends
           off for 4 weeks for a total of 12 treatments utilizing Health Canada approved device
           specific protocol guidelines for treatment of the cervical spine.

        -  Data scores will be collected for a second ImPACT® test using the Workplace Post-Injury
           2 test.

        -  Results of the Post-Injury 1 test and the Post-Injury 2 test will be compared.
