      9.8% had a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). 200 patients (31%) had a negative rule and
      none showed MACE during the 45-day follow-up (0% [0-1.9]). Among these 200 patients, 119 had
      a standard troponin assay, a single dosage was increased.

      The main objective is to demonstrate the reliability of CARE rule to exclude ACS in chest
      pain, using an observational Franco-Belgian multicenter study in routine care.

      If the reliability of CARE rule is confirmed in Emergency departments, it could be evaluated
      to be used in other circumstances such as in pre-hospital or in private practice for the
      general practitioner or cardiologist.

      In summary, the ICARE study is intended to allow a rationalization of the management of
      patients with chest pain, limiting the use of unnecessary investigations while ensuring the
      safety of care.
