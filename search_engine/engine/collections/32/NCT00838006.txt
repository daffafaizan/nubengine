      PTSD and test two pre-deployment resiliency interventions. The objective predictors will be
      based on: 1) physiologic reactivity (heart rate, heart rate variability, eye blink startle,
      skin conductance) to virtual reality (VR) environments depicting common Operation Iraqi
      Freedom (OIF) or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) combat scenarios and 2) cognitive bias
      assessment using a recognition memory paradigm. We hypothesize that a model combining
      physiologic reactivity and cognitive bias predictors will be superior to either the
      physiologic reactivity or cognitive bias model alone for predicting post-deployment PTSD. We
      also will test two pre-deployment resiliency interventions: heart rate variability
      biofeedback and cognitive bias modification training that we have designed to target
      physiologic and cognitive responses to stress, respectively. We will compare the prevention
      interventions to a no intervention control group. We hypothesize that the prevalence of
      post-deployment PTSD will be lower in the intervention groups compared to the control group.
