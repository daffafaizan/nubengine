    
      A single centre prospective cohort phase II study of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging in specific
      patient populations:

        1. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of radical prostatectomy for treatment of
           prostate cancer, and a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 µg/L

        2. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or
           brachytherapy for treatment of prostate cancer, and a serum PSA progressively rising to
           ≥ 2 µg/L (minimum two samples) OR a serum PSA doubling-time of < 9 months

        3. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of biopsy-proven prostate cancer and
           high-risk features for metastatic disease prior to treatment with radical prostatectomy,
           radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or brachytherapy. High-risk features include a Gleason score
           > 7, serum PSA > 20 µg/L, OR minimum clinical T-stage T2c.

      All patients will have a comparison conventional imaging study performed within 10 days of
      the investigational PET/CT scan. The conventional imaging study will include a 99mTc -MDP
      bone scan including whole body planar imaging (top of skull to toes) as well as SPECT/CT
      imaging of the trunk (including clavicles to pelvis). In the absence of contraindications
      (renal failure with eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73m2 or history of IV contrast allergy), all scans
      will include an IV-contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In the
      presence of contraindications to IV contrast, a non-IV contrast enhanced CT scan of the
      chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed.

      The biodistribution of 18F-PSMA-1007 produced by the Edmonton PET Centre will be evaluated in
      2 ways:

        -  by comparing the biodistribution of tracer on the scans to an expected normal
           distribution.

        -  for any identified abnormal distribution, a lesion-by-lesion comparison to the
           conventional imaging study will be performed with lesions classified as follows:

             -  A - lesion identified on the investigational imaging study but not on the
                conventional imaging study

             -  B - matching lesions on both the investigational and conventional imaging studies

             -  C - lesion identified on the conventional imaging study but not on the
                investigational imaging study

      The clinical efficacy of 18F-PSMA-1007 will be evaluated as follows:

      • a follow-up questionnaire will be sent to referring clinicians 6 months after the scan to
      determine if the scans were of perceived clinical benefit.

      The safety of 18F-PSMA-1007 produced by Edmonton PET Centre will be evaluated in 3 ways:

        -  the patients will be screened for adverse effects immediately post-injection as well as
           after the scan (approximately 2.5 hours after injection)

        -  the patients will be provided an information sheet and contact information for
           self-reporting of delayed adverse events (1-7 days post injection)

        -  a 6 month follow-up questionnaire will be sent to referring clinicians to determine if
           there were any perceived adverse events related to the injection

      The diagnostic accuracy of 18F-PSMA-1007PET/CT produced by Edmonton PET Centre will be
      evaluated as follows:

        -  All lesions categorized as "A", "B", or "C" will be compared with a reference standard
           to determine sensitivity and specificity on both a per lesion and per patient level

        -  The reference standard will be defined a minimum of 1 year after completion of both
           scans based on available clinical data

        -  Lesional histopathology results will be used as the reference standard when available

        -  When pathology is unavailable, criteria for determining lesional positivity for
           metastatic disease will be based on recently published methodology (Lawhn-Heath et al.,
           AJR 2019;213:1-8)

        -  If lesion the criteria for determining lesion positivity are not met, the lesion will be
           considered unevaluable and will be excluded from assessment of accuracy
