    
      This non-interventional clinical study (NIS) is conducted to clinically confirm the safety
      and performance of the Aesculap® APT VEGA System® PS components under routine conditions. The
      VEGA System® PS is an established TKA design, and there is a long-lasting experience in the
      use of PE for TKA in general and for APT components in particular; thus a NIS is thought to
      be sufficient to give the required confirmation. For this NIS only CE-marked medical devices
      will be used within their intended purpose and no additional invasive or other stressful
      examinations are to be carried out (acc. to MPG §23b). As part of the post marketing
      surveillance plan an obligatory Post-Marketing Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is required for the
      product under investigation.
