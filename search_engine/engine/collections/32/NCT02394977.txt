      manual CPR would impact the quality and consistency of chest compression and patient
      survival. We conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing
      CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic teaching
      hospitals. Patients were randomized to receive either standard manual CPR or CPR using the
      Cardio First Angelâ„¢ (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) feedback device. Recorded variables
      included return of spontaneous circulation, adherence to CPR guidelines and quality of CPR,
      nurse satisfaction and CPR associated morbidity.
