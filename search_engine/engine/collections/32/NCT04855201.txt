      treatment period (up to 44 days [6 weeks]) and follow-up period (7 days [1 week]).

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 7 days
      (1 week) after the end-of-treatment on day 44 (week 6) or 7 days (1 week) after early
      discontinuation from the study.

      The anticipated total duration of the study for each participant, including screening and
      follow-up, is approximately 75 days (11 week).
