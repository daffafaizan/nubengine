      aerodigestive tract. There were over 24 million ambulatory chronic cough visits nationally in
      1991 and over 8,000 visits in 2004 at MCR. Current guidelines for chronic cough are based on
      case series and on empirical expert opinions. Studies have implicated mucosal inflammation,
      heightened sensitivity of capsaicin cough receptors on peripheral nerves and elaboration of
      inflammatory mediators including tussigenic neuropeptides. There are gaps in our knowledge of
      what triggers cough in many disease states. For example, postnasal drip syndrome has been
      estimated to account for 70% of chronic cough, yet it is known that not all patients with
      postnasal drip have chronic cough. Our hypothesis is that there must be critical factor/s
      that cause cough in one patient with postnasal drip but not in another. This study will
      evaluate whether there exists differences in capsaicin cough sensitivity, neuropeptides
      levels and mucosal inflammation in patients with postnasal drip and chronic cough and
      compared to its natural control group, subjects with postnasal drip with and without chronic
      cough. After standard therapy to eliminate postnasal drip, repeat measurement of capsaicin
      sensitivity and nitric oxide levels will be obtained. There is a critical need to determine
      the mechanisms underlying cough for better management. The study results will provide insight
      and fill gaps in our knowledge and will serve to advance future work evaluating mechanisms of
      cough in other disease states including asthma, GERD, interstitial lung disease and smokers.
