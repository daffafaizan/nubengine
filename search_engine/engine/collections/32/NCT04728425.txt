    
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular condition which can cause fatigable
      weakness of skeletal muscles including bulbar, ocular, limb, axial and respiratory muscles.
      Symptoms range from mild, transient double vision and ptosis to severe, life threatening
      diffuse weakness, and treatments which are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory have been
      shown to improve outcome in MG. This includes 10% intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which
      has previous been shown by our group to improve strength at 2 and 4 weeks in patients with
      MG. Due to delay in the onset of many immunosuppressives and potential side effects from
      steroids and other immunosuppressive medications, IVIG is also used in clinical practice as
      bridging of maintenance therapy until other therapies take effect or the patient stabilizes.
      In addition, there have been other studies suggesting that 20% subcutaneous immunoglobuin
      (SCIG) can be helpful to improve strength in patients with MG over a relatively short period
      of time (6 weeks). Some of these studies are ongoing and are further evaluating the ability
      of IVIG and SCIG to stabilize or improve strength IVIG in patients with MG, however, there is
      no current published study evaluating different administration routes of immunoglobulin (IVIG
      and SCIG) in patients with MG over a longer 6 month follow-up period.

      The current study aims to be the first to evaluate 20% Cuvitru SCIG formulation in patients
      with neuromuscular conditions including MG. The study aim is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of 6 months of 20% SCIG Cuvitru treatment vs three months of 10% IVIG
      "pre-treatment" followed by 3 months of 20% SCIG Cuvitru treatment. The study will also be
      the first to use the myasthenia gravis impairment index (MGII) as primary outcome in
      conjunction with standard MG outcomes.
