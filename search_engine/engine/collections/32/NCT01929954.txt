      a posterior tooth requiring extraction. The use of GINTUIT in this investigational clinical
      indication may eliminate/reduce the need for aggressive flap advancement with its concomitant
      morbidity, while, at the same time, obtaining stable closure over a grafted socket. It is
      anticipated that GINTUIT will facilitate tissue granulation, followed by tissue coverage with
      site appropriate tissue (ie, keratinized tissue) that is needed for long term stability of
      the final restoration.
