      addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients
      exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome
      loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic
      synergy via "sequential nephron blockade," first described more than 40 years ago. Although
      potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop
      diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish
      safety and clinical efficacy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type
      diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema
      resolution. To our knowledge there are no clinical trials designed to prove the efficacy and
      safety of combined diuretic therapy (a commonly used therapy) among patients with
      decompensated heart failure.
