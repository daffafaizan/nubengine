      I. To assess the toxicity and safety of temsirolimus in combination with dexamethasone in
      patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To assess a dose of temsirolimus that is capable of inhibiting the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) in myeloma tumor cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of temsirolimus in combination with dexamethasone in these
      patients.

      II. To correlate the efficacy of this regimen with molecular characteristics of the
      individual tumor clones.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 and oral dexamethasone once on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection periodically for
      correlative studies. Correlative studies include analysis of p70S6 kinase activity in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in multiple myeloma cells; analysis of the degree of
      AKT phosphorylation and degree of PTEN expression in multiple myeloma cells by
      immunohistochemistry; Ras mutational analysis; and Myc 5'UTR mutational analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
