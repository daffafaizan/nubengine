      extremity amputation in the United States. Conditions such as stress and depression have been
      shown to worsen diabetic symptoms. Data indicate that expressive writing (an activity during
      which individuals deal with stressful experiences by writing about them on paper) has
      beneficial effects on psychological and physiological outcomes. This study will determine
      whether diabetes patients can benefit from expressive writing. This study will also determine
      the duration of the benefits and the effectiveness of booster sessions in improving their
      diabetic symptoms.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to engage in expressive writing or neutral writing for
      18 months. Participants in the expressive writing group will write about traumatic or
      stressful events; participants in the neutral writing group will write about neutral topics
      that do not affect them emotionally. Some participants in the expressive writing group will
      receive an additional 4 months of booster sessions of expressive writing. All participants
      will undergo interviews, blood collection, physical exams and complete clinical scales on
      their disease status, quality of life, and psychological well-being; these assessments will
      occur at study entry, every 4 months during the study, and at the end of the study.
