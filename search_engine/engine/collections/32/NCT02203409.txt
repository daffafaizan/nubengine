      (ALPPS) is a breakthrough in the field of hepatobiliary surgery in recent years，which
      stimulates the remnant liver volume(RLV) grew by 74%-87.2% in 9 to 13 days。The published
      literature reported that the two stages of ALPPS are the conventional laparotomy
      surgery，Patients need to undergo the injury of two open operations in a short time. The
      incidence of postoperative complications and mortality rate is as high as 53% -73% and
      12%-27%.The aim of this study was to evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure
      in a single center, with special emphasis in validity, feasibility and limitations.

      Results:

      Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood
      transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, long-term curative
      effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

      Statistical method:groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression
      analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.
