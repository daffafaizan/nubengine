      size is 200 subjects in 1-16 years pediatric patients with HBeAg positive Chronic Hepatitis B
      (CHB). These subjects will be randomized (1:1) to group A(treated with NAs + IFN for 96
      weeks) and group B(treated with NAs for 48 weeks, then NAs combined with IFN for 96
      weeks).Meanwhile, 1-6 years and 7-16 years patients should be distributed by 1:1 ratio by
      random method in both groups. Regularly Blood cell count, biochemical test, hepatitis B viral
      markers test, and lymphocyte subsets test were exerted. To compare the curative effect of
      group A and group B, The primary monitoring indicator is HBsAg clearance rate, and the
      secondary monitoring indicator is hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA clearance，HBeAg seroconversion
      in these patients,. So that we can make the optimal antiviral treatment strategy for
      1-16-year-old children with CHB，and try to find out the possible influencing factors of
      function cure
