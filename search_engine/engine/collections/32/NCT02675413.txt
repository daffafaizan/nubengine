      multiple sclerosis (MS) has the potential to reduce the burden of neurologic disability while
      minimizing side effects and risks associated with more established therapies. However, at
      present there is a need for further understanding of the mechanisms of action for DMF. That
      is, it is not yet known whether the benefits observed in MS patients treated with DMF are due
      primarily to immunologic and anti-inflammatory effects or neuroprotective effects, or both.
      The main site(s) of DMF actions, whether in the CNS and/or the periphery, is also not known.

      Dimethyl fumarate is believed to act centrally by enhancing the nuclear factor erythroid 2
      related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional pathway, which regulates enzymes to counter act
      oxidative stress . DMF may enhance the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway within the CNS, but this
      is unproven. DMF is also anti-inflammatory, and is known to inhibit NFB translocation to the
      nucleus [and chemokine-induced monocyte chemotaxis. Inhibition of NFB could occur
      systemically, or within the CNS, or both. Therefore, investigators intend to investigate
      antioxidant and immunologic changes within the central nervous system (CNS) and blood in
      relation to DMF therapy.
