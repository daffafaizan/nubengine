      I. To evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography (MRE) to detect changes in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between baseline and after initial 6 weeks of treatment
      (change in MRE liver tumor stiffness compared to percent non-viable/necrotic tumor).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate MRE imaging measurements with patient survival (overall survival and time to
      tumor progression) over 18 months.

      II. Correlate MRE measurements with change in tumor size and enhancement on standard of care
      MR imaging sequences.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care MRI and MRE over 60-90 minutes within 5 days of liver
      biopsy before receiving any medical treatment for HCC, at 6 weeks after medical treatment for
      HCC, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression.
