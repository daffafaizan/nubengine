      A. First secondary objective of this study is to compare 10 day mortality rates of septic
      shock patients with renal insufficiency treated via L-Carnitine (as an adjunct therapy) for
      56 days versus a patients not receiving L-Carnitine adjunct therapy

      B. To compare study arms in terms of patient safety.

      C. To compare study arms in terms of further clinical outcomes, with special emphasis on
      nephrological outcomes.

      D. To study (and compare between arms) the kinetic curves of free and total serum carnitine.
      Renal replacement therapy rapidly depletes the body's carnitine levels. Tracking adequate
      carnitine levels is therefore important for the interpretation of study results.

      E. To constitute a bio-bank in association with the study for future ancillary studies (e.g.
      kidney injury marker studies, carnitine-responders versus non-responders, and other
      exploratory studies.
