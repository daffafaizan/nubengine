    
      After informed consent, investigators randomized 180 type 2 diabetes into interventiona group
      (25-hydroxy vitamin d 2000 IU+ elemental calcium 200mg per day) or placebo group (elemental
      calcium 200mg per day). The participants should control diabetes by oral medications or
      lifestyle intervention at the intervention period. Investigators exclude the participants who
      took vitamin D or calcium or anti-osteoporotic drugs. Investigators also exclude renal
      insufficiency (Cr>1.5 in men or Cr>1.4 in women) or heavy alcoholics.

      Investigators followed the participants for 24 weeks. After randomization, investigators
      checked HbA1c,glucose, calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin d, AST, ALT,Creatinine, Parathyroid
      hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum CTX, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity,
      central blood pressure, and aortic augmentation index, and precontrast liver computed
      tomography. Also investigators checked body weight, height, and peripheral blood pressure.

      At 12 weeks, investigators checked HbA1c, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, AST, ALT, calcium, and
      creatinine.

      At the end of the study(at 24 weeks), investigators checked HbA1c, glucose, AST, ALT,
      Creatinine, calcium, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum CTX, brachial-ankle pulse wave
      velocity, central blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, and precontrast liver computed
      tomography.

      After the study completed, investiators compared the data of interventional groups and
      placebo groups.
