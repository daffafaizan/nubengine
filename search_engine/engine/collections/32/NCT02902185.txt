      cells/μL and 30 for ≥500 cells/μL). Each layer was 1:1 randomly divided into Chidamide group
      or Placebo-controlled group.Chidamide and Placebo will be administrated 10mg each time, twice
      a week, interval not less than 3 days. Chidamide and Placebo intervention will last 12
      consecutive weeks. All participants will keep their antiretroviral therapy during this study.

      This study will last for 96 weeks, involving 16 study visits(Screening, Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12,
      14, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96) for every participant. At the screening visit,
      participants will give a medical history and will undergo a physical exam; blood samples will
      be collected. If participants agree, their blood samples may be stored for future research.
