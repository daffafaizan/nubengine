      effects of BCG vaccination in cognitively unimpaired older adults and older adults with
      memory and thinking problems by measuring target engagement, pharmacodynamic response, and
      effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and immune response markers. This study will
      also gather data on study feasibility, tolerability, and safety.
