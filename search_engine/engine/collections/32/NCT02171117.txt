      colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized HLA-mismatched peripheral blood stem cells
      (GPBSC). Data from more than 70 elderly AML patients who received microtransplantation in
      Beijing showed that the remission rate and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) reach 75-82%
      and 32-39% respectively, and microchimerisms (donor cells<1%) were detected without GVHD. The
      results have been clinically validated in several other centers in China, United States and
      Australia. Based on these facts, to further validate the therapeutic efficacy, we propose a
      phase III clinical trial in which the de novo AML patients â‰¥60 years old are randomly
      assigned to receive standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy with or without
      microtransplantation.
