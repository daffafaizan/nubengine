      stranded DNA breaks via production of oxygen free radicals. At the very high doses of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) administered with extreme accuracy in a single fraction
      by the CyberKnife system, there is induction of tumour necrosis due to endothelial cell
      damage and vascular collapse, cell membrane breakdown, and the release of cellular material
      and tumour antigens into the circulation, in addition to DNA strand breaks. It is
      hypothesised that the combination of modulation of the body's immune responses in the
      presence of an increased exposure to tumour antigen will provide sufficient induction of the
      immune system to suppress tumour growth.
