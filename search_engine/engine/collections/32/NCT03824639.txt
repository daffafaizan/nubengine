      Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicts nearly 6 million Americans, a number projected to grow in
      coming decades. AD is known to have a long preclinical phase in which pathophysiologic
      processes develop many years, even decades, before the onset of clinical symptoms. During
      this preclinical phase there is evidence of unremitting decline in cognitive function,
      particularly in episodic memory. Thus far, evidence of the efficacy of pharmacological
      interventions to slow this decline in cognitive function has been limited, leading to
      increasing interest in the utility of nonpharmacological interventions including exercise.

      Objective:

      The investigators propose to assess the feasibility of a novel home-based exercise
      intervention to improve episodic memory in Veterans with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

      Methods:

      The investigators will estimate the difference between the intervention (n=30) and the
      control group (n=30) on 6-month change in episodic memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure
      Test, Wechsler Logical Memory Test) as well as the effect size, which will be used as a basis
      for sample size calculation for a proposed larger study. Participants will be male and female
      Veterans 50 years of age or older with amnestic MCI.
