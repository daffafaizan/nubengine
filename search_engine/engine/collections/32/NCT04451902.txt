      required will be specified in Appendix 1 (collection form). Patients will be identified by
      their initials (first letter of their surname and first name); The study will last for one
      year to cover the COVID-19 epidemic in France (which includes the areas of mainland France
      and its overseas departments and territories) and in Europe, via the ERN-Skin European
      Network.

      The frequency of severe forms of COVID-19 will be calculated with a bilateral 95% confidence
      interval using, as a numerator, the number of patients with a severe form of COVID-19 and, as
      a denominator, the number of patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by PCR, chest scan,
      serological assay or by suggestive clinical signs during the medical consultation. A severe
      form of COVID is defined as a case requiring hospitalisation in an intensive care unit,
      requiring resuscitation, or resulting in death.

      Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 infection on rare skin diseases: complications, potential
      comorbidity factors, impact on the management of chronic conditions (change in treatment) and
      the experience of patients.

      The results of the analysis may be compared with those obtained for other groups of diseases.
      Gaining a better understanding of high-risk situations, as well as any aggravation or
      protective factors, should enable us to issue recommendations adapted to this kind of disease
      but that may also be useful for the general population. This type of study may also provide
      "reassurance" to patients with rare diseases who have many questions during this period of
      epidemic and heightened concern.
