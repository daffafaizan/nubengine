      by the rare spontaneous remissions of cancer. However, the endogenous T cell response to
      cancer fails in the vast majority of patients and the tolerogenic conditions within the liver
      may pose additional immunologic barriers for those with intrahepatic metastases. The
      investigators modify patient T cells to kill malignant cells based on their expression of
      tumor antigens using antibody-defined recognition. The investigators will achieve this by
      preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to yield "designer T
      cells" from normal patient cells. Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that
      recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2
      secretion, cellular proliferation, and cytotoxicity - the hallmarks of an effective,
      self-sustaining immune response.

      The present trial will test the regional infusion of anti-CEA designer T cells, given via the
      hepatic artery using a percutaneous approach. This is an intra-patient dose escalation trial,
      where patients will receive three doses over the course of six weeks. Doses are 10^8, 10^9
      and 10^10 modified T cells. Patients are monitored for safety and response. Patients are
      on-study for one month after dosing.
