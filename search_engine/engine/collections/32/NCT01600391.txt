      including asymmetries in propulsive forces between the paretic and non-paretic limbs, step
      lengths, widths and stance and swing phase durations. Currently there is insufficient
      evidence that current rehabilitation strategies improve walking in people who are more than 6
      months post-stroke.

      The purpose of the trial is to determine the necessary information on which to base a future
      definitive trial examining the effectiveness of visual cues for gait training following
      stroke in contrast to conventional over-ground walking practice.

      The study will determine the numbers of patients willing to be recruited into both control
      and VCT groups; the willingness of physiotherapists at each collaborating site to enroll
      patients to usual care OVCT and TVCT groups.

      It will determine the numbers of patients who do not complete the allocated treatment, thus
      dropping out of the study, and the reasons for dropping out.

      The knowledge gathered about recruitment, outcomes and drop-out rates will determine sample
      size for a subsequent definitive trial.

      The study will also measure completeness of outcome data, i.e. percentage of patients with no
      missing values in outcome assessments.
