      diagnostic imaging procedures performed for unrelated reasons. Depending on the criteria
      applied, up to 50% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas may have biochemical evidence of
      cortisol excess. Possible autonomous cortisol secretion (pACS), as defined in the 2016
      European Society of Endocrinology Guidelines, is characterized by a partial, incomplete
      suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis without the typical signs of
      overt cortisol hypersecretion.

      Investigators will perform a prospective longitudinal study in patients with adrenal
      incidentalomas associated with possible autonomous cortisol secretion, aiming to assess the
      effect of surgical and conservative management on cardiovascular and metabolic features.

      Data will be detected at baseline, at 1 and at 5 years follow-up to quantitatively identify
      the different cardiovascular and metabolic alterations in: (1) patients with non-functioning
      adrenal adenoma; (2) patients with possible autonomous cortisol secretion receiving
      conservative management; (3) patients with possible autonomous cortisol secretion receiving
      adrenalectomy according to the 2016 European Society of Endocrinology guidelines; (4)
      patients without adrenal masses.
