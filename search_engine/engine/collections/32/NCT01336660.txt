      been developed. This antivenom is a third generation F(ab')2 "fabotherapeutic" agent.It is
      administered intravenously which should lead to rapid neutralization of circulating venom.
      This study will demonstrate whether or not use of the new antivenom in children receiving
      standardized supportive care leads to resolution of the syndrome within 4 hours of
      treatment.The onset of clinical symptoms following a scorpion envenomation is usually within
      5 to 30 minutes following the sting.

      Established a classification of the patient status to differentiate a simple scorpion sting
      from a severe envenomation. A simple sting (class I) is characterized by signs that are local
      only: pain at the inoculation point, redness, edema, and numbness.

      A class II envenomation is characterized by the presence of some systemic signs: hypothermia,
      hyperthermia, chills, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Being 15 years old or younger or
      the presence of priapism, vomiting, sweating, or a body temperature greater than 39Â°C are
      factors predictive of severity.

      A severe envenomation (class III) is characterized by cardiovascular failure, often leading
      to death; respiratory failure related to the cardiac failure; and neurologic failure due to
      hypoxia.
