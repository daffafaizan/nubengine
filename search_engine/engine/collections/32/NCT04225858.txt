    
      Axillary staging in clinically node negative (cN0) breast cancer patients with neoadjuvant
      systemic therapy (NST; i.e. chemo- and immunotherapy), is preferably performed with sentinel
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NST. The probability of a tumor-positive SLNB post-NST is low.
      cN0 patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2- positive (HER2+) or triple
      negative (TN) breast cancer who achieve radiologic complete response (rCR) of the breast on
      MRI, have the lowest probability of a tumor-positive SLNB post-NST (<3%). Omitting removal of
      axillary lymph nodes in clinically node negative patients does not increase the rate of
      distant metastases nor breast cancer mortality. Performing SLNB can cause short- and
      long-term morbidity, reducing quality of life. The additional value of performing SLNB in
      patients with a very low risk of tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes should be investigated.
