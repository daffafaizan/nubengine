      restoration of androgenicity is paramount in hypogonadal men. Intramuscular injection of the
      long-acting ester testosterone undecanoate (TU) offers a new modality.

      The objective is to assess safety of TU regarding metabolic and pharmacogenetic confounders
      in hypogonadal men treated with this new formulation.

      This is a longitudinal prospective one-arm open intervention and observation trial. A minimum
      of 5 individual assessments is a prerequisite. Investigated modulators of safety parameters
      entering regression models are: nadir and/or delta total testosterone concentrations, body
      mass index (BMI), and age.
