      Early post-transplant kidney function can be attributed to inherent donor characteristics,
      damage from storage, and perioperative events and recipients factors. The incidence of severe
      injury to the transplant kidneys is 10-25% in the early post-transplant period. In addition,
      milder forms of early transplant kidney injury can impact on long term allograft function.
      Severe transplant kidney injury in the immediate post-transplant period has been hypothesized
      to be associated with higher rates of rejection.

      Hypothesis:

      In the current investigation, we would like to test the hypotheses that 1) mRNA and microRNA
      expression of proinflammatory genes in donor tissues is a risk factor for development of
      early kidney transplant dysfunction and 2) early inflammatory mRNA and microRNA expression in
      the allograft is associated with subsequent activation of cell mediated immunity as evidenced
      by increased incidence of acute rejection episodes and increased expression of cell mediated
      immunity genes during the first year post-transplant.

      Aims:

      Aim 1: Test the association between proinflammatory mRNA and microRNA expression in donor
      samples and subsequent development of early organ dysfunction in the immediate period
      following transplantation.

      Aim 2: Test the association of mRNA and microRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators in
      the transplanted organ in the immediate pre and post-reperfusion period with subsequent
      incidence of acute rejection and expression of genes involved in cell mediated immunity.
