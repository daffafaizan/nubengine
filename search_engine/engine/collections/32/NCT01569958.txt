      Cathodic tDCS (1 mA for 20 minutes) will be sequentially applied over the motor cortex of
      both sides, for five consecutive days every month for twelve months. The control group will
      receive a sham stimulation that reproduce tactile sensation of real stimulation but has no
      effects on central nervous system. For stimulation, researchers will employ a CE-certified
      medical device acting as a micro-processor-controlled constant current source. All patients
      will take riluzole during the entire period of the study.

      Fifty-four participants will be recruited from three Italian Centers and randomized to one of
      two arms of the study.

      Disease progression and quality of life will be evaluated at baseline and every three months
      during the study.

      At each visit adverse events will be reported and tolerability will be assessed through a
      specific questionnaire.
