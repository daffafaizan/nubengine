      will compare the effectiveness of a new therapy called interpersonal psychotherapy for
      depression with panic or anxiety symptoms (IPT-PS) with that of traditional interpersonal
      psychotherapy for depression (IPT).

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive up to 24 weeks of treatment with either IPT-PS
      or traditional IPT. Improvements in interpersonal functioning, quality of life, and symptoms
      of depression and anxiety will be assessed at the end of therapy and at a 3-month follow-up.
