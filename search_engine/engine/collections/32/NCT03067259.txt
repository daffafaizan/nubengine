      Operative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) in patients over 65 years of age, undergoing surgical
      / anesthetic procedures and in patients who will not undergo surgical / anesthetic. The
      patients will be taken from the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires.

      The population of the present study will be constituted by patients belonging to the HIBA
      Health Plan. It comprises patients who will not undergo any surgical / anesthetic act
      (Control Group) and those who will undergo sedation for diagnostic procedure or some surgical
      / anesthetic process (Exposure Group).

      All patients will be tested, the day of signing the Informed Consent (IC), which will serve
      as an exclusion criterion.

      Patients in the Exposure Group who signed the consent will be evaluated on five occasions: up
      to the day before the surgical / anesthetic act, on the day of the surgical / anesthetic
      event, 7 days (CAM - If the patient is hospitalized this test will do the test personally if
      the patient is discharged, the test will be done by telephone), 3 months later and a year
      after the procedure (for the latter two patients will be asked to attend the Hospital in
      time). Trained and trained personnel will be in charge of taking the test (which last
      approximately 1 hour). The battery of tests (detailed below) aims to determine if there is a
      cognitive decline, to estimate and compare it among the participants of this study.

      Patients in the control group will be evaluated on 2 occasions only, a first evaluation on
      the day the patient and the researchers arrange and then, 12 months from that date.
