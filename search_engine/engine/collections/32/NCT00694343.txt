      established part of anesthetic practice for the prevention of maternal hypotension.
      Systematic reviews of clinical data suggest the usefulness of administering colloids to

      safety of HES 130/0.4 (6%) in normal saline vs. Ringer's lactate solution in prevention of
      hypotension during spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section.
