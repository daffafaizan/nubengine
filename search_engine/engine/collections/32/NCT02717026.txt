    
      This is considered a pilot study and will pe performed on patients scheduled for routine
      fluorescein angiography.

      During the study day the following procedures will be performed:

        -  Medical history and concomitant medication

        -  Blood pressure and heart rate

        -  Assessment of visual acuity using Snellen vision charts

        -  Biomicroscopy

        -  Intraocular pressure

        -  Funduscopy

        -  IOL-Master axial length measurement

        -  Fundusphotography

        -  Optical coherence tomography

        -  Fluorescein Angiography Fundus photography analysis will be performed with an automated
           software and analysis of both angiography and optical coherence tomography will be
           performed via the devices inbuilt software.
