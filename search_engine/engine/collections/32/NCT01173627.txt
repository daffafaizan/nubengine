      interacts predominately with the opioid Âµ-receptor. In clinical settings, fentanyl exerts its
      principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. The fentanyl citrate oral
      transmucosal troche, Actiq (Cephalon, Inc.), is indicated only for the management of
      breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are
      tolerant to prior therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
