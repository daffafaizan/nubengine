      medication reconciliation at admission. The standard physician-acquired medication history
      will be performed as usual.

      Eligible patients, randomized within the intervention arm, will receive medication
      reconciliation according to the following steps:

        1. The pharmacy assistant will obtain the best possible medication history by compiling a
           comprehensive list of the medications the patient is taking and details about how the
           drugs are taken. In order to confirm the accuracy of the history, the pharmacy assistant
           will use at least two sources of information, one of which being, when possible, the
           interview with the patient and/or family members, in addition to referral letters,
           prescriptions and drug lists from primary care centres, and other.

        2. The clinical pharmacist will reconcile best possible medication history with prescribed
           medicines and, to resolve unclear or ambiguous discrepancies between the two lists
           and/or to propose any adaptations of the pharmacotherapy, the clinical pharmacist will
           refer to the medical doctor.

        3. The medical doctor will decide potential changes in pharmacotherapy and communicate them
           to the patient providing complete information on medicines.
