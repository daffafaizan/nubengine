      and quality of life in routine administration of the combination of nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane®) and carboplatin as first line treatment for adult patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for potentially
      curative surgery and / or radiation therapy. The combination of Abraxane® and carboplatin has
      been approved in Europe in March 2015 based on results from a pivotal randomized, open label
      phase III study with 1,052 patients.
