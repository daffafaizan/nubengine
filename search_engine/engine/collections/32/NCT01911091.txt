        1. To identify specific changes in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)/micro ribonucleic acid
           (miRNA) expression in muscle associated with higher or lower relative measures of
           mitochondrial capacity and fat oxidation.

        2. To identify secreted factors/miRNAs that specifically relate to the metabolic response
           of muscle and that are present after a single initial bout of exercise.

        3. To collect the appropriate clinical samples (muscle and adipose tissue, plasma/serum) to
           enable validation of myokines associated with changes in oxygen
           consumption/mitochondrial content via in vivo and in vitro discovery efforts.
