    
      When the patient will be under invasive ventilatory support and coma, and will present the
      inclusion criteria, the investigator will perform ultrasound measurements of muscle thickness
      on four muscle groups:

        -  Shoulder Side muscular compartment

        -  Anterior Arm muscular compartment

        -  Anterior thigh muscular compartment

        -  Antero-lateral leg muscular compartment The ultrasound measurements will be made once a
           day each weekday, until the discharge from ICU.

      Ultrasound measurements will be stopped if the patient's condition deteriorates and the ICU
      team chooses to limit active therapy.

      If the patient condition get better, the investigator will perform the first volitional
      muscle function assessment, as soon as the patient Glasgow scale will score 15/15:

        1. Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-ss)

        2. Dynamometric strength assessment with the muscular groups used for the MRC-ss Then the
           volitional muscle assessment will be made once every 3 days, until patient discharges
           from ICU.
