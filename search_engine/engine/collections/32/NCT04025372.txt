      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at whether the novel form of hormonal
      therapy, called Darolutamide, when paired with radiation therapy will provide the same
      quality of care as the current standard treatments available for men with this type of
      cancer. Darolutamide prevents testosterone from signaling throughout the body. Although
      studies have shown that Darolutamide has activity in more advanced forms of prostate cancer,
      the activity of Darolutamide is unknown in intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with
      radiation therapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Darolutamide
      as a treatment for any disease.

      The current standard of care treatments available to men with this type of cancer are
      radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) involving a gonadotropin
      releasing hormone agonist plus bicalutamide (both FDA-approved) or surgery. ADT works by
      depriving the body of testosterone which "feeds" prostate cancer cells and weakens prostate
      cancer cells from repairing damage caused by radiation therapy.

      In addition, the investigator will be assessing erectile function at baseline, during and
      after treatment to determine if short-term erectile function can be preserved without
      sacrificing long-term disease control.
