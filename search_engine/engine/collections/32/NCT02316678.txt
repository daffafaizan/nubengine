      and D beneficiaries with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators will compare the
      incidence of severe infection, bowel resection surgery, and death among new users of
      anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies and corticosteroids. The investigators will compute
      propensity scores to describe the propensity for treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor
      drugs compared to corticosteroids, and will match corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis
      factor drug treated patients on the propensity score. Cox regression will be employed to
      assess the hazard ratio for each of the outcomes.
