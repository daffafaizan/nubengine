    
      Patients who are waiting for foot and ankle surgery are recruited from four large referral
      centers (Peijas Hospital, Sein√§joki Central Hospital, Central Finland Central Hospital, Oulu
      University Hospital). Participants fill in foot and ankle-specific, generic and
      sosiodemographic questionnaires on the day of surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 6 months 2
      weeks after surgery. Both pen-and-paper and electronic options for completing the
      questionnaire set are provided.

      The data obtained from the Foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS), European foot and ankle
      society (EFAS) score, modified Lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), Visual analog scale
      foot and ankle (VAS-FA), Manchester Oxford foot and ankle (MOxFA) questionnaire, and the Foot
      and ankle ability measure (FAAM) are analyzed using the Rasch Measurement Theory and several
      other psychometric approaches to investigate minimal important change, reliability,
      responsiveness and validity of foot and ankle PRO instruments.
