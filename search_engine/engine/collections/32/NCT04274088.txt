      were implanted with the spherical aberration correcting diffractive, bifocal Tecnis ZLB00
      IOL, and 60 eyes of 30 age matched subjects with the spherical aberration neutral,
      diffractive, bifocal Diffractiva IOL. Observation Procedure was performed 1, 3, 6 months
      postoperatively. Main Outcome Measures included uncorrected and corrected distance and near
      visual acuity, manifest refraction, ocular aberrations and visual quality metrics with 2mm
      and 4mm pupil, and the position of visual axis.
