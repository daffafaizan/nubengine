      failure of aminosalicylates plus corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators.1-4 In the
      registration studies for adalimumab in ulcerative colitis prior anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) treatment was restricted; in ULTRA 1, prior anti-TNF treatment was an exclusion
      criterion,5 while in ULTRA 2, 40% of patients had been exposed to infliximab prior to start
      of adalimumab, but primary non-responders to infliximab were excluded.6 Open label real life
      studies have shown good responses to adalimumab in UC. However typically, these cohorts were
      small and most patients were anti-TNF naïve. One Italian open label study on 88 patients
      reported clinical remission rates of 28% and 43% at week 12 and year 1, respectively.7 No
      significant differences were observed between infliximab naïve and infliximab exposed UC
      patients. In a Belgian open label study of 73 patients previously failing infliximab, overall
      clinical response at week 12 and 52 were 75% and 52%, respectively.8 Adalimumab was continued
      without need for dose escalation throughout year 1 in 16 patients, 22 needed dose escalation
      and 35 discontinued treatment within 1 year. Prior response to infliximab and early serum
      concentrations correlated with response.

      While data are available in Crohn's disease,9 real life data on adalimumab dose escalation
      and dose de-escalation are limited in ulcerative colitis. Similarly, factors associated with
      need and success of dose escalation and dose de-escalation later on are almost absent.
