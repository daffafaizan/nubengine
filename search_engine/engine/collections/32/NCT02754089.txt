      utilized extensively for medicinal purposes. The antioxidant components of this plant made it
      a favorable target for laboratory and animal studies in different conditions such as
      oxidative stress cytotoxicity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Rhus (Somagh) is found in
      temperate and tropical regions worldwide, often growing in areas of marginal agricultural
      capacity. Rhus is used as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine because of its assumed
      analgesic, antidiarrheic, antiseptic, anorexic and antihyperglycemic properties. The fruits
      of Rhus contain flavonols, phenolic acids, hydrolysable tannins, anthocyans and organic acids
      such as malice, citric and tartaric acids. Some studies have shown that polyphenols could
      have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer and could be regarded as
      bioactive compounds with a high potential health-promoting capacity. Phenolic compounds
      inhibit lipid peroxidation, scavenge the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, and enhance
      the activities of detoxifying enzymes.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Rhus coriaria L. (Rhus) commonly known as
      Somagh on body weight.
