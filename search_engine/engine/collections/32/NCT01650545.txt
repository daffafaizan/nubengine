    
      This is a randomized single-center pilot study to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      aerosolized liposomal cyclosporine A (L-CsA) in the treatment of chronic rejection in lung
      transplant recipients with Grade 1 or 2 BOS.

      The primary endpoints will include:

        -  Improvement or stabilization of pulmonary function test (FEV1) from baseline

        -  Stabilization of histology (no deterioration from baseline)

        -  Safety of the preparation

      The secondary endpoints will include:

        -  Pharmacokinetics and distribution of CsA in blood -

        -  Change in cytokine levels from BAL specimens.
