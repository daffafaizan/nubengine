      immediate release (IR) MPH using PET and C-11 altropane. The main target of MPH in the brain
      is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure
      DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This research will
      provide novel and unique information toward a better understanding of the mechanism of action
      of long-acting stimulant formulations to enable new drug development and an estimation of the
      relative abuse potential of the current formulation.
