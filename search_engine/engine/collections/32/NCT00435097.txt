      early detection and diagnosis of colon cancer metastases. Colon cancer is the third most
      common cancer worldwide. While it is amenable to surgery if detected early, advanced
      carcinomas are usually lethal, with liver metastases being the most common cause of death.
      Early and accurate detection of these lesions is recognized as having the potential of
      improving survival rates and reducing treatment morbidity. Current diagnostic imaging offers
      improved discrimination and sensitivity that can be used for earlier detection of smaller
      lesions conducive to curative therapy.

      In previous research, we demonstrated the feasibility of fMRI based on hypercapnia and
      hyperoxia for monitoring changes in liver perfusion and hemodynamics without contrast agent
      administration. The isolation and analysis of areas with significant hemodynamical changes in
      images acquired at early phase of tumor development has proven to be a difficult, time
      consuming, and potentially unreliable task. Our goal is thus two-fold: 1. use image
      processing and machine learning tools on a training set of hemodynamical maps obtained from
      well validated tumors to automate the process and improve its discrimination and sensitivity
      characteristics, and; 2. implement our method in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
      The method can help general radiologists with no image processing training to highlight
      undetectable tumors from background noise and increase diagnosis specificity and sensitivity.
