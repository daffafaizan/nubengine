      into the surgical incision in patients undergoing hernioplasty.

      The study is a prospective, comparative, double covered. The distribution of patients in the
      groups was randomly drawn prior to starting the project and the groups were identified in
      envelopes numbered 1-40.

      Criteria for inclusion and exclusion After approval by the Ethics Committee of UNIFESP and
      signature of consent by those responsible, and the term of assent by patients over six years,
      40 children of both sexes will be evaluated, aged between 3 and 12 years who underwent
      hernioplasty.

      Children with bleeding disorders, using analgesic or sensitivity to any drug will be
      excluded.

      The patients will be randomly divided into one of two groups. Patients in group 1 will
      receive local infiltration with 2 mg / kg of tramadol diluted in 5 ml of 0.9% saline solution
      and 20ml of 0.9% saline solution intravenously at the end of the surgical procedure Patients
      in group 2 will receive 2 mg.kg-1 tramadol intravenously diluted in 20 ml of 0.9% saline
      solution and local infiltration with 5 mL of saline solution 0.9% at the end of the surgical
      procedure.

      All patients will undergo general anesthesia, and will receive additional analgesia with
      dipyrone and morphine as needed in post operative period.
