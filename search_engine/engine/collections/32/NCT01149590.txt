      patients with coronary heart disease and angina. Despite this important service provision,
      coronary heart disease continues to be under-diagnosed and many patients are left untreated
      and at risk. Recent advances in imaging technology have now led to the widespread use of
      non-invasive computed tomography both to measure coronary artery calcium scores and undertake
      coronary angiography. However, this technology has not been robustly evaluated in any
      systematic approach. Using state-of-the-art multidetector computed tomography scanners, we
      propose to undertake a major multicentre randomized controlled trial to assess the added
      value of computed tomography imaging in over 4000 patients attending rapid access chest pain
      clinics across Scotland. This will define the most appropriate use of this emerging
      technology in the setting of diagnosing and treating patients with coronary heart disease and
      angina pectoris. This study will also lay the foundation for future studies to look at the
      potential prognostic value of this technology.
