      coronary artery disease (CAD); however, HDL is often ignored in primary care. The combination
      of niacin extended-release (ER)/lovastatin in a single tablet formulation (AdvicorÂ®) may be
      the most effective therapeutic option for simultaneously correcting both of these lipoprotein
      abnormalities to reduce CAD risk. The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits of
      combination niacin ER/lovastatin in patients receiving standard care who are not at LDL goal
      per ATP III guidelines.
