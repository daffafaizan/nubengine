      procedure. At 9 months (+ 30 days) all subjects will undergo a standard quantitative coronary
      angiography (QCA) follow up to assess the in-stent LLL as the main efficacious evaluation.
      Use the major adverse cardiac event (death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis)
      within one year post procedure as the main safety indicators to evaluate the investigational
      product's safety. The clinical and angiographic data sorting, calculation and statistical
      analysis will be conducted by an independent data management center and angiographic core
      laboratory.
