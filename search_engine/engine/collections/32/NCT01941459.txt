      To day we normally used a blood or crystalloid based solutions. It has been published a lot
      of papers comparing the too groups with different results. To our knowledge no prospective,
      randomized study has compared modified St Thomas based Blood and Crystalloid cardioplegia on
      the acknowledged markers (CK-MB, troponin-T) of myocardial damage during aortic valve
      replacement on patients without additional significant coronary artery disease.

      Methods: 100 patients with aorta stenoses undergoing aortic valve replacement without
      significant coronary artery stenoses or other significant concomitant heart valve disease
      were included in the study. They were given antegrade cold blood or cold crystalloid
      cardioplegia delivered through the coronary Ostia every 20 min throughout the period of
      aortic cross-clamp. CK-MB and troponin-T were compared between the two groups.
