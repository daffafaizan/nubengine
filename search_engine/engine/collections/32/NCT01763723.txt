      test-area (4 x 6cm) on one buttock to induce pigmentation. This will be followed by 3 weekly
      IPL (intense pulsed light) exposures. At 24 hours after the first IPL exposure, biopsies will
      be excised from the buttocks of the subjects (4 each).The skin will be evaluated after IPL
      exposure for: skin reactions, pain and mRNA expression of two pigment markers. Follow-up
      visits is planned at 1 and 4 weeks after the third and final IPL exposure.
