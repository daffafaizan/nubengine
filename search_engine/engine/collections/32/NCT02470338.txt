      treatment of routine ankle instability without evidence of intra-articular pathology on MRI.
      Our study population will include those individuals whose ankle MRI is inconclusive or
      negative for intra-articular pathologies, and intra-articular ankle pain is not a predominant
      presenting symptom. Although it is our current practice at WBAMC not to conduct an ankle
      arthroscopy on this group of patients, there is a debate in the literature on whether the
      arthroscopy should be conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the MBP with
      and without ankle arthroscopy.
