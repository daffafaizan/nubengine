      eligibility criteria may be included in this study. An information letter will be sent to
      them by mail. If they wish to oppose to the use of their data, they can then return the
      objection form.

      This sample will be supplemented by new patients who are recruited during a classic
      rheumatology consultation. The investigator will propose the study to all patients meeting
      the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.

      They will be informed of the objectives of the study and their rights. For patients who agree
      to participate in the study, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will be collected.

      Depending on the usual care, they will benefit from an ultrasound and/or a dual energy
      scanner (M0). Imaging data will be collected. Routine clinical follow-up is then carried out
      in consultation, with collection of clinical and biological evolution data, and morphological
      data if necessary if imaging is rechecked, until the patient is lost to follow-up or the
      follow-up is interrupted at the GHICL for any reason.

      Available quarterly or semi-annual data will be collected.
