    
      -  Participants will be required to enroll in DFCI Protocol 99-224, the CLL Research
           Consortium Tissue Bank, and DFCI Protocol 01-206, Tissue and Data Collection for
           Research Studies in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies, Bone Marrow Disorders, and
           Normal Donors, or may have blood banked for future use.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take
           pyrimethamine orally once per day. Since we are looking for the highest dose of the
           study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects,
           not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of study drug.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time points during
           participation in the study: Physical exam, vital signs, blood tests and bone marrow
           biopsy. The participant's tumor will be assessed by CT scans of the chest, abdomen and
           pelvis prior to the start of the study and at the end of the 1st, 3rd and 6th months.

        -  Participants can continue to receive pyrimethamine as long as they do not have side
           effects and their disease does not worsen.
