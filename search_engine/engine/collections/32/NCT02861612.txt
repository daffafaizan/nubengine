    
      Cervical spinal cord injury is a life-altering injury that results in profound loss of upper
      limb function. Hand function is essential to basic activities of daily living and
      consequently has a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Tendon transfers and/or
      tenodesis have traditionally been used to restore hand function in spinal cord injuries -
      however, in recent years there is growing interest in the role of nerve transfers as a means
      of accomplishing this goal. Although preliminary results indicate nerve transfers may be
      well-suited for patients with spinal cord injury, their long term efficacy has not been
      demonstrated.

      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of nerve transfers in restoring hand function in
      patients with cervical spinal injuries. Eligible patients will receive nerve transfer
      procedure(s) (e.g. brachialis to anterior interosseous nerve, supinator to posterior
      interosseous) and will be followed post-operatively to assess for changes in strength,
      functional independence, and quality of life.
