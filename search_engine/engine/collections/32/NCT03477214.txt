      impairment due to changes in bio-mechanical properties of soft tissues with the age. That is
      why pelvic floor characterization and diagnosis must include electomyographic (EMG) and
      biomechanical measurements (pressure) or better if EMG and tactile imaging with improved
      spatial resolution. The quantitative and objective imaging data for pelvic floor conditions
      could allow an effective treatment of OAB and UI.

      In this research the investigators propose to develop a new device for accurate diagnosis of
      the diseased conditions by measuring the pelvic floor muscles strength and EMG activity. The
      value to society is high given by the prevalence of OAB and UI.
