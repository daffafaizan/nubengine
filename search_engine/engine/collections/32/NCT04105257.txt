      radiological examinations:

        1. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging to evaluate blood flow in the brain;

        2. Imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI) of the brain to detect lesions from a cerebral
           vascular accident (stroke) not visible on standard imaging of the brain.

      The proposed additional examinations (CTP and MRI) are tests that are currently used at the
      CHUM. Those are not experimental tests. These tests are commonly used when doctors wants a
      further investigation to clarify the cause of the neurological symptoms. These tests are
      usually done in a semi-urgent or non-urgent situations. In the present study they will be
      done urgently. The investigators wish to determine if obtaining these additional tests in
      emergency will change the decision of whether to administer the drug (thrombolysis). The
      investigators want to determine whether one imaging test is sufficient or if both exams are
      needed to help clinical decision-making. Please note that urgent access to perfusion CT and
      brain MRI is not considered routine care, since the value of these additional tests has yet
      to be demonstrated.
