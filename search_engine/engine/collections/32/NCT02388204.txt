      disease progression. Although Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) improves patient's quality of life
      by addressing the cardinal symptoms and reducing Levodopa motor complications, non motor
      symptoms still increasing over time. Gait problems as falls and freezing are important cause
      of disability and incapacity. Novel therapeutics approaches are needed to restore quality of
      life. Data from animal PD model suggest that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can enhance
      locomotion in mice. Although clinical results, mostly from case reports, in PD patients are
      still conflicting, a few patients benefited from SCS in thoracic levels.

      Aim: Evaluated Spinal cord stimulation effects in locomotion, gait, freezing and falls in PD
      patient's.

      Method: 20 PD patients will undergo thoracic spinal cord stimulation with high frequency in a
      prospective study for six months. Gait and freezing evaluation will consists in: timed up and
      go test, timed up and go test with dual task, 20 m walk test, 20 m walk test with obstacle,
      freezing of gait scale and falls scale. PDQ 39 and Schwab and England scales will be used to
      measure quality of life. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for motor symptoms and
      general evaluation. All tests will be done before surgery, after one week, one, three, six
      months. All patients will be stimulated with the same parameters: High frequencies and 90 mcs
      pulse width and the sensory threshold will be measured. At the third month the parameters of
      SCS will be changed and comparative tested for low frequency in a double blind trail.
