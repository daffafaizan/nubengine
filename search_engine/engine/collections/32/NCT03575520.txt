      the incidence of febrile neutropenia during four cycles of dose dense (DD)
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) with pegtoegrastim support is being investigated.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of febrile neutropenia
      during four cycles of DD AC with pegteograstim support (8 weeks).

      Patients received four cycles of DD-AC (60 mg/m² doxorubicin and 600 mg/m² cyclophosphamide
      administered intravenously on day 1 every two weeks).

      A fixed dose of 6.0 mg pegteograstim was administered subcutaneously on day 2 of each
      chemotherapy cycle (between 22 and 26 hours after the completion of chemotherapy).

      Clinical, hematological, and biochemical assessments were done before the start of each
      cycle.

      Adverse events (AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
      (NCI-CTCAE version 4.03).
