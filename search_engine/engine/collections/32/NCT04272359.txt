    
      Approximately 500 T2DM patients aged ≥18 years will be enrolled according to the guidelines
      of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) with poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [A1C]
      ≥6.5% and ≤11% [≥58 mmol / mol and ≤97 mmol / mol]), in stabilized treatment with
      sulfonylureas / glinids, which meet all the study enrollment criteria.

      During the study 7 visits are scheduled which coincide with the routine diabetic visits.

      During the scheduled visits the patients of the study will be subjected to:

        -  Enrollment on the first visit if the inclusion criteria are met and those of exclusion
           are absent

        -  Anamnestic and clinical collection

        -  Evaluation of the type of treatment to which they have been assigned and possible
           modification of drug therapy in the in case that the desired glycemic target has not yet
           been reached up.
