      first arm will be comparison clinics that continue to use existing team-based strategies for
      hypertension management. The second arm will be intervention clinics. These clinics will have
      enhancements to existing team-based hypertension management. The first enhancement is
      clinical decision support based in the electronic health record. The second enhancement is
      improved protocols to implement telehealth prescribing that is nurse-led.

      The trial will enroll participants through an urban emergency department. Participants will
      be assigned to one of these 12 clinics and continue study activities for 1 year. Clinicians
      at the clinics will manage blood pressure. Study specific visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, and
      12 months. Primary outcome assessment is 12 months.
