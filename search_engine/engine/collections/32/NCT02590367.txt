      cancer, in metastatic disease and in the adjuvant setting . Moreover, oxaliplatin is being
      used as an alternative option to cisplatin in various cancers, such as ovarian, gastric.
      Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy is characterised by acute and transient cold
      hyperaesthesia in the hours and days following oxaliplatin infusion (>90% of patients), but
      also by retarded chronic neuropathy due to the repetition of chemotherapy cycles (30-50% of
      patients). Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy impairs the health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) of patients and no preventive or curative strategies have as yet proven
      effective so far. Animal experiment show that HD6610 granule can relieve mouse's peripheral
      neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin. In clinical practice, the investigators also find that
      HD6610 granule can relieve patient's oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in the
      treatment of chemotherapy. So the investigators design this randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study to estimate the efficacy and
      safety of HD6610 granule for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer.
