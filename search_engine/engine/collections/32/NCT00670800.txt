    
      The pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a reproductive and metabolic disorder,
      is associated with insulin resistance. The effects of insulin resistance on cognition, mood,
      opioid system and reproductive function in PCOS affected women are investigated in the
      current study. The identification of reversible changes in brain function and reproductive
      measures in insulin resistant PCOS patients would likely significantly influence treatment
      protocols for these young women.

        1. Evaluate the differences in opioid tone in women with insulin resistant PCOS compared to
           normal controls.

        2. Evaluate whether an oral hypoglycemic agent is capable of altering opioid tone in women
           with insulin resistant PCOS.
