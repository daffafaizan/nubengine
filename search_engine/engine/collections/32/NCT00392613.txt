        1. To show that lenient rate control is not inferior to strict rate control in terms of
           cardiovascular mortality and morbidity

        2. To show that lenient rate control is not inferior to strict rate control in terms of all
           cause mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, NYHA class for exercise tolerance,
           left ventricular function and left atrial size, quality of life, neurohormonal
           activation as measured by NT-proBNP, hospitalization for heart failure, syncope,
           sustained ventricular tachycardia, appropriate shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing of ICD
           for ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and pacemaker implantations, stroke,
           systemic emboli, and bleeding, unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, costs
           and renal function
