      Center. When orthopaedic surgery is consulted for management of a fracture, the patient will
      be offered enrollment into the study. The collected data will be assigned a letter and number
      associated for references with the patient's age, type of fracture, and time since original
      injury to thermal imaging scan. If any patient receives a thermal imaging scan at their
      initial injury evaluation, then he or she will also receive thermal imaging scans at all
      follow-up appointments to track changes in temperature over the healing process. No obtunded
      or unresponsive patients will be enrolled into the study. The goal will be to have to thirty
      patients enrolled into both acute fracture and non-union arms of the proposal for a total of
      sixty subjects. Age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, medical history, and surgical history
      will be recorded for future confounding analysis.
