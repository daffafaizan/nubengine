      cause of symptomatic heart failure in approximately one half of patients who are admitted to
      hospitals with heart failure symptoms. However, diastolic heart function remains difficult to
      measure objectively without cardiac catheterization. Diastolic heart dysfunction is also
      common among patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Despite the
      ubiquitous use of inhaled volatile drugs to maintain anesthesia in these patients, their
      effects upon diastolic heart function remain unclear.
