      cancer, and reevaluated by CT scan after 6 months. Patients with no evidence of disease will
      be randomized to receive either standard follow up, or to have a second look laparoscopy to
      evaluate for peritoneal carcinosis. After laparoscopy, those patients who do not have
      peritoneal carcinosis will continue with standard follow up. Patients with peritoneal
      carcinosis diagnosed by laparoscopy will be treated according to their peritoneal carcinosis
      index (PCI). For patients with PCI > 20, systemic chemotherapy will be given according to
      Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) guidelines. Patients with PCI < 20 will
      undergo peritonectomy and then receive intravenous chemotherapy immediately followed by
      HIPEC.
