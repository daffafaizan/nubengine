      sepsis or septic shock. This study is supported by unrestricted grants.

      The release of reactive oxygen species is an important factor in the development of sepsis
      induced multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Common protection mechanisms are impaired in this
      syndrome. Serum levels of selenium, a cofactor of the glutathionperoxidase, are reduced.
      Several studies suggest a benefit of selenium application in patients with severe sepsis but
      data from large clinical trials are not available. After inclusion into the study, patients
      are randomly allocated to a placebo or selenium group. Treating physicians and patients are
      blinded regarding the allocation. The selenium group receives sodium selenite intravenously -
      1000 µg as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 µg per day until the end of ICU
      treatment but not longer than 21 days.

      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker which is elevated in the blood of patients with severe
      sepsis/septic shock. Data from patients with community acquired pneumonia demonstrated that
      this biomarker can be used to decide on the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Studies with
      small sample size seem to confirm this in ICU patients with severe sepsis. However, this
      needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort. All patients are randomly allocated to a PCT guided
      algorithm or a control group. In the PCT-guided group, PCT is measured at randomization, day
      4, 7, 10, and 14. Depending on the PCT course, the protocol recommends to change, alter, or
      stop anti-infectious measures. In the control group, anti-infectious therapy is left to the
      discretion of the treating physician.
