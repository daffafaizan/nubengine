      androgen independent prostate cancer previously treated with up to two cytotoxic chemotherapy
      regimens. During this study, the efficacy and safety of this combination will be evaluated.
      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate PSA response rates (response will be
      defined as a > 50% reduction in PSA levels) in men who have failed primary chemotherapy. The
      secondary objectives are to compare progression free survival, disease free survival, overall
      survival, and toxicity (tolerance/safety). There will be up to 35 male subjects >= 18 years
      of age enrolled on this single institution study.
