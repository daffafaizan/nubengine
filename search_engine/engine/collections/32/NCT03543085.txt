    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open label, single center to confirm the
      effectiveness and safety of an ultra-high frequency (500 KHz) spinal cord stimulation in
      patients with chronic back pain or lower limb pain. The trial length is 14 days. Patients
      will be given ultrahigh frequency pulse stimulation, up to 3 times in every 24 hours, and VAS
      will be obtained at least once a day. Compared to previous study conducted last year, patient
      can now have two lead implant sites for different pain locations. The electrode implantation
      site will be epidural space instead of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG).
