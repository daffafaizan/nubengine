      penetrate the skin and deliver medication into intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular
      tissues. Multi-dose jet injectors are a type of jet injector with a reusable fluid path that
      consists of the vial adapter, dose chamber, fluid pathway, and nozzle. Although credited with
      decades of use and the delivery of millions of doses of vaccine in the field, multi-dose jet
      injectors are no longer used due to evidence of cross-contamination between injections. The
      HSI-500 Jet Injector with Protector Cap has been designed with a disposable plastic cap that
      acts as a shield between the nozzle and the skin to eliminate cross-contamination between
      injections while maintaining a high rate of vaccine delivery to multiple patients.

      The objective of this pilot safety study is to provide a preliminary indication of the
      ability of the jet injector to prevent cross-contamination from hepatitis B virus between
      volunteer injections. A secondary objective of the study is to test study procedures prior to
      a larger-scale safety study.
