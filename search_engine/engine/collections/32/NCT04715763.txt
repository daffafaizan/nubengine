      the severity of COVID-19 related disease in hospitalized patients. Data on clinical course
      and lab values will be passively abstracted from Queen's standard of care evaluations on
      COVID-19 in-patients. Participants will be monitored closely as an outpatient if/when
      discharged prior to day 21. The only study-specific procedure will be a blood draw of ten
      (10) cc to be collected for research purposes at entry and at day 4 and day 21 of study for
      the evaluation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system and for various blood biomarkers
      of organ function/coagulation, inflammation, leukocyte chemotaxis, tissue remodeling/fibrosis
      and immune exhaustion.
