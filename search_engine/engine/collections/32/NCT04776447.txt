      total sample size is 51 patients. The population to be included are non-resectable stage
      IIIA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer patients.

      Patients randomised will receive induction treatment (Atezolizumab 1200mg+ Carboplatin
      AUC5+Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 for 3 cycles) and concurrent chemotherapy (CT) -radiotherapy
      treatment for 3 cycles. At the end of concurrent treatment Atezolizumab 1200mg maintenance
      treatment will start and will be administered for 12 months (16 cycles).

      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of the treatment (Atezolizumab + Induction
      chemotherapy (CT) + CT-Radiotherapy) in terms of the Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 12
      months according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.

      PFS are defined as the time from inclusion until objective tumor progression or death.

      Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 2 years, treatment is planned to extend
      during 1.5 years and the patients will be followed up for 2 years. The study will end once
      survival follow-up has concluded.
