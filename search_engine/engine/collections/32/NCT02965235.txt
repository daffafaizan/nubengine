      from 16% to 21% and is associated with adverse outcomes. The exact cause of POCD remains
      unknown. Extensive studies report that epigenetic modification, including the alteration of
      DNA methylation and chromatin structure, plays an important part in the regulation of memory
      and learning. The present study thus hypothesize that epigenetic modification may increase
      the risk for POCD. The present study will enrolled the elderly patients (agedâ‰¥65) and young
      and middle-aged patents (aged 20-50) who are planning to undergo elective noncardiac surgery
      under general anesthesia. Perioperative clinical characteristics of all patients will be
      recorded. Participants enrolled will be evaluated for POCD with Mini-Mental State Examination
      (MMSE) on preoperative day, postoperative days 1. Postoperative pain will be evaluated by the
      numerical rating scale (NRS). The patients' blood will be collected in the morning on the day
      before surgery and after surgery when they recover consciousness for the detection of
      concentration of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

      The present study may help to find whether epigenetic changes will occur after surgical and
      anesthesia stress and will be an important factor for POCD in elderly patients.
