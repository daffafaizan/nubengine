      Alzheimer's disease (AD) eventually become driving impaired. Drivers with dementia are
      estimated to be 2-8 times more likely to be involved in an automobile crash as unimpaired
      peers. Approximately half of individuals with mild AD have the skills needed to drive safely.
      Formal driver evaluation may be necessary to make this distinction. Some reviews in the
      literature have suggested that individuals identified as high risk, such as those with AD, be
      advised by their physicians to cease driving altogether. Other studies suggest that these
      individuals may continue to drive for up to 4 years following diagnosis. Memantine may be
      effective in delaying the progression of driving impairment in individuals with mild AD. If
      the investigators can demonstrate a significant delay in the decline in the driving ability,
      this could extend their driving time and therefore be of immense benefit to patients and
      their caregivers.

      Comparison(s): Subjects treated with memantine over a period of 12 months, compared to
      subjects on placebo.
