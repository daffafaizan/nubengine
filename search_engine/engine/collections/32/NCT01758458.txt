      I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with
      metastatic merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) by combined myosin heavy chain (MHC) up-regulation
      therapy and adoptive transfer of merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) T-antigen (TAg)-specific
      polyclonal autologous cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells.

      II. Determine the antitumor efficacy associated with treating patients with metastatic MCC by
      combined MHC up-regulation therapy and adoptive transfer of MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal
      autologous CD8+ T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence and where evaluable, migration to tumor sites of
      adoptively transferred polyclonal CD8+ T cells targeting the MCPyV TAg.

      II. Determine the in vivo functional capacity of adoptively transferred polyclonal CD8+ T
      cells targeting the MCPyV TAg.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy or recombinant interferon beta intralesional injection
      within day -3 to day -1.

      Patients receive MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8-positive T cell vaccine
      intravenously (IV) on day 1 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours on days 1-14.
      Treatment repeats at least every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with continued presence of detectable metastatic disease 8 weeks after the first
      infusion may repeat the treatment regimen including radiation therapy or recombinant
      interferon beta injection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
