      as a model system of the symptoms of schizophrenia. To complement this model system and to
      allow neurobiological as well as translational studies, biomarkers are often applied to
      people under the influence of ketamine. Here, we apply oculomotor, perceptual and cognitive
      biomarkers to healthy human volunteers whilst they undergo BOLD fMRI at 3 Tesla field
      strength. We use a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects
      design. A sample of 25 healthy participants is required. Participants will receive
      intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine (with a 100ng/ml target plasma concentration) on one of two
      assessment days and they will receive placebo (intravenous saline) on the other assessment
      day. BOLD fMRI will be carried out on a Siemens Trio scanner at the Life&Brain Centre, Bonn.
      In addition to brain functional and cognitive, perceptual and oculomotor responses, we will
      also measure self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences. These will be obtained using the
      Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI; Mason et al 2008).
