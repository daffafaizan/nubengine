      physical activity levels. Prevention is key to reducing the obesity problem. Intervention
      programs must be easily accessible, and include intervention materials in a format that draws
      attention and interest. This study evaluates an 8-week web-based intervention for teens to
      promote healthy food and physical activity choices. The web program includes role model
      stories, nutrition and activity information pieces, goal setting and problem solving, and
      self-monitoring. Students will complete assessments at baseline, 8-weeks post, and then 6 and
      12-months post intervention.
