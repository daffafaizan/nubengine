    
      In this prospective, open, not-randomized, controlled single-center pilot study 80 patients
      having had an in-stent-thrombosis (40 sub-acute thromboses (SAT), 40 late thromboses (LT))
      and a control group of 80 patients having not developed a thrombosis will be compared.

      The aim of this study is the establishment of diagnostic markers vor prediction of SAT
      (detection of CD39- and CD73-activity, respectively)and of LT (EPC-number and function,
      respectively) correspondingly aiming at the early identification of patients with high risk
      for developing an in-stent-thrombosis.
