      perpetrator of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with digoxin, adefovir and furosemide in healthy
      male and female subjects. Unique subjects will be enrolled into each arm of the study and
      enrollment will be sequential. The first 20 subjects confirmed to be eligible will be
      assigned to Arm 1 (digoxin), the next 16 subjects will be assigned to Arm 2 (adefovir) and
      the next 22 subjects will be assigned to Arm 3 (furosemide). Blood samples for PK analysis
      will be collected at pre-defined timepoints for each arm throughout the study. Subjects will
      be on study for up to 80 days, including a 28-day screening period, 7-21 day in clinic
      period, and a 30-day follow up period post last dose.
