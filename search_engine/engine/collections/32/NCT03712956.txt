      taxanes should be included in the chemotherapy regimen for 'Luminal B' disease1. However,
      several patients are reluctant to receive a "strong" chemotherapy because of the fear of its
      toxic effects, and usually ask for a somehow "less intensive" approach, even accepting a
      possible reduction in the treatment efficacy.

      One of the reasons why patients refuse chemotherapy more often is the fear of alopecia. Few
      dermatologic conditions carry as much emotional distress as chemotherapy-induced alopecia.
      Hair loss negatively affects a patient's perception of appearance, body image, sexuality, and
      self- esteem.

      We decided to conduct a single-center, phase II, single-arm, feasibility study to evaluate
      PLD (Caelyx®) as an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with early-stage luminal B
      breast cancer.

      The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant PLD (Caelyx®) for each
      individual subject. The regimen will be considered feasible if that subject is able to
      achieve relative dose intensity (RDI) of at least 85% of the 8 cycles of treatment.

      Secondary endpoints will include:

        -  Adverse events

        -  Tolerability (treatment completion)

        -  Breast cancer free interval (BCFI; events are reappearance of invasive breast cancer at
           any site including contralateral disease)

        -  Disease Free Survival (DFS) (includes second malignancies and deaths)

        -  Overall survival (OS) Caelyx® should be administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/m2
           once every two weeks for 8 courses.
