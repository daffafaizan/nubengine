      polyunsaturated fatty acids in Camelina seed oil allows the body to take up the fish oil
      fatty acids in the same way as it does from fish oil.

      In the first study (A) the Camelina oil will be used in a meal. The volunteers (healthy men
      and women) will be asked to consume the meal and provide blood samples in the following 6
      hours to look at immediate uptake of the fish oil fatty acids. This will be repeated (for
      comparison) with fish oil.

      The second study (B) will look at consumption over a longer period. Volunteers will be asked
      to consume the Camelina oil daily for 8 weeks and provide blood samples at the visits at the
      start and end of that period. This will be repeated (for comparison) with fish oil.
