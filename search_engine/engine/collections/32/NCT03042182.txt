      initiated at the NCC involving 20 patients with confirmed CCA diagnosis. The trial will be
      short, it will last only 2 months, but this will be sufficient to gauge the safety and
      efficacy. Only those patients who have higher than normal levels of CA19-9 tumor marker will
      be enrolled, which will serve as a surrogate marker in a manner alpha fetoprotein (AFP) has
      been used as a predictor of clinical response in HCC patients. Additional primary endpoints
      will be overall survival and changes in tumor burden, with secondary endpoints being liver
      function tests and changes in quality of life.
