      dyslipidemia and increased adiposity in schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotic
      medications in combination with valproate. The project hypothesizes that combined treatment
      with valproate and antipsychotic medications will decrease insulin sensitivity at the level
      of skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, in comparison to antipsychotic monotherapy. The
      decrease in insulin sensitivity is hypothesized to be associated with defects in glucose and
      lipid metabolism and increased adiposity

      Treatment effects of antipsychotic/valproate combination therapy on different components of
      insulin secretion and action, and treatment effects on abdominal versus peripheral adiposity,
      are unknown despite the availability of gold-standard methods and the prognostic significance
      of these issues. Relevant data are needed to target basic research, to identify the potential
      for acute and long-term complications, and to plan therapeutic interventions. The following
      specific aims will be addressed in non-diabetic schizophrenia patients treated with atypical
      antipsychotics who will be randomized to open label treatment with either valproate or no
      adjuvant. Evaluations are performed at baseline and 3 months of treatment.
