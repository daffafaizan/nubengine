      of SB-656933 following 28 days of daily administration of 20 and 50 mg SB-656933 in patients
      with CF compared to placebo. The primary endpoints of the study will be the effect of
      SB-656933 on safety and tolerability (adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory
      assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and urinalysis) following 28 days of dosing.
      Secondary endpoints will include levels of neutrophil elastase in induced sputum and other
      sputum markers of inflammation (e.g. myeloperoxidase, total protein), induced sputum cells
      (i.e. total sputum neutrophil counts, percent sputum neutrophils) and sputum microbiology.
      Other assessments will include lung function measurements (spirometry); serum and plasma
      markers of inflammation (e.g. fibrinogen, CC-16, CRP, MMP8, MMP9, SP-D, and CXCL-8), quality
      of life questionnaire, and population pharmacokinetics parameters of SB-656933
