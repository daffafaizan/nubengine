      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by RECIST v1.1 of advanced
      hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients treated with TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody)
      and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ORR as determined by the immune related Response Criteria (irRC),
      duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response of study participants.

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of treated patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1
      binding antibody) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 9 weeks.
