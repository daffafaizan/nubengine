      as most interested in those children who have never been fed prior to their cardiac surgery.
      The medical charts will be reviewed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston Hospital.
      Approximately 90 charts will be reviewed for newborns undergoing surgery in the 2003 calendar

      The factors that will be reviewed are pre-op feeding regimen, diagnosis, single vs two
      ventricle, open vs closed heart procedure, length of bypass, level of hypothermia,
      circulatory arrest, presence of TEE probe and post-op ventilation.
