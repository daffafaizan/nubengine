      turnover in patients prescribed Aromatase Inhibitors. However, there are no studies to date
      that prospectively quantify the impact of Aromatase inhibitors on bone quality. Furthermore,
      the actual effects and clinical significance of adjuvant chemotherapy and supportive
      medications on bone quality in women with breast carcinoma is unknown. The current study
      proposes to prospectively assess novel skeletal health outcomes, namely trabecular structure
      (connectivity, hole size) and bone geometry (bone area, cortical thickness) among women with
      breast cancer being treated with Anastrozole. Not only will the current study provide a
      better understanding of the changes in bone quality and muscle mass after Anastrozole
      treatment, it will provide important information about the development of secondary skeletal
      complications in this population. Therefore, the potential to collect data prospectively from
      a cohort of individuals with breast cancer being treated with Anastrozole represents an
      important step to advance knowledge in this area. Also, by examining bone quality and
      secondary complications in a diverse cohort of patients who vary with respect to radiation
      therapy, chemotherapy and additional medications, we can begin to identify patterns of
      musculoskeletal change and predictors of these changes.
