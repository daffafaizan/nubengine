      endosurgical system to perform endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric/colon cancer
      in human. The MASTER is a master-and-slave robotic system that is deployed through a standard
      dual-channel therapeutic endoscope. It introduces robotic control of endoscopic surgical
      tools and tasks through an ergonomic human-machine interface built around the original
      endoscopic paradigm. In doing so, it separates control of instrumental motion from that of
      endoscopic movement such that surgical tasks may be independently executed by a second
      operator via a human-machine interface. With it, endoscopically deployed instruments can be
      independently controlled, allowing thus bimanual coordination of effector instruments to
      facilitate actions such as retraction/exposure, traction/countertraction, approximation and
      dissection of tissue. Using the MASTER, operational dexterity is increased, thus making it
      easier for the operator to perform the ESD procedure as compared with using the conventional
      endoscope. This study will measure the ease of using the MASTER to perform the various
      surgical tasks involved in the ESD procedure, the time taken to perform the procedure, and
      record complications, if any, occurred during and after the procedure.
