    
      Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline
      visit, the subject will return for the first infusion. Subsequent treatments will occur
      weekly for the first 8 infusions, followed by 4 infusion that occur 2 weeks apart. The total
      number of infusions will be 12.

      On each of these visits, the subject will receive one allogeneic HB-adMSC infusion of 200
      million (2 x 10^8 cells) total cells suspended in 250 mL normal saline for IV infusion. Every
      infusion visit will include the following procedures:

        1. Review of medical history,

        2. Complete Physical exam (Week 1, 4, 10, 20, and 52),

        3. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),

        4. Weight measurement

        5. A verification of patient consent will be verbally performed

        6. *When applicable (Week 4, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 52): A urine and blood sample for clinical
           labs including:

             -  CBC with diff.,

             -  CMP,

             -  Coagulation Panel,

             -  TNF-a

             -  IL-6

             -  CA 19-9

             -  LDH

        7. The HB-adMSC infusion will be given via IV.

        8. The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 2hr after infusion.

        9. 24-hour telephone assessment for adverse events

       10. Video Documentation

      Vital signs will be continuously monitored during the infusion and recorded at 15 minutes
      intervals during the first hour. Vital signs will be recorded at the end of the infusion and
      every 30 minutes x 2 hours or more frequently if clinically indicated. The subject will be
      contacted by telephone 24hr. after the infusion visit to determine if any adverse events have
      occurred.

      *Please note that blood and urine sample during the intervention period will only be required
      for the visits corresponding to weeks 4, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 52. During these visits, these
      samples will always be taken before the infusion is started. Refer to Table 1. Schedule of
      assessments for more details.

      Follow-up Visits week 4,7, 10, 14, 20, and 52

      The subject will undergo the following procedures at each follow-up visit without infusion:

        1. Review and update medical history,

        2. Update concomitant medications list

        3. Weight

        4. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),

        5. Complete physical exam (Week 1, 4, 10, 20, and 52)

        6. A urine and blood sample for clinical labs including:

             -  CBC with diff.,

             -  CMP,

             -  Coagulation Panel,

             -  TNF-a

             -  IL-6

             -  CA 19-9

             -  LDH

        7. Adverse event monitoring.

      In addition, visits 13 and 14 (week 20 and 52) will include CT Scans of the chest, abdomen
      and pelvis. This procedure could be done up to 7 days before or after the actual visit day,
      depending on availability and schedule of the imaging center. If a CT Scan has been done as
      standard of care within 30 days of these visits, it would meet the requirement for this
      assessment.
