      the difficulty associated with performing clinical trials in this field.

      Gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil and S-1, are routinely used for
      BTC chemotherapy. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines published in 2009 recommend either gemcitabine-based
      or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy or clinical trials for first-line treatment.
