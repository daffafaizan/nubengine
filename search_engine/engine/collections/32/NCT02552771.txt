      (MVP), a condition wherein the mitral valve does not close properly. One common strategy for
      mitral valve repair is leaflet resection, which involves removing part of one or both of the
      mitral leaflets that flop or bulge back (prolapse). Another strategy is leaflet preservation,
      which involves placing man-made fibers (sutures) to more securely connect the mitral leaflets
      to the papillary muscles (muscles located in the ventricle). While both strategies are
      routinely used and lead to successful mitral valve repair, there is no clear evidence as to
      whether one strategy is better than the other in terms of long term outcome. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if one repair strategy (leaflet resection versus leaflet
      preservation) leads to better longer term patient outcomes. A total of 88 patients from 6
      Canadian centres will be randomly assigned to one of the two strategies. The primary outcome
      will be functional mitral stenosis (MS) as assessed by 12-month mean mitral valve pressure
      gradient at peak exercise.
