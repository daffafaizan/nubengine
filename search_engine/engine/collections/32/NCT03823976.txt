      risk to a patient. In situation where a patient does not tolerate dental treatment, and
      consequently general anaethesia (GA) is used, an intellectually disabled (ID) patient with a
      condition that is routinely managed in the general population is exposed to significantly
      higher medical risk. Quality of oral health care delivery for adults with ID is considered
      inadequate and in need of constant improvement. Therefore, the present study aims to analyse
      the type of dental treatment performed in GA and factors affecting the treatment. By its
      design this is an observational, epidemiological, retrospective study. A representative
      sample of the target population is realised by the assessment of approximately n=250 ID
      adults treated at the Dental Clinic of Vojvodina. A number of parameters such as severity of
      ID, the presence of concomitant conditions, living arrangements, medical diagnoses, physical
      status according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification (ASA score),
      history of previous surgical/GA treatments and injuries/trauma, frequency of dental visits,
      procedures that were conducted in GA and during routine dental treatment (RDT), dental status
      including DMFT (decay, missed, filled teeth index) and total number of extracted teeth and
      data about oral rehabilitation.The use of GA emphasizes the inequalities in persons with ID,
      since it is always more radical compared to RDT. It is a frequent occurrence that with the
      use of GA only prevention of complications and pain relief are accomplished, resulting in a
      multiple teeth extractions. This approach inevitably leads to further dysfunctions in
      cranio-facial system, affecting all aspects of everyday life in persons with ID.
