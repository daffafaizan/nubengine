    
      Intra-amniotic infection (IAI) is an acute bacterial infection of the amniotic fluid and
      intrauterine contents during pregnancy and occurs in 4% to 10% of all deliveries (Newton,
      ER., 1993. Newton, ER, et al., 1989. Soper, DE, et al., 1989). IAI is an important cause of
      maternal and neonatal morbidity. Identifying and appropriately treating women with IAI is,
      therefore, a major obstetrical challenge.

      Intrauterine infection may occur early in pregnancy and remain undetected for a prolonged
      period, thus exposing the fetus to the effects of infection/inflammation for a considerable
      period. Ideally, an early diagnosis of IAI is important to allow timely treatment and
      intervention. Unfortunately, the early diagnosis is difficult because the clinical signs and
      symptoms of IAI may occur late in the course of the infection and are neither sensitive nor
      specific. Therefore, to avoid a delay in diagnosis a high degree of suspicion and the
      appropriate use of adjunctive laboratory tests are warranted.
