      I. To determine the ability of indocyanine green (indocyanine green solution) (ICG) to
      highlight pelvic lymphatic tissue with fluorescence during robot assisted radical
      prostatectomy using near infrared fluorescence (diffuse optical imaging).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of this technique to improve lymph node yield, providing a
      potential therapeutic benefit to these patients by removing additional lymph nodes that may
      otherwise have been missed.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green transperineally and undergo diffuse optical imaging during
      robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection using
      the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-2 weeks.
