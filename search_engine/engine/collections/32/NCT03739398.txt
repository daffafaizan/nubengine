      enlarged pores, hyperhidrosis as well as wrinkles. Unlike conventional treatments, FMR
      equipment has the advantage of a short recovery time after treatment because it minimizes
      damage to the epidermis because the insulated microspheres penetrate the skin and generate
      high frequency only at the end of the microspheres.

      The Thulium laser with 1,927nm wavelength is a device that effectively removes various skin
      diseases present in the epidermis while minimizing the side effects such as scarring and
      pigmentation because it induces thermal damage to the only skin surface compared to
      conventional laser equipment. In recent years, not only skin lesions on the epidermis but
      also pigment disease and wrinkles have been reported to have a good effect.

      In this study, investigator investigated the effect and stability of combined treatment of
      Thulium laser with 1,927nm wavelength in addition to FMR equipment which has already proven
      to be effective in improving skin aging.
