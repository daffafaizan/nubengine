      Adding the drug cilostazol to the standard care may improve outcomes after surgery. The blood
      within the brain following aneurysmal hemorrhage can have harmful effects on the blood
      vessels causing them to narrow and thus decrease blood flow; this process is called
      vasospasm. Decreased blood flow in the brain can lead to more damage. Delayed cerebral
      ischemia is a complication which is believed to be a consequence of reduced blood flow to the
      brain following this type of hemorrhage. Cilostazol opens blood vessels and reduces the
      formation of blood clots. The standard treatment of these hemorrhages currently involves the
      use of nimodipine which also relaxes blood vessels and allows blood to flow more freely. The
      combination of these two drugs cilostazol and nimodipine may improve neurologic outcomes
      after surgery.
