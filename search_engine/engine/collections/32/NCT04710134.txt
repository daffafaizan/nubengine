      maintaining eosinophil homeostasis, have been developed as adjunct therapy for severe asthma
      with an eosinophilic phenotype. Reslizumab/Cinqair is an approved/marketed product
      administered monthly by intravenous to severe eosinophilic asthmatics at 3mg/kg. However some
      patients do exhibit sputum eosinophilia at this dosage. We are investigating whether those
      that receive 3mg/kg that have persistent sputum eosinophils would benefit at a higher dose of
      4mg/kg and those that still exhibit sputum eosinophils at this elevated dose would show
      improvement at 5mg/kg.

      The overall aim of this study is to determine whether dose escalation of reslizumab can
      ameliorate sputum eosinophilia in severe asthmatics who have persistent sputum eosinophilia
      despite treatment with reslizumab at the standard dose.
