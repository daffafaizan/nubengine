      percutaneous coronary revascularization, with good results. The advantages of the radial
      compared with femoral access are related to a lower incidence of vascular complications. The
      radial access has also inconveniences such as a less predictable anatomy which can make the
      procedure difficult and prolong the time required.The patients with ST elevation myocardial
      infarction have an increased risk of vascular complications after interventional procedures
      because previous antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy.On the other hand, the time and
      success of the procedure are significant prognostic issues.In this sitting, the radial
      approach might reduce vascular complications and increase other cardiovascular events when
      comparing with the classical femoral access. For this reason, the purpose of the study is to
      compare both arterial access in terms of efficacy and security and to quantify the
      consequences of the advantages and drawbacks of both.
