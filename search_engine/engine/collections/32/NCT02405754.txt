      been evaluated in previous observational studies, there are limited data regarding how
      primary care clinicians are using the results of the test in the care and management of
      patients with symptoms suggestive of angina in the African-America patient population. This
      retrospective study is designed to examine the relationship between the Corus CAD (ASGES)
      score and patterns of care regarding cardiology referral or further cardiac diagnostic
      testing in an African-American patient population single-center site.

      This is a retrospective study, designed to be conducted at a single-center in the US. The
      study will conduct a one-time data abstraction from approximately 500 patient medical charts
      who received Corus CAD (ASGES) testing, by order of the Principal Investigator. Limited
      demographic data and patient data pertaining to cardiology referral or advanced diagnostic
      testing will be collected. All data will be collected anonymously. IRB approval will be
      requested with a waiver of informed consent, as no identifying information will be collected.

      This retrospective study is designed to understand the patterns of care, including referrals
      for cardiac care and testing (including referrals to a cardiologist, exercise stress testing,
      cardiac computerized tomography angiography (CCTA), invasive cardiac angiography (ICA))
      within an African-American patient population.
