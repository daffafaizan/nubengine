      growing problem among older Americans, especially women. These organisms are relatively
      resistant to antituberculous medications and frequently persist or recur. In patients with
      disseminated infections, interferon gamma has been shown to be a critical cytokine in the
      resistance to and therapy of these infections. Previous experience with injected interferon
      gamma has been relatively disappointing, with clinical response rates in conventional
      therapy-refractory patients of about 20%. Aerosol administration of interferon gamma has been
      shown to rapidly convert sputum smears to negative in multidrug resistant tuberculosis and in
      one case of MAC infection. However, in these short-term experiments, cultures have remained
      positive and patients have had clinical relapse. In addition, aerosol administration of
      interferon gamma has significantly less systemic activation and side effects than does
      systemic administration. Therefore, we propose to administer interferon gamma by aerosol into
      the lungs of patients with MAC infection that has persisted despite adequate conventional
      therapy. This aerosol will be delivered 3 times weekly by the patient. This trial is
      randomized and double blinded. The period of therapy is 48 weeks and the follow up is another
      48 weeks. All patients must be on conventional therapy at the same time and have organisms
      that are macrolide sensitive. Screening and treatment will be conducted at the NIH Clinical
      Center as well as multiple collaborative sites. This study should clarify the therapeutic
      role for aerosolized interferon gamma in the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial
      infections.
