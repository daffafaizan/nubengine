      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of octreotide vs placebo, in terms of extending the
           time-to-paracentesis, in patients with cancer-related symptomatic malignant ascites.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the number of paracenteses in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Determine the toxicity of octreotide in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to anticipated ongoing chemotherapy (yes vs no), frequency of prior
      paracentesis (never vs other), and prior chemotherapy (never vs only first-line chemotherapy
      vs second-line chemotherapy vs other). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive octreotide subcutaneously (SC) once on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC once on day 1. In both arms, treatment with
           intramuscular octreotide or placebo repeats monthly for up to 2 years in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and then monthly for up to 2 years during
      study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 2 years.
