      sleep-tracking performance of the Medical Health Tag device developed by Spire Health. The
      step data will be evaluated in a controlled environment over a range of approximately 1.0-2.5
      miles per hour (i.e., slow to moderate walking) via Reference manual counting and pedometer.
      The sleep data will be evaluated in a natural environment (i.e., the participant's daily life
      and home) over one afternoon and night with Reference sleep/wake data.
