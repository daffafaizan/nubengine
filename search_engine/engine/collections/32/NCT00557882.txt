      correction of pelvic support problems. However, conventional pelvic reconstructive surgeries
      have been associated with a 20-30% prolapse recurrence rate. The anterior vaginal wall is the
      site most often recognized as the area of vaginal prolapse recurrence. Minimally invasive
      surgical procedures using mesh have rapidly developed in the field of pelvic floor
      reconstruction in an attempt to improve surgical cure rates. Unfortunately, safety and
      efficacy data have lagged behind the technical advancements.

      This trial will randomize women with advanced anterior wall prolapse to two treatment arms:
      vaginal reconstructive surgery with mesh and vaginal reconstructive surgery without mesh. The
      primary outcome is cure of anterior wall prolapse at one year. Secondary outcomes are cure of
      apical and posterior wall prolapse, quality-of-life measures and complication rates. Patients
      will be approached for recruitment only after they have made the decision to undergo vaginal
      surgery for anterior prolapse. The patient and examiner will be blinded to the surgical
      treatment assignment. Interim measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted
      three months post-operatively. Additional follow-up will be conducted at one-year intervals
      subsequent to the expected one-year endpoint.
