      combined with mononitrates are the method of choice in secondary prophylaxis of esophageal
      variceal bleeding. However, studies have shown that this therapy is effective only in 20-50%
      of the patients, documented by a significant drop of the portal pressure with hepatic venous
      pressure (HVPG) measurements. The best method for secondary prevention in this high risk
      patient cohort is not known so far. In this randomized controlled study we hypothesise, that
      a group of 20 vs 20 patients is large enough to discriminate efficacy of prevention of
      rebleeding in patients receiving TIPS implantation or endoscopic band ligation in patients
      non responding to medical therapy as secondary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding.
