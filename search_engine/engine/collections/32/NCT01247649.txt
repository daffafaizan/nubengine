      network analyzer (VNA), which monitor blood glucose through propriety sensors.Dielectric
      spectroscopy is an analytical technique whereby the electromagnetic radiation is affected by
      the electric dipole moment of the sample it interacts with. This method utilizes the change
      in the impedance of the antenna to measure the change in the relaxation processes of the
      interrogated medium.

      The VNA (vector network analyzer) , which emits non irradiating electromagnetic waves in very
      low power emission, is connected via standard coaxial cables to propriety sensors that are
      attached to the patient skin without direct contact.

      Study objective:

      To evaluate the feasibility of a new noninvasive method to measure continuous glucose values
      using electromagnetic radiation.The glucose values generated by the investigational non
      invasive devise will be compared to glucose reading of a reference devise, which measure
      blood glucose levels at the subcutaneous tissue.

      During the study we will evaluate the reliability of the study device under the conditions of
      alter blood glucose values in the range of 50-400 mg/dl:
