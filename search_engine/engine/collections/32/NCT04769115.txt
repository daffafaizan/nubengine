      among older populations. There are currently 400 million diabetics worldwide, with 30 million
      diagnosed diabetics living in the US.

      The standard of care today in treating complications of diabetes is a reactive one: doctors
      often wait for a problem to occur and then treat it. This waiting approach results in high
      medical expenses and an increase in pain for patients.

      This study is testing a predictive technology system (investigational bluetooth-enabled
      thermometer and mobile app) to see if it can identify potential foot complications before the
      damage becomes irreversible. The thermometer being used in this study is the Exergen
      DermaTemp (DT) Thermometer. Participants will check the temperature of each foot daily for a
      period of three months. These results will sync directly from the thermometer to the mobile
      app.

      Patients are notified when temperature levels indicate a potential complication that may lead
      to a developing foot ulcer. The study doctor is available to determine if any trauma or
      vascular obstruction has occurred and will follow up with the participant.
