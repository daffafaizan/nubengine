      schizophrenia. The study has two aims. First, it will examine the impact of a multimedia
      DVD-based informed consent process on the ability of participants to make decisions regarding
      participation in research, both after the initial presentation of information and after 1
      month. Second, it will examine the association between participant personal characteristics
      and the benefit derived from the DVD-based informed consent process.

      Participants with schizophrenia and a normal comparison group will participate in either a
      routinely used informed consent procedure or an enhanced, DVD-based informed consent
      procedure. The outcome measure, comprehension of the consent materials, including
      understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the study, will be assessed in
      each group. It is expected that the normal control group will reach the requisite level of
      comprehension faster than the schizophrenia group.
