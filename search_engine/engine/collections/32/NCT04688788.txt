      Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either rituximab or ocrelizumab. The study
      duration is 24 months, and patients can continue in an extension phase for additional 36
      month. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients without new or enlarging T2 white
      matter lesions on brain MRI scans from month 6 to month 24, which will be assessed by
      radiologists blinded to the treatments status. The study will evaluate a number of efficacy
      and safety endpoints using clinical, MRI, routine blood samples and research biomarkers.
