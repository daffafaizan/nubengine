      infected patients and common treatments, including ribavirin, interferon and
      methylprednisolone, lack evidence. Although drugs with anti- coronavirus (CoV) activities
      have been identified, as yet no anti- MERs- CoV drug has been approved and a vaccine has yet
      to be developed. Previous reports on other viral infections including SARS have suggested
      that convalescent plasma or serum is effective where no other treatment is available or in an
      emergency. A recently completed systematic review and meta-analysis by the University of
      Nottingham - World Health Organization Collaborating Center indicates that convalescent
      plasma therapy may be the most promising near-term therapy patients with for MERS- CoV
      infection. In this study, investigators will study the pharmacokinetics of immunoglobulin in
      response to convalescent plasma administration in order to inform a much larger study which
      will investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma. Plasma will be collected from patients
      who recently recovered from MERS-CoV, Health Care Workers who had potential exposure and are
      tested for anti MERS-CoV serology and RT-PCR after obtaining their consent. This convalescent
      plasma will be stored in the blood bank as per their policies and procedures. Patients with
      MERS-CoV positive after meeting the eligibility criteria will receive 2 units of convalescent
      plasma . Clinical data as well as the standard laboratory studies will be collected at
      baseline, 30 mins after first dose, 30 mins after second dose, day 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 of
      hospital stay after enrollment.
