      malignancies. Umbilical cord blood is a source of stem cells for transplantation in patients
      with no related donor. However, in adults, the number of stem cells in a single unit, may be
      too low to allow engraftment, and the time to engraftment may be prolonged, increasing the
      risks of the transplant. In this study, we expand part of the cord blood unit, in the lab,
      trying to increase unit size, such that it would be suitable for adults, and would allow safe
      engraftment.
