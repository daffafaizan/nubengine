    
      -  Principal Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of
           lomustine to increase the overall survival by adding lomustine to induction and
           post-remission chemotherapy.

        -  Secondary Objectives:

             -  To assess the ability of lomustine to increase the CR rate.

             -  To assess the ability of lomustine to increase the event-free survival.

             -  To evaluate the toxicity and side-effects of lomustine.

             -  To evaluate the feasibility of reduced conditioning allogeneic transplantation
                *between 60 and 65 years old.

             -  To evaluate prognostic factors.

             -  To evaluate QOL in elderly.

        -  Study design: Parallel

        -  Study plan:

             -  Induction therapy: Patients will be randomized to receive idarubicin (5d) plus
                cytarabine or the same drugs plus lomustine, the latter given at the dose of 200
                mg/m2 orally at day 1.

             -  Consolidation therapy: After completing induction treatment, patients who are in
                complete remission will receive a course of consolidation therapy with idarubicin
                (3d) and subcutaneous cytarabine.

             -  Maintenance therapy: In all patients with persisting CR one month after completing
                consolidation: six courses of monthly combination chemotherapy (idarubicin (1d) and
                subcutaneous cytarabine) and then a continuous regimen of methotrexate and
                6-mercaptopurine, for 6 months.

             -  Allogeneic transplantation: Patients between 60 and 65 years old with a full
                matched donor will receive after consolidation (if still in CR) an alloBMT with a
                reduced conditioning regimen of Fludarabine (3d) and TBI (2Gy).
