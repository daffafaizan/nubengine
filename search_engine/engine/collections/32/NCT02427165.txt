    
      A seven way crossover study to investigate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of inhaled RPL554 compared to salbutamol and placebo in patients with mild to
      moderate chronic asthma.

      Salbutamol is a marketed beta-2 agonist typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any
      cause, allergen asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      but has associated dose-related systemic side effects.

      RPL554 is a dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitor that has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory
      actions and also the potential to stimulate increases in mucociliary clearance via its proven
      ability to activate CFTR. Four different doses of RPL554 will be compared with placebo and a
      two doses of salbutamol as benchmarks for bronchodilation and systemic side effects.
