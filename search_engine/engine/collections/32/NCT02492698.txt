      between 20 and 65 years, nondiabetic (fasting blood glucose <126 mg/dL and 2-hour blood
      glucose <200 mg/dL), and overweight (25 kg/m2 â‰¤ body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m2). Over a 12
      week test period, the probiotic group consumed 2 g of powder twice a day containing L.

      without probiotics for 12 weeks.
