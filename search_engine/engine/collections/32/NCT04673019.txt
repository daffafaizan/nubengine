      trial in which immediate treatment group participants receive the Nurse AMIE intervention in
      full for 3 months, then continue Nurse AMIE (without navigation) for 3 months, while the
      delayed intervention group will not receive an intervention for 3 months, followed by
      receiving the Nurse AMIE full intervention with navigation for 3 months. The primary
      comparisons will be between the immediate treatment and delayed treatment groups over the
      first 3 months.

      Intervention. Participants will all receive an Amazon Echo Show device, WiFi connection (if
      patients do not already have one), pedometer, and resistance bands. Each day, the participant
      will open the Nurse AMIE for Echo Show, which will result in the daily greeting. After the
      greeting, participants will be asked to provide a verbal rating of their symptoms (e.g.,
      pain, sleep, fatigue, and distress).

      After completing the symptom survey, Nurse AMIE will use an algorithm to discern which of the
      intervention modules to offer as assistance for the reported symptoms. These interventions
      include exercise, guided relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and soothing music. These
      guideline-based interventions are provided as audio files or YouTube-style videos. In
      addition, Nurse AMIE provides a daily educational nutrition tip as well as recipes designed
      to be of interest to people undergoing chemotherapy.

      Each week, the participant will receive a phone call from the study navigator. This navigator
      will monitor symptom ratings daily and will discuss symptoms, interventions, and step goals
      with the participant each week.
