      can negatively affect both mental and physical functioning, thereby complicating the
      rehabilitation process. Although much research has targeted the effects of long-term
      cognitive impairment after a stroke, very little research has been done to examine the
      incidence and course of cognitive impairment during the first three months following a
      stroke. These first three months are the most important in terms of regaining function.
      Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been beneficial to both sufferers of vascular dementia
      and Alzheimer's disease. They may also be a useful pharmacologic intervention to enhance
      post-stroke rehabilitation. This study will compare the effectiveness of two
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, galantamine and donepezil, in improving cognitive function
      and overall rehabilitation in elderly stroke survivors.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either galantamine
      or donepezil for 12 weeks. Participants assigned to receive galantamine will receive 4 mg
      twice a day for 4 weeks, 8 mg twice a day for the next 4 weeks, and 12 mg twice a day for the
      remainder of the study. Participants assigned to receive donepezil will receive 5 mg twice a
      day for 6 weeks, and then 10 mg twice a day for the next 6 weeks. Functional independence
      will be measured at baseline and Weeks 2 and 12. In addition, a pre-stroke level of
      functional independence will be obtained through a structured interview with participants and
      their families. Participants will also be monitored for signs of depression and medication
      side effects throughout the study.
