    
      The aim of this randomized trial is to examine whether Youth Compass plus enhances
      adolescents' (a) psychological skills, particularly with respect to finding a purpose, and
      psychological flexibility and adaptation skills as the ACT process outcomes; (b) career
      preparation and psychological well-being as the proximal outcomes; and (c) the initiation of
      upper secondary education studies and engagement in upper secondary education as the distal
      outcomes.

      In addition, our aim is to investigate the ACT processes and mediating mechanisms of the
      Youth Compass plus program, and to explore the extent to which the effectiveness of the Youth
      Compass plus varies according to the differences in various individual and contextual
      factors.

      H1: The study expects that the Youth Compass plus is more effective than no intervention.
      Youth Compass plus is expected to promote ACT proximal youth outcomes, as well as the youth
      distal outcomes.

      H2: In addition, the study expects that the Youth Compass plus will promote the distal
      outcomes through enhancing the ACT process outcomes and the proximal outcomes.

      H3: The study expects that Youth Compass plus is more effective for those adolescents who
      accept the intervention well, take part intensively and diversely in different exercises, as
      well as among the adolescents who are initially highly emotionally reactive.
