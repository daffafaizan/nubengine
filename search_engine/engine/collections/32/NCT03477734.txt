    
      The clinical study is intended to establish the efficacy and safety of the CardiacSense1
      wearable device intended to monitor and detect heart arrhythmia, specifically atrial
      fibrillation (A-Fib). Study design as as follows:

      100 subjects, 50 (at least 30% of each gender) with A-fib and 50 without (at least 30% of
      each gender).

      All subjects will be measured during at least 24 hours. Primary endpoint - A-Fib detection
      Control: Holter device will be the reference

      For PPG analysis, each one hour will be considered as an event:

      If A-Fib is present for more than accumulated 5 minutes in that specific hour then it shall
      be considered an "A-Fib hour" If A-fib was present for less than accumulated 5 minutes then
      it shall be considered a "Non-A-Fib hour".

      For ECG analysis, each measurement of between 1-3 minutes will be considered an event.

      If A-Fib is present at that specific measurement, then it shall be considered an "A-Fib
      event" If A-fib was not present at that specific measurement, then it shall be considered a
      "Non-A-Fib hour".

      Sensitivity (true positive) is defined as the percentage of Holter defined "A-fib
      hours"/"A-Fib event" found by PPG/ECG.

      The asked sensitivity is 90%. Specificity (true negative) is defined as the percentage of
      Holter defined "Non-A-fib hours"/"A-Fib event" found by PPG/ECG. The required specificity is
      90%.
