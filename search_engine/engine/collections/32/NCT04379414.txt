    
      This is a prospective, interventional cohort study with an embedded Phase II randomized
      controlled clinical trial with a parallel design.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, consent, enrolled,
           randomization into 1 of 4 groups.

        -  The study interventions including the (web-based portal ) YES portal use including
           regular assessments, serial outcome surveys, medical record review, and tumor/blood
           collection.

        -  The YES portal is a web-based portal designed for access by smartphone, tablet, or
           laptop/desktop. The portal is designed to help monitor cancer related issues and to
           share self-management information and resources to those interested in particular issues
           or who score high enough on the symptom measures designed to assess and track noticeable
           symptoms (and thus might benefit from such), as well as to share potential research
           opportunities when available. The portal is also designed to create a community among
           participants through the yeschat.org discussion board

        -  Participants will be in this research study for up to 5 years with the option to opt out
           of portal assessment component follow-up after only 1 year.

        -  It is expected that about 400 people will take part in this research study
