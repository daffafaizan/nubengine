      that collects information on demographic data, including usual adult height and weight, and
      history of DM in first-degree relatives. Existing medical conditions, including DM, duration
      of these medical problems, and current medications will also be inquired. The database will
      also include details of weight measured at the time of recruitment and body mass index (BMI),
      calculated as weight (kg)/height2 (m2). All studied patients will have FBG levels measured.
      Patients receiving prescription antidiabetic medications for previously diagnosed DM will be
      classified as having DM regardless of their FBG value. Among patients not reporting treatment
      for DM, classification of DM status will be based on the American Diabetes Association
      criteria; patients will be classified as having DM if the FBG level is ≧126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L),
      as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) if their FBG is between 100 and 125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9
      mmol/L), and as having normal fasting glucose (NFG) if their FBG value is ≦99 mg/dL (5.5
      mmol/L).

      After withdrawal of anti-diabetic medications for 12 h, the patients were asked to fast
      overnight for 12 h, then were given 200 ml of formula (220kcal, 14g of protein, 28 g of
      carbohydrates, and 5 g of fat; Modifast, Stocksund, Sweden) within 10 min through a NG tube
      on post-operative day 5 (proximal feeding group [PFG]) and a jejunostomy feeding tube (distal
      feeding group [DFG]) on post-operative day 6. The below parameter will be checked, including

        1. HOMA insulin resistance assessment (HOMA-IR)

        2. GLP-1

        3. GIP

        4. C-peptide

        5. Insulin

        6. Glucose
