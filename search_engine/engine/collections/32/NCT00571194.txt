      pediatric and adolescent subjects ranging from 12 months to 16 years of age who are on
      dialysis. The study group will be comprised of healthy children receiving continuous cycling
      peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Pravastatin dosing will be 10 mg in all subjects. Blood, urine,
      and dialysate samples will be obtained over a 24-hour period post-dose for measurement of
      pravastatin concentrations. Safety evaluations will include adverse events (AEs), physical
      examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.
