      index (ANI) is an analgesia/nociception balance monitoring tool computed from high frequency
      heart rate variability analysis, and developed by MetroDoloris (Lille, France). Its
      sensitivity to detect noxious stimulus was studied in several studies. However, its
      specificity is not established in particular in the presence of factors influencing autonomic
      nervous system other than analgesia/nociception balance. In the context of anaesthesia, one
      of the most relevant factor is hypovolemia. This study aims to assess the effect of blood
      volume variations on ANI under general anaesthesia, independently of analgesia/nociception
      balance status. Variations of systemic venous return (SVR) (cardiac preload), which reflects
      blood volume status, will be induced by changes of operating table slope, from head-down tilt
      (Trendelenburg), with increased SVR, to head-up tilt position, with decreased SVR. Variations
      of SVR will be attested by changes in the arterial pulse pressure variation, a
      well-established indice of preload responsiveness in the mechanically ventilated
      anaesthetized patient.
