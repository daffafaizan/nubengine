      Clinical hemodialysis takes place three times a week and is dependent on adequate
      anticoagulation throughout the three to four hour procedure. Infection is one of the most
      common causes of death for patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis (25%).

      Xigris (drotrecogin alfa activated) is a recombinant form of human activated protein C and is
      successfully used for treatment of adult patients with severe sepsis. In addition to its
      fibrinolytic properties, drotrecogin alpha has both an anti-inflammatory effect, and an
      anti-coagulant effect. However, there are few safety and no efficacy data on the effect of
      Xigris in ESRD patients as an anticoagulant.
