      recently diagnosed diabetes (<1 year duration) who present with severe hyperglycemia (blood
      glucose 300-450 mg/dl) to the ED or other clinical settings and who do not need to be
      admitted.

      A combination of Saxagliptin+Metformin XR, could be a potential drug combination to be tested
      as an initial treatment in these circumstances compared to Glipizide XL which was shown to be
      effective in our previous study. We expect Saxagliptin to improve beta cell function and
      decrease glucagon levels as was shown for the DPP-IV class medications and in turn improve
      blood glucose levels, while Metformin XR may reduce insulin resistance and hepatic glucose
      output. Such discharge therapy may help to prevent deterioration into acute metabolic
      complications (DKA or hyperosmolar states) and avoid hospitalization. A high proportion of
      patients may achieve glycemic targets without significant hypoglycemia as measured by self
      glucose monitoring and objectively by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Such an
      easy regimen may safely bridge the time gap until patients will be seen by their providers.
