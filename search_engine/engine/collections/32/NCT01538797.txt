      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal in man.
      Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. The compound has been well
      tolerated in animal toxicity studies at doses in excess of the projected therapeutic dose in
      patients, and merits studies in healthy volunteers. Extrapolation from data obtained in
      animals suggests that a single oral dose of about 10mg of YF476 should compare favourably
      with an oral dose of 150mg of ranitidine in man with respect to effect on basal and
      food-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Therefore in the proposed study a range of doses of
      YF476 encompassing that dose will be studied; the exact dose of YF476 will be chosen on the
      basis of the previous study but the top dose will not exceed 100mg. 24-hour ambulatory
      gastric pH will be monitored via an intragastric pH electrode (7-10). Although there is
      variability between subjects with respect to the effects of food and drug treatment on
      gastric pH, the methodology for measurement of ambulatory gastric pH is robust.
