      receive each treatment for 6 weeks followed by a minimum 4-week wash-out period. During the
      peanut treatment, participants will consume one ounce per day (28 g) of peanuts as an evening
      snack. The control treatments will be an isocaloric higher carbohydrate snack consumed after
      the evening meal. Markers of glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and gut health
      will be assessed at the beginning and the end of each treatment period.
