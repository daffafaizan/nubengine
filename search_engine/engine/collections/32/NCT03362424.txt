      affects 20% of the population. Although arthroscopic repair leads to satisfactory clinical
      results, the retear rates varies from 4 to 94%. The main cause of failure after rotator cuff
      repair is not related to the material used, but to the tissue deficiency and the healing
      process between the tendon and the bone. After the intervention, the rotator cuff does not
      restore its original histological characteristics and its fixation occurs through scar tissue
      with lower biomechanical resistance. There are few clinical studies on the use of mesenchymal
      cells in rotator cuff repair,, with good results.

      The investigators will perform a randomized clinical study involving 44 patients, evaluating
      the effect of mesenchymal cells on rotator cuff repair. The primary outcome will be
      post-operative MRI tendon integrity and secondary outcomes clinical assessment by the UCLA
      and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scales and pain by visual analog scale (VAS).
