      patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect and high relapse rate of
      resection for patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria. Our
      previous prospective study also revealed that neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) seems to confer a survival benefit for resectable HCC. Recently, the results of our
      previous prospective study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion
      chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for HCC with large HCC.Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of resection
      plus neoadjuvant HAIC over resection alone.
