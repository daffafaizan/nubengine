      family history, emphasizing the importance of genetics in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.
      Till now, most genetic studies in osteoporosis have focused on the phenotype of BMD. However,
      areal BMD (bone quantity per unit bone area measured) does not provide information regarding
      bone distribution (between cortical and cancellous compartments) or bone microarchitecture
      (trabecular number, thickness, spacing and distribution) and cortical (thickness, porosity).
      We are planning to analyze the hereditary determinism of bone microarchitecture assessed non
      invasively with HR pQCT at the distal radius and the distal tibia in a case-control study
      with fractured and not fractured mothers and their daughters. Additionally, the role of the
      bone turnover, hormones involved in regulating bone metabolism , bone geometry measured at
      the proximal femur and bone strength estimated by finite element analysis (Î¼FE)in the
      hereditary determinism of bone fragility will be analyzed.
