      II. Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival of this patient
      population with this treatment regimen. III. Determine the safety of this treatment in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive CI-994 orally daily. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed for 30 days and then every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-63 patients will be accrued for this study.
