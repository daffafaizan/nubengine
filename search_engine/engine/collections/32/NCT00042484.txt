           household and air quality research of the CAAA project;

        -  identify and engage existing community groups and organizations interested in working on
           environmental issues important to their neighborhood and community in the hopes of
           creating an interorganizational network (I.N.);

        -  work with member group of the I.N. to organize, coordinate and conduct activities to
           reduce physical environmental threats related to asthma; and

        -  increase community awareness and knowledge of factors associated with the environment
