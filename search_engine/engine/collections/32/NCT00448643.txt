        -  Determine a recommended phase II dose of adjuvant whole-abdominal radiotherapy when
           administered with cisplatin in patients with optimally debulked stage III or IV
           carcinoma of the endometrium.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of whole-abdominal radiotherapy (WAR).

      Patients receive 3 courses of standard chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV and paclitaxel
      IV. Beginning within 6 weeks after completion of standard chemotherapy, patients receive
      cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and undergo a single fraction of WAR on day 1. Treatment with
      cisplatin and WAR repeats weekly for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo standard vaginal brachytherapy beginning no earlier than the last course
      of standard chemotherapy or no later than 1 week before the start of cisplatin and WAR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of WAR until the recommended phase II dose
      (RPTD) is determined. The RPTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the RPTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
