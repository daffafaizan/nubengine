      is plunger-driven device that measures the uterine shape change that occurs with a
      contraction. Toco only reports the timing of contractions, not the contraction strength, and
      cannot distinguish between false and true labor.

      Our overarching goal is to validate our method of determining if a patient experiencing
      contractions is in true labor or false labor. We will accomplish this by applying new
      knowledge to an old technology - uterine EMG.

      This trial is based on our advanced understanding of how the uterus generates coordinated
      contractions without a pacemaker or dedicated electrical conduction pathways -
      mechanotransduction and intrauterine pressure - but also uses bioelectrical signaling for
      local tissue recruitment.

      The uterus emits bioelectrical signals with each contraction that can be detected by
      electromyography (EMG). To observe uterine bioelectrical signals, we created a novel EMG
      sensor, we call the "area sensor". This sensor is directional - capable of preferentially
      reporting muscle contractions from immediately below the sensor location.

      In this clinical trial we use multiple area sensors placed on the maternal abdomen to
      directly observe how well the regional contractions are synchronized. Our hypothesis to be
      tested is that highly synchronized contractions predicts true labor, unsynchronized predicts
      false labor.

      Patients with unclear labor status, or those in early labor will be studied. We will
      correlate the results of the synchronization analysis against the patient's progress over the
      ensuing 24 hours. These data will validate the ability to identify false and true labor using
      multichannel EMG and area sensors.
