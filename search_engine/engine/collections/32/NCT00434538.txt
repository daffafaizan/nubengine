      wound repair of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers. BST-DermOn is a sterile, non-toxic,
      nonpyrogenic wound dressing composed of an aqueous mixture of Chitosan, hydrochloric acid
      (HCl) and disodium beta-glycerol phosphate (β-GP) designed to address current wound healing
      needs. Chitosan has well documented wound healing properties as well as inherent haemostatic
      and bacteriostatic capabilities. BST-DermOn is used in conjunction with a defined standard of
      care and is applied over a prepared and debrided ulcer and covered with a semi-occlusive
      secondary dressing.

      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled study will enrol 130 type 1 or type 2
      diabetic subjects presenting with a Grade 1 or Grade 2 (Wagner classification) diabetic foot
      ulcer of 1-10cm² on the mid or forefoot. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      assigned to one of two groups:

        1. a control group that will receive the standard of care or

        2. a treatment group that will receive BST-DermOn.

      Treatments in both groups will be applied three (3) times a week for up to twenty consecutive
      weeks or until the study ulcer is closed. All subjects will be followed for safety and
      efficacy during treatment visits through a final evaluation visit. There will be a post
      treatment follow-up visit at 4 weeks post-closure for subjects with complete
      re-epithelialization.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BST-DermOn in providing
      a clinically significant advantage over the standard of care in the repair of diabetic foot
      ulcers.
