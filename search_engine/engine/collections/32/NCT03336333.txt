    
      This is a global phase 3, open label, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus bendamustine
      plus rituximab (B+R) in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), including participants without del(17p) [Cohort 1]
      and participants with del(17p) [Cohort 2 and Cohort 3]. Participants in Cohort 1 are
      randomized 1:1 to zanubrutinib (Arm A) or bendamustine plus rituximab (Arm B). Randomization
      will be stratified by age, Binet stage, immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV)
      mutational status, and geographic region. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive treatment
      with zanubrutinib. Participants in Cohort 3 will receive treatment with zanubrutinib and
      venetoclax.
