      are studying whether vancomycin in low doses will help prevent further CDI episodes and how
      this therapy impacts patients' gastrointestinal microbiome and composition.

      Patients with a history of past CDI who are receiving antibiotics for a non-CDI condition
      will be invited to participate. Approximately half of the participants will receive a
      low-dose capsule of vancomycin and half will receive a placebo. Participants will continue
      taking the vancomycin/placebo for 5 days after their prescribed antibiotics end.
