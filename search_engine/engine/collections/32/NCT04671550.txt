      Service of the Ophthalmologic Clinic of the ASST Sette Laghi University Hospital in Varese.

      All the patients enrolled in the study require a reliable (less than 15% of false positive or
      false negative and no more than 33% of loss of fixation) visual field examination (Humphrey
      SITA 24-2 or 30-2 SITA Standard) performed in the previous six months.

      All patients undergo a full ophthalmologic examination and verbally submitted a questionnaire
      designed by the authors of the paper (LL, SD, MD).

      The examination included Visual Acuity, refraction, slit lamp bio-microscospy, Goldmann's
      applanation tonometry, gonioscopy with four mirror lens, OCT RNFL and GCL imaging if
      necessary and re-evaluation of target IOP.

      The investigators use the two monocular visual fields to build an Integrated Visual Field
      which, according to D.P. Crabb papers, is an efficient surrogate to the Binocular Esterman
      Visual Field Test (EVFT). In short, each point in each monocular field is compared to its
      equivalent in the other eye, and the data, from the eye with the best sensitivity, are used.
      Locations are dichotomized into groups with sensitivity > 10 dB and < 10 dB, representing
      whether a patient would see or miss a point in the Esterman test, respectively. To match even
      better the IVF with the EVFT, 8 points of the inner 20Â° of the IVF were excluded since they
      have no direct equivalent in the EVFT.
