      randomized in the atorvastatin group and 15 in the placebo group. The women with PCOS
      participating in the study are required to use safe non-hormonal contraception during the
      medication.

      The study includes transvaginal ultrasonography, serum samples, oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) and intra venous tolerance test (IVGTT) before and after receiving 6 months
      atorvastatin 20mg/day therapy or placebo.

      Measurements for androgen levels, pituitary hormones, glucose, insulin and inflammatory
      markers are performed.
