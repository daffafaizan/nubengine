      Esketamine DPI, inhalation powder delivered via dry powder inhaler (DPI) in participants with
      TRD in the course of MDD. There are 3 study phases: Screening phase, a two weeks double-blind
      treatment phase and a 6-week follow-up phase. Participants are to be randomized in 1:1:1:1
      ratio to receive placebo or one of the three doses of Esketamine DPI. Participants from each
