    
      AbGn-107 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which targets an antigen (AG7 antigen) present
      in gastric, colorectal, pancreatic cancer or biliary cancer. This study is a standard 3 + 3
      dose escalation design with cohort expansion. AbGn-107 will be administered every 14 days
      (Q2W regimen) or 28 days (Q4W regimen) in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced,
      recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal, pancreatic adenocarcinoma or biliary cancer. The
      primary objectives of this study are to define the safety profile and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose regimen of AbGn-107, and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107.
