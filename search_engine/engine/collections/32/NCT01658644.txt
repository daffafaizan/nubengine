      one year. There will be 2 visits during the study. The first visit should last for 15 minutes
      (to get consent), the second visit should last somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes. The
      research team created a structured survey tool designed to characterize patients' knowledge
      of the names and roles of their health care professionals and understanding of their plan of
      care, which includes some semi-structured questions to assess patient satisfaction with their
      hospital experience. This survey tool will be administered to participating patients each
      weekday during the study period, prior to their discharge from the hospital.

      At the first visit, depending on whether the participant was previously assigned to group A,
      B or C, participants will be provided with a piece of paper listing the names of the members
      of their clinical care team (group B), or a piece of paper with a list of names and
      photographs of the members of their clinical care team (group C), or no paper at all (group
      A) which is currently the typical communication experience at the hospital.

      There is no compensation for participation in the study.
