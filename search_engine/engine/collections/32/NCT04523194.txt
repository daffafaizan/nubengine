      coronary angiograms, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and computed tomography angiograms
      (CTA) for future studies. About one thousand patients who underwent the above three imaging
      tests at Tsuchiura Kyodo General Hospital (TKGH) in Japan, will be included. The main goal of
      this collaboration is to create a resource to promote further understanding of the
      pathobiology of atherosclerosis through image analysis.
