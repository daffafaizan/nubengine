      I. Determine the tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and lowest biologically active dose of
      imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab in patients with advanced melanoma or other advanced
      cancers.

      II. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      III. Correlate clinical activity with inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor
      beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, flt-1, and markers of angiogenesis in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Correlate clinical activity with alterations in tumor perfusion as assessed by dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI and Doppler ultrasound in patients treated with this regimen.

      V. Correlate toxicity, clinical activity, and correlative endpoints with the steady-stage
      plasma concentration of imatinib mesylate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label study.

      PHASE I (closed to accrual as of 8/23/04): Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or
      twice daily on days 1-28 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 14. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab as in phase I at the MTD.
