      glycaemic index across the course of a day, and thus produce different glycaemic responses.
      The outcome variables will be blood glucose levels and subjective mood. The purpose of this
      study is to identify the appropriate times (according to glycaemic response) at which
      cognitive functioning should be tested. Importantly, this study is also the first step to
      characterizing glycaemic and cognitive profiles associated with food consumption over a whole
      day (breakfast, lunch, snack) rather than just one meal (e.g. breakfast), ranging from the
      most favourable (stable glucose regulation) to the least favourable (variability; many peaks
      and troughs).
