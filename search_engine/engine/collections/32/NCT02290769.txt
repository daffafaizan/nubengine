      Up to now there is no doubt about the efficacy of such a procedure. The use of long wire
      requires the help of another person behind primary operator. The use of short wire rapid
      exchange allows the primary operator to perform all the steps by himself. Time of cannulation
      is known to be directly associated to post ERCP pancreatitis.

      Aim of the study is to assess which length of guide wire allows the shorter cannulation time
      during primary ERCP. Post ERCP pancreatitis onset will be assessed for all patients
