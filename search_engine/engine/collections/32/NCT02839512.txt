    
      The Jejunal to Ileal Diversion procedure is an adaptation of a biliopancreatic diversion with
      duodenal switch, which is a surgical procedure used to treat metabolic syndrome conditions.
      The small bowel diversion of the jejunum into the ileum by creating a single anastomosis just
      beyond the ligament of Trietz will be studied. Up to 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled
      into the trial. Enrollment will stop once 10 subjects have undergone the Jejunal to Ileal
      Diversion procedure.
