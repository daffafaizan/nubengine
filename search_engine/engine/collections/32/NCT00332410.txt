      (CrCl < 50mL/min) receiving intravenous voriconazole experienced any adverse effects related
      to serum chemistries or other imaging studies of the kidney due to the potential accumulation
      of the vehicle cyclodextran. t has been previously shown by a large multi-centered,
      prospective, randomized study that voriconazole is superior to the then gold standard
      amphotericin B in the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis - a disease with
      significant morbidity and mortality. In patients with these infections who have severe renal
      insufficiency may be denied the best therapy due to the accumulation of a diluent with
      unknown clinical consequences. Qualifying and or quantifying these consequences are important
      to these patients so that potentially life-threatening therapy should not be unduly denied.
