      is surgical extirpation of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection to remove regional
      nodes at risk for spread. Via this treatment regimen, the investigators will be able to
      prospectively obtain tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection.

      The specific aims of this study are to compare gene expression between head and neck tumors
      with and without regional lymph node metastases, and to compare gene expression between head
      and neck tumor with and without distant metastases.
