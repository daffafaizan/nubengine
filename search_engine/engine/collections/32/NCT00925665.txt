      under general intubation with endotracheal intubation. Because of a limited mouth opening and
      swelling within the oral cavity, intubation can be difficult and sometimes impossible with
      conventional direct laryngoscopy. Therefore, alternative techniques are desirable. We want to
      compare the success rate of intubation in these patients using the Glidescope technique vs.
      conventional Macintosh technique.
