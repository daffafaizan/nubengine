    
      According to the "European Society of Hypertension International Protocol Revision 2010 for
      the Validation of Blood Pressure Measuring Devices in Adults", 33 patients have their blood
      pressure measured by two observers using parallel connected mercury sphygmomanometers,
      blinded from each other's result, and then by the supervisor using the tested device, NISSEI
      DM 3000. The measurements using the mercury sphygmomanometers are repeated 5 times and in
      between them, 4 measurements using the tested device take place. If the results of the
      comparison of these measurements according to the analysis required by the protocol, meet the
      required criteria, the device is regarded as "Pass", otherwise as "Fail".

      In this study, instead of consecutive, simultaneous measurements of the two mercury
      sphygmomanometers and tha tested device will be taking place. This will be so to exclude any
      inaccuracy due to blood pressure variability and because the tested device has a controllable
      deflation rate and allows simultaneous measurements with the mercury sphygmomanometers. In
      addition, the investigators will be performing 6 set of measurements instead of 4.
