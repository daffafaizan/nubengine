    
      The study will be conducted in 2 consecutive parts:

        -  Part 1 with 2 parallel cohorts (Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with
           anti-TNF-α Certolizumab (Cohort 1) and Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination
           with anti-TNF-α Infliximab (Cohort 2)). 6 patients will be included in each cohort.

        -  Part 2 (expansion phase) will then be scheduled after the most promising combination has
           been confirmed; the choice of the combination will be based on safety, efficacy, and PD
           data observed in both cohorts during the Part 1 of the study.
