        1. ECCA (échelle d'évaluation clinique des cicatrices d'acné) grading scale for
           quantitative grading of acne scars. Two blinded evaluators compare and rate the
           photograph using ECCA score.

        2. Patient Assessment Based on 1 to 10 point scale; 1- nil acne scars and 10- severe acne
           scar

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Postacne hyperpigmentation index (PAHPI)

           -Each of these 3 variables --size, intensity, and number of lesions is weighted and the
           summation of the weighted variables gives the total PAHPI score, ranging 6 to 22.

        2. Safety Assessment (This is an ordinal scale) i. Score of redness ii. Score of swelling
           iii. Score of oozing/crusting iv. Post peel hyperpigmentation v. Post peel scarring vi.
           Assessment based on patient and doctor global assessment (global assessment from 1 - 10)
