      long-term corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents. Thus lupus patients are
      immunocompromised patients, and the incidence of herpes zoster is higher than general
      population (asian population 32.5-91.4/1000 person-years vs general population 2.58-4.89/1000
      person-years). Patients with active SLE are more susceptible because they require stronger
      immunosuppressive therapy. However, even mild or even stable lupus patients are highly
      susceptible, and they account for about two-thirds of the events. In addition, herpes zoster
      may trigger lupus flare. A case-control study showed a close correlation between herpes
      zoster reactivation and the diagnosis of lupus, and our previous studies indicated that
      recent VZV infection was associated with increased risk of disease flares. The risk of virus
      reactivation limited the use of live-attenuated shingles vaccine in SLE patients, especially
      in whom with high dose of prednisone or immunosuppressants. Whether the introduction of
      recombinant herpes zoster could reduce the risk of zoster reactivation in lupus patients is
      to be explored in this study.
