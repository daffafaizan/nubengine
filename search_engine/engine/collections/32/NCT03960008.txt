      local treatment of their disease has become the standard of care in an effort to decrease
      dropout rates and as a means of reducing tumor recurrence after transplantation. For patients
      undergoing local regional therapy as a bridge to transplantation, trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly utilized treatment. However, the best modality
      for patients undergoing treatment as a bridge to transplantation is unclear. A newer strategy
      for the treatment of HCC is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). This study will
      compare SBRT to TACE as a bridging strategy for patients with HCC undergoing liver
      transplantation.
