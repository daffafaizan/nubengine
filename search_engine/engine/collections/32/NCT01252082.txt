    
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), the most common type of diabetes, is characterized by
      hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and associated complications. The classic major complications
      of diabetes are microangiopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, delayed
      wound healing, and periodontitis. There is an interacting, complex relationship between
      diabetes and periodontitis.Many studies have shown a greater incidence and a greater severity
      of periodontitis in diabetic patients.Meanwhile, a number of studies have suggested that
      periodontitis may actually be a risk factor for diabetic complications as well. This study is
      performed to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on metabolic control
      in DM2 patients.
