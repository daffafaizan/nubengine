      headache types, with limited evidence of its use for headaches related to mild traumatic
      brain injury (MTBI). No studies were found regarding OMT for headaches in patients with
      post-concussion syndrome (PCS), defined as symptom persistence >3 months after MTBI.

      Objective: To evaluate OMT for headaches in patients with PCS. Methods: A controlled pilot
      study was conducted of patients with PCS who presented to an outpatient interdisciplinary
      rehabilitation clinic. Twenty-six subjects with symptoms lasting >3 months were enrolled and
      were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 13) and a control group (n = 13). Primary
      outcome measures were 1) immediate change in headache scores with a visual analog scale (VAS)
      and 2) change in the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) between baseline and follow-up
      visits. 10 control participants completed HIT-6 between baseline and follow-up visits but did
      not receive OMT and did not complete VAS. After OMT, immediate VAS changes in treatment group
      and the improvements in HIT-6 scores for both groups between baseline and follow-up were
      analyzed for statistical significance.
