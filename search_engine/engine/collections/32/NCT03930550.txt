      whom the intubation is predicted to become difficult so that an awake
      flexible-video-scope-guided intubation is chosen.

      Infrared light is applied to the front of the neck of patients for awake flexible optical
      intubation. The infrared light can be detected by the camera at the tip of the flexible
      video-bronchoscope. The flexible scope is introduced into the trachea with or without the aid
      of the blinking infra red light and the ease of placement of the flexible scope is studied.
