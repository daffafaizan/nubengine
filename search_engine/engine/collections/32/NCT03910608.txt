      paired pulses can induce plasticity at cortical synapses, producing long-term potentiation
      (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) effect. The investigators use paired associative
      stimulation (PAS) protocols to target cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical networks
      (frontoparietal control pathway) by using different intervals between the paired pulses to
      explore the mechanism of cognitive deficits in methamphetamine addiction. The investigators
      hypothesize that different temporal sequences of cortical stimulation could produce
      facilitation or inhibition effect.
