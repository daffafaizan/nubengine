      leading to significant increases in hospital length of stay. The pathophysiology of delirium
      is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Disruption of circadian rhythms, with
      subsequent impairment of alertness, and increased inflammation including neuroinflammation,
      is common in hospital environments, and is associated with poorer outcome, particularly in
      the elderly.

      An intriguing new therapeutic concept currently emerging in the area of elective surgery is
      prehabilitation, a form of exercise training, which when pre-emptively administered in the
      weeks prior to admission, has the potential to improve postoperative cognitive status,
      mobility and recovery, thereby minimizing complications such as delirium. Our team has
      recently developed a novel personalized medicine intervention that uses wearable devices
      (smartwatches) to create an individualized exercise regimen for older adults that can
      facilitate prehabilitation and monitor adherence to the prehabilitation regimen while the
      patient is at home. In one sense, prehabilitation can be conceptualized as bouts of physical
      exercise performed at home prior to admission, which, when adequately timed using guidance by
      a wrist-worn biometric mobile device (smartwatch), augment the robustness of circadian
      rhythms, particularly in the elderly. This intervention has the potential to have a high
      impact because of its low cost, personalized nature, and ability to monitor adherence to
      confirm maximization of functional status prior to admission.
