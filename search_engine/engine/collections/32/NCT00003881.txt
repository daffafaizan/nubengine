      paclitaxel in patients with HER2 positive non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine median
      time to progression and one year freedom from progression in this patient population. III.
      Evaluate one year survival rate and overall objective response rate in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours immediately followed by carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes immediately followed by monoclonal antibody HER2 IV over 30-90 minutes on day
      1. Patients also receive monoclonal antibody HER2 on days 8 and 15. Treatment is repeated
      every 3 weeks for 6 courses. After 6 courses of treatment, patients may receive monoclonal
      antibody HER2 weekly for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years and
      once a year thereafter until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-44 patients will be accrued for this study.
