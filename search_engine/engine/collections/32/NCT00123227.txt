      binding to peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). It has been
      suggested that the TZD class od anti-diabetic drug may exhibit anti-atherosclerotic effects.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate over a 12 month period the potential benefits of
      rosiglitazone on carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques in the type 2 diabetic population
      with coexisting vascular disease or hypertension. It is hypothesised that treatment with
      rosiglitazone will lead to a decrease in plaque size. In addition it is hoped that
      rosiglitazone will have a positive effect on the plaque composition and stability.

      The primary endpoint will be the plaque volume change over 12 months as assessed by
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). The effectiveness of this modality to evaluate the
      effects of pharmacological agents on atherosclerosis in vivo has been demonstrated in
      previous studies using statins.

      The secondary endpoints will be to define the changes in plaque lipid content, fibrous cap
      thickness and gadolinium enhancement as a measure of fibrous cap inflammation and plaque
      neovascularisation.
