      licensed influenza vaccine as their standard or care, either the trivalent influenza vaccine
      (Fluvirin) or the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad). Eligible residents are
      those or their legally authorized representatives who give written, informed consent for
      three blood draws over one month's time and permission to review their nursing home medical
      and administrative records, including information required to be submitted to Medicare
      including quality performance data (the Minimum Dataset or MDS) and Medicare claims data for
      demographic and underlying disease comparisons between our participating populations between
      nursing homes. The investigators propose to study up to 230 subjects in one season at a 1:1
      ratio of adjuvanted vs. and non-adjuvanted vaccine.

      Background: Influenza is the most common clinically important viral infection of older
      adults. Influenza vaccination is associated with reduced hospitalization, strokes, heart
      attacks and death in non-institutional older adult populations, but the benefit of influenza
      vaccine for the oldest population has been questioned. The adjuvanted vaccine was shown in
      the past to elicit higher antibody titers than non-adjuvanted TIV. This included the elderly
      population as well. There are far more limited data about cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and
      use of the adjuvanted vaccine. There are data that support that CMI is important beyond the
      helper function to B cells. CMI helps mitigate influenza disease if the antibodies alone are
      not adequately protective.

      Objectives: To determine if adjuvanted vaccine elicits higher T cell and B cell responses
      than non-adjuvanted standard dose influenza vaccine in nursing home residents.
