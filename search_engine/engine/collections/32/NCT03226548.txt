      correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a
      shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease
      than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It
      is widely believed that an antipoverty policy, such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), could
      improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by
      increasing material hardship and psychological stress, two risk factors that are strongly
      correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher
      cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure).
