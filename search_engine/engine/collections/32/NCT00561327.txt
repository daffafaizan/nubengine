      proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) as a partial agonist in vitro. PPAR-γ is a nuclear
      hormone receptor and functions as a regulator of lipid- and glucose metabolism. PPAR-γ
      ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduce cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

      Angiotensin II receptor 1-blocking and PPAR-γ-activating properties of losartan metabolites
      in patients would markedly improve the pharmacological profile of losartan by combining
      anti-hypertensive and highly beneficial metabolic actions. We developed the following
      hypothesis:

        1. Hypertensive patients chronically treated with losartan exhibit sufficient plasma levels
           of EXP3179 to activate PPARγ.

        2. PPARγ target genes are induced in monocytes from losartan-treated patients.
