      nephropathy, this preconditioning is administered through repeated insufflation of an
      arterial pressure cuff in one of the patient arms, which in theory liberates vasoactive
      mediators that prevents the ischemic damage to the kidneys secondary to contrast media. All
      of the patients will receive endovenous normal saline to prevent nephropathy, which is a
      common strategy in our institution. Half of the patients will receive remote ischemic
      preconditioning while the other half will only receive a dummy preconditioning intended to
      keep the double blind strategy of the trial.

      The main endpoint will be to ascertain the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy in both
      arms of the study, as a way to evaluate the efficacy of this strategy.
