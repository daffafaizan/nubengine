      I. To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative disease by
      multiparameter-flow cytometry at 12 months after randomization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evidence of response as demonstrated by the improvement of the depth of response by at
      least one category according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. Overall survival (OS). IV. Duration of MRD-negative
      disease. V. Safety and tolerability of experimental arm (ixazomib citrate, lenalidomide, and
      low dose dexamethasone [IRd]) vs. control arm (lenalidomide [Rd]).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of markers of response based on pre-treatment characteristics using methods
      described in correlative research.

      II. Evaluation of MRD by gene sequencing method using the Sequenta platform (LymphoSIGHTÂ®) in
      parallel with multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide PO
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (of courses 1-4
      only).

      ARM II: Patients receive lenalidomide PO as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
