      during VATS. A three-dimensional printed navigational template was designed to aid
      percutaneous lung nodule localization, and its feasibility has been confirmed in previous
      study. The trial was conducted to confirm the non-inferiority of template-guided method to
      conventional CT-guided method in terms of localization accuracy.
