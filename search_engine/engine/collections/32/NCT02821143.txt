      Home, with the number over 25% in USA. With the ageing of the population, this rate is
      expected to dramatically increase in the next years, to reach 40% in USA in 2020. Yet, there
      is some evidence that palliative care is often inadequate in Nursing Home: there is a
      difficulty to recognize residents who might benefit palliative care and their needs, an
      underassessment and under-treatment of pain and other end-of-life symptoms, and frequent
      burdensome treatments and hospitalizations. Several programs including palliative care
      consult service (with outside consultant), Nursing Home-based palliative care or Nursing
      Home-hospice partnerships, have succeeded in delivering high-quality palliative care in
      Nursing Home. But, to our knowledge, no studies examined the benefit of telemedicine for
      palliative care in nursing home.

      During a 6 month-inclusion period, residents with palliative care needs will be included in
      both arms. In the intervention group, Telemedicine consultations involving Nursing Home staff
      and the palliative and/or geriatric unit from the University Hospital, will be organized
      systematically at inclusion and during the follow-up if needed. In both groups,
      hospitalizations and emergency hospitalizations, quality of life of the resident,
      satisfaction of the nursing home staff and health costs will be recorded during 6 months.
