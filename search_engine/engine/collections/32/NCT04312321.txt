      emergency medical service stations with distant access to hospital. Each call on emergency
      line during 6 weeks study period will be assessed for eligibility. If deemed as low urgency,
      the event will be randomised into 3 groups. CONTROL group: routine operation of paramedic
      crew with optional consultation with a doctor over the phone. In the PHONE group and in the
      VIDEO group, there will be a mandatory consultation of a doctor over the phone or by
      audiovisual constultation, respectively. The primary outcome of the study is the percent of
      patients treated on site without the need of hospital transfer. The secondary safety outcome
      is to evaluate repeated ambulance trips within 48 hours after the patient had been treated at
      home. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of subjective perception of the event by the patients,
      paramedic and consulting doctor using the Likert scales will be performed by survey at the
      end or immediately after the event.
