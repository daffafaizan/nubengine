      with infectious complications of perineural catheters exist. We assess incidence and
      localization of infectious complications of perineural catheters by means of computerized
      data acquisition. We prospectively evaluate perineural catheters placed at different sites
      for regional anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. The catheters were placed under
      standardized sterile conditions by using the nerve stimulator technique. Local inflammation
      is defined as the presence of at least two of the three signs: redness, pain on pressure or
      swelling. Infection is defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: pus
      at the catheter insertion site, fever, increased CRP and/or leukocytes requiring antibiotic
      therapy.
