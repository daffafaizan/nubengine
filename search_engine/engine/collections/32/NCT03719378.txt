      in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Typical intraoperative and post-operative fluid
      management has been arbitrary without evidence based guidelines established following total
      joint replacement. The investigators have observed many patients post-operatively with side
      effects such as fluid overload leading to medical complications requiring either prolonged
      hospitalization or readmission. Additionally, this overload may lead to wound healing
      complications secondary to fluid shifts which may be devastating in this patient population.
      Recent randomized trials in major abdominal surgery suggest that large amounts of IV fluid
      may increase morbidity and hospital stay. Additionally, this increase fluid may be
      detrimental in patients with anastomosis leading to failure and/or complications in this
      patient population. The investigators have defined to specific groups of interest to study in
      this patient population with regards to fluid management. The first group is the
      "traditional" IV fluid group where the anesthesiologist gives an unspecific amount of fluid
      intraoperatively and post-operatively the patient gets a set amount of fluid based on
      "protocol" on the orthopaedic floor (i.e. 75 cc/hour until good oral intake). This is the
      protocol utilized by most orthopaedic practices throughout the United States. The second
      group is defined as patients who are given a specific protocol preoperatively to optimize
      hydration, followed by limited fluids intraoperatively based on physiologic parameters. This
      study will investigate the effects of two regimens of intraoperative fluid management
      ("traditional" vs. "oral") with
