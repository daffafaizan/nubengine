      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of Thalidomide/Biaxin (Clarithromycin)/Dexamethasone as
      maintenance therapy after autologous/syngeneic transplant.

      II. Evaluate the median time to disease progression. III. Evaluate survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive thalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD), dexamethasone PO once weekly, and
      clarithromycin PO twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with thalidomide continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
