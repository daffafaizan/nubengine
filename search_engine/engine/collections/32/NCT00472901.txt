    
      Polymorphic Light Eruption (PLE) is a prevalent photosensitivity disorder, occurring in up to
      20% of the European and US populations and up to 5% of the Australian population. The disease
      is characterised by a rash that is intensely itchy with blisters, bumps and patches
      presenting on areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun. There is a lack of
      effective treatment available for the condition but the most common available forms of
      therapy include sun avoidance and the use of the use of steroids and/or phototherapy.
