      evidence-based behavioral theory as well as perspectives from parents, children, and the
      restaurant industry. The campaign aims to help parents choose healthful options for their
      children when dining in the quick-serve restaurant setting. Aim 1 is campaign development.
      Aims 2 and 3 are assessment (i.e., Randomized controlled trial and revenue analysis).
      Hypotheses are that the messaging campaign will be associated with fewer calories
      ordered/consumed by children in the quick serve setting; and the campaign will not negatively
      impact quick serve restaurant revenue.
