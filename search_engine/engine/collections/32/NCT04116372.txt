      chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active
      enough to experience these benefits. Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective
      for increasing physical activity, and our online platform includes components of several
      behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback.

      Target Population: Sedentary adults who have recently (within 6 months of enrollment)
      retired, or had their last child leave the family home, living in Victoria, British-Columbia,
      Canada.

      Sample Size: 80 participants, 20 participants per group - Empty Nest (Control) Empty Nest
      (intervention), Retired (Control), Retired (Intervention).

      Intervention: Participants in each Empty Nest and Retirement participant pool will be
      randomized to two groups: 1 - Waitlist control group, 2 - Access to Online Platform. Half of
      the empty nest participant group and half of the retired participant group will receive an
      intervention, with the other half representing the control comparison group. Participants
      from both groups will complete an online questionnaires at baseline and 10 weeks. The
      intervention group will also be asked for an in-person exit interview.
