      efficacy of a single 1500 mg IV dose of dalbavancin plus a single 500 mg IV dose of
      azithromycin in comparison to an approved antibiotic regimen of linezolid 600 mg every 12
      hours for 10-14 days plus a single 500 mg IV dose of azithromycin for the treatment of CABP.
      Adult patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized
      to one of the two treatment arms. Dosing will commence on Day 1, and all patients will
      receive a minimum of 10 days of therapy. Patients will be assessed on Day 1, Day 4-5, Day 7,
      Day 14 (End of Therapy, EOT), and Day 28 (Follow up).
