    
      Patient with a severe asthma attack will be admitted to the observation area in the Pediatric
      Emergency Center and assessed for eligibility for the study by the attending physician, based
      upon our study inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled after obtaining written consent from the parents. Patients
      will receive routine treatment for a severe asthma attack, such as inhaled bronchodilators,
      plus intravenous steroids and supplementary oxygen if needed. Standard blood work and chest
      X-Ray will be obtained and bronchial asthma severity score will be measured at baseline
      before starting treatment,and then at 4,8,12,24,36,48 hr and thereafter. The medical team as
      well as parents and patient will be blinded to the medications delivered. The patient will be
      randomized into one of the four study groups and adverse effects of the medications in each
      group will be monitored and documented carefully.
