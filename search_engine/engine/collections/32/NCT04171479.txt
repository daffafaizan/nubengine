      a selected, receives local Ethics Committee approval, and receives Sponsor approval to
      enroll, the site will begin enrollment. All subjects must meet eligibility criteria and
      follow protocol and ethics committee requirements regarding informed consent prior to
      enrollment. Once a subject is enrolled, the site may begin reviewing the subject's medical
      records and entering data into the electronic data capture system. Once enrollment and
      retrospective data entry is complete at a site, a monitoring visit will occur where source
      data verification will occur.
