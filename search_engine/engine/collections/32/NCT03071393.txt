      spinal cord injury, and enhance walking outcomes after walking rehabilitation compared to
      walking rehabilitation alone. A single session of acute intermittent hypoxia has also been
      shown to temporarily enhance breathing and limb strength in people with spinal cord injury.
      Further evidence supports the hypothesis that acute intermittent hypoxia acts on all motor
      pathways, and thus can enhance the strength of most muscles in the body.

      Spinal cord injury affects the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture. Decreased
      respiratory muscle function can lead to diseases of the respiratory system, which are the
      primary cause of death and significant cause of re-hospitalization after spinal cord injury.
      Deficits in postural muscle function affect one's ability to balance, safely maintain a
      seated position, or ambulate after spinal cord injury, severely impacting daily activities
      such as self-care and feeding skills.

      This study will test the hypothesis that a single session of acute intermittent hypoxia will
      increase strength and activation of the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture,
      leading to improved scores on functional assessments in individuals with chronic spinal cord
      injury. Our long term goal is to better understand the therapeutic potential of acute
      intermittent hypoxia combined with physical rehabilitation for individuals with chronic
      spinal cord injury.
