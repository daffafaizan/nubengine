      performance and is associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and survival. Treatment
      options include therapy for any underlying causes, pulmonary vasodilator drugs, oxygen and,
      in selected cases, pulmonary endarterectomy or lung transplantation. Unfortunately, PH
      specific drugs are expensive, associated with side effects and even combined pharmacological
      treatment is often not sufficient to achieve clinical benefits. Therefore, novel therapeutic
      drugs are needed. The investigators have recently demonstrated that sleep related breathing
      disorders, which are common in PH patients, can be improved by both nocturnal oxygen therapy
      and acetazolamide (AZA). AZA is a carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that acts as a
      respiratory stimulant thereby improving oxygenation and possibly PH. There are even data
      suggesting that CA-inhibitors have a direct pulmonary vasodilator effect. However, the
      potential role of AZA in the treatment of PH has not been conclusively studied. Therefore,
      the purpose of the current project is to investigate, the acute hemodynamic clinical effects
      of AZA in PH patients.
