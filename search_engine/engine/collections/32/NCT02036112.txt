      the rectal tumors suitable for ELAPE, most of them were circular or nearly circular
      infiltrating tumors. Patients with these rectal tumors should receive full ELAPE resection.
      In those rectal tumors not involving the levator ani muscle, the dissection plane may
      continue close to the external anal sphincter and the levator ani muscle, leaving the
      ischioanal fat and the terminal branches of the pudendal nerve intact.If the tumor has only
      penetrated into 1 side of the levator ani muscle, the dissection might include the levator
      ani muscle and the fat of the ischioanal fossa on the side of the tumor to achieve a clear
      circumferential resection margin, whereas the ischioanal fat and levator ani muscle on the
      other side of the tumor may be left

      . This individual ELAPE may be as effective as conventional ELAPE while minimizing the
      operative trauma and the damage to the nerves of the genital organs.
