      coronary risk, without any clear threshold below which lower levels are not associated with
      lower risk. Cholesterol reduction with statins reduces such risk but there is uncertainty
      about whether greater reductions with more intensive statin therapy will produce greater
      benefits. Elevated blood homocysteine levels appear to be an independent marker of
      cardiovascular risk, but it is unknown whether taking vitamins to reduce homocysteine
      concentrations will translate into cardiovascular benefit.

      12,064 survivors of myocardial infarction have been randomised in a 2x2 factorial design to
      more intensive versus standard cholesterol-lowering treatment, using 80 mg or 20 mg daily
      simvastatin, and separately to homocysteine-lowering with folic acid plus vitamin B12 or
      matching placebo. Follow-up will continue until there are at least 2800 confirmed major
      vascular events (MVE), defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary death, stroke or
      arterial revascularisation. The primary outcome is the incidence of first MVE during the
      scheduled treatment period.

      SEARCH should provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and safety of more intensive
      cholesterol-lowering for the reduction of major vascular events in a high-risk population,
      and of the effects of homocysteine-lowering with folic acid plus vitamin B12.
