      the detection of early colon cancer. The examinations were performed with Olympus 165
      colonoscopes by seven experienced endoscopists, each of whom performed alone about over 2000
      colonoscopies. The patients were randomly assigned to Group I and II with either air or
      carbon dioxide insufflation. Both study groups were matched by sex, age, duration of the
      procedure, and BMI. The authors compared for the duration of the procedure, coecal intubation
      time, complication rate, pulse rates immediately after the procedure, 15 minutes after, and
      subjective pain evaluation on a Visual Analogue Scale.
