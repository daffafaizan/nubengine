      far a disease-specific molecular breath profile has not been identified. Real-time, whole
      breath analysis incorporating all of the thousands of potentially relevant volatile compounds
      is needed in order to identify reliable CF-specific breath patterns. These may be used in
      future clinical applications to greatly enhance cost-effectiveness and simplicity of
      diagnostic testing for CF.
