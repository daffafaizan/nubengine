      were palliated with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt. This prevented cyanosis while the
      child grew to a size where complete repair could be undertaken. With the improvements in
      surgical technique and critical care, there is a push to do a primary complete repair for
      these defects at younger and younger ages. These operations should be delayed as long as
      possible to allow for growth but not so long that there is unnecessary cyanosis and
      hypoxemia.
