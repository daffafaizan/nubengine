      forms of vasculitis detailed above in the VCRC Patient Contact Registry who have completed
      the Diagnostic Questionnaire. The form was sent in PDF format to the patient, who either
      printed out or emailed the form to his or her primary vasculitis provider to complete. This
      form included the same questions in the patient questionnaire, with minor reformatting and a
      few expanded details to verify the patient-provided data (please see appendix B). If the 20
      questionnaires are not returned one month after the initial recruitment email to the Patient
      Contact Registry participants, 20 additional participants with the seven forms of vasculitis
      will be selected randomly and will be asked to participate in this study. The survey data is
      stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network's (RDCRN) Data Management and
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.
      Names or other personal health information were not collected. Upon conclusion of the study
      period, the data will be sent to Dr. Kathleen McKinnon. All data collected will be sent to
      the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) to be stored indefinitely.
