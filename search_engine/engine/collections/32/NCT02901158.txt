      lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. A dedicated
      esophageal balloon catheter is then placed in the esophagus to measure tidal variations in
      esophageal pressure.

      In this study high resolution solid-state manometry technique was instead used to provide
      detailed and continuous measurements of esophageal pressures in the different parts of the
      esophagus. The manometry catheter has 36 circumferential sensors at 1 cm intervals. Each
      sensor has 12 pressure-sensitive segments that add to the signal at that location.
      Measurements were performed during ongoing mechanical ventilation at different levels of
      endexpiratory pressure. Possible differences in tidal variations in esophageal pressure in
      different parts of the esophagus were assessed.
