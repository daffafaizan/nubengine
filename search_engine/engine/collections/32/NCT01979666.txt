    
      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether treatment with a local nitrate patch
      will improve MRI findings and clinical outcomes in patients with AVN of the knee.

      This is a double-blind prospective study that will include 50 adult volunteers, randomly
      assigned to a "nitrate" group that will be given a nitrate patch, and a "placebo" group that
      will be given a placebo patch.

      The following outcomes will be measured:

        -  MRI findings before and after the patch treatment

        -  Use of analgesics

        -  Subjective pain relief.
