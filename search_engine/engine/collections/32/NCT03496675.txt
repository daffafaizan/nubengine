      associated with individual distress, substantial carer burden, and high societal costs.

      Music interventions represent a highly promising type of non-pharmacological interventions
      for both dementia and depression in older adults. They are widely used, but have yet to be
      rigorously tested in large trials.

      The MIDDEL trial is the largest trial of music interventions to date, and the first to
      compare different music-based interventions - group music therapy (GMT), and recreational
      choir singing (RCS) - alone and in combination across countries.

      MIDDEL is designed as a large, pragmatic, international cluster-randomised controlled trial
      with a 2x2 factorial design that will compare the effects of GMT, RCS, both, or neither, for
      care home residents aged 65 years or older with dementia and depressive symptoms.

      Study sites will be located in Australia and in five European countries, and a total of 100
      care home units will be randomised to one of the four study conditions.
