      Screen to assess female athletes pre- and post injury prevention program.The study will
      include ninety-four females: forty-seven who complete a nine week program focusing on
      neuromuscular and proprioceptive exercises to improve landing techniques, and forty-seven who
      go about their normal preseason training regimen. This program has no more risk than if each
      athlete were to work out at their own gym. Each athlete will be given two questionnaires
      before and after completing the program in order to determine their level of activity has
      changed as well as uncover any underlying knee issues. Participants will also go through a
      series of functional and movement tests to reveal any imbalances, and determine whether or
      not they have improved by going through the prevention program.

      All functional and movement tests will be video recorded. These recordings will only be used
      for the purpose of conducting this research study and will only be viewed by the HFHS
      investigators participating in the study. We will follow-up with each athlete one year later
      to see if there are any lasting effects from the program and re-test each athlete at that
      time to validate any results
