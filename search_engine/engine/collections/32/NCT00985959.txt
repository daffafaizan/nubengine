      (participants are not assigned by chance), multi-center study in untreated multiple myeloma
      participants who were not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This study
      consists of two parts: Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I, a total of 18 participants will be
      enrolled ie, 6 patients per dose level (0.7, 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m2) to determine the recommended
      dose of bortezomib. In Phase II, additional 83 participants will be enrolled. Safety
      evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory test, specifically
      hematological toxicities.
