      bite-aligning mouthpiece on the different parameters assessed during a Wingate Test, as
      compared to clenching the jaw without a mouthpiece, in a physically-active, male population.
      The study also investigate the influence of wearing a mouthpiece on non-forced and forced
      airflow dynamics, as compared to open mouth and a jaw clenching without mouthpiece.
      Mouthpieces are made using a new scanning method that simplified the fitting process and
      lowered its cost.

      A nonrandomized study was designed to compare the effect of the occlusion condition on the
      anaerobic power and airflow dynamics. Conditions of wearing or not wearing mouthguard (MOUTHG
      and NO-MOUTHG, respectively) are randomly distributed in all tests. Each subject participate
      in three sessions. The first session is used to obtain informed consent assess anthropometric
      measurements and to scan the subject's mouth structure. In the second session, subjects are
      familiarized with the test protocols via a learning session that included demonstration of
      Wingate Test and the airflow dynamics measurements. Subjects also perform the airflow tests
      and the first Wingate Test trial. In the third session, subjects perform the second Wingate
      Test trial. Conditions are randomly distributed in all tests. Wingate Test trials were
      separated by three days and subjects were not allowed to perform intensive training
      workloads.
