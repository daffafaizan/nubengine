      closed reduction and percutaneous fixation of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. The
      study will be designed as a prospective, double-blinded, two-arm, non-inferiority trial. The
      control arm will receive standard of care preoperative prophylactic antibiotics. The
      intervention group will receive a preoperative saline placebo. The primary outcome of the
      study will be the development of a surgical site infection, including all infections both
      superficial and deep. Secondary outcomes will include rate and type of post-operative
      complications in either group, to account for any drug-related adverse outcomes. The
      hypothesis is that this surgery is safe to perform without prophylactic antibiotics, and the
      investigators anticipate finding no difference in infection rates between the two groups.
      Inclusion criteria will consist of an isolated, closed, displaced supracondylar humerus
      fracture treated with closed reduction and temporary percutaneous pinning. Immunocompromised
      patients, pathological fractures, open fractures, polytrauma, skeletally mature patients, and
      those treated primarily with open reduction or those converted to open reduction will be
      excluded. Because of the low infection rate observed in this type of surgery, the sample size
      for the study is estimated at 600 patients per arm for adequate power. With a multicenter
      design, the expectation will be enrollment over the course of 1-2 years with a follow up of
      approximately 3 months post-surgical intervention per participant.
