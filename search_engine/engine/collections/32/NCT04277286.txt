      chronic diseases. Several observational studies show needs not covered by care services at
      this period and significant lost to follow-up rates. "Transend" is a program designed to
      promote the transition of young patients with endocrine or metabolic diseases when they
      arrive in the adult sector at La Pitié-Salpétrière hospital (Paris, France). Since September
      1, 2016, approximately 500 patients benefited from it.
