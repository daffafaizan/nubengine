    
      This is an open-label, randomized, pilot, Phase II study of the safety and efficacy of
      Viracept in combination with modified antiretroviral therapy as treatment in patients with
      cutaneous and mucosal KS. Patients will be randomized to modify (add or switch or initiate)
      their current antiretroviral therapy and will add Viracept or remain on their current
      background antiretroviral therapy for a 2 month period. Initially 20 patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 14 Viracept, 6 control) for a 2 month period. Response to
      therapy will be evaluated at the end of the 2 month control phase. At this point, patients
      who were initially assigned to the control arm will continue on open label Viracept for an
      additional 10 month period.
