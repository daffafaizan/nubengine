    
      This is a single center specimen collection study. Eligible subjects from across the USA will
      be referred to the single center for participation.

      This study will evaluate whether the test methods being developed for the detection of fetal
      chromosomal abnormalities of interest in maternal whole blood samples can be used in clinical
      practice.

      Enrollment of study subjects will be done in two phases - an initial pilot study phase to
      collect samples for research and development activities, followed by a larger single-blinded
      sample collection phase for NIPT evaluation. For both phases, study subjects will be enrolled
      in a prospective manner until the predetermined sample size is attained. Each study subject
      will be asked to provide one 20mL blood sample.
