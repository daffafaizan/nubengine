      methods (compared to standard care).

      The aim of the first intervention is to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized message
      intervention in improving tobacco quit rates above and beyond standard care smoking cessation
      treatment in patients at risk for lung cancer. Messages will be designed specifically for
      patients at risk for lung cancer, personalized and presented in a gain-framed manner, taking
      into account demographics and smoking history.

      The aim of the second intervention is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, biofeedback-based
      intervention that provides personalized individual-level feedback on biomarkers of lung
      cancer risk and how they improve in response to cessation, delivered in a gain-framed way.
      The biomarkers include skin carotenoid status, spirometry, and plasma bilirubin, all of which
      improve with cessation. The study team will examine whether the biofeedback prevents relapse
      in those who quit and leads to reductions in smoking in lung nodule patients who failed to
      quit.

      Additionally, this study will attempt to evaluate the impact of smoking cessation on miRNA
      profiles in human serum, especially miRNAs in the let-7 family, which are known to have tumor
      suppressor function, and which we hypothesize increase in response to cessation.
