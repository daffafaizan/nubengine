      chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads. The
      procedure is similar with conventional TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization). At
      the target vessels, radiologists will inject lipiodol with doxorubicin first, then Taiwan ACE
      Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also
      similar with conventional TACE.

      Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.
