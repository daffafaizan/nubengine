    
      This is a single-arm trial in which previously untreated, wild-type k-ras metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients will receive therapy with the combination of panitumumab with
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin. During the treatment period of 6 cycles, subjects with evidence
      of complete response, partial response or stable disease will continue to receive the
      combination of chemotherapy with panitumumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or withdrawal of consent. Those patients with disease stabilization who are not appropriate
      for chemotherapy may continue with panitumumab alone. Patients with disease progression will
      be discontinued from chemotherapy and panitumumab and will be followed every 3 months after
      the last drug administration until death. Tumor response will be assessed according to the
      RECIST criteria (investigator's read of scans), every 6 weeks through week 18 and every 3
      months thereafter, until disease progression. Disease progression will also be evaluated
      radiographically at the time of clinical suspicion of progression.
