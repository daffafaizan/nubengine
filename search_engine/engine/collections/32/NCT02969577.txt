      effects. A kind of hormone therapy called Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is often used
      along with other treatments like radiation and has been shown to improve survival. However,
      ADT can have negative effects especially on the heart and metabolism (the body's system for
      using and storing energy).

      Participation in this study will last for up to 12 months. The study is looking at two
      different approaches to treating men who are undergoing ADT:

        1. Staying Strong & Healthy Intervention + Usual Care

        2. Usual Care

      All participants will have blood drawn and be asked questions about how they are feeling
      during their participation. The men in the Staying Strong & Healthy Intervention group will
      also take part in a diet and exercise program and receive counseling from a member of the
      study team.
