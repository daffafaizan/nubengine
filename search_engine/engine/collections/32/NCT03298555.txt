      postpartum weight retention and offspring obesity. Traditional intervention programs are time
      and cost intensive. Mobile technology (mHealth) has been successful for weight loss and
      behavior changes; however, their use in pregnancy need to be further examined. This study
      aims to evaluate the impact of a smartphone application (app) intervention on GWG, diet,
      physical activity and glucose homeostasis.

      HealthyMoms is a randomized controlled trial recruiting women at the first maternity clinic
      visit (week 6-10) in the Link√∂ping area, Sweden. Women will be randomized to the control or
      intervention group (n=150 per group). All women will receive standard care. The intervention
      group will also receive the HealthyMoms smartphone app promoting healthy eating, activity and
      GWG during 6 months. Pregnancy outcomes are GWG (primary), food intake (web-based
      questionnaire), fat mass (BodPod), glucose homeostasis, activity (accelerometer) in week 37.
      Maternal and infant body fatness will be assessed one week post partum.
