      fludarabine in combination with CPX-351 in patients with untreated AML. The rationale for
      this combination stems from data which indicated that pre-treatment of the THP-1 cell line
      with fludarabine for 4 hours prior to CPX-351 administration (Flu-CPX) significantly
      potentiated intracellular ara-CTP accumulation compared to CPX-351 alone. This suggests that
      fludarabine combined with CPX-351 may have efficacy against leukemic clones that would be
      resistant to CPX-351 or standard chemotherapy in first induction. It has been demonstrated
      that treatment with CPX-351 produces superior clinical outcomes in secondary AML likely due
      to its novel formulation, which results in sustained exposure of the cytotoxic agents
      cytarabine and daunorubicin in a synergistic 5:1 ratio within the plasma and bone marrow.
      Fludarabine can potentially improve upon the outcomes observed with CPX-351 monotherapy and
      7+3 by enhancing intracellular ara-CTP accumulation from CPX-351. Patients will received
      fludarabine and CPX-351 for up to 2 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of consolidation.
