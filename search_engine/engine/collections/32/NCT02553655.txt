      term cerebral vasomotor reactivity in healthy volunteers as measured by breath holding and
      transcranial doppler vasomotor reactivity. Previous studies on brachial vasomotor reactivity
      have shown a beneficial effect of remote ischemic preconditioning. It remains uncertain if a
      similar beneficial effect can be reproduced with cerebral vasomotor testing. Many biological
      mechanisms and effector pathways triggered by preconditioning have demonstrated endothelial
      protection and beneficial vascular effects.
