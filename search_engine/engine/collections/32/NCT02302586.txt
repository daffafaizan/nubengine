      chronic pain because of trocar site tissue damages, intercostal nerve injuries and related
      inflammatory responses. Poorly controlled pain in the early postoperative period usually
      causes chronic pain, and also affects patients' physiotherapy, mobilization and daily
      function.

      Our hypothesis in this study is 'thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is associated with an
      improvement in control of acute and chronic pain after VATS compared to systemic analgesia.
