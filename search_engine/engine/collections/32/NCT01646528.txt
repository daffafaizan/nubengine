      development of intestinal type gastric cancer. Previous study has shown that confocal laser
      endomicroscopy promising in the diagnosis of GIM. The investigators have found an elevated
      incidence of mesenchymal black spots in patients with GIM during previous CLE imaging. This
      study aims to explore the properties of mesenchymal black spots, and to determine the value
      of mesenchymal black spots in diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia by confocal laser
      endomicroscopy.
