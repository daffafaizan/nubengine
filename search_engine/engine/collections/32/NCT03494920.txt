    
      The DIRECT-SAFE trial will include patients with acute ischemic stroke, who are â‰¥18 years of
      age and are eligible for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset.
      Patients will be assessed for large vessel occlusion to determine their eligibility for
      randomization into the trial. Eligible vessel occlusions include the internal carotid artery,
      basilar artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 or M2). Patients will be consented after large
      vessel occlusion is confirmed based on standard care multimodal imaging.

      Patients will be recruited in Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and
      Europe. Randomisation either direct to ECR or standard thrombolytic therapy and ECR shall be
      in a 1:1 ratio.

      All patients will have a multimodal MR (or CT/CTP at investigator's discretion if MRI not
      possible) at 18 to 30 hours post treatment to assess reperfusion, recanalization, ischemic
      core growth and hemorrhagic transformation. Final follow up will occur at Day 90.
