      neuroblastoma patients with refractory or relapsed disease. Data from pre-clinical and adult
      studies suggest that radiation can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted
      therapies such as dinutuximab. This first pediatric phase 1 trial of 131I-MIBG in combination
      with dinutuximab and vorinostat aims to determine the recommended phase 2 pediatric dose of
      these three therapies in combination.
