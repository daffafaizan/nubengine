      nutritional intake, mainly protein intake, before surgery is important to improve
      preoperative muscle strength and functional capacity. However, up to 40% of patients admitted
      to the hospital suffer from malnutrition and this further deepened during hospitalization,
      which is an independent risk factor for peri-operative morbidity and severe complications,
      ranging from increased muscle loss, to higher infection rates, delayed wound healing and
      subsequently a prolonged hospital stay. An adequate food service is one strategy to improve
      protein intake and thereby the nutritional status. Extension of the study period to the
      out-of-hospital setting is recommended to explore the effects of long-term exposure to this
      concept on nutritional, functional and clinical outcomes. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      evaluate whether home delivered protein-rich meals, as part of FoodforCare meal service, in
      the preoperative setting improves protein intake in patients undergoing surgery, compared to
      usual care. The second aim is to investigate the effects on functional and clinical outcomes.
