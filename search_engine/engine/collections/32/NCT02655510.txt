    
      IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines which control bacterial infection,
      homeostasis, and tissue repair. IL-22 may be used to treat patients with ALD because of its
      antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-steatotic, anti-microbial, and proliferative effect that
      have been demonstrated in various experimental systems.

      The sponsor has developed F-652, a recombinant human IL-22 IgG2 Fc fusion protein produced in
      serum-free culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. F-652 is able to protect tissue from
      damage and enhance tissue repair during the inflammation process and infection by activation
      of STAT3 mediated by the interleukin-22 receptor subunit 1 (IL-22R1) expressed on epithelial
      cells such as hepatocytes.
