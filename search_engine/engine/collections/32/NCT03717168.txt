      These complications are common and can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

      Major operations are followed by acute respiratory insufficiency (RI) in 3%-27.4%, which
      causes prolonged hospital stay, high patient costs, high mortality rate and lower survival
      rates. The most crucial pulmonary postoperative complication is the prolonged mechanical
      ventilation and difficult weaning.The rHGH is a synthetic metabolic hormone which improves
      synthesis of protein, corrects hypoalbumenia, reverses negative nitrogen balance, improves
      patient nutrition, improves wound healing and promotes recovery of respiratory muscle
      function. When used for weaning from mechanical ventilation, rHGH reducess the duration of
      mechanical ventilation time, ICU admission period, incidence of VAP & ICU mortality.
      Felbinger et al reported a case of prolonged ventilation with failure of weaning after 42
      days; the patient received subcutaneous rHGH (0.3 IU/kg/day) for 20 days in addition to
      intensive care standard management. They reported improvement of protein metabolism in
      addition to improvement of respiratory muscle strength, the patient was weaned successfully
      on the 75th postoperative day.this study assumes a hypothesis that rHGH would help weaning
      from mechanically ventilated tracheostomized patients.
