      thyroid hormones. Because of a lack of stability during time and because of wide inter-batch
      variability in terms of active molecule, the National Agency of Safety of Medicaments (ANSM)
      ask to the market authorization holder to develop a new formula without lactose. This new
      formula, which has been proven to be bioequivalent has been marketed since march 2017 in
      France. Some patients were predicted to have their thyroid function imbalance because of this
      modification. The purpose of the study is to analyse, on the patients treated by
      Levothyroxine® in how many patients this modification has clinical and biological
      consequences.
