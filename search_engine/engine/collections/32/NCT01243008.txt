        -  Cohort 1: 8 volunteers

        -  Cohort 2: 24 volunteers, divided into 3 groups of 8 subjects each

      The study will be conducted in the following three phases:

        1. Treatment of cohort 1: The aim is to establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for a
           local treatment with azithromycin dermal formulation.

             1. Treatment of cohort 1 with azithromycin dermal formulation and follow up

             2. Assessment of local safety within the 7 days following the first treatment

             3. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined

        2. Treatment of cohort 2: The aim is to confirm the local tolerance of the selected doses
           and to evaluate the local skin and plasma concentration of azithromycin after
           application of SHB001 dermal formulation.

             1. Treatment of cohort 2 with azithromycin dermal formulation at maximal tolerated
                dose (MTD), with a dose one or more concentrations lower than maximal tolerated
                dose (MTD) and with placebo

             2. Skin biopsies of treated skin areas will be taken for the PK assessment

        3. Study completion examination
