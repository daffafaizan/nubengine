      renal stones. Sodium bicarbonate has been shown to reduce renal tubular acidosis in other
      populations. To date, no data exist on the efficacy of correction of renal tubular acidosis
      in pediatric patients on topiramate. We are proposing to investigate the efficacy of 4 weeks
      of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy to reduce tubular acidosis in patients on topiramate.
