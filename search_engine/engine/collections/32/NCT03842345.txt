      psychotic disorders, Major depressive disorder, Bi-polar disorder, Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and anxiety disorders. To date none of the
      psychiatric conditions mentioned diagnosis' relies on an imaging or other quantitative
      technique. Diagnosis and treatment prescription in the psychiatric clinic still relies on
      subjective reports and physician assessment of symptoms. Trans-cranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method that allows to study human cortical function
      In-vivo. Using TMS for examining human cortical functionality is enhanced by combining TMS
      with simultaneous registration of electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG provides an opportunity to
      directly measure the cerebral response to TMS, measuring the cortical TMS Evoked potential
      (TEP), is used to assess cerebral reactivity across wide areas of neo-cortex. Studies
      integrating TMS with EEG (TMS-EEG) have shown that TMS produces waves of activity that
      reverberate throughout the cortex. and that are reproducible and reliable thus providing
      direct information about cortical excitability and connectivity with excellent time
      resolution. By evaluating the propagation of evoked activity in different behavioral states
      and in different tasks, TMS-EEG has been used to causally probe the dynamic effective
      connectivity of human brain networks.
