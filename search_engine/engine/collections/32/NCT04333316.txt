      suffering of hip arthritis between 2011 and 2018. They were randomized into two groups of
      homogenous demographic and clinical data. Group A was treated by cementless T.H.A. with a
      large head while group B received cementless T.H.A. with a dual mobility cup. Clinical
      evaluation and preoperative patient's expectation were assessed and compared to the
      postoperative satisfaction.
