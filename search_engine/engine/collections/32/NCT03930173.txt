    
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the accuracy of 18F-fluciclovine PET in
      distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor progression. Accuracy will be assessed via
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, as well as by calculating sensitivity and
      specificity.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to assess which factors may influence accuracy of
      18Ffluciclovine PET in distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor progression and to
      compare the accuracy of each of the qualitative and quantitative metrics.
