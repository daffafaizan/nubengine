      may worse case develop into cancer. In most cases both the virus infection and lesions (CIN1)
      regress spontaneously, but must be followed up with gynecological examinations to ensure
      normalization. If further persistent disease and worsening to precancerous lesions (CIN2-3),
      the usual treatment is surgery, where one removes the tissue in the cervix where the CIN
      lesions are.

      In this research study we will evaluate a new non-surgical treatment for CIN1 using
      hexaminolevulinate (HAL) photodynamic therapy (PDT). HAL PDT is the combination of a
      medication and a specific type of light to activate the drug. HAL PDT selectively removes CIN
      lesions while preserving normal tissue, thus this may be an alternative to frequent
      gynecological consultations and local surgery that may have undesirable side effects.
