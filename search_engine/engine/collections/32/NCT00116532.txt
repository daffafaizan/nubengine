      population. Treatment options include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
      dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and behavioral therapy. A recent
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that citalopram is effective in the
      treatment of OCD. Escitalopram is a new SSRI that may be more effective than other SSRIs for
      the treatment of major depression and may have fewer side effects. This study aims to assess
      the efficacy of escitalopram for the treatment of OCD.

      Comparisons: Subject Y-BOCs pre-post treatment. We will also compare the improvement of
      subjects across the three different medication levels: 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg.
