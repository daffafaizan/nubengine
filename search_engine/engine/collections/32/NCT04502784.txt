      debilitating due to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. Iron
      deficiency anaemia can be treated by giving iron supplementation. Iron supplements can be
      taken orally or can be given intravenously (through the veins). Giving iron intravenously has
      advantages over iron supplements taken orally, which can cause side effects such as stomach
      pain and cramping. However, giving iron intravenously has been associated with the
      development of low levels of phosphate in the blood. This is known as hypophosphataemia.
      Phosphate is an important salt in the body and has a number of important functions. Very low
      levels of phosphate can cause muscle pain, disorientation, seizures and heart problems. It is
      unclear why giving iron intravenously can cause hypophosphataemia. This project aims to
      investigate the potential causes of hypophosphataemia in patients who receive intravenous
      iron as treatment for anaemia associated with their condition. Patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and intestinal failure will be recruited to the study, since people with CKD
      may handle iron differently than those with healthy kidneys. Samples will be taken at two
      time points: prior to giving the intravenous iron and at the patient's next appointment.
      Healthy volunteers will also be recruited to the study to allow comparison between the groups
      receiving iron and those who do not receive iron. Samples will be analysed to determine
      potential causes of hypophosphataemia. Results from before and after iron is given will be
      compared to determine if any of the participants developed hypophosphataemia and if any other
      test are affected which may explain why this has developed.
