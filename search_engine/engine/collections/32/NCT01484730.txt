      performance of Multi-Spectral Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging can measure in the full range
      of vascular conditions ranging from ischemic (under-perfused or unsaturated) to hyperemic
      (over-perfused and over-saturated).

        1. .Modulated Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology can detect the concentration
           of total hemoglobin, deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin in absolute amounts in units
           of millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured.

        2. . Laser Speckle Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology consists of a coherent
           light source, camera, and image acquisition system. This image device can measure and
           compare relative flow in vasculature at varied time points.
