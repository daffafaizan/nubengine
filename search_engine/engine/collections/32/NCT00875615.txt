    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the safety of intrahepatic arterial infusion of cisplatin or carboplatin in
           combination with sorafenib tosylate in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive intrahepatic arterial infusion of cisplatin or carboplatin over
      30-45 minutes on day 1 and oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 8-35. Treatment
      repeats every 42 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
