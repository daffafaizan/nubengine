    
      Children (age 0-14 years) with congenital lacrimal stenosis in whom probing and intubation of
      the lacrimal drainage system is indicated are included the study after informed written
      consent by their parents. Microbiological specimens are taken bilaterally from conjunctiva
      and nasal mucosa during the two procedures under general anaesthesia (insertion and removal
      of the silicon intubation) and from the silicon tube after removal. Specimens are examined
      for bacterial contamination. Microbiological findings are correlated with clinical data about
      the further clinical course and especially the success of the surgical treatment.
