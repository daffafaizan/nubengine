    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration (glutamate
      supplementation) on the salivary gland uptake of gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11
      (68Ga-PSMA-11).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of MSG administration on renal 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake. II. To
      determine the effect of MSG administration on tumor 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake. III. To determine if
      68GA-PSMA-11 is excreted in the saliva. IV. Safety of MSG administration both oral ingestion
      and oral-salivary stimulation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo a
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan on day 1. Within 2 weeks
      (days 2-14), patients receive MSG orally (PO) over 10 minutes and receive a second dose of
      gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 IV, followed by a second PET/CT scan. Patients also undergo
      collection of saliva at 0, 30, and 60 minutes after gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 injection
      and 90 minutes after PET/CT.

      Arm II: Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 IV and undergo a PET/CT scan on day 1.
      Within 2 weeks (days 2-14), patients receive a second dose of gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11
      IV immediately followed by MSG applied in the mouth over 30 seconds every 10 minutes for a
      total of 6 times, and then undergo a second PET/CT scan. Patients also undergo collection of
      saliva at 0, 30, and 60 minutes after gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 injection and 90 minutes
      after PET/CT.
