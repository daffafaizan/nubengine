      COVID-19 patients (death, initiation of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and thrombotic
      event). An additional analyses will be performed for each individualized outcome.

      Metodology: Prospective case-only study. The variables that will be collected are:

        1. Previous epidemiological data of the patient.

        2. Clinical and biological data and treatment upon admission to the hospital.

        3. Clinical and biological evolutionary data (Increases in the values of certain biological
           variables in a defined period of time (> 48 h) during admission):

             -  Baseline epidemiological and clinical variables

             -  Baseline biological variables

             -  Complications and clinical evolutionary variables

             -  Evolutionary biological variables

        4. Clinical evolutionary data of final outcomes, including death (at 30, 90 days and at 6
           months), initiation of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and thrombotic event.

        5. For future studies of new biological and epigenetic variables, blood samples will be
           collected from hospitalized patients under the CIBER coverage.
