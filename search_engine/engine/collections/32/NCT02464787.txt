      carotenoid levels over time in individuals who increase their carotenoid intake by taking a
      dietary supplement containing a known amount of carotenoids. After a two-week control period
      eating their normal diet, forty medical students meeting study inclusion criteria will be
      asked to take a dietary supplement over an eight week period of time. Students will be given
      twin-sachet packets of LifePak Nano supplements containing five capsules (dry ingredients)
      and two CR-6 Liponutrient softgel capsules (liquid ingredients, including omega-3 fatty acids
      and nanosized carotenoids). These will be taken twice a day with eight ounces of liquid at
      the morning and evening meal. SCS will be measured every 2 weeks. At the end of this period,
      the students will be asked to discontinue dietary supplement intake and follow their usual
      diet for 2 weeks then their SCS measured again.
