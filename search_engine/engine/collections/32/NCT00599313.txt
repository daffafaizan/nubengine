      (Sutent) for the therapy of progressive metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer
      (AIPC) following prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Since most patients with metastatic AIPC
      following prior chemotherapy clinically progress rapidly, we believe that achieving a 30%
      freedom from clinical progression (PFS) (not including PSA progression) at 12 weeks
      represents biologically active therapy. Sunitinib malate (Sutent) represents a tolerable and
      convenient form of therapy with the potential for improving outcomes in AIPC.
