      effects. In order to avoid long time glucocorticoids intake, patients with mild disease will
      be treated with Iguratimod combined with one dose of diprospan. 30 untreated IgG4-RD patients
      with mild symptom will be enrolled in this study, and be treated with one dose of
      diprospan,then take Iguratimod 25mg, Bid orally. 5 ml of patients' peripheral blood will be
      collected at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks of follow up. At baseline and each follow-up,
      the clinical efficacy of treatment will be evaluated by IgG4-RD responder index, serum
      immunoglobulin, IgG4, immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum cytokines, such as interleukin 1, 6, and
      tumor necrosis factor, will be measured by ELISA, peripheral blood T cell sub-populations, B
      cell sub-populations and plasma cells will be measured by flow-cytometry.
