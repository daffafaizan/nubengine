      endovascular or surgical procedures.

      WB-MRA is an imaging procedure that can visualise the arterial system. WB-MRA can be
      performed in different manners. On option is to start the scan in the head region and
      continue down the body to the feet (standard protocol). Another option is to use a hybrid
      protocol that first examines the head and lower leg followed by examination of the pelvic and
      upper leg region.

      A comparison between the standard and hybrid protocols has not been performed in a 3T high
      magnetic field system, therefore we will perform such a study.
