      system on reducing problem behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during a
      physical exam.

      Design, setting, patients, intervention: Fifteen study participants, aged 5-10 years, with
      autism and identified by caregivers as typically uncooperative with physical exams were
      randomized to one of two physical exam groups (treatment and control) based on their adaptive
      communication score. The treatment group exam included use of a picture
      schedule-reinforcement book and the control group exam did not introduce the book. Caregivers
      rated participants' irritability/stereotypy behaviors before and during study exams. Exam
      teams blinded to study aims, recorded participants' total exam items completed and caregivers
      rated participants' level of cooperation.
