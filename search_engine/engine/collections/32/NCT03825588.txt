      ideation with a plan or a suicide attempt to one of four treatment arms: (1) ASAP + BRITE +
      TAU (treatment as usual); (2) BRITE + TAU (treatment as usual); (3) ASAP + TAU (treatment as
      usual); and (4) TAU (treatment as usual) alone. The investigators will assess suicidal
      ideation and behavior at 4, 12, and 24 weeks post-intake, in order to:

        1. Assess the relative efficacy of ASAP, BRITE and the combination on suicidal ideation,
           non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide attempts, and re-hospitalizations.

        2. Examine mediators and moderators of treatment outcome.

        3. Examine the costs and cost efficacy of ASAP and BRITE and the combination.
