      peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens
      (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1,4, 15 and 18
      of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the
      treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into superficial inguinal
      lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.
