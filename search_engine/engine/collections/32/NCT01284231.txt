      open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of MEDI-565 to determine the MTD or OBD and
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and antitumor activity of MEDI 565 in adult
      subjects who have GI adenocarcinomas for which no standard or curative treatments are
      available. The second part is a dose-expansion study at the MTD or OBD in subjects with
      selected tumor types.
