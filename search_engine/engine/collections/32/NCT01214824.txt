      subjects. Each subject will use a FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitor for a period
      of 20 days at the start of the study, after which their Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) may
      recommend changes to their glucose management based on the continuous glucose monitoring(CGM)
      data. Subjects will then return to self-managing their diabetes with a blood glucose meter.
      After 2 months, subjects will use the FreeStyle Navigator for a further 5 days and review
      their results and glucose management with their HCPs. Subjects will again return to
      self-managing their diabetes with a blood glucose meter until the end of the study, when the
      last FreeStyle Navigator 5 day wear is completed and HbA1c and measures of glycaemic
      variability are recorded.
