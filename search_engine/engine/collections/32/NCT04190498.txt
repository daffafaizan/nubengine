      of recurrent episodes of partial or total obstruction of the upper airway called hypopneas
      and apneas respectively. These episodes are associated with the repetitive occurrence of the
      desaturation-reoxygenation sequences, the so-called chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) which
      is the major stimulus underlying main cardiovascular, metabolic consequences and
      pro-inflammatory state found in patients with OSA. Recent data from cohort studies have
      established that OSA is an even greater risk factor for cancer-related mortality.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cancer related death worldwide and has an
      increasing impact in developed countries. The epidemic of metabolic syndrome (MS) plays a
      growing role in the occurrence of metabolic steatohepatitis (NASH) related HCC. Concerning
      transition from NASH to NASH-related HCC, neither the frequency nor the underlying mechanism
      are known. Very recently, a link between OSA (IH) and NASH has been highlighted. OSA and
      intermittent hypoxia should be a major worsening factor in a neoplastic context. Our
      hypothesis is that OSA promotes the prevalence of HCC in a context of NASH.

      The objective is to compare the prevalence of OSA between patients with NASH-related and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC. In this type 3, cross-sectional, multicenter, national,
      non-randomized study patients suffering from a NASH-related or HCV-related hepatocellular
      carcinoma will be recruited. Investigators expect to show a higher prevalence of OSA in
      patients with HCC NASH-related but also a shorter overall survival. Complementary ex vivo
      studies on tumor samples will be conducted in order to explore the mechanisms by which OSA
      and IH would promote carcinogenesis
