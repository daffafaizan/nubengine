      (August-September 2012) Phase II: Two-month randomized trial comparing four groups:
      self-refraction with adjustable glasses, receiving custom standard glasses; subjective
      refraction by an expert refractionist after cycloplegic automated refraction and receiving
      custom standard glasses; subjective refraction by a rural refractionist after cycloplegic
      automated refraction, receiving custom standard glasses; and subjective refraction by an
      expert refractionist after cycloplegic automated refraction receiving ready made glasses
      (September 2012 - August 2013)
