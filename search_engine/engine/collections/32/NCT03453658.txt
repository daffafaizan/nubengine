      radiographic examination, patients in search for endodontic treatment in primary teeth will
      be invited to take part in the study. The participants of the study will be randomized to one
      of two groups (manual or reciprocating instrumentation). Endodontic treatment will be held by
      a specialist according to the randomized group. A blinded examiner will proceed one week, 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months follow ups. Clinical and radiographic conditions of
      endodontic treatments will be analyzed to classify them as Success or Failure. The unit of
      analysis will be the teeth; hence, each participant may have more than one tooth included in
      the study. The randomization will be performed considering the tooth. Data analysis will
      consider the cluster nature of the sample.

      The primary outcome of the study will be the success rates according to the groups. The
      longevity of treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival rates by Kaplan-Meier and
      Cox regression. The differences between survival rates of both groups will be through Cox
      regression adjusted for the cluster nature of the sample (more than one tooth per
      participant), considering a level of significance of 5%.
