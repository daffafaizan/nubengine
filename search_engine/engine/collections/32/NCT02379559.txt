      two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) on MetS components and biomarkers related to
      prostate cancer in Black men with MetS. Due to the striking racial disparities of prostate
      cancer, this proposal will focus on the impact of an aerobic and resistance exercise
      intervention on MetS and biomarkers related to prostate cancer in Black men. Specifically,
      our proposed clinical trial compares an aerobic and resistance exercise intervention to an
      attention control group among Black men.
