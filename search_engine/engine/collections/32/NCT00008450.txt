      I. To safely establish partial lymphoid chimerism (1-95% donor cluster of differentiation
      [CD]3+ cells) using a non-lethal conditioning regimen in patients with severe combined
      immunodeficiency syndrome.

      II. To define the kinetics of immune reconstitution following a non-lethal conditioning
      regimen in patients with immunodeficiency diseases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) on days -3 to 100 followed by
      a taper until day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV on days 0-40 with a taper until day
      96 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Unrelated donor recipients also undergo TBI on
      day 0. Patients undergo bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then yearly for
      5 years.
