      cysts usually includes endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The
      cyst fluid sample from EUS-FNA is routinely sent for lab analysis (carcinoembryonic
      antigen-CEA) and cytology assessment. The diagnosis of a mucinous cyst is usually based on
      those results.

      For study participants undergoing EUS-FNA, a small portion of the cyst fluid will be analyzed
      for glucose levels using a bedside glucometer in addition to the routine analyses. A low cyst
      fluid glucose level may correlate with a diagnosis of a mucinous cyst. The primary aim of
      this study will be to determine if a low cyst fluid glucose level correlates with standard
      laboratory cyst fluid analysis (CEA) in establishing a diagnosis of a mucinous pancreatic
      cyst.

      Secondary aims of this study will be: (1) comparing the accuracy of cyst fluid glucose to CEA
      level among subjects with a proven diagnosis of a mucinous cyst (based on surgery or
      cytopathology findings), and (2) determining the optimal cyst fluid glucose level that
      correlates to a proven diagnosis of a mucinous cyst (based on subjects who undergo surgery or
      have a diagnosis based on cytopathology).
