    
      Women are referred by the general practioner (GP)/primary care with a suspected diagnosis of
      PCOS to the Endocrine Clinic at St George's Hospital.

      They have an initial routine clinical assessment involving history, BP, weight & assessment
      of PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria.

      The routine clinical investigations involve the following:

      â€¢ one fasting blood sample to measure various hormones; fasting glucose:insulin ratio; pelvic
      ultrasound scan to determine ovarian morphology, follicular count and endometrial thickness

      Part 1 of the research protocol will include obtaining the following:

        -  One urine & serum sample to be taken at the same time as their routine clinical blood
           samples.

        -  These samples will be anonymised before despatch to SPD. Part 2 of the study will
           involve treating patients with Vitamin D (if they are deficient) and/or myo-inositol
           supplement or metformin depending on their clinical need. The outcomes measured will be
           as above (blood sample to measure hormones) and an assessment of body fat distribution.
