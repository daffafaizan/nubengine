    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      This is a pilot study designed to determine the safety and feasibility of treatment with
      dasatinib 100 mg administered orally once daily for 4 weeks duration prior to radical
      cystectomy for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
      ineligible for and/or willing to forgo neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
      If surgery delay is imperative, dasatinib therapy should continue until at least 24 hours
      before planned surgery.

      ECOG Performance Status 0-1

      Life Expectancy: Not specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Platelets > 100 K/mm3

        -  INR < 1.2

      Hepatic:

        -  Total bilirubin < 2.0 X Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN.

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine < 2 X ULN

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure or MI within 6 months prior to
           registration on study.

        -  No diagnosed congenital long QT syndrome (a congenital disorder characterized by a
           prolongation of the QT interval on ECG and a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmias,
           which may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death).

        -  No history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular
           tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de Pointes).

        -  No prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (> 450 msec), obtained within
           28 days prior to being registered on study.
