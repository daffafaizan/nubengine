      to titration of insulin dosage relying on data from glucose meters with health care provider
      support (Control) in the management of insulin treated diabetes, by randomizing 200 insulin
      treated subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Primary Objective: To demonstrate a greater reduction in HbA1c at 6-months for d-Nav users
      compared to control patients in the primary cohort.
