      system responses. An artificially constructed HIV-1 vaccine (NYCBH), using vaccinia virus as
      its vector, has the advantage of conferring both cellular and humoral immune responses that
      are long-lived. Studies have shown that a second artificially constructed vector vaccine,
      HIV-1 canarypox (vCP205), also increases CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, a
      cell-mediated immune response. Yet, immune responses are not boosted in volunteers previously
      vaccinated with vaccinia-based HIV-1 vaccines when a second vaccination with the same vaccine
      is given. One theory for vaccinia vaccine's failure is that immunologic barriers by
      antibodies to the vector itself may be responsible. This study examines the effectiveness of
      boosting the immune responses following vCP205 vaccination in the following: 1) volunteers
      who were previously immunized with vCP205 vaccine who may or may not have shown increased
      immune responses following the first immunization, and 2) volunteers who were previously
      immunized with NYCBH vaccine.

      Upon study entry volunteers receive one injection of ALVAC-HIV vCP205. Temperature and
      symptoms should be recorded by the volunteer each day for 2 days and reported to the clinic
      staff. Volunteers will have seven clinic visits for drawing blood, collecting urine
      specimens, and performing clinical evaluations. At Month 3 HIV testing will be done.
      Volunteers will be followed for 3 months, with a passive follow-up call at the end of a year
      and once or twice a year for the next 5 years. Counseling on avoidance of HIV infection and
      pregnancy will be done.
