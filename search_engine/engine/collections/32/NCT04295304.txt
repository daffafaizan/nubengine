    
      The NR600 is a retinal prosthetic system intended to provide electrical stimulation to the
      retina to induce visual perception in patients with severe to profound vision loss due to
      degenerative retinal disease. The system is consisting of an autonomous epiretinal implant
      with penetrating electrodes, Glasses and a Clinician Station. The implant is Infrared (IR)
      powered and is designed to convert visual input into well-defined electrical stimulation
      patterns suited to elicit neuronal retina activity. All study subjects will be implanted with
      the device in one eye and will be followed for 18-months.
