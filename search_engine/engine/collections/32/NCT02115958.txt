      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with
      Nasopharyngeal Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the
      PBMCs of the nasopharyngeal cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate
      ALDHhigh and ALDHlow tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the nasopharyngeal cancer patient
      using a similar protocol as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-nasopharyngeal cancer CSC
      immunity induced by nasopharyngeal cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of nasopharyngeal cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with nasopharyngeal cancer
      CSC-DC.
