      and/or Thiazolidinedione will be randomized. Twenty (20) patients will be randomized to
      receive active study medication and 10 patients will be randomized to receive vehicle
      control. After undergoing screening procedures, potential patients will enter a 14 day
      baseline phase where baseline data will be collected. Pending successful completion of the
      baseline phase, patient will enter a 28-day treatment phase where they will be randomized to
      receive either once daily subcutaneous injections of E1 plus G1, as separate injections or
      once daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle control (as 2 separate injections). Patients
      will receive once daily doses in the morning after breakfast for a period of 28 days. Upon
      completion of treatment, all patients will continue in the follow-up phase for an additional
      6 months and will return to the clinic for monthly visits. Throughout the study, patients
      will remain on their current oral hypoglycemic therapy with Metformin and/or
      Thiazolidinedione and will maintain a diary record of blood glucose levels.

      The body's ability to control glucose will be assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
      After an overnight fast, patients will be asked to drink a solution containing a known amount
      of glucose. Blood samples for glucose and insulin measurements will be obtained before the
      patients drink the glucose solution, and again 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 2 hours after the
      glucose is consumed. This test will be performed at frequent intervals during the study.
