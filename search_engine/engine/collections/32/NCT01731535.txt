      nonunion fractures. Subsequently, we will collect associated medical information related to
      fractures such as age of osteoporosis diagnosis, BMI, previous bisphosphonate treatment, type
      and location of fracture, time to complete union, other treatment needed for nonunion etc.
      With this information, we will evaluate the risk of delayed and nonunion fractures in
      patients previously receiving bisphosphonate treatment compared to a normal population. We
      also will investigate other potential causes of delayed or nonunion fractures in this
      population.
