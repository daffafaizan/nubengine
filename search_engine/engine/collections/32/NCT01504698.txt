      musculoskeletal pain as well as amount and types of sport during leisure time the past week.
      Following a report of pain, the parents will be interviewed by phone by a member of the
      clinical team, consisting of two licensed physical therapists and two licensed chiropractors,
      for a thorough description of the complaint. Based on this, the interviewer determines
      whether the complaint is negligible or whether the child should be seen by a member of the
      clinical team, in which case the child will be examined at his or her school. At this
      examination, the child will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria.
