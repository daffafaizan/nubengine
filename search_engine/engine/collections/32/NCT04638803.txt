    
      A crossover study comparing blood concentrations after oral administration of microdoses of
      (-)-fencamfamine (FCF; 40 µg) or its prodrug form (PRX-P4-003; 100 µg)) in the fasted state
      will be carried out in 4 healthy male volunteers (Study A). This will be followed by
      determination of blood concentrations of (-)-fencamfamine in a separate cohort of 4
      volunteers following oral administration of a microdose of PRX-P4-003 (100 µg) in a fed state
      (Study B).
