        -  Assess tolerance and complications from consolidation therapy with intraperitoneal
           floxuridine and cisplatin and/or carboplatin in patients with stage III ovarian
           epithelial cancer or gastrointestinal cancer with peritoneal involvement.

        -  Determine the sites of failure and estimate the time to failure following treatment with
           this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of residual disease at second look
      laparotomy or laparoscopy (micro only vs no greater than 0.5 cm vs greater than 0.5 cm and no
      greater than 1 cm), and by CA-125 level (elevated vs normal on day -7).

      Patients receive intraperitoneal floxuridine on days 1-3 followed by intraperitoneal
      cisplatin and/or carboplatin on day 3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4-6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 and 6 weeks, then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
