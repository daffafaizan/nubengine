      recruited cohort of patients with HFpEF or probable HFpEF to understand the characteristics
      and needs of this patient group. It involves a longitudinal cohort study conducted to
      identify patients with HFpEF in primary care and assess comorbidities, lifestyle factors,
      frailty, self-management, symptoms, quality of life, cognitive function, types of care
      received, management of risk factors and comorbidities, and one year morbidity and mortality.
      This will inform particular areas for assessment and management/self-management in the
      optimised programme. The investigators will also apply to NHS Digital who are the data
      controllers of Hospital Episode Statistics to check if participants have had any hospitals
      visits throughout the duration of the study.
