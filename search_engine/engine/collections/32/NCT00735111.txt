      across the cancer population. The scale relates to purely physical ability and covers 11
      stages, ranging from normal health to death, with each stage scored as a percentage. The
      score is determined by the health-care provider and is based on observation and narrative
      patient descriptions. The purpose of this study is to compare the scores rated by the
      health-care provider to the scores that patients assign to themselves.
