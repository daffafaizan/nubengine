      Korea. Even though, we still do not know what the cause is. Only IOP-lowering drugs are the
      currently available therapeutic method. Glutathione is one of the mostly high concentrated
      intracellular antioxidants. We find apoptosis of neuronal cell in the mouse retina by
      systemic depletion of glutathione using buthionine sulfoximine. Glutathione is also known to
      be reduced in primary open angle glaucoma with high IOP. So we are planning to evaluate
      systemic glutathione level in normal tension glaucoma.

      Blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture to the antecubital vein of normal tension
      glaucoma patients and age-matched normal controls. Five milliliters of blood will be
      collected in EDTA-treated tubes (to prevent oxidation). Thirty microliters of blood will be
      then transferred into centrifuge tubes, and will be added 33.3 microliter of 5-sulfosalicylic
      acid (SSA), 100mg/mL within 10 minutes from the blood collection.Each sample will be then
      diluted with 936.7 microliter sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the content of each tube
      will be mixed rapidly in a centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. A portion of supernatant
      (150 microliter) will be then collected into clean centrifuge tubes and immediately cooled at
      -70°C. To each well of a 96-well plate, 150 microliter of daily buffer (3 mg NADPH into 10 mL
      sodium phosphate buffer), 50microliter of DTNB solution, and 25 microliter of standards or
      samples will be added in quadruplicate, and the plate will be incubated at 37 °C for 3
      minutes.Finally, 25 microliter GSSGR will be added to the previous mixture, and the plate
      will be read at 410 nm using a 96-well plate reader(UV spectrophotometer).
