      I. Develop a prototype of the APPSPIRE (phone application [app] of a smoking prevention
      interactive experience).

      II. At post assessment, students enrolled in the study will qualitatively provide information
      about the usability and usefulness for the prevention and cessation sites.

      III. Investigate frequency of use of and exposure to APPSPIRE modules via an objective
      measure of general use.

      IV. Investigate how feasible the program will be. V. Obtain a maintained use of APPSPIRE with
      high completeness and extent of completion.

      VI. Evaluate change in stage of change from baseline to about 1 and 4-month follow-ups among
      participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants attend an audio-taped focus group over 1 hour and are given the APPSPIRE app.
      After 1 and 4 months of using the app, participants complete a telephone survey over 1 hour
      to discuss how they liked the app and its usefulness.
