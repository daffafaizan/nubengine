    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To compare changes in levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity over 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To compare changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and flexibility over
           24 weeks.

      Participants will be randomized to one of three groups. Participants in the control group
      will receive an activity monitor and educational materials, but will not have access to the
      interactive website. Participants randomized to the two intervention groups will be given
      access to a rewards program delivered via an interactive website, an activity monitor, and
      educational materials. Individual physical activity data can be viewed by study participants
      after uploading information from their monitors to the interactive website. One intervention
      group will receive minimal rewards, while the other group will receive immediate incentives
      as well as the minimal rewards as they move from one level to the other on the website.

      After 24 weeks, changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, flexibility, and
      physical function will be compared between the two intervention groups and the control group.
