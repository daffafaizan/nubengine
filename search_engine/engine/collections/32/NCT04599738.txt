      gastric emptying (GE) after the consumption of millet-based muffins in pre-diabetic and
      healthy participants. This was a single-blind, randomized controlled crossover study in which
      participants consumed one control muffin (wheat) and one test muffin (millet).This study
      investigated the effect of polyphenol-rich millet-based muffin on glycaemic response (GR),
      insulinaemic response (IR) and gastric emptying (GE) in healthy and pre-diabetic participants
      (people with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet
      high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes - the normal fasting blood glucose level is below 6.1
      mmol/l or 108 mg/dl).

      After potential participants have read the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and signed the
      consent form, they were screened during the first visit to measure fasting blood glucose
      (FBG; fasting blood glucose should be between 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l for pre-diabetic participants
      and < 6.1 mmol/l for healthy participants ).If eligible for the study, body weight and height
      and blood pressure were taken in the Functional Food Centre (currently known as Oxford
      Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health). If the fasting blood glucose test was less than
      6.1mmol/l (participants were informed of their fasting blood glucose result and given the
      choice either to do Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to check for Impaired Glucose
      Tolerance (IGT), participate in the healthy group or to be excluded). If the participant
      agreed to continue and had one or more of the pre-diabetes inclusion criteria, they could
      complete an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) over 2 hours.( An oral glucose tolerance test
      involves taking a fasting sample of blood and then taking a very sweet drink containing 75g
      of glucose. After having this drink participants had to stay at rest until a further blood
      sample is taken after 2 hours.) If their 2 h blood glucose result was between 7.9 to 11.0
      mmol/l, they were considered eligible to participate in the study as a prediabetic
      participant, and were asked to come for a subsequent visit in order to begin the study. If
      the participant does not have IGT, they had the option to take part in the study as a healthy
      participant.
