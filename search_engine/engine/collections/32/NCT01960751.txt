      Cerebrovascular Effects Induced by Low Dose Ionizing Radiation (CerebRad).

      CerebRad is a collaborative European project funded in 2011 within the 7th European Union
      (EU) framework programme, Nuclear Fission and Radiation Protection. CerebRad aims to identify
      the potential cognitive and cerebrovascular risks of radiation doses below 100 milliGray
      (mGy) when delivered to a young child (pre- or postnatally).
