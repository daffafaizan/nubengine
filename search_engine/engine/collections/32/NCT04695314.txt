      ocular hypertensive patients. Patients were recruited from the Temple Ophthalmology
      outpatient clinic. Primary open-angle glaucoma patients were recruited from those about to
      have SLT for additional intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering. OHTN patients were recruited
      from the clinic. The glaucoma patients performed a 5-minute foot massage on a foot massage
      board and the IOP was checked pre-massage, post-massage and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post
      massage. OHTN patients underwent a one-month drop washout and then performed a 5-minute
      massage using a 3D-printed shoe insert with the identical pressure checks. They then were
      randomly assigned to wear the shoe insert or a sham insert for one day. IOP was checked
      before inserting the insert and at the end of the day. The number of steps was recorded each
      day.
