      intra-articular injection of 7 mL 0.5% lidocaine and Group II (n=26) received 7 mL saline
      into painful knee for 3 times with one week intervals under USG guidance. VAS and WOMAC scale
      including pain, stiffness and physical function was used for the assessment of patients with
      osteoarthritis. Analgesic requirements were also recorded.

      The primary outcome parameter of this study was the pain scores. The sample size for the
      primary variable was calculated based on a standard deviation of 20 mm estimated from a
      previous study. A power analysis with a type II error of 20% at a two-sided 5% significance
      level estimated 22 patients per group to be included. Investigators included 26 patients per
      groups for possible missing date. Ï‡2 test for categorical data and independent samples t-test
      for the comparison of VAS and WOMAC scores between groups were used for statistical analysis.
