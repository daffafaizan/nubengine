      motivational interviewing as a means to counsel African Americans with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) to increase their walking. Additionally, we will determine the acceptance of
      culturally sensitive print material on managing PAD. Finally, we will utilize the pilot to
      develop best practice methods for successfully carrying out the full study.
