    
      This is a open label, parallel arm, randomized study of ISMN with or without vitamin C to
      improve exercise capacity and LV remodeling in CKD. Twenty subjects with CKD will be enrolled
      in this study and three different daily doses of sustained release isosorbide mononitrate
      (SR-ISMN) will be administered over time accompanied by a random administration of vitamin C
      in half of the subjects (500 mg three times daily). Before administration of SR-ISMN,
      baseline assessments will be performed. These include arterial tonometry, Doppler
      echocardiography, reflection magnitude measurements, a bicycle exercise test, activity
      monitoring, cardiac MRI, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, and blood drawing. After these
      assessments, a dose of 30 mg of SR-ISMN will be administered daily (either with or without
      vitamin C) for the first week, 60 mg SR-ISMN for the second week, and 120 mg for the third
      week. After each week, blood pressure and central hemodynamics will be assessed. The third
      week visit also includes the bicycle exercise study and initiating the long term dose (60 or
      120 mg) of SR-ISMN. In the long-term phase, blood pressure and hemodynamics are assessed at
      12-weeks post initiation of the study medication(s). After 24 weeks we will perform the final
      assessment, which includes the same tests performed during the baseline assessment.
      Enrollment will take place at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Penn
      Presbyterian Medical Center.
