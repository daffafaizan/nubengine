      with IC + LABA to answer the following questions:

      i. Is it possible to improve the pulmonary function (spirometry and plethysmography) of
      stable asthma patients, regularly treated with IC + LABA, who have a positive bronchodilator
      response, with the introduction of oral steroid?

      ii. What is the relationship among nasal, induced sputum and blood cytology, as a tool to
      observe inflammatory airway expression, in controlled and total controlled asthma patients?
      What will be these values response if oral steroids have been introduced?

      iii. What is the correlation between pulmonary volumes and airways inflammation to evaluate
      severity and control status in asthmatic patients, using plethysmography and HRCT? What will
      be these values response if oral steroids have been introduced?
