    
      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients included in the study must meet the following criteria:

        -  be hypertensive patients over 18 years

        -  with degenerative joint disease

        -  which regularly need analgesic treatment. They must submit BP in the consultation lower
           than 150 and 95 mmHg or lower than 135 and 85 mmHg if they have associated
           cardiovascular disease (stroke, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease) or
           diabetes mellitus.

      They can't receive pharmacological antihypertensive treatment, or this must be stable and
      unchanged in the last month.

      In relation to osteoarticular disease, they should have a degree of mild to moderate pain,
      with a score between 1 and 4 on a visual analog scale (VAS)

      Evaluation of results

      Primary endpoint:

      The primary endpoint is the change in mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour systolic
      BP, measured by ABPM, from baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Changes in systolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect
           baseline in both periods.

        -  24-hour, daytime and night-time (sleep) diastolic BP measured by ABPM: change from
           baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods

        -  Changes in diastolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect
           baseline in both periods.

        -  Percentage of patients maintaining clinical BP under 140 and 90 mmHg at the end of each
           period

        -  Degree of pain assessed by visual analog scale

        -  Consumption of rescue medication

        -  Therapeutic compliance
