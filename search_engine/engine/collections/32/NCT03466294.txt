      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Up to 42 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be
      treated with azacitidine and venetoclax until a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      response is achieved. Once patients achieve a MRD negative composite response, azacitidine
      will be discontinued and venetoclax dose will be decreased to "maintenance" dose.
