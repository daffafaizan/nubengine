      safety and effectiveness of the novel BCI device which involves newly developed dry electrode
      sensors and intervention game. Twenty children, aged 6-12 and diagnosed with Inattentive or
      Combined subtype of ADHD will be recruited for the study. This open-label, experimental arm
      will go through 8 weeks of BCI intervention.

      The second phase will be a randomized controlled trial involving 160 children. They will be
      randomized into the treatment or control arm. The treatment arm will receive 8 weeks of BCI
      intervention, similar to the experimental arm. The other group will serve as wait-list
      controls.

      The fMRI trial aims to examine the underlying neural processes explaining any therapeutic
      effects that may be seen.

      The study will enroll 70 children with ADHD, aged 6-12, who are participating in the main
      randomized controlled trial: 40 from the BrainpalTM intervention group and 30 from the
      control group; participants will undergo fMRI scan at Week 0 and 8 or Week 8 and 16. The
      study will recruit another 30 children aged 6-12 from the community as the healthy control
      group, who will undergo the same imaging procedure once. The scans will involve both
      functional and structural imaging.
