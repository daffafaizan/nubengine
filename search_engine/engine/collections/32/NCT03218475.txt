      of MR guided focused ultrasound treatment for cancer of the neck in 10 patients. The
      procedure will consist of a planning MRI scan and two treatment sessions where real time MRI
      thermometry is used in conjunction with a focused beam to heat the tissue to 40-42oC in the
      target field over a period of 20-30 seconds per treatment. All patients on the study will
      undergo palliative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. MRg-FU treatments will be delivered on
      fraction #1 and fraction #10 (50 Gy/20 regimen) or on fraction #1 and fraction #3 (35-45 Gy/5
      SBRT regimen). Palliative radiotherapy treatment will be administered to the treatment target
      lesion and in addition may encompass other tumour regions of the head and neck. The
      prescribed dose for patients who have not received previous radiotherapy will be between 50Gy
      over 4 weeks using IMRT or VMAT -based planning or 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions using SBRT
      technique; in previously irradiated patients, the dose will be determined at the discretion
      of the treating radiation oncologist. The patient will be assessed by a physician
      investigator and clinical research assistant (CRA) on the MRg-FU treatment dates, then 1 day,
      1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months afterward.
