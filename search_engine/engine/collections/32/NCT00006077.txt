      dopamine reuptake on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor
      response complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. In a controlled
      proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of NS2330 will be assessed through the use of
      validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical
      evaluations and laboratory tests.
