      lower limbs and trunk. It was used a machine "leg extension" for the training on the lower
      limbs. For upper limbs we used a pulley triceps machine and front pull in addition to free
      weights (dumbbells).

      In order to perform the exercise program the study followed all the recommendations
      established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (Ratamess et al., 2009). It was
      carried out two exercises for major muscle groups and one exercise for small muscles. The
      exercises were divided in 3 sets of 12 repetitions for each muscle group. The intensity of
      the exercises were 60% of one-maximum repetition (1RM).

      The exercise program involved pectoral exercises: crucifix and seat supine; biceps:
      alternated screw; triceps: triceps pulley; back: standing handsaw and pulled ahead;
      quadriceps: leg extensor and finally gluteo: standing hips extension.

      Control Group (CG) The control group was kept in a waiting list while continued with the
      standard pharmacological treatment during all the study. The patients were instructed to
      maintain their daily activities and to avoid any other non-pharmacological treatment. The
      exercise program was offered to the control group in the end of the study.
