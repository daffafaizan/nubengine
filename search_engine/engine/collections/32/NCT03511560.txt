      survival, the rate of late allograft loss following kidney transplantation has remained
      unchanged. Achievement of therapeutic, minimally toxic, tacrolimus concentrations early
      (within 30 days), after transplantation, is known to be important since achieving it has been
      associated with a lowered risk of acute rejection. The investigators hypothesize that using
      extended release tacrolimus (Envarsus XR, Veloxis), will provide more stable, more effective,
      and less toxic levels of tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients. Therefore, the
      investigators propose to analyze the impact of the blood concentration normalized by the dose
      (C/D ratio) on kidney function after renal transplantation in experimental group that will be
      treated with Envarsus XR and the standard of care (SOC) group treated with twice a day
      tacrolimus.
