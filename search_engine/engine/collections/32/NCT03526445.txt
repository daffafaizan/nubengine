      signalling (or lack of) in the development of NAFLD. However, increasing evidence suggest
      that the other major gluco-regulatory pancreatic hormone glucagon is also implicated in lipid
      metabolism and recent human data from studies investigating the effect of glucagon receptor
      antagonism suggest that glucagon signalling may be essential for maintaining a fat-free
      liver. This, combined with observations of increased degree of hepatic steatosis in patients
      after total pancreatectomy, who are devoid of pancreatic glucagon and typically are lean and
      peripherally insulin sensitive, suggests that glucagon may play a hitherto unrecognised role
      in the pathophysiology of NAFLD.

      The hypothesis of the study is that exogenously delivered glucagon will drive hepatic
      metabolism in a lipolytic direction and increase resting energy expenditure without affecting
      appetite and food intake.

      The acute effects of exogeneous glucagon infusion on hepatic lipid metabolism will be
      evaluated in patients after total pancreatectomy (no endogenous pancreatic hormones), in
      patients with type 1 diabetes (no endogenous insulin production) and in healthy controls
      (preserved endogenous pancreatic hormones).
