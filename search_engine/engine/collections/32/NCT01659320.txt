      do not respond satisfactorily to antidepressant therapy alone gain any benefit from taking
      minocycline alone or in addition to their antidepressants. Minocycline is a commonly used
      antibiotic medication with anti-inflammatory properties. It is hoped that information gained
      from this study will help the investigators better understand the role of inflammation in
      depression, and whether decreasing inflammation will lead to improvement in the symptoms of
      depression and cognitive function. Elderly patients with depression who remain symptomatic
      after at least 6 weeks of treatment with an antidepressant medication reaching a therapeutic
      dosage will be recruited and receive minocycline augmentation for 8 weeks. They may or may
      not remain on their antidepressants based on their physicians' clinical recommendation.
      Response to treatment will be measured weekly during the first four weeks and every other
      week thereafter using rating scales of depressive symptoms, intellectual functions and side
      effects.
