      skin-fold, waist and hip. Children and parents fill out questionnaires on social and
      educational background as well as motivation and expectations to the treatment. All Children
      are thereafter randomised into two groups:multi-disciplinary group intervention versus
      traditional information. The randomisation is stratified according to gender and degree of
      overweight (135%-145% and >145%) supposing that the degree of overweight may mirror the
      difficulties in loosing weight. The experimental intervention consists of one lecture of
      general nutrition, weekly psychological group sessions for the children followed by physical
      exercise, and separate bi-monthly group sessions for the parents. After six months children
      and parents go to separate group sessions once a month for six months. The control group is
      offered nutritional advice once with a brief follow-up after one month. The height and weight
      of the children is measured every month, and the fat % is measured with DEXA-scanning at
      on-set, after six months, and after twelve months
