      (without insulin). Their therapy has to be stable for at least 3 months prior enrollment.
      Besides anthropometric measures, patient's glycaemia, renal and liver function will be
      monitored. Safety and adverse events will be closely monitored and these are the primary
      outcomes of the study. The main outcome measure of the effectiveness is HbA1c (glycated
      hemoglobin). Patients will be given detailed instructions on how to prepare the tea and the
      dosing. The intervention will last 3 months and during that time patients will be asked not
      to change their dietary or lifestyle habits.
