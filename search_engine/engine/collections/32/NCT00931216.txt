      population, and services in Migori district, Kenya that provide ANC have been randomly
      assigned to receive "integrated ANC, PMTCT & HIV services" (intervention arm) or
      "non-integrated services" (control arm). At the intervention clinics, pregnant women will
      receive ANC, PMTCT and HIV care and treatment (including HAART if required) at the same
      clinic visit from the ANC provider. At the control clinics, women will receive antenatal care
      and PMTCT services with referral to the HIV care and treatment department located in the same
      facility. The control sites more closely resemble the current approach followed for care and
      treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women in Kenya. The content of ANC, PMTCT, and HIV care
      will be the same in the two study arms and will follow current Kenyan national guidelines.
      The only difference between the two arms will be the provider/location of HIV care and
      treatment.

      Outcomes will be compared for HIV-positive pregnant women who attend intervention versus
      control facilities. In addition we will conduct qualitative research with health care
      providers at the study health facilities in order to learn provider perspectives on the two
      service models and to explore the effects of integration on provider job satisfaction
      (including work load).
