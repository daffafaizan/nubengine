      cancer cells are thermo-sensitive, with significantly reduced heat shock protein (HSP)
      expression. Moreover, hyperthermia (42°C) causes repression of genes involved in the cell
      cycle and cellular growth and proliferation. Upon exposure to hyperthermic conditions, HSP
      expression is increased in normal cells. However, when cancer cells are exposed to
      hyperthermia, they initially express significantly less HSPs than normal cells, which
      sensitizes them to hyperthermia. Mild hyperthermia (43°C for less than two hours) induces
      extensive double-stranded DNA fragmentation and, at a later time, apoptosis in murine
      thymocytes. In cells with irreparable levels of DNA damage, apoptosis is the means of
      elimination.
