      prospective observational study designed to characterize clinical, neuro-imaging, laboratory
      and biomarker correlates of disease progression over 12-18 months. Subjects who complete a
      minimum of 12 months' participation in this trial will be candidates for enrollment in the
      future planned Phase 1 trial of intrastriatal delivery of mesenchymal stem cell
      (MSC)/Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
