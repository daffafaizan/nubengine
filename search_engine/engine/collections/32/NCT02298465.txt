      the shockwaves to reach the distal ureter. No serious complications had developed in the
      patients who underwent transgluteal approach. Only minor complications such as self-limiting
      hematuria, dysuria, or pain that had responded to oral analgesics. There were no serious
      complications encountered in children as well. In the most recent retrospective review by
      Tolley et al, they had revealed that patients who had underwent transgluteal ESWL for distal
      ureteric stones had an improved stone-free rate of 78% in the transgluteal group versus 40%
      in the prone group after one session of shockwave lithotripsy and a stone-free rate of 92%
      versus 63% respectively after two sessions of shockwave lithotripsy. This has been speculated
      to be due to the presence of bowel gas attenuating the shockwaves as well as a long
      skin-to-stone distance in the prone position.
