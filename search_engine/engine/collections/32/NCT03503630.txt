    
      The purpose of this study is to show that the addition of COMPOUND 2055269, an
      immunotherapeutic drug, to Folfox chemotherapy will improve the pathologic complete response
      rate in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      COMPOUND 2055269 has demonstrated meaningful clinical activity across various tumor types and
      treatment settings. No clinical trial is conducted over COMPOUND 2055269 in locally-advanced
      rectal adenocarcinoma.
