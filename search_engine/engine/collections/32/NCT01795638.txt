      gestation, who are admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at University of Cincinnati
      Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio. Infants are randomized to receive either 4 meq/kg/day
      supplemental sodium or an equal amount of sterile water on days of life 7-35. Institutional
      data from 2008 revealed that a sample size of 56 infants completing the study will detect a
      15% difference in the primary outcome of weight gain with 80% power and an alpha error of
      0.05. Allowing that 33% drop-out rate (infants may be transferred to another hospital,
      expire, or be discharged prior to day of life 35), we choose to randomize 75 infants. Calorie
      intake, serum sodium, weight gain, urine sodium were monitored weekly till 35 days of life or
      discharge. Infants were assessed for common morbidities associated with prematurity including
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, systemic hypertension, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing
      enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity.
