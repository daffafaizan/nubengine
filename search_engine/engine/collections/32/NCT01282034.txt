    
      Post-operative MRI exams will be carried out for each patient during the follow-up visit, at
      6, 12 and 24 months post-op., and centrally blind evaluated by two senior radiologists.

      STATISTICS The study has been designed to demonstrate the superiority of MaioRegen® compared
      to marrow stimulation techniques.

      On the basis of previous evidence and, assuming a minimum difference in the modification of
      the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Score between MaioRegen® and the control therapy, the
      sample size was estimated in 74 patients for group (power=90%, first type error α=5%,
      drop-outs=10%), for a total sample size of 148 subjects.

      The analysis of the primary end-point will be the evaluation of change from baseline to two
      years, in IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Score, comparing the results between the two
      groups.

      Secondary end-points (functional improvement, quality of life improvement, tissue
      regeneration) will undergo the same analyses as the primary end-point, for each follow-up
      visit.

      Frequency tables will be provided for overall judgement of the treatment. The incidence and
      gravity frequency of eventual events after surgery will be tabulated.

      The study will be conducted after approval by the ethics committee board of each centre and
      possibly by the national competent authorities.
