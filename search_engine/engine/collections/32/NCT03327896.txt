      complexity (as assessed by characteristics of the patients' geocoded addresses) will be
      tested for significant association with patient level outcomes (meeting or not meeting a
      specific standard of care). These indicators will be assessed in 4 cohorts: 2 cohorts of
      patients identified in electronic health records of Clinical Research Networks of community
      health centers, and 2 cohorts of patients insured by Medicaid in 2015 (Oregon and Florida
      Medicaid cohorts). Due to limitations in the available data, some quality indicators can only
      be evaluated in a subset of the cohorts. The consistency of specific social complexity
      indicators, referred to as Community Vital Signs (CVS), will be evaluated across the cohorts
      and quality metrics.

      In the second stage, CVS indicators that contributed consistently to models at the patient
      level will be evaluated for their effect on provider ranking on quality metrics if the
      metrics are adjusted for the social complexity of the providers' patient panel in addition to
      the panels' clinical complexity.
