      (specifically interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and depression symptoms becomes clearer, clinical trials
      to evaluate effective and novel treatments are needed. As there have been no published
      tocilizumab trials among patients with major depression, this pilot study will adopt a
      single-arm, open-label design. Due to the notion that inflammatory cytokines may play a role
      in a sub-type of depression, this study will recruit patients with treatment refractory major
      depressive disorder, for whom established depression treatments have not been effective. In
      conducting this trial, the investigators seek to examine the potential role of tocilizumab as
      an augmentation agent, with the hypothesis that it could reduce depression symptomatology in
      patients with major depression who have not experienced symptom reduction through more
      traditional antidepressant therapies.
