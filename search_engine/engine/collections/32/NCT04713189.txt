    
      Stage I: dose-response relationship and safety assessment of inhaled fentanyl aerosol in
      patients with breakthrough cancer pain. placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind
      randomized design is applied in this stage.

      Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be treated with inhaled fentanyl
      aerosol (4 of 6 episodes BTcp) or placebo (2of 6 episodes BTcp).Subjects will inhale fentanyl
      aerosol or placebo for each episode of BTcp with a starting dose of 25 µg every 4 minutes
      until adequate pain alleviation. The maximum doses are 6×25 µg.

      Stage II: The dosage regimen (number of puffs) will be depended on the data from Stage I.
      Subjects will inhale fentanyl aerosol not in the episode of breakthrough cancer pain with a
      starting dose of 25 µg every 4 minutes.
