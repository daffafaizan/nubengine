      that the investigators have done in all of the previous outpatient studies under both insulin
      only and bihormonal bionic pancreas control. The investigators are planning to transition the
      outpatient studies to an integrated bionic pancreas, the iLet, in the near future. The
      intended use of this device does not include remote monitoring, which would not be feasible
      on a commercial scale. Therefore, in this trial the investigators will test the effects on
      hypoglycemia of eliminating blood glucose related monitoring. In addition, the investigators
      will perform a pilot trial testing the effects of the bionic pancreas on food intake,
      exercise, weight and body composition. The primary purpose of this pilot is to assess the
      feasibility of performing these measurements in the context of a larger trial and to collect
      data that can be used to power sub-studies of pivotal trials looking at these outcomes.
      Finally, the investigators will test the accuracy of two new CGM devices to see if they have
      sufficient accuracy to provide glucose data to the bionic pancreas. If so, this would provide
      new options for users who may have difficulties with the only currently validated CGM for
      this purpose, the Dexcom G4 AP / G5 platform.
