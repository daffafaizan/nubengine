    
      A fragment of Breast/Ovarian tumors will be taken from a specimen or a cold biopsy, tissue
      from patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ovarian cancer before starting an induction
      treatment stage IIIc and IV pleural IFGO operable.

        -  Culturing the cells obtained from the tumor fragment by Oncomedics in a defined medium
           and provided for enriching tumor cells compared to stromal cells.

        -  Maintaining the cells in culture for 7 days.

        -  Effects of conventional chemotherapy (corresponding to protocols) on these cells for 72
           hours (growth chambers) by Oncomedics (chimio-oncogramme).

        -  For each chemotherapy tested, measuring the proportion of dead cells / total cells.

        -  Retained by Oncomedics results, not given to the nursing team. The patient will be
           treated and followed up in the usual way.

        -  At the end of the study, comparing the in vitro results (chimio-oncogramme) to the
           patient response to the same chemotherapy.
