    
      This is a randomized phase II trial to evaluate the effect of transarterial radioembolisation
      with yttrium-90 microspheres (SIRT) and transarterial chemoembolisation with cisplatin
      (DSM-TACE) in patients with liver metastases due to advanced uveal melanoma in terms of
      progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints.

      Patients in study arm A will receive transarterial radioembolisation one time only. Patients
      in study arm B will receive transarterial chemoembolisation every 4 to 6 weeks until complete
      tumor devascularisation is observed or disease progression or intolerable toxicity occur. At
      the time of local tumor progression patients will be offered the other treatment respectively
      (either SIRT or DSM-TACE) as part of the study.
