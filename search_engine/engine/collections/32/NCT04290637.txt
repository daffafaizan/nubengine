      swimming or discontinuation of sea swimming for 4-6 weeks, stratified by the type of swimmer
      (those who purely immerse in the water for a brief period of time versus those who actually
      swim [i.e., exercise] in the water) and use of blood pressure medication at the time of study
      commencement (yes or no), using a block size of four to maintain balance between intervention
      arms. In line with previous studies that assessed the impact of swimming intervention on BP,
      participants randomized to the swimming arm should pursue sea swimming 2 or more days/week.
