      have shown feasibility and safety in dedicated centres. Compared to thoracotomy the procedure
      results in at least equal oncologic results and survival, perhaps better.

      Most series do not publish their early experience. They are retrospective and report on
      lobectomies and segmentectomies, excluding the live-saving pneumonectomies. They are
      potentially ignoring the intention-to-treat principle, excluding conversions.

      Based on scarce existing literature and conference worst-case presentations a pattern of the
      most common intraoperative major complications can be drawn In Europe, a large percentage of
      high-volume-centres have now successfully implemented a vats lobectomy program. In this era
      with low-volume-centres switching into vats anatomical resections, it is important to focus
      on potentially life-threatening complications. To be aware of potential hazards is the best
      way to avoid them.
