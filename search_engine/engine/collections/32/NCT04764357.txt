      scalp cooling system and as per the manufacturers recommendations. Scalp cooling will begin
      30-45 minutes prior to administration of each chemotherapy (45 minutes for those with thick
      or coarse hair types). Scalp temperature will be maintained at +3°C (37°F) throughout drug
      administration and for 90-120 minutes after discontinuing the infusion.

      A trained study staff member will be present to place the cool cap on the participant, ensure
      proper fit, begin the cooling process, and ensure functionality. The bedside nurse on the
      inpatient unit will monitor the participants during the duration of cool cap therapy while
      also receiving chemotherapy infusion. A trained study team member will be available for any
      questions or issues that may arise during this time. When the participant is ready to remove
      the cooling cap a trained study team member will return to shut off the device, remove the
      cap, and assess the participant.
