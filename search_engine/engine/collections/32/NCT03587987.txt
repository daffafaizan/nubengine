    
      Comparison of two different neonatal resuscitation devices (Neopuff and rPAP) in the Neonatal
      Unit in Cork University Maternity Hospital. Participants will use the devices on a mannequin.
      Performance of the two devices is judged by comparing the tidal volumes produced.

      Consultants) of the neonatal unit.
