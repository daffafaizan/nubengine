    
      Introduction: Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is a procedure that is performed via flexible
      bronchoscopy under moderate sedation for visualization of lymph nodes in the chest and biopsy
      under real-time guidance for the staging of lung cancer or evaluation of enlarged lymph
      nodes. In addition, lung lesions or masses can be visualized and biopsied in the same
      sitting. The use of EBUS has enhanced the safety and diagnostic yield of flexible
      bronchoscopy.

      Aim: The data of patients with suspected lung cancer or undiagnosed lymph node enlargement in
      whom bronchoscopy with EBUS guidance is clinically indicated will be collected prospectively.

      Results from EBUS are considered positive if a specific diagnosis is obtained ( eg
      malignancy) or if lymphocytes are present in the lymph node biopsy, indicating accurate
      sampling of lymph node. In patients with non-diagnostic EBUS, the results from other
      procedures will be compared for analysis.
