      early ambulation and facilitates breast-feeding. Post-CS analgesia is usually multimodal. At
      our hospital, patients are routinely given a combination of parenteral paracetamol,
      metamizole and tramadol at fixed intervals with additional intravenous piritramide on demand.
      The well-known side effects of piritramide (nausea, vomiting, and sedation) may interfere
      with interaction between mother and child, breast-feeding and post-partum experience in a
      dose-dependent manner. Alternative strategies to reduce rescue opioid analgesic consumption
      post-CS section are, therefore, required.

      A 2009 Cochrane review concluded that wound infiltration with local analgesic after CS
      reduced opioid consumption. In addition, two regional anesthetic techniques, the transversus
      abdominis plane (TAP) block and the quadratus lumborum block (QLB), have been shown in
      multiple studies to reduce post-operative opioid consumption after CS. A recent randomized
      controlled trial showed that QLB is more effective in reducing morphine consumption post-CS
      compared to TAP.

      Telnes et al. compared TAP block with wound infiltration with local anesthetic following CS.
      They found no reduction in cumulative morphine consumption and more pronounced sedation
      associated with TAP block. No randomized controlled trial to date, however, compared the
      analgesic effect of QLB with infiltration of the wound after CS.

      The objective of the study is to compare the analgesic effect of QLB type 2 with wound
      infiltration after CS.
