      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of asoprisnil 5 mg, 10 mg
      and 25 mg, compared to placebo, taken daily for 12 weeks by women with one or more uterine
      fibroids, confirmed by ultrasound. Upon completion, subjects at participating sites will be
      allowed to enter an open-label extension study
