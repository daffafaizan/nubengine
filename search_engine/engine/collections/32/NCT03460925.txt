    
      Aim of the study is to define the percentage of patients with down-staging and clinical
      response after having undergone stereotactic radiotherapy + chemotherapy with neoadjuvant
      intent for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma or "borderline resectable" at the time of
      diagnosis.

      The study evaluates the response to therapy in terms of resectability, of acute and delayed
      treatment-related toxicity, of overall survival and progression-free survival and also
      assesses patient's quality of life.
