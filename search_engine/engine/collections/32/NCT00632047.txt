        -  To investigate the effectiveness of well planned health education programs (HEP) and
           low-cost screening methods (e.g., clinical breast examination [CBE] and visual
           inspection of the cervix painted with 4% acetic acid [VIA]) in down-staging and reducing
           the incidence of and mortality due to breast and cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (intervention): Participants undergo intervention comprising health education
           programs (HEP), clinical breast examination (CBE), and visual inspection of the cervix
           painted with 4% acetic acid (VIA) every 2 years for up to 8 years. Participants also
           undergo active surveillance over 8 years.

        -  Arm II (control): Participants receive one HEP. Participants also undergo active
           surveillance over 8 years.
