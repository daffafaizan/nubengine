    
      This study is intended to evaluate performance of a new design pulse oximeter (test device)
      manufactured by Nihon Kohden Corporation sufficiently to support performance claims for an
      FDA 510K submission or ISO technical file. Specifically, SpO2 and pulse rate accuracy will be
      assessed for a Nihon Kohden OLV-4202 pulse oximeter with adult patients under a controlled
      setting of varying levels of inhaled oxygen concentration levels for patients during
      controlled motion.
