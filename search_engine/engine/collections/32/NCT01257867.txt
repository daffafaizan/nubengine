      lithium in drinking water have lower rates of suicide. This study will evaluate the effects
      of drinking EDJ (pronounced "edge") lithia spring water (which comes from a natural spring in
      the Rocky Mountains and contains trace amounts [0.68 mg/litre] of lithium) for 4 weeks,
      compared to drinking commercially available bottled water (which contains no lithium at all)
      for 4 weeks.

      This pilot study has been designed as an 8-week randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study
      in 15 healthy male participants. Eligible participants will use lithia water or control water
      for daily ingestion for 4 weeks, then cross over to the other condition for another 4 weeks.
      At baseline and after each 4-week condition, participants will complete self-report
      questionnaires of mood, cognition and well-being, and blood samples will be assayed for BDNF
      and oxidative stress protein markers.
