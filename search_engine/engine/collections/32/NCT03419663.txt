      grain in relation to the risk of gastric cancer up to October 2017. Summary odd ratios (OR)
      and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by using either random effect models or
      fixed effect models according to the heterogeneity of included studies. Subgroup analysis,
      heterogeneity, and publication bias were also performed.
