    
      This is a Phase I study evaluating safety and tolerability of autologous BM-MSCs in chronic
      pancreatitis patients who undergo total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation
      (TP-IAT). CCT-BMMSC will be infused at one of the following doses: (Tier 1), 20x10^6 cell per
      patient, (Tier 2), 50x10^6 cell per patient, and (Tier 3), 100x10^6 cell per patient.

      Primary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of infusion of fresh
      autologous bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal stromal cells after islet transplantation in
      chronic pancreatitis patients who undergo TP-IAT. The investigators plan to enroll 24
      patients for the whole study. The duration of this study is 12 months. The investigators
      anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of commencement.

      Secondary objective: Efficacy of infusion of fresh autologous bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal
      stromal cells together after islet transplantation in chronic pancreatitis patients who
      undergo TP-IAT as assessed through onset of diabetes, glycemic control, pain relief and
      quality of life index.

      Safety variables: Adverse events (AEs), Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry,
      urinalysis), Vital signs
