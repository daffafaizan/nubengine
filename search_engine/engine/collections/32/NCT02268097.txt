      by increasing surgeons. When performing the resection, several principles such as restoring
      the original patellar thickness, avoiding over or under resection must be complied in order
      to achieve satisfactory outcomes.This study was conducted to compared the outcomes of two
      commonly adopted methods for performing patellar resection in total knee arthroplasty. One
      hundred patients with osteoarthritis were recruited in the clinical trial using Nexgen Legacy
      Posterior Stabilized-Flex prosthesis. Patients were randomized to receive "free-hand"
      technique and "resection guide" technique when performing patellar resection in total knee
      arthroplasty. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at follow-up visits conducted at
      twelve months, at twenty-four months. Clinical outcome was assessed and compared with use of
      the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), range of motion, Knee Society Score (KSS), Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Short Form-36
      (SF-36). Patellar alignment was assessed before surgery and at each follow-up by measuring
      the patellar tilt (PT) and lateral patellar displacement (PD). Prosthetic position and leg
      alignment were also compared between the two groups.
