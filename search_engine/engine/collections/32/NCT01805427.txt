    
      Our primary endpoint is the individual trough concentrations of interest at steady state for
      NNRTI or boosted PI; Principal outcome measure: comparison of the concentrations between
      patients <25kg/m2 and patients<25kg/m2

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Occurrence of virologic failure

        -  Occurrence of clinical/biological adverse events

        -  Percentage of patients with concentration within the therapeutic range

        -  Body composition Secondary outcome measures: comparison of the occurrence of virologic
           failure, occurrence or adverse event, patients with concentration within the therapeutic
           range between groups. Correlation between body composition and concentration.

      Methodology, study design:

      open-labelled monocentric study.

      Sample size:

      It will be a descriptive experimental study involving 120 overweight subjects, 120 normal
      weight subjects
