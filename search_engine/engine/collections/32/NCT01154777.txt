      functional and behavioral parameters in individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders
      when 60 Neurofeedback training sessions are applied. The long term objectives for these
      individuals include improvement of quality of daily functioning, better ability to integrate
      and navigate within society, and overall to decrease the limitations caused by the
      disability. Additionally, increasing awareness by the public, as well as healthcare providers
      and legislation, that Neurofeedback is a viable intervention which may contribute not only to
      a significant reduction of the level of disability for affected individuals, but also in
      reducing required lifetime costs of healthcare. Hopefully in the future Neurofeedback
      training would be incorporated as a standard of care for ASD. As of today, there are around
      1000 trained Neurofeedback practitioners in the US who are offering this intervention to a
      very limited number of individuals due to lack of recognition of NFB benefits.
