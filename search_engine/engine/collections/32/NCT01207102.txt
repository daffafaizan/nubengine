      tumors including breast cancer. As cytotoxins, they have been studied alone and in
      combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, and have been incorporated into treatment
      regimens for women who fail previous anthracycline-based therapies. Although both agents are
      notable for favorable response rates, they are also associated with a variety of adverse
      events, some of which may be dose-limiting and having a negative effect on quality of life:
      myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis/mucositis, short- and long-term
      neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, alopecia and hypersensitivity reactions.

      As second-generation compounds, AbraxaneÂ® and carboplatin have been shown to improve response
      rates and may mediate some of the toxicities associated with paclitaxel and cisplatin,
      respectively. Of particular interest is Abraxane's potential to reduce allergic reactions
      associated with other taxanes.

      This study combines these two agents: primarily, to evaluate progression-free survival; and
      secondarily, to assess the feasibility and tolerability of this regimen to treat poor
      prognosis metastatic breast cancer patients.
