      study with blinded analysis of the ultrasound data in 28 patients with known coronary artery
      disease, normal systolic cardiac function and with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes including
      impaired glucose tolerance who are treated by ≤1 oral antidiabetic medication. After
      recruitment and informed consent, patients are randomized to two treatment arms which takes
      into account age and presence or absence of therapy with statins.

      In one treatment arm, therapy is based on insulin glargine sc o.d., while in the other
      treatment arm, therapy is based on oral metformin, up to 2000 mg daily. Both treatment arms
      will be titrated to the target of fasting glucose ≤110 mg/dl during the first 12 weeks. The
      patients in the insulin treatment arm will be instructed in the skills of self-medication by
      the departmental diabetic teaching programme prior to starting study medication and are
      encouraged to keep records of any episode of hypoglycemia throughout the study.Outpatients
      visits for metabolic control and ultrasound assessment are at weeks 4, 12 and 24 after
      baseline and are associated with life style instructions for all patients.
