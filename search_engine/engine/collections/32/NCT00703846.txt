    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-group study to assess the long-term safety of
      twice daily treatment with Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% in subjects with seborrheic
      dermatitis.

      The study subjects must have seborrheic dermatitis with an Investigator's Static Global
      Assessment (ISGA) of 2, 3, or 4 at baseline. In addition, subjects must have a discrete,
      evaluable target area of at least 0.5 cm2, with a score of 2, 3, or 4 for erythema and
      scaling.

      All subjects will apply Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% topically twice a day (morning and
      evening) to all seborrheic dermatitis lesions on the face, scalp, ears, neck, and chest.
      Study product should be applied at the first sign of a seborrheic dermatitis flare, and twice
      daily applications should continue until the area(s) has cleared. All symptom flares should
      be treated throughout the 12-month study period. Study visits will occur at baseline (day 1)
      and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, 39, and 52 (or early withdrawal). See the study flowchart (section
      3) for the assessments to be performed at each visit. Primary Objective: To assess the
      long-term safety of Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.
