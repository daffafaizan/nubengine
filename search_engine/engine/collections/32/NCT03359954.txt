      I. To evaluate the change in percent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as a continuous
      variable before and after preoperative boost radiotherapy (RT) in hormone receptor
      (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor2 (HER2)- breast cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of preoperative boost RT administered to patients with HR+/HER2-
      breast cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To assess the mechanisms of cell death induced by preoperative boost RT.

        -  II. To assess immunologic and molecular responses to preoperative boost RT.

        -  III. To assess the correlations between immune markers, cell death markers, and their
           changes during treatment.

        -  IV. To determine if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to predict breast tumor
           response to neoadjuvant radiation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo boost radiation therapy 6-8 days before breast surgery. After surgery,
      patients continue to receive standard of care radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months.
