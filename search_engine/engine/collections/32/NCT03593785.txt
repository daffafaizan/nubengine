    
      This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted at a single study
      center in United States of America. Up to 56 healthy male subjects with elevated LDL-C
      levels, aged 18 to 60 years will be randomized into this study. This study will consist of 5
      cohorts with 8 subjects in each. Depending on emerging data, 2 additional cohorts may be
      added to test additional dose levels at the discretion of the sponsor, if the pre-defined
      exposure limits and stopping criteria have not been reached at previous administered doses.
      The study will comprise of 3 periods:

        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days.

        -  A treatment period:

        -  A follow-up period of 16 weeks

      In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive a single SC dose of AZD8233 and 2
      subjects randomized to receive placebo. Single dose of AZD8233 SC injection (40 mg/mL) will
      be administered in each cohort as follows:

      Cohort 1: Dose 1 (starting dose) Cohort 2: Dose 2 (provisional dose) Cohort 3: Dose 3
      (provisional dose) Cohort 4: Dose 4 (provisional dose) Cohort 5: Dose 5 (provisional dose)
      Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel cohort, such
      that 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo and 1 subject will be randomized to
      receive AZD8233.

      In the treatment period, the sentinel and non-sentinel subjects will be resident at the
      clinical unit from the day before IMP administration (Day -1) until at least 72 hours and 48
      hours after IMP administration, respectively.

      Sentinel will have 10 follow-up visits (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 weeks post-dose).
      Non-sentinel subjects will have 11 follow-up visits (on Day 4 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
      14 and 16 weeks post-dose).

      The follow-up period (16 weeks) has been selected based on the predicted terminal half-life
      of AZD8233 in man (predicted to be 2 to 3 weeks), to cover at least 5 half-lives.

      Following review of data from the study, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) may decide to:

        -  Adjust the window for sentinel dosing.

        -  Adjust the length of data collection prior to dose-escalation diction.

        -  Prolong the length of the stay at the Clinical Unit.

        -  Adjust the timing and number of assessments and/or blood/urine samples for subsequent
           cohorts.

        -  Adjust the length of the Follow-up Period. Each subject will be involved in the study
           for up to 20 weeks.
