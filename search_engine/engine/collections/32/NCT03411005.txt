    
      Each subject will be part of 8 different experimental diets, and randomly assigned to one of
      the diets every time.

      4 reference diet would be based on egg protein composition, 3 sorghum diets would have
      protein from cooked sorghum and 1 mixed meal would comprise of cooked sorghum and lentils.

      Each experimental diet will be studied over 3 days: 2 adaptation and 1 study day. The 2
      adaptation meals would be consumed at home. On the study day 3, following a 12-h overnight
      fast, subjects will come to the research unit at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON
      for a period of 7.5 h and consume the diet as 9 hourly meals. The first 3 meals would be
      consumed at home.

      For the duration of all experiments, subjects will consume a daily multivitamin supplement to
      ensure adequate vitamin intake.

      Measurements:

      Resting energy expenditure (REE) will be measured by open-circuit indirect calorimetry Body
      composition (fat and fat free mass) will be measured by BIA and Skin Fold. Breath samples
      will be collected after the 4th and 7th meals.
