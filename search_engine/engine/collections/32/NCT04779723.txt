      Half of the people in this world consider themselves overweight or obese. Obesity is
      challenging to control by medical therapy and drug treatment. The most effective way to treat
      obesity is bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is a "gold
      standard" bariatric surgical procedure. Recently there is much attention gained by
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Therefore, we decided to conduct this comparative
      study to compare the early post-op complications of LSG with LRYGB technique in patients
      undergoing bariatric surgery.
