    
      Subjects will be included during an inclusion visit (within 7 days post generator
      replacement/Upgrade (R/U)), and followed up at a Post Replacement Visit (1-6 months post
      R/U), at 12 months post R/U, at 18 months post R/U and at 24 months post R/U. These Follow-Up
      visits will be performed in clinic except for the visit 18 months post R/U which could be
      performed through device Remote Monitoring.

      Additional follow-ups can be performed at physician's discretion. Data on reportable adverse
      events will be collected throughout the study. All study data will be collected using an
      Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.

      All delivered anti-tachycardia therapies (shock/ATP) will be reviewed by an independent board
      of experts in order to evaluate appropriateness.

      The programming of the device parameters is at physician's discretion (suggested settings:
      Slow VT Monitoring zone 150-185 bpm with 30 cycles persistence; VT Zone 185-230 bpm with 16
      cycles persistence; Remote-Monitoring activated)
