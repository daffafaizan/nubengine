    
      Background The field of kidney transplantation currently lacks robust models to predict
      long-term allograft failure, which represents a major unmet need in clinical care and
      clinical trials. This study aims to generate and validate an accessible scoring system that
      predicts individual patients' risk of long-term kidney allograft failure.

      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)

      A score based on classical statistical approaches to model determinants of allograft and
      patient survival (Cox model, multinomial regression). These models will be further completed
      with statistical approaches derived from artificial intelligence and machine learning.
