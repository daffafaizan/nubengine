    
      A 30-month community survey will be conducted, and the survey will be divided into three
      phases, namely study preparation and subject recruitment (6 months), data collection (18
      months), and data entry and analysis (6 months).

      A survey of 15000 people aged 50 years or older identified in community facilities (e.g.,
      neighbourhood elderly centre, social centre for the elderly) will be conducted. The
      participants will be invited to their affiliated centres for a brief screening using the
      FRAIL scale and assessment. A series of community health talks or activities on frailty will
      be offered to the participants based on the frailty status. Questionnaire and screening tools
      will be administered by trained researchers.

      The primary outcome will be the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty. Secondary outcomes
      will cover physical performance measures including hand-grip strength and 5-chair stand test.
      Anthropometric and demographic data will also be collected using standardized methods and
      questionnaires respectively.

      Views of participants taking part in a community health talks or activities on frailty about
      what the participants felt or had gained from participating, concerns, and suggestions for
      change or improvement will be explored by client satisfaction questionnaires.
