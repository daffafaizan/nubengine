      laser treatment for women previously treated for gynecological indications with 3 consecutive
      laser treatments. Women will be randomized to one of 2 groups: 1. Study group-additional
      single laser treatment. 2. Control group-single sham laser treatment. All women will fill out
      validated questionnaires regarding sexual function, urinary stress incontinence and
      satisfaction after treatment. All women will be followed for an additional 6 months to
      evaluate the length of effect.
