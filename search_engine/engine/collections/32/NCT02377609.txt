      by up to 100 liver and 100 kidney transplant patients. Subjects who will be attending a
      routine outpatient follow-up visit will be asked to provide 3 whole blood venepuncture
      samples (each sample = 3 mL blood) and 3 finger prick DBS blood samples at predose and at 1
      and 3 hours postdose. All subjects will be discharged from the study and clinical site at 3
