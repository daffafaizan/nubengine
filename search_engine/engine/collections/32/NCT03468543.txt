    
      This is a single center, open-label, single dose, 5-period study in 24 healthy male and
      female subjects, with an optional Period 6, if required. It is expected the study will be
      executed in 3 cohorts of 8 subjects, with each cohort participating in up to 2 study periods
      (total of up to 6 study periods). Cohort 3 may be conducted in parallel with Cohort 2.

      Subjects will be dosed in a sequential manner, as appropriate. Each subject will be
      administered up to 2 regimens (2 different prototype capsule formulations) across 2 study
      periods. There will be a minimum 35-day interval between each dose administration.

      Subjects will have an MRI scan performed on Days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 of each period to assess
      the gastric retentive properties of the formulation.
