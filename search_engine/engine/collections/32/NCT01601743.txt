      significance in that it will provide detailed behavioral and physiological data for a
      non-pharmacological intervention to treat stimulant addiction. Regular exercise is known to
      promote better mental and physical health, however the effects of exercise on cocaine use and
      craving in cocaine-dependent individuals has not been previously assessed. The Specific Aims
      include: 1) To evaluate the effects of regular exercise (running and walking) versus placebo
      (sitting) on basic fitness measures; 2) To evaluate the effects of exercise on objective and
      subjective measures of cocaine and nicotine use and craving. Participants will also receive a
      total of 12 sessions of a standardized series of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CCBT) modules, which are specifically designed for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
