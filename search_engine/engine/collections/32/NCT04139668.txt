      treatment-seeking adults with Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) will be recruited. All participants
      will receive 3 x 4ml intramuscular injections of Vivitrol (380mg naltrexone). Injections will
      be administered once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. In addition, all participants will receive a
      weekly psychological intervention (Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy; MET/CBT) for 12 weeks.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if the proposed Vivitrol dosing schedule, combined
      with MET/CBT, is appropriate for subsequent randomized controlled trials in people with CUD.
      This will be achieved by assessing the safety and effectiveness of 12 weeks open-label
      treatment with Vivitrol (3 x 4 ml intramuscular injections, 380mg naltrexone) combined with
      weekly MET/CBT.

      Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events during the 12 week treatment period, and
      up to 3 months follow-up. Effectiveness will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment and at 3
      month follow-up using: (1) seven-day point prevalence cannabis abstinence, (2) percentage of
      days of cannabis use, (3) amount of cannabis use, and (4) effects on withdrawal symptom
      scores, craving scores and number of urine samples screened positive for cannabis use.
