      MSCT submitted to core lab & sizing strategy pre-declared (annular sizing, supra-annular
      sizing, mix of both methods) Follow up: MSCT and TTE to cooper lab

      TAVI treatment Predilatation according to aortic annulus Dmin Evolut Pro (23-26-29) and
      Evolut R 34 XL Annular anchoring of the THV Postdilatation according to the operators'
      discretion Study Population All consecutive patients presenting with severe and symptomatic
      bicuspid aortic valve stenosis or mixed disease

      Inclusion Criteria 1. Age ≥18 years. 2. NYHA≥2 and/or syncope and/or angina. 3. Patient
      judged by the Heart Team as indicated for TAVI. 4. Anatomical suitability for
      transfemoral-TAVI with Evolut Pro or Evolut R XL, based on MSCT assessment.

      5. Estimated life-expectancy>1 year.

      Exclusion Criteria 1. Age <18 years 2. Asymptomatic patients 3. Estimated life expectancy<1
      year 4. Pure aortic regurgitation. 5. LVEF<20% 6. No baseline MSCT evaluation. 7. Unsuitable
      aortic root anatomy for Evolut Pro or XL. 8. Unsuitable peripheral vasculature for
      transfemoral Evolut Pro or XL. Primary Endpoint Valve performane Secondary endpoints 30 day
      and 1 year mortality Patient-prosthesis mismatch Ellipticity index at 30 days Follow-up 30
      days: physical examination, ECG, TTE /MSCT upon operators' judgement

      1 year: physical examination, ECG, TTE.
