      biomarkers, their combinations or temporal changes in the level can be associated with an
      increased risk of preterm delivery. Blood samples at three time points in pregnancy will be
      collected from the study participants. The first two blood draws will be timed to coincide
      with the first and second trimester maternal serum testing. The third blood draw will
      coincide with the screening for gestational diabetes. Pregnancy outcome information will be
      collected from the physicians and linked to the subject samples.

      Subject samples from a case-control patient group will be analyzed by the serum screening
      biochemical assay. Statistical analyses will be performed to achieve the study objectives.

      NOTE: This study is recruiting in Florida, USA. The laboratory data coordination is being
      performed in Massachusetts, USA and New Mexico, USA. New study locations will be identified
      on an ongoing basis.
