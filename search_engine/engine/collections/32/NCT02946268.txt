      postoperative analgesia when using continuous interscalene peripheral nerve catheters for
      shoulder surgery. New technology has emerged with electronic pumps that permit intermittent
      mandatory boluses of local anesthetic to be delivered in addition to continuous infusions.
      The pump would automatically deliver a bolus at a given interval, but would otherwise be idle
      for a period of time. This technology could improve the efficacy of local anesthetics, and
      thereby improve postoperative analgesia.

      Continuous peripheral nerve catheters have been shown to improve pain control in several
      orthopedic surgical procedures when compared to opioids. However, it is not uncommon for
      patients to experience breakthrough pain in spite of a functional peripheral nerve block.
      Many times, this breakthrough pain can be managed with a bolus of local anesthetic
      administered by an anesthesia provider. Until recently, the vast majority of peripheral nerve
      catheter infusion pumps have only had the capability of providing a constant rate of local
      anesthetic administration. Newer technology allows for infusion pumps to deliver intermittent
      mandatory boluses of local anesthetic. This technique of local anesthetic administration has
      previously been evaluated with popliteal nerve blocks, but to our knowledge has never been
      evaluated for use with interscalene nerve catheters.

      Currently, data would support the idea that a bolus of local anesthetic can improve analgesia
      with decreased side effects compared to a continuous infusion. However, there is little data
      evaluating the optimal volume of bolus, the optimal speed of delivery, or the optimal
      interval between local anesthetic boluses.
