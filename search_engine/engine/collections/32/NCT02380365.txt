    
      Primary endpoint:

      â€¢ prevalence of significant QTc-interval prolongation (500 msec or above) after lung
      transplantation

      Key secondary endpoint(s):

        -  prevalence of any QTc-interval prolongation (>440 msec ) after lung transplantation

        -  prevalence of PQ prolongation (200 msec sec or above) after lung transplantation

        -  prevalence of QRS prolongation (120 msec or above) after lung transplantation

        -  prevalence of QTc-prolonging drugs in drug regimen before and after lung transplantation

        -  influence of long-term neo-macrolide (e.g. azithromycin) on QTc interval after lung
           transplantation

        -  intra-individual difference of QTc interval before and after lung transplantation

        -  incidence of any QTc-interval prolongation(>440 msec ) after lung transplantation

        -  incidence of any QTc-interval prolongation (>440 msec or increase by 50msec or above)
           after initiation of new QTc prolonging drugs (especially neo-macrolides)

        -  reversal of QTc-interval prolongation (440 msec or lower or decrease by 50msec or above)
           after stopping any QTc prolonging drug

        -  Assessment of safety:

        -  Incidence of new onset heart rhythm disorder during 6 months of follow-up
