      relief of migraine after sleep. In older migraine sufferers migraine is sometimes triggered
      with sleep changes. Occurrence of migraine in the early morning is very common. Therefore in
      these individuals regulation of sleep may improve the frequency of migraine. Recent PET
      studies done during migraine demonstrated activation of hypothalamus during migraine. In
      light of this new data and the known action of ramelteon on the melatonin receptors it may
      theoretically provide an insight on a possible mechanism of action in migraine.
