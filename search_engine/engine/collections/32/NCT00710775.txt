      and calcified. This leads to a severe narrowing of the valve orifice, which causes chest
      pain, heart failure and eventually death. The condition is currently treated with open chest
      surgical valve replacement on cardiopulmonary bypass. Heart Leaflet Technologies has
      developed an aortic valve prosthesis that can be delivered to the stenotic aortic valve
      through a catheter inserted in the femoral artery.

      The purpose of this study is to confirm that the dimensions of the HLT valve are appropriate
      for patients with aortic valve stenosis. There is no animal model of aortic valve stenosis.
      Heart Leaflet Technologies has performed extensive device geometry and deployment testing on
      fixed cadaveric hearts with calcified cusps and aortic stenosis. HLT has also performed a
      number of preclinical animal experiments to verify deliverability and device function in
      vivo.
