      clinical trial of the effect of intra-articular triamcinolone 40 mg injectable suspension,
      administered every 3 months over two years (for a total of 8 doses). The randomization was
      stratified by the baseline radiographic severity of knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence grade of 2
      or 3) and gender. An interim analysis would have been conducted after the first half of
      participants has completed the trial. This interim analysis would have allowed the trial to
      be stopped early for either success or futility, or allow the trial to continue if neither
      success nor futility has been established. However, the plan for interim analysis was
      eliminated with the support of the DSMB because of feasibility issues for completing
      cartilage measurements contemporaneously and because early trial cessation would preclude
      analysis of informative secondary outcomes. The primary structural outcome objective in this
      study was cartilage volume loss; secondary structural outcomes included peri-articular bone
      marrow lesions (BML), tibial peri-articular bone density ratio (paBMD). The primary clinical
      outcome objective was the pain domain of the WOMAC© LK3.1; secondary clinical outcomes
      included WOMAC© LK3.1 stiffness and function scores and physical function tests.
