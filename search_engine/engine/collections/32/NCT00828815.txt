    
      This is a Phase I, open-label (patient and trial doctor know what medication you are taking
      at any point in time during the trial), add-on trial in patients who are on stable sublingual
      (placed in the mouth under the tongue until it disolves) buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance
      therapy, to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic effect of multiple-dose TMC125 on
      buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine administered as buprenorphine/naloxone. The study
      population will consist of 16 HIV-negative opioid-dependent patients on stable individualized
      sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy. Patients will first participate in a 2
      weeks run-in period with supervised buprenorphine/naloxone intake. Subsequently, patients
      will receive TMC125 200 mg orally twice daily for 14 days added to their
      buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. During the treatment period from Day 1 to Day 14, the
      individualized buprenorphine/naloxone treatment will be continued with co-administration of
      TMC125. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine will be
      determined on Days -1 and 14 up to 24 hours postdose. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC125
      will be determined on Day 14 up to 12 hours postdose. Pharmacodynamic assessments of symptoms
      of opiate withdrawal and excess will be performed. The short-term safety and tolerability
      will be assessed throughout the trial. Patients will firstparticipate in a 2 weeks run-in
      period with supervised buprenorphine/naloxone intake. Subsequently, patients will receive 2
      tablets of 100 mg TMC125 twice daily for 14 days added to their buprenorphine/naloxone
      treatment. During the treatment period from Day 1 to Day 14, the individualized
      buprenorphine/naloxone treatment will be continued with co-administration of TMC125.
