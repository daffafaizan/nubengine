    
      This is a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial of
      pomegranate supplementation in medical students and residents, and to see whether there is
      evidence of an effect on reported emotional and physical well-being.

      Phase 1 will be a pilot with 10 participants in which all will receive the pomegranate
      supplement for 28 days. In phase 2, we will randomize 40 participants (1:1) to receive either
      the pomegranate supplement or a placebo.

      For both phases, we will measure self reported emotional and physical well-being using
      several questionnaires, and we will conduct laboratory testing for measures of oxidative
      stress and inflammatory biomarkers in blood, and for a metabolite of pomegranate in urine.
