      fusion rates and good clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies that have
      assessed the optimal material of cage systems. The primary objective of this study was to
      compare the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after instrumented transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF) using either titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (TiPEEK) or common
      PEEK cages. Secondary objectives were to assess differences in fusion rates and differences
      in pain and in quality of life between these groups.
