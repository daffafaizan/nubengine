      periodontics will be recruited in the study. 40 subjects will be randomly divided into two
      groups(control group and test group with 20 subjects in each group). Clinical parameters such
      as gingival index, periodontal index, random blood sugar levels(RBS) and glycosylated
      hemoglobin levels (Hb1aC) will be recorded at baseline and after 3 months and 2ml of blood
      sample will be collected by venepuncture ( baseline and after 3 months) and stored in
      Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid containing vials to identify the levels of resistin in the
      patients by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Group A will receive Alpha lipoic acid at
      baseline for a period of 3 months. Both the groups will receive scaling and rootplaning at
      baseline.
