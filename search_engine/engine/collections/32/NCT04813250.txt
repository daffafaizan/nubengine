      IMV(intermittent mandatory ventilation) Regular Ventilation with Tidal volume with 7ml/ kg
      (Predicted body weight) ； Group RP, Regular Ventilation with Tidal volume with 7ml/ kg
      (Predicted body weight) + PEEP : 6 cm H2O ；Group RI : Regular Ventilation with Tidal volume
      with 7ml/ kg (Predicted body weight) + Reverse IE ratio ventilation( I:E=1:1) ；Group RPI:
      Regular Ventilation with Tidal volume with 7ml/ kg (Predicted body weight) + PEEP : 6 cm H2O
      + Reverse IE ratio ventilation( I:E=1:1)】 to compare the beneficial in decreasing the
      incidence of post-operative pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery including of the data
      of EIT, GAS , Lactate , PFR：PaO2/FiO2 ratio , cardiac index (CI) , BMI..etc . EIT were
      measured at two perioperative timepoints 1. after intubation at the onset of anesthesia with
      mechanical ventilation with 7ml/ kg (Predicted body weight) 2. at the end of surgery.
