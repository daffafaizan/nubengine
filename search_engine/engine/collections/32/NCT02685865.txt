      of WON using FCSEMS and plastic stents. The trial will be conducted at the Florida Hospital
      Center for Interventional Endoscopy, Orlando, Florida.The sample size estimated for this
      study is 60 patients. All patients will undergo EUS-guided drainage of WON and be randomized
      to either FCSEM or plastic stents in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomized
      sequence. It will not be possible to blind the endoscopist to the stent type being inserted
      due to the differences in stent appearance. The statistician will be blinded to the stent
      type utilized.
