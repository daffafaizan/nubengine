    
      Aim: to evaluate whether a single intravenous administration of allogeneic bone
      marrow-derived multipotent stromal cell also referred as to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
      modified endogenous insulin secretion capacity and exogenous insulin requirement in patients
      with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

      Participants: 10, females or males, 18 years or older, diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus at most 1 year before enrollment, under exogenous insulin treatment, with pancreatic
      reserve of insulin.

      Intervention: intravenous administration of a single dose (2-3 millions/Kg) of allogeneic
      MSCs.

      Follow up: before and 1, 6, 24 months after MSC administration.
