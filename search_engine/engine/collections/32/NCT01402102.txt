      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Reduction of these and other risk factors through
      dietary modification, behavioral changes, and medicinal intervention has already
      substantially decreased the incidence and mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      disease. Supplementation of the diet with certain biofactors may further reduce such risk
      factors. Aged garlic belongs to a group of dietary supplements that may lessen the incidence
      of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by reducing lipids levels and decreasing
      platelet responsiveness to activating agents.
