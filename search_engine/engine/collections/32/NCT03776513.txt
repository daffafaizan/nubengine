      disturbances of contextual memory dependent on the hippocampus. Obesity is also associated
      with negative emotional consequences. However, no clinical study has so far evaluated the
      effect of obesity on emotional memory, a function underpinned by the amygdala. Recent studies
      indicate that obese children and adolescents exhibit memory disturbances. Adolescence
      represents a crucial period in the development of the hippocampus and the amygdala, two brain
      regions implicated in memory and emotional functions for the rest of life. Changes in
      connectivity during development, whether structural or functional, are major before the age
      of 10 and progressive and minor until the age of 30. Disturbances of this
      amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity during adolescence have been associated with the
      development of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the impact of childhood obesity on
      functional amygdala-hippocampus connectivity has still not been evaluated. The first aim of
      the study is to compare the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the amygdala
      measured during the realization of an emotional associative memory task or at rest before and
      after the task between obese teenagers and control teenagers and how closely it is related to
      emotional memory performances. Secondly, it will be determined whether the level of
      functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala is related to cognitive
      performances and eating symptomatology in obese teenagers.
