    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine objective clinical response in patients with progressive, unresectable
           metastatic melanoma treated with recombinant LMB-2 immunotoxin and peptide vaccination
           comprising gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen, MART-1:27-35 antigen, and Montanide ISA-51.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in levels of CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T cells in peripheral blood before
           and after treatment in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the ability of recombinant immunotoxin LMB-2 to augment peptide vaccination in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes twice on days 1-3. Patients
      then receive peptide vaccinations comprising gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC), and MART-1:27-35 vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
      SC on days 4, 5, 6, and 24-27 (course 1). After week 8, patients achieving tumor response may
      receive 1 additional course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically in the absence of
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
