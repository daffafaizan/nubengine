      be painful, pain reduction procedures warrant continued investigation. Camouflage design
      deals with the visual impact of the needle and syringe though the tactile sensation remains
      unaltered. In our study, post treatment anxiety levels in camouflaged syringe was reduced as
      compared to conventional syringe group and this might be because, patients with low anxiety
      tend to have high pain thresholds.
