      I. To determine if treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir will decrease progression of symptoms
      compared to control/placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if treatment improves time to symptom resolution. II. Determine the time to
      symptom progression. III. Determine time to improvement of participants as defined by
      complete resolution of symptoms.

      IV. Determine the proportion of participants who have severe or critical symptoms and
      hospital admission.

      V. Determine the time to hospital admission for those who develop severe of critical symptoms
      VI. Determine the proportion of participants with an intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

      VII. Determine the proportion of participants receiving ventilator support. VIII. Determine
      survival of participants enrolled on the study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients admitted to the hospital, will determine the following parameters: potassium
      level, blood oxygen level, creatinine, and blood pressure.

      II. Identify obstacles and barriers encountered while implementing a clinical trial in the
      context of a pandemic caused by a contagious disease and associated social distancing.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive lopinavir/ritonavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 14 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3 times a week until symptoms
      resolve plus 2 additional weeks thereafter, for up to 3 months, whichever occurs first.
