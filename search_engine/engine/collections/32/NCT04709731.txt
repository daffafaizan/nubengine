    
      Phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, open label study which aims to investigate the therapeutic
      activity and the cardiovascular safety profile of Ponatinib when used as third line therapy
      of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase, after using the only two Tyrosine Kinase
      Inhibitors (TKIs) known for the safest cardiovascular profile, i.e. Imatinib and Bosutinib.
      Patients will be stratified according to the cause of discontinuation of the second TKI:
      intolerance or resistance. The safety of Ponatinib will be assessed by a combination of
      clinical tests such as ECG, Doppler ultrasound studies to assess arterial and venous vessels,
      blood pressure monitoring and lipid profiles, combined with inflammatory cytokine analysis
      which is a known predictor of subsequent cardiovascular adverse events.
