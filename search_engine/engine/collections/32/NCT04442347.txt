    
      This is a single ascending dose study of ARCT-810 in which approximately 12 (up to a maximum
      of 20) subjects are planned to be enrolled. The length of each study participant is
      approximately 8 weeks from screening to last study visit. The study comprises an up to 4-week
      Screening and a 4-week Diet Run-in period to run concurrently followed by a 1-day dosing
      period and a 28-day Post Treatment Period.

      Study participants will be allocated to one of the three different study groups (also called
      cohorts), to test different doses of ARCT-810. There will be 4 participants in each group.
      Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized 3 :1 to receive ARCT-810 or placebo as an IV
      infusion.
