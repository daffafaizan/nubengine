      with different administration methods. 24 hour intragastric pH catheter was inserted in
      stomach of patients with peptic ulcer an hour prior to PPI administration in order to observe
      the initial change in pH. Three groups of patients were given PPI through per oral,
      intravenous, and sublingual administration methods. The hypothesis of this study is that
      sublingual administration will be faster than oral or IV administration in PPI dosing with
      respect to intragastric pH change and re-bleeding rate.
