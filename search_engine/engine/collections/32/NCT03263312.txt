      Fontan patients and 20 controls of a similar age, gender, BMI and physical activity level
      between the ages of 10-40 years. The investigators will enroll from pediatric cardiology and
      heart failure clinics and inpatient care units at Children's Health Dallas, adult congenital
      heart disease clinics and inpatient care units at Clements University Hospital and the
      Clinical Heart Center. This study will evaluate the multimodality biomarkers for assessment
      of Fontan circulation including heart, liver and lung and change in these markers with
      exercise training.

      Participants will receive an MRI of the Fontan circulation. This will include imaging of the
      heart, lung and liver. A blood draw (approximately 10 ml) for assessment of serum biomarkers
      and circulating microRNAs of interest will be completed. The participants will also complete
      exercise testing and will then start a 3-6 month long cardiac rehabilitation program.
      Frequent phone follow up (conducted by the research staff) and regular download of data from
      heart rate monitors will ensure adherence.

      After the 3-6 month study period the participants will return for a follow up and repeat all
      testing completed at enrollment.
