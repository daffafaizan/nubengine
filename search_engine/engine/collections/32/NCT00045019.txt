        -  Determine the scale structure, reliability, and validity of the QLQ-SAT32 patient
           satisfaction module in assessing the perception of the quality of care received in
           hospitals by patients with cancer.

        -  Determine the success of the QLQ-SAT32 patient satisfaction module when used with the
           QLQ-C30 core quality of life questionnaire, in terms of expanding on quality of life
           evaluation or providing information on treatment acceptability or preference of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a descriptive, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (18 to 49 vs 50 and over) and the cancer therapy received in hospital (surgery vs
      chemotherapy).

      Patients in all strata receive the QLQ-SAT32 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires, a debriefing
      questionnaire, and the Oberst patient satisfaction visual analog scale prior to hospital
      discharge. Patients complete the materials at home within 7 days of discharge. A group of 100
      patients have a repeat QLQ-SAT32 module mailed to them to be completed within 7 days of
      receipt of first questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 640-768 patients (160-192 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
