      population is 1-2% and for age 50 -75 years: 2-3% (1) . It has been estimated that there are
      currently 6.5 million HF patients in Europe and 5 million in the USA (2) . Lack of vitamin D
      has been linked to heart disease including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and
      hypertension.(3) Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the elderly population. Calcium
      absorption, bone mineralization and muscle function may be impaired. Vitamin D receptors have
      also been demonstrated in skeletal as well as cardiac muscle(4) . Vitamin D and Parathyroid
      Hormone (PTH) are closely linked in the calcium metabolic system. In order to maintain serum
      calcium within range PTH and vitamin D acts together in response to changes in serum-calcium
      levels. 25(OH)D concentration also being an important factor determining the levels of
      PTH.(5) Decreasing vitamin D leads to increasing levels of PTH. Hyperparathyroidism in
      patients with kidney-disease has in numerous studies been linked to cardiovascular disease,
      left ventricle hypertrophy, and valvular calcification .(6) Aim: Intervention with vitamin D
      and calcium will improve patients' vitamin D levels and suppress PTH. Thus we hope to find an
      improved cardiac function and quality of life in the intervention-group.

      Comparison: Cardiac function (and other effect parameters - such as self-evaluated health) in
      the intervention group vs. in the placebo-group
