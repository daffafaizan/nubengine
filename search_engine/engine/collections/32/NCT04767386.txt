      years old, presented with chronic NSCP persisted for six months or more, with neck disability
      index score (NDI) ≥10%, and can possess at least 45° of left and right cervical rotation
      participated in the study. Convergence insufficiency was evaluated by the near point of
      conversion (NPOC) rule and postural instability was examined by the Biodex balance system.
      RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation between (NPOC) and anteroposterior
      stability index (APSI) at the three cervical positions; neutral, 45° right torsion and 45°
      left torsion (P>0.05).
