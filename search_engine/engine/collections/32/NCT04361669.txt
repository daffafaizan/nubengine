      to improve the site's National Quality Forum (NQF) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
      Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores. These scores are calculated by the hospice using
      existing patient satisfaction survey scores (HCAHPS). The institution quantifies their
      compliance with national quality metrics (NQF) and reports this existing data to the
      pharmacist providing counseling services to their patients. The pharmacist assesses for areas
      for improvement and provides additional counseling services to improve the continuity and
      quality of care. The pilot program is scheduled to launch April 2020 and the researchers will
      look to assess for changes in the NQF scores, HCAHPS scores, and time for their partnering
      pharmacy to refill the first set of prescriptions.
