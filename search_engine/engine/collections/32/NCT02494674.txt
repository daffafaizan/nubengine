      one 1.5-hour orientation meeting, baseline assessment, and training meeting, and then weekly
      1-hour meetings for four weeks (5 meetings total). Participants will listen to 2 podcasts per
      week and will be encouraged to monitor exercise and body weight and track each meal using the
      provided wearable, wrist worn device. Each of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to
      listen to and so participants should expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to
      podcasts and up to 3 hours completing other study-related activities each week-including
      attending the weekly meetings-for a total of about 4 hours per week.
