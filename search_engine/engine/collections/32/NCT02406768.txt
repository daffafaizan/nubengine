      Comparing data from Asian children to these norms may lead to the wrong interpretation of the
      results, as it does not account for cultural differences, translation issues and a possibly
      different education system. Therefore it is essential to include a matched control group to
      evaluate the participants of the study to the fullest extent in terms of cognition, memory,
      behavior and fine motor skills, in all age groups over the full course of the study.
