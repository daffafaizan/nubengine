    
      The investigators will enroll about 120 subjects from the hospital's healthcare center, and
      these 120 subjects will be divided into four groups: normal weight with or without metabolic
      diseases and obesity with or without metabolic diseases. Each group has 30 subjects. The
      investigators will collect the basic information(name, gender，age, medical history，family
      history, etc.), blood pressure, body mass index, fasting blood glucose and fasting blood
      lipids of each subject from the healthcare center. The investigators will collect the blood
      samples of each subject,separate the plasma and then test the fasting insulin, VEGF-B levels
      by ELISA. The investigators will separate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the
      blood, and then test the gene promoter region methylation status of the VEGF -B gene by PCR
      and the bisulfite-modified sequencing and test the genomic protein methylation level of the
      VEGF-B gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay(CHIP) and real-time quantitative PCR of
      the cells，and finally do the statistical analysis.
