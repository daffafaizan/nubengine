      for childhood asthma. The Investigators will place adherence monitoring devices on patient
      inhalers, and track use of patient asthma medicines. The Investigators will also utilize an
      asthma navigator who will discuss adherence with families and help to address any barriers to
      adherence that families identify. Additionally, the navigator will communicate patient
      specific adherence information to the patient's primary care physician (PCP) and school
      nurse. The adherence monitor will monitor communications between these providers.
