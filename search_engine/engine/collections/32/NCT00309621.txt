      aggravating factors such as allergens and irritants, no registered systemic treatment is
      available. Current systemic treatment options consist in the off-label use of systemic immune
      suppressants, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate.

      Severe chronic hand dermatitis is a debilitating disease, with massive impact on social life
      and working ability. A huge proportion of the population suffers for more than a decade, and
      job losses are a frequent consequence.

      This open-label trial investigates the safety and efficacy of oral alitretinoin 30mg as a
      single daily dose for up to 6 months. The trial is complementary to the pivotal efficacy
      study BAP00089.
