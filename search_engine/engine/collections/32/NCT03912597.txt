      individuals with depression. This is done through the development and evaluation of a
      VR-assisted curriculum that promotes stigma reduction towards depression among tertiary-aged
      students. Collection of data will provide insights about the effectiveness of VR's immersive
      quality in enhancing stigma reduction skills through measures of attitudes, beliefs and
      knowledge about depression. In the first study, VR is compared with traditional pamphlets in
      an information sharing booth about depression. In the second study, participants attend a
      30-min session where they undergo an educational curriculum with either a VR or standard
      video as adjunctive tools.
