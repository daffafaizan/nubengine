      After surgery the ordinary standard praxis treatment is immobilisation in a plaster for 3
      weeks. One common complication is "stiff elbow". Stiffness in the elbow may be due to
      "heterotopic ossification" which is the abnormal growth of bone in the non-skeletal tissues
      including muscles or tendons. There is a prospective study that have reported positive
      results with early mobilisation starting two days after surgery in these patients. However,
      randomised clinical trials are missing. Therefore our aim was to investigate if early
      mobilisation may increase elbow function (increased range of motion and decreased pain) and
      also reduce comlications as stiff elbow compared to ordinary treatment in these patients.

      All patients operated with elbow fracture-dislocation at the University hospital in Link√∂ping
      were asked if the wanted to participate in the study. They had thourough written and oral
      information about the study. If they agree to participate written informed consent was
      collected. After surgery patients were randomised to either early mobilisation or to ordinary
      treatment (standard praxis).

      At baseline before surgery or directly after patients filled in some background vatiables
      such as gender, age social status medical treatment etc They also filled in some
      self-adminstrated outcome measure in purpuse to evalute upper extremity function and activity
      and health related quality of Life.

      Follow ups with X ray and upper extremity function and activity were at 3 weeks 3 and 12
      months with an independent observer.

      In beteween these follow ups patient followed the treatment regime (ordinary or early
      exrecise treatment) and had support from a physiotherapist.
