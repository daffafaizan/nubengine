      degree of lowering is closely related to improvements in longevity, hospitalisation rate and
      heart function. The investigators have shown that increasing heart rates using pacemakers
      does not increase exercise capacity in CHF patients. This might be because the optimal heart
      rate range for contraction is narrower for patients with CHF. At higher heart rates, heart
      contraction might be less strong. The investigators now want to examine the relationship
      between heart rate and heart contraction in patients with heart failure and pacemakers.
      Tailored pacemaker heart rate setting's, individually optimised for heart contractility as
      assessed by cardiac ultrasound, will be investigated to examine the effects on exercise
      tolerance .
