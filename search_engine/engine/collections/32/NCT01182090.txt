      dissected from the bladder to expose a vaginal wall area of at least 3 x 5 cms where the mesh
      will be attached with four-five Polyglycolic 0 sutures. The procedure is repeated for the
      posterior vaginal wall, where the mesh will be attached with three-four Polyglycolic 0
      sutures.

      The sacral promontory surface is prepared and 1 or 2 non-reabsorbable 0.0 sutures are placed
      into the sacral periosteum about 2 cm below the promontory. A sub-peritoneal tunnel is
      created through which meshes are passed avoiding traction to the sacrum. The peritoneum is
      closed over the meshes.
