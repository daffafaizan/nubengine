      experience difficulties in learning motor tasks, functional disability, and poor quality of
      life. Interventions for cognitive impairment remain under development and pharmaceutical
      intervention is not yet optimal at present. Targeted cognitive treatments or aerobic exercise
      training provided potential benefits to enhance cognitive function for stroke patients with
      cognitive decline. Recent studies demonstrate that combining exercise and cognitive training
      may provide additional benefits on cognition than single type of training. However, physical
      exercise training and cognitive-based intervention can be combined either sequentially or
      simultaneously. It remains unclear whether the two combination methods induce similar or
      differential effects in brain plasticity, physiological modulation, and behavioral outcomes
      for individuals with stroke. It is important to examine the potential effects, comparative
      effects and the neural mechanism of two combined interventions that can possibly maximize
      benefits for stroke survivors with cognitive impairments.

      The purposes of the present study are to: (1) examine and compare the effects of two combined
      interventions on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes,
      including cognitive, physical, and daily functions, and quality of life, from pre- to
      post-training; (2) understand the neural mechanisms of cognitive recovery following two
      combined interventions using the electroencephalography (EEG); (3) examine the long-term
      benefits following the two combined interventions; (4) to identify the correlations between
      brain activity, biomarkers and behavioral measures.
