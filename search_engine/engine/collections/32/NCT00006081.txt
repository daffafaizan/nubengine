        -  Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with bryostatin 1 and
           paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of
           this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV
      over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete
      response (CR) receive up to 4 more courses after achieving CR.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
