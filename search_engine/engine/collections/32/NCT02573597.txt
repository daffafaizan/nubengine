      identified as potential participants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and their desire
      for labor epidural analgesia. Once identified, interested candidates will be fully informed
      of the study procedures, have all questions answered, and informed consent obtained. Pregnant
      participants will receive a labor epidural upon the patient's request and dosed per protocol
      to adequate analgesic level.

      Patients will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups. Either group I or II in Study Part A and
      group III or IV in Study Part B in a double-blinded design. Each study part will run in
      parallel and independently.

      Each group will have a varying concentration of bupivicaine infusion; continuous or
      intermittent bolus administration. In addition each group will have continuous or
      intermittent bolus administration of sufentanil. These concentrations and forms of
      administration will be blinded to both the patient and study administrator.

      Each epidural infusion concentration and continuous or bolus administration will be
      determined to be a success or failure based on analgesic scores. The investigators' primary
      outcome will be the minimal local anesthetic concentration of the final participants in each
      respective group upon study completion.

      DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN will follow standard of clinical care. Any adverse events will be
      reported to the PI and necessary adjustments to the protocol will be immediately instituted.
