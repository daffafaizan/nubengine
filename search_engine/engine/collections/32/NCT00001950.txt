      object categorization in early development. The proposed work is designed to examine the
      emergence of organization in toddlers internal representations of real-world categories such
      as furniture and fruit. Representation, in this capacity, refers simply to stored information
      that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the treatment of discriminable as
      equivalent in some way.

      Even young infants appear capable of categorizing diverse sets of discriminable patterns and
      objects, and can form internal representations of such bounded collections. Much less is
      known, however, about changes leading from this basic capacity to the highly structured
      concepts that are characteristics of children s and adults category knowledge. The present
      research is designed to characterize the course of these changes between infancy and
      childhood.

      The primary research strategy to be used consists of analyzing toddlers examination and
      manipulation of familiar objects that are similar within adult-defined categories than
      between such categories. The organization and temporal structure of children s actions on the
      objects will be coded and analyzed to infer the similarity relations that are perceived among
      of each stimulus set.
