      single-dose study. Six subjects will receive a single dose of Pyronaridine 720 mg orally
      administered together with 14C-Pyronaridine (approx. 100 Âµg, 800 nCi (29600 Bq). Safety
      measurements (12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology) and adverse events
      will be monitored throughout the study.

      Subjects will come to the clinic the evening before the dosing of Pyronaridine. After the
      drug intake at day 1, subjects will have regular in-house periods for specimen collection up
      to 87 days after the drug administration Blood, faeces and urine will be collected during the
      hospitalisation periods. Samples will be analyzed for radioactivity by Accelerator Mass
      Spectrometry (AMS).
