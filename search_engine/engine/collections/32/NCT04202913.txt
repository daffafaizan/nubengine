      meet weekly with their assigned health coach and together they identify both strengths and
      areas for improvement with respect to resilience, developing resilience skills, and setting
      resilience goals. Topics discussed include coping skills, self-efficacy, and interpersonal
      relationships. The program was developed using the social determination theory (SDT), goal
      theory, and elements from the social-ecological model. SDT was used within the intervention
      to promote and facilitate behavior change. Goal theory was also utilized to develop
      strategies to support youth short- and long-term goal setting. Finally, weekly discussions
      about resilience and goal setting activities accounted for elements of the social-ecological
      model which acknowledges that behaviors are not independent factors, but are influenced by
      multiple levels of one's personal and social environment.
