      patient's overall satisfaction with the procedure(s), functional improvements, and recognized
      or perceived negative effects of the procedures. One of the most commonly used measures of
      HRQoL is SF-36, which has been reduced to 12 items with the minimal loss of information to
      form SF-12 . HRQoL was assessed using SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental
      Component Summary (MCS) scores.
