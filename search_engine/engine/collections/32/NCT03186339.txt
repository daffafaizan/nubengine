      patients with aortic stenosis - the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) questionnaire
      and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).

      The KCCQ has now become the only cited health related (HR) QoL validated scale for use among
      a growing TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) patient population; however
      questions on the KCCQ do not reflect the concerns and lifestyle of patients proceeding for
      aortic valve intervention. Many of the questions do not reflect this patient population's
      perspective of well-being in contrast to perceptions by the general cardiac population on
      which it was validated. It is important to capture the disruptions caused by a chronic
      disease and its treatment on lifestyles, activities, and interests; that is interference with
      psychologically meaningful activity. It has been noted that this interference varies by
      disease process and treatment by general scales such as the Illness Intrusiveness Scale .

      Due to issues of limited validity of the KCCQ for TAVI / SAVR (Surgical Aortic Valve
      Replacement) patients related to symptom items not being revised from their original use for
      congestive heart failure, a new original HR-QoL questionnaire was proposed: The "Toronto
      Aortic Stenosis Quality of Life Questionnaire" (TASQ) is a health specific measurement tool
      designed to measure changes in quality of life in aortic stenosis patients. The aim of this
      study is to validate this questionnaire in this specific patient population.
