      drop-out rates in the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment. The psychotherapies to
      be assessed in the present study are: trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT), mindfulness-based
      health promotion (MBHP) and Positive psychotherapy (PPT). Objectives: Our objectives are: 1)
      to assess the efficacy of TBCT compared to MBHP and PPT to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the
      context of the COVID-19 pandemic, all delivered online; 2) to compare the efficacy of these
      psychotherapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and in improving well-being;
      3) to describe how patients and professionals perceive teletherapy. Methods: This is a
      three-arm, randomized, multicenter, single-blind, clinical trial. An estimated sample of 135
      patients will receive either TBCT, MBHP or PPT, individual, weekly visits, totaling thirteen
      sessions. The primary outcome measure will be the CAPS-5, and the secondary outcome measures
      will be the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Negative Core Beliefs Inventory
      (NCBI), and the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI). Other measures are the WHO-5
      Well-being Index (WHO-5), and the California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS-P). Also,
      questions about patients perception of teletherapy will be asked. Expected results: PTSD
      symptoms are expected to be reduced after TBCT, MBHP and PPT. The null hypothesis is that no
      statistical difference is expected to be found among the three psychotherapies, as opposed to
      the alternative hypothesis that TBCT and MBHP are superior to PPT.
