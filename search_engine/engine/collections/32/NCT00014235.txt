    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated
      with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), PBSC
      infusion and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and a disease risk-based
      cyclosporine taper.

      II. To estimate the risk of graft rejection, GVHD, disease response, non-relapse mortality
      and the incidence and severity of infectious complications using this treatment strategy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      ARM I (indolent disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on
      day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV every
      8-12 hours on days -3 to 56 with a taper to day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID or IV
      every 8-12 hours on days 0 to 27.

      ARM II (aggressive disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate and undergo TBI as in Arm I.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID or IV every 8-12 hours on days -3 to
      56 with a taper to day 70 and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
