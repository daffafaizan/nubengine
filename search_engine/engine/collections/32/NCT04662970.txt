      will be the base for a semiautomatic model incorporating the conductivity of the heart, the
      lungs, blood and the torso. For this reason, a software package (AMIRA Developer, TGS
      Template Graphics Software, France) has been adapted to calculate a quasi static
      approximation of Maxwell equations.

      After fusion of the T1 CMR scan and the ECG electrodes a model-based bidomain FEM is used for
      a step-wise measurement of the local activation times (resting potential: 290 mV; plateau: 0
      mV; acceleration time: 3 ms) both Ende- and epicardially.
