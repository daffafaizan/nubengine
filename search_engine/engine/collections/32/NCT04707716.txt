      randomized to three different groups. In group 1 AcurisÂ® is used as fixation type; in group 2
      screw retention, and in group 3 cementation is used. After 3 months of submerged healing the
      dental implants will be restored with all ceramic single implant crowns, fixed by using the
      randomized fixation mode. Follow-up visits till one year after implant restoration will be
      performed. At least 11 study visits during 16 months will be conducted.
