      for kidney cancer by a robotic partial nephrectomy in France (recruiting centers, patient
      profile, tumor characteristics).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To describe the surgical techniques and operative development.

        2. To assess the modalities of haemostasis, during robotic partial nephrectomy.

        3. To assess peri-operative morbidity in robotic partial nephrectomy and post-operative
           complications.

        4. To assess the outcome of renal function after a robotic partial nephrectomy. This study
           is a national, multicenter, prospective, cohort.
