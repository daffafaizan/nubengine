      thoracoscopic lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. We calculated the aggregate risk
      score and the corresponding class of 90-day mortality risk for each patient. The correlation
      between risk classes and mortality rates was tested by Spearman's rho-test. Model calibration
      was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
