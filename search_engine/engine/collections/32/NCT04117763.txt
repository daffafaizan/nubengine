      patients.

      New hypoglycemic drugs are required to undergo cardiovascular safety studies for their
      release. In 2015, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, which was done for empagliflozin´s approval was the first
      study to provide evidence that an antidiabetic agent could decrease cardiovascular events.
      The results demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome (death by cardiovascular causes,
      nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke), cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for
      heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk who received
      empagliflozin in combination with standard treatment. It is noteworthy that the study
      population was under-optimized clinical treatment with antihypertensives, statin and aspirin
      and especially it is noteworthy that the difference in the primary outcome over placebo
      became evident only three months after treatment´s start.

      The potential mechanisms underlying the surprising cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin
      are not fully understood.

      The present project aims to investigate if the empagliflozin has an antiarrhythmic action.
      Analyzing the T-wave heterogeneity index, a new electrocardiographic risk marker associated
      with the prediction of cardiovascular risk, in diabetic patients and coronary artery disease,
      we will verify if empagliflozin is associated with a reduction in electrical instability.
