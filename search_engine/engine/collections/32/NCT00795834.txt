    
      This study will assess the potential of a beverage containing plant and fruit extracts rich
      in polyphenolics to modulate vascular risk.

      Novel risk factors for vascular disease will be assessed including non-invasive assessment of
      vascular function by pulse wave analysis / pulse wave velocity and laser doppler
      iontophoresis.
