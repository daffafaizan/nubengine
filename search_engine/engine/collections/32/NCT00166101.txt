      in assessing systemic perfusion with accuracy. At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,
      Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is available, but has never been studied. In patients
      undergoing first stage palliation (Norwood) for hypoplastic left heart, routine management
      will be utilized in addition to the NIRS monitor. The following will be documented pre- and
      post-bypass, then every 4 hours for 24 hours after admission to the Cardiac Intensive Care
      Unit:NIRS readings, Lactic acid levels,mixed venous saturations,hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      arterial blood gases, heart rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, left atrium
      pressure,core temperature, toe temperature, pulse oximeter reading, urine output, ventilator
      settings, inotropic levels. All the data will be entered into a database and analyzed.
