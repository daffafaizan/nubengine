      intraoperative angiography using ICG dye which the camera can detect. This dye will be
      provided through intravenous access. The picture will be taken of the wound to determine
      preoperative blood flow to the area where the incision is planned. After the wound has been
      closed postoperatively, a final picture, using the procedure described above, will be taken
      to determine blood flow after closure of the wound. These images will be obtained using
      intraoperative angiography. The Participant will be followed after the surgical procedure at
      standard intervals as determined by the surgeon until the wound heals or requires further
      intervention.
