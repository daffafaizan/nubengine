      Blood is drawn for liver function tests and measurement of plasma choline levels and breast
      milk samples are taken for measurement of breast milk choline levels at fasting and at 1 hour
      after breakfast on day 1. The patient then undergoes magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the
      liver to assess liver density and choline compound mass. The patient then receives oral
      phosphatidylcholine supplement, and plasma and breast milk samples are taken at 3 and 6 hours
      after the dose. Oral phosphatidylcholine supplements continue for 30 days. The above studies
      are repeated on day 31.
