      i.e. Marathon running, leads to hemodynamic, endothelial and myocardial functional changes.
      Whether these myocardial, endothelial and hemodynamic changes can also develop and persist
      through repetitive extreme and prolonged physical activity is currently still a matter of
      controversy. In addition, it is not known whether adaptations and changes over time can
      develop into clinically relevant cardiovascular events with negative health consequences in
      healthy athletes. The aim of this study is to detect exercise-induced physiological changes
      (inter alia of the cardiovascular system) induced by repetitive ultra-endurance strain over a
      period of 10 years.

      For this purpose, 277 male participants from the Be-MaGIC study (Marathon 2009) are examined
      in this prospective observational study. A single examination with the following components
      will take place: Anthropometry, clinical examination, laboratory, resting / exercise
      electrocardiography cardiopulmonary stress test, echocardiography, and fundus camera. Further
      examinations will be conducted in participants with abnormal examination results in line with
      current clinical recommendations.
