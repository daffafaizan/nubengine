      stratified according to current smoking status were recruited in USA and Sweden. Patients
      were randomly assigned to 8 groups, all of which were treated by SRP plus none, one, two or
      three adjunctive treatments. Thus, patients were assigned to groups that did or did not
      receive Surg, LAb, SAb or LAb+SAb (All) providing 8 treatment combinations (Surg + All, Surg
      + SAb, Surg + LAb, Surg alone, SRP + All, SRP + SAb, SRP + LAb, SRP alone). Clinical,
      microbiological and immunological measurements were taken for 2 years (at baseline, 3, 6, 12,
      18 and 24 months). To focus on changes diseased sites, analysis was restricted to sites with
      baseline pocket depth greater than 5 mm. (also, these were the only sites treated by LAb). In
      this report, main effects and interactions were evaluated for PD reduction and AL gain two
      years post therapy for 187 of patients. Mean values were computed for each treatment group
      and averages after 2 years were compared to baseline by ANOVA. Factorial ANCOVA was used to
      examine significance of differences between Surg or not, SAb or not and LAb or not for PD
      reduction and AL gain using baseline attachment level or pocket depth as covariates and
      including current smoking as a factor.
