      tissue damage and may even lead to long-term remission of disease. This concept is supported
      by reports of SLE-associated autoimmunity that are detected serologically many years prior to
      any constitutional symptoms or specific tissue inflammation and immune dysregulation precedes
      the development of clinically apparent SLE. Belimumab (Benlysta) is an FDA approved
      medication and is a monoclonal antibody directed against B cell-activating factor (BAFF)/ B
      Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS). B cells maturing in environments with high BAFF levels are more
      likely to be autoreactive B cells. This is a double-blind placebo controlled trial of
      belimumab, in patients with early lupus, ie lupus diagnosed within 2 years. Thirty subjects
      will be randomized (2:1) to receive subcutaneous belimumab weekly or placebo. After a year of
      treatment, subjects receiving belimumab will be rerandomized (1:1) to receive belimumab or
      placebo. The primary outcome is B cell autoreactivity. Clinical efficacy including disease
      activity, flares, attainment of low disease activity or remission as well as surrogate
      cardiovascular biomarkers will also be assessed.
