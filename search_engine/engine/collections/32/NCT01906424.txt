      improve hand and arm function in people with paralysis who suffered a cervical spinal cord
      injury. The investigators hypothesize that this stimulation can revive spared function in the
      spinal cord of individuals who are clinically paralyzed, but who have some remaining
      connections between the brain and spinal cord. Our research has demonstrated that modifying
      the activation state of the spinal cord or awakening the spinal cord can benefit people with
      paralysis years after a spinal cord injury. This method and device have not yet been approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of paralysis and are under investigation. This study if
      successful will help provide further evidence that could be use to gain FDA approval.
