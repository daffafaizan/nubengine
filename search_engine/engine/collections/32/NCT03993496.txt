      (AAA) rupture by reducing the blood pressure transmitted to the wall of the aneurysm.
      Unfortunately, this procedure is not always successful, and patients need to return to the
      operating room for further procedures because the aneurysm wall remains pressurized and the
      aneurysm continues to grow. Currently, there is no standard non-invasive way of measuring
      aneurysm pressure. The purpose of this study is to infer the reduction of pressure
      transmitted to the aneurysm wall by using intraoperative ultrasound ('M-Mode') to assess the
      pulsatility of the aneurysm wall. The hypothesis is that intraoperative reduction in aneurysm
      wall pulsatility after EVAR will correlate with improved aneurysm sac size reduction. This is
      clinically relevant because physiologic intraoperative feedback of aneurysm pressure may
      potentially influence surgical decision making in the future, reducing unnecessary
      re-interventions. This will also improve our understanding of the intraoperative physiologic
      response to EVAR.

      Our primary research question is in patients receiving elective endovascular repair of
      abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), does the change in intraoperative ultrasound estimated
      aneurysm wall pressure during EVAR correlate with aneurysm sac size reduction 1 year after
      surgery? Secondary objectives are to assess correlation between intraoperative ultrasound
      estimated aneurysm wall pressure and endovascular leaks and aneurysm-related
      re-interventions.

      A prospective, observational, assessor-blinded and surgeon-blinded study will be conducted at
      the TOH Civic Campus in Ottawa, ON in order to satisfy the objectives of the study.
