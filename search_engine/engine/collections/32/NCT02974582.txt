      as one of the causal factors for the epidemic. Previous studies on cigarette direct mail
      marketing yielded a limited data on mechanisms influencing smoking behavior. Therefore, there
      is a need for a study that would provide a stronger evidence on how direct mail marketing
      influences smoking behavior. The prosed study will consist of two parts where pilot data are
      to be collected in Part 1, and further data are to be collected in Part 2 conducted as a
      randomized comparative trial. Up to a total of 530 healthy volunteers ages 18-29 are to be
      recruited for the study. After meeting the eligibility and enrolling onto the study,
      participants will have their biospecimens collected followed by an experiment in which they
      are to be shown images on the computer. Study participants will then take a break and
      afterwards will provide additional sociodemographic and psychosocial information through an
      audio computer assisted self-administered interview.
