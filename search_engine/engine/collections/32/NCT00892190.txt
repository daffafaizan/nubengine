    
      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of dasatinib and ATRA in
      relapsed or elderly, non-induction candidate acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or MDS patients
      and to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of dasatinib and ATRA when administered
           as combination therapy for patients with AML or MDS

        2. To determine if the combination therapy of dasatinib and ATRA promotes differentiation
           of AML or MDS .
