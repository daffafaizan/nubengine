      effects on thought, emotions, and overall daily functioning, particularly in the first year
      following the stroke. Evidence suggests that antidepressants may be used to prevent
      post-stroke depression. This study will treat nondepressed stroke patients with
      antidepressants or problem solving therapy (PST) to determine the most effective treatments
      for preventing depression.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive PST, escitalopram, or placebo
      (an inactive pill) for 12 months. Participants who display depressive symptoms for 2 weeks or
      more will be removed from the study. After 12 months, treatment will be discontinued and
      participants will be monitored for an additional 6 months.
