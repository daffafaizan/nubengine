    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of 5Hz repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to bilateral motor areas as an adjuvant
      intervention to task-specific body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) in individuals
      with subacute stroke.

      Five individuals with a diagnosis of subacute stroke will be recruited and assigned to either
      high frequency or sham rTMS group.Both groups will receive a comprehensive assessment of
      their motor function, gait performance and neurophysiological function before the training.
      Both groups will then go through a 10 week (24 sessions) of gait training with body weight
      supported treadmill. For the high frequency rTMS group, they will receive 5 Hz rTMS applied
      to bilateral motor areas prior to each gait training session. For the sham rTMS group, they
      will receive a sham stimulation prior to the gait training sessions. All participants will
      receive another comprehensive assessment after the training concludes. The assessor will be
      blinded to the intervention.
