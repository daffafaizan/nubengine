      population and patients with cardiovascular disease but also in critically ill patients with
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A raised heart rate in MODS patients is
      associated with a worse prognosis. Beta-blocker (BB) administration showed to improve
      autonomic function and exhibited a significantly reduced mortality in MODS. In most cases
      negative inotropic effects prevent administration of BB in MODS patients which often are
      treated with catecholamines. In this trial we investigate, whether the "funny current" (If)
      inhibitor ivabradine is able to reduce pathologically elevated heart rate in MODS- patients.

      The investigators hypothesized that critically ill patients could derive particular benefit
      from the specific HR-lowering agent ivabradine.

      Methods: MODIfY is a prospective, single center, open label, randomized, controlled two arms,
      Phase II-trial to evaluate the ability of ivabradine to reduce an elevated heart rate in MODS
      patients. The primary end point is the proportion of patients with a reduction of heart rate
      by at least 10 beats per minute (bpm) within 4 days. This trial will randomize 70 patients
      (men and women, aged ≥18 years) with newly diagnosed MODS (Acute Physiology and Chronic
      Health Evaluation (APACHE) II-score ≥20, diagnosis within ≤24 hours), with an elevated heart
      rate (sinus rhythm with HR ≥90 bpm) and contraindications to BBs. Treatment period will last
      4 days. All patients will be followed for up to six months.
