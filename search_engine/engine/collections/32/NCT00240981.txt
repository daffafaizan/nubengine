      men, who have low testosterone levels and mild to moderate physical impairment, will increase
      their maximal voluntary muscle strength of major upper and lower extremity muscle groups. The
      second objective is to determine whether testosterone replacement will improve the power of
      knee extension, physical performance tests, the level of physical activity (measured by 3D
      accelerometer), self-reported disability, exercise tolerance and mobility. The third
      objective is to determine whether testosterone supplementation improves fatigue, affect, and
      overall sense of well being in older men with low testosterone levels. A fourth objective is
      to define the Minimum Clinically Important Differences in physical measures perceived by the
      participants (MCID).

      Participant involvement will require 15-17 clinic visits over 28 weeks. Five to 7 of these
      visits are for physical testing, including body composition, muscle performance, and physical
      function. Throughout the study, hormone measurements will be obtained.
