      consent and will then have a single 5 mL blood sample drawn for DNA sequence analysis of
      genes known to cause achromatopsia, including the CNGB3 gene. All participants will be
      informed of the results of testing for these mutations. Those with mutations in both alleles
      of the CNGB3 gene will be evaluated every 6 months for up to 1.5 years by using a variety of
      non-invasive visual function tests to more fully characterize their clinical condition. This
      testing will include routine ophthalmic examination and tests of visual acuity, color vision,
      reading speed, perimetry, nystagmus, light sensitivity, optical coherence tomography,
      adaptive optics retinal imaging, electroretinography, fundus photography and completion of a
      quality of life questionnaire.
