      cardiac dyssynchrony, the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces the risk of death,
      and improves symptoms and quality of life.

      A considerable portion (80%) of patients with a CRT indication has a chronotropic
      incompetence (CI). CI usually induces a stress intolerance which negatively affects the
      quality of life. In addition of being a marker of diminished exercise capacity, severe CI
      (sCI) may be an independent predictor of mortality.

      The sensor-based rate adaption provided by the implanted CRT device delivers a possible
      therapeutic approach for the CI.

      Usually, rate adaption is achieved by an accelerometer. The previous studies in terms of
      effectiveness of rate adaption in CRT patients with CI showed inconsistent results.

      In addition to an accelerometer to deliver the rate adaption BIOTRONIK provides closed loop
      stimulation (CLS) as unique feature in a CRT device. CLS determines the appropriate heart
      rate based on intra-cardiac impedance measurements. These measurements reflect changes of the
      cardiac contraction dynamics in reaction to information coming from the autonomic nervous
      system. CLS takes the information on the contraction dynamics and translates it into an
      adequate heart rate adaptation, thus delivering physiologically appropriate therapy.
